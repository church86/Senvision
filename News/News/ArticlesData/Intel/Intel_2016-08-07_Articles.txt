BENGALURU: Global chip maker Intel would pay Rs 16.5 crore by August 28, as directed by the Karnataka High Court, to the city's civic corporation towards property tax arrears, an official said on Monday. "Intel India gave in writing that it would abide by the High Court order to pay 50 per cent of the Rs 34 crore it owes to us by August 28," Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) spokesman S.S. Khandre told IANS here. Confirming the development, an Intel India spokesman said the company would comply with the court's interim order, which it obtained on challenging the BBMP notice but declined to elaborate, as the issue was sub-judice. "Though Intel India paid property tax partly on its campus as per its estimates under the self-assessment scheme, we served a notice to it, conveying that as per our calculations, it has to pay Rs 34-crore property tax, including arrears for the land it acquired and had built its product development office," Khandre recalled. BBMP and Intel India subsidiary, however, did not share details of the notice served, when the latter challenged it in the High Court and the interim order was given to pay 50 per cent of the tax plus arrears. "Our Mahadevapura joint commissioner Muni Veerapppa went to Intel office earlier in the day to collect the amount as per the court order, which said it (amount) should be paid by, and not on, August 28," Khandre pointed out. The corporation also threatened to dump truck loads of garbage in the company's campus, located in the city's eastern suburb on the outer ring road, if it did not rpt not pay the amount by August 28, to expose it as a property tax defaulter.

Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu + Linux 4.7 + Mesa 12.1 Intel OpenGL Tests Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 8 August 2016. Page 1 of 4. 30 Comments With Microsoft having recently released the Windows 10 Anniversary update I've been running some fresh Windows vs. Linux performance comparisons. The first of these comparisons for your viewing pleasure is looking at the latest Windows 10 build with the latest Intel driver compared to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS while also comparing the performance when manually upgrading to the Linux 4.7 kernel and Mesa 12.1-dev for delivering the latest OpenGL performance potential. The same Core i5 6600K "Skylake" system with Intel HD Graphics 530 was used for testing both under Windows and Ubuntu Linux. The Windows 10 Pro x64 Anniversary Update with all other available system updates as of 6 August was used for testing. The latest 20.19.15.4463 driver was used as of testing time. The Intel Windows driver currently exposes OpenGL 4.4 and OpenCL 2.0 (along with DirectX 12.0). Under Ubuntu 16.04 LTS first the same OpenGL game tests were run with the default stack: Linux 4.4 and Mesa 11.2. Following that the system was manually upgraded to the Linux 4.7.0 mainline kernel and Mesa 12.1-dev Git as of 7 August from the Oibaf PPA. With Mesa 12.1 Git, the Intel driver is finally exposing OpenGL 4.4 for Broadwell and newer while they are quite close to OpenGL 4.5 once finishing up some conformance issues. Under OpenCL, via Beignet they currently have OpenCL 1.2 support for Intel on Linux while there is a branch containing OpenCL 2.0 support but it doesn't appear that it will be in released form anytime soon. All of the benchmarks under Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux were carried out in a fully-automated manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software. Additionally, at the end of the article are some additional Windows vs. Linux gaming benchmarks that were run manually for there not being full and appropriate automation support within those games like F1 2015, Shadow of Mordor, and Tomb Raider.

Of course, any manufacturer that has a high performing halo product will want that story out of the door on day one, but for typical user sales, it is the mid-range that is more relevant. The Intel Core i3 line comes without any Turbo, offering a flat frequency at load, and is synonymous with dual-core configurations with hyperthreading. In this review, we test three of the Core i3 processors, the i3-6100, the  i3-6300  and i3-6320, all of which are set at a 51W thermal design power. The Skylake Core i3 (51W) Review Intel’s mainstream desktop processor line, using the latest Skylake microarchitecture, currently sits at 30 different socketable processors. Most of these are available for purchase for system builds, although some of the lower power/specialized parts will be found in OEM systems only or select customers. These processors are subdivided into five ‘families’, with broad ranging feature sets designed to increase as we move through the stack. Intel's Mainstream Consumer Skylake Product Segments   Core i7 Core i5 Core i3 Pentium Celeron TDP Options 35W 65W 91W 35W 65W 91W 35W 51W 54W 35W 51W 54W 35W 51W Price $303 to $339 $182 to $242 $117 to $158 $64 to $85 $42 to $52 Cores 4 4 2 2 2 Hyperthreading Yes No Yes No No L3 Cache 8 MB 6 MB 4MB: 62/63 3MB: 61/60 3 MB 2 MB Base Freq 2.4-4.0 GHz 2.2-3.5 GHz 2.7-3.9 GHz 3.4-3.6 GHz 2.3-2.9 GHz Turbo Freq 3.4-4.2 GHz 2.9-3.9 GHz - - - DRAM Support DDR4-2133 DDR3L-1600 ECC No No Yes Yes Yes IGP HD 530 All All but P All but P G45 - HD 510 - 6402P 6098P G44 All AVX Yes Yes Yes No No TSX Yes Yes on 65/66 No on 64 No No No SGX Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes MPX Yes Yes Yes No No The Core i3 line sits in the middle, with two cores and hyperthreading enabled. There are three variants of Core i3 processor: the regular non-lettered models at 51W (e.g. i3-6300), the low power models at 35W (i3-6100T, i3-6100TE) and a single downgraded graphics SKU at 54W (i3-6098P). The Core i3 processors are the lowest specification of the range to enable AVX 2.0, indicating that AVX is a ‘Core’ feature, over a Pentium or Celeron. Similarly, MPX (Memory Protection Extensions) is only on Core i3 and up. By contrast, transactional extensions are not on the Core i3 models, and are only available on Core i5 and above. What makes the i3 line a little different to most is the L3 cache variation within the family. Typically the more cache a processor has (or the higher associativity of the cache), and the more cache that a processor has at lower levels, the less important the speed of higher cache/memory levels become. Low levels of cache are typically expensive SRAMs that also take up die area that might be better suited for lower latency logic, hence why we have a tiered cache system rather than just gigabytes of L1 cache. Core i3 processors either come with 3 MB or 4 MB of L3 cache. This will mean that, as a general rule of thumb, the processors with 4 MB will have to access main memory fewer times, and can hold more data closer to the core logic. This keeps the processors working as much as possible, and should afford obvious benefits in benchmarks where the data cannot fit as easily into cache. Processors with names that start i3-63xx will have 4MB of L3 cache, whereas the i3-61xx variants only have 3MB, except the Core i3-6100TE which has 4 MB. As confusing as that is, here’s a full table of every LGA1151 socketable Skylake processor released/announced: Intel's Skylake LGA1151 CPUs CPUs in Bold have been Tested (some not written up, yet)   C/T L3 Base Turbo HD HD Turbo TDP MSRP (OEM) Core i7-6700K 4/8 8 MB 4.0 4.2 530 1150 91W $339 Core i7-6700 4/8 8 MB 3.4 4.0 530 1150 65W $303 Core i7-6700T 4/8 8 MB 2.8 3.6 530 1100 35W $303 Core i7-6700TE 4/8 8 MB 2.4 3.4 530 1000 35W $303                   Core i5-6600K 4/4 6 MB 3.5 3.9 530 1150 91W $242 Core i5-6600 4/4 6 MB 3.3 3.9 530 1150 65W $213 Core i5-6500 4/4 6 MB 3.2 3.6 530 1050 65W $192 Core i5-6400 4/4 6 MB 2.7 3.3 530 950 65W $182 Core i5-6600T 4/4 6 MB 2.7 3.5 530 1100 35W $213 Core i5-6500T 4/4 6 MB 2.5 3.1 530 1100 35W $192 Core i5-6400T 4/4 6 MB 2.2 2.8 530 950 35W $192 Core i5-6500TE 4/4 6 MB 2.3 3.3 530 1000 35W $192 Core i5-6402P 4/4 6 MB 2.8 3.4 510 950 65W $182                   Core i3-6320 2/4 4 MB 3.9 - 530 1150 51W $149 Core i3-6300 2/4 4 MB 3.8 - 530 1150 51W $138 Core i3-6100 2/4 3 MB 3.7 - 530 1050 51W $117 Core i3-6300T 2/4 4 MB 3.3 - 530 950 35W $138 Core i3-6100T 2/4 3 MB 3.2 - 530 950 35W $117 Core i3-6100TE 2/4 4 MB 2.7 - 530 1000 35W $117 Core i3-6098P 2/4 3 MB 3.6 - 510 1050 54W $117                   Pentium G4520 2/2 3 MB 3.6 - 530 1050 51W $85 Pentium G4500 2/2 3 MB 3.5 - 530 1050 51W $75 Pentium G4400 2/2 3 MB 3.3 - 510 1000 54W $64 Pentium G4500T 2/2 3 MB 3.0 - 530 950 35W $75 Pentium G4400T 2/2 3 MB 2.9 - 510 950 35W $64 Pentium G4500TE 2/2 3 MB 2.4 - 510 950 35W $70                   Celeron G3920 2/2 2 MB 2.9 - 510 950 51W $52 Celeron G3900 2/2 2 MB 2.8 - 510 950 51W $42 Celeron G3900T 2/2 2 MB 2.6 - 510 950 35W - Celeron G3900TE 2/2 2 MB 2.3 - 510 950 35W $42 Originally Turbo mode was introduced in order to be able to push the frequency of a single core (or two) when the software only uses a small number of threads. This allows for extra performance while still keeping within the TDP of the processor. The Core i3 processors do not have a turbo mode by design: when any of the possible threads are in action, the processor will run the cores at the rated base frequency on the box. This should allow for more repeatable results in benchmarks, as long as background tasks do not interfere with the CPU time of a small number of cores. The pricing of the Skylake processors is such that moving up from a lower family to a higher family is a sufficient jump in price, and there is no overlap. Moving from a Core i3 to a Core i5 for example, is a minimum $23 (from $158 for a boxed i3-6320 to $182 for the i5-6400) for more cache and more physical cores, albeit with the same number of threads and lower core frequencies. Core i3-6100TE vs Core i3-6100 Looking at the rear of the processors, the lower power Core i3-6100TE, compared to the others (6100/6300/6320 are all the same), has extra capacitors and transistors on the bottom which presumably assist with lower power operation. As the i3-6100TE has a lower frequency to assist with power consumption, the extra components may help shift the efficiency of the processor to nearer the 35W mode. The T/TE variants are typically slightly more expensive than the standard versions, and part of this may be from the additional hardware required. Competition and Market One could argue that the Core i3 line is aimed at bulk system production where fast response times are important but high compute functions such as video editing are not. The Core i3 is often earmarked as a processor for entry level gaming, providing enough horsepower to drive medium graphics cards at reasonable resolutions without being a bottleneck. This becomes important if more game development engines and studios adapt their programming models to go beyond 2-4 threads or cores. Users coming into the Core i3 arena may be updating from an older machine, or looking at a fixed budget and trying to get bang-for-buck. Going back to entry level gaming and sub-$800 systems, users will pull out the Core i3 as an example. What will be interesting here is to see if that L3 cache difference between the Core i3-6100 and Core i3-6300 will be significant. On the other side of the x86 fence is AMD’s A10-7000 and FX-8000 processor lines. As the Core i3 processors are available for $117-$158, this fits in with the several AMD options. Some of the AMD options have the recently released and updated AMD CPU cooler, which we reviewed recently in a stock cooler roundup. Based on our extensive testing, this 'free' cooler adds value to the AMD offerings, which is not always apparent in benchmark data or when comparing price for performance. From AMD’s dual-module APUs with superior integrated graphics: - A10-7860K at $117, free $30 CPU cooler, - A10-7890K at $165, free $30 CPU cooler And AMD’s slightly older FX line with either six or eight threads, but no IGP: - FX-8350 at $199 (launch price) - FX-8320E at $147 - FX-6350 at $132 Putting these together gives the following table: CPU Competition at $115-$150   Intel Core i3 AMD A10 AMD FX i3-6100 i3-6300 i3-6320 A10 7860K A10 7890K FX 6350 FX 8320E TDP 51W 51W 51W 65W 95W 125W 95W Cores/Modules 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 Threads 4 4 4 4 4 6 8 Base Freq 3700 3800 3900 3600 4100 3900 3200 Turbo Freq - - - 4000 4300 4200 4000 IGP HD 530 HD 530 HD 530 R7-512 R7-512 - - IGP GFLOPs 403.2 441.6 441.6 900.0 1029.6 - - DRAM DDR4-2133 DDR4-2133 DDR4-2133 DDR3-2133 DDR3-2133 DDR3-1866 DDR3-1866 Released Sep '15 Sep '15 Sep '15 Feb '16 Mar '16 Oct '12 Sep '14 Price (box) $117 $147 $158 $117 $165 $132 $147 The FX parts, with more threads, have the deficit of being substantially older parts based on AMD’s Steamroller microarchitecture, while all the AMD parts suffer in terms of power consumption. However, for the extra TDP, there’s an uptick in integrated graphics for the APUs. Also, the AMD parts suffer a noticeable single thread performance deficit, so it will be interesting to see how this plays out on our benchmark suite. As part of a series of reviews this quarter, we have recently retested a small number of FX processors, as well as the newer A10 processors. The data for these is available in our benchmark database, Bench. CPUs in this Review For this review we have tested the Core i3-6100, Core i3-6300 and Core i3-6320 processors from Intel. This builds on our review of the Core i3-6100TE, where we explored overclocking on Core i3. As was apparent in that review, trying to get a motherboard with an older microcode to allow overclocking on a Core i3 is somewhat difficult, and results were not over the moon, so we won’t be producing overclocking numbers for these parts here (and I might have broken the OC motherboard accidentally trying some out-of-the-box thinking). Intel Core i3-6320 Intel Core i3-6300 Intel Core i3-6100 (with lower L3 Cache) Nonetheless, the landscape for Core i3 should be very interesting. We put these CPUs through our long-form CPU 2015 tests, including our Real World, Office and Professional tests, while the 2016 suite is still being built. The CPUs were also used with five high-caliber gaming titles, with low, mid and high-end GPUs. We then end with the final countdown analysis. Any of the links below will jump straight to the respective page.

POST A COMMENT 91 Comments View All Comments tipoo - Monday, August 08, 2016 - link Looks like even a Skylake i3 may be able to retire the venerable 2400/2500K, higher frame rates and better frame times at that. However a native quad does prevent larger dips. Reply Kevin G - Monday, August 08, 2016 - link I have a feeling much that is due to the higher base clock on the SkyLake i3 vs. the i5 2500K. Skylake's IPC improvements also help boost performance here too. The real challenge is if the i3 6320 can best the i5 2500k as the same 3.9 Ghz base clock speed. Sandy Bridge was a good overclocker so hitting those figures shouldn't be difficult at all. Reply tipoo - Monday, August 08, 2016 - link That's true, overclocked the difference would diminish. But you also get modernities like high clocked DDR4 in the switchover. At any rate, funny that a dual core i3 can now fluidly run just about everything, it's two cores are probably faster than the 8 in the current consoles. Reply Lolimaster - Monday, August 08, 2016 - link Benchrmarks don't tell you about the hiccups when playing with a dual core. Specially with things like Crysis 3 or even worse ROt Tomb Raider where you get like half the fps just by using a dual core bs a cheapo Athlon 860K. Reply gamerk2 - Monday, August 08, 2016 - link That's why Frame Times are also measured, which catches those hitches. Reply Samus - Tuesday, August 09, 2016 - link I had a lot of issues with my Sandy Bridge i3-2125 in Battlefield 3 circa 2011 with lag and poor minimum frame rates. After long discussions on the forums, it was determined disabling hyper threading actually improved frame rate consistency. So at least in the Sandy Bridge IPC, and probably dating back to Nehalem or even Prescott, Jackson Technology or whatever you want to call it, has a habit of stalling the pipeline if there are too many cache misses to complete the instruction. Obviously more cache resolves this, so the issue isn't as prominent on the i7's, and it would certainly explain why the 4MB i3's are more consistent performers than the 3MB variety. Of course the only way to prove if hyper threading is causing performance inconsistency is to disable it. It'd be a damn unique investigation for Anandtech to do a IPC improvement impact on it's affect on hyper-threading performance over the years, perhaps even dating back to the P4. Reply AndrewJacksonZA - Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - link HOW ON EARTH DID I MISS THIS?!?! Thank you for introducing me to Intel's tech known as "Jackson!" This is now *SO* on my "To Buy" list! Thank you Samus! :-D Reply bug77 - Monday, August 08, 2016 - link Neah, I went i5-2500k -> i5-6600k and there's no noticeable difference. The best part of the upgrade was those new I/O ports on the new motherboard, but it's a sad day when you upgrade after 4 years and the most you have to show is you new M2 or USB 3.1 ports (and USB 3.1 is only added through a 3rd party chip). Sure, if I bench it, the new i5 is faster, but since the old i5 wasn't exactly slow, I can't say that I see a significant improvement. Now, if you mean that instead of getting an i5-2500k one can now look at a Skylake i3, I'm not going to argue with you there. Though (money permitting) the boost speed might be nice to have anyway. Reply Cellar Door - Monday, August 08, 2016 - link This is a poorly educated comment: a) Your perceived speed might be limited by your storage b) You don't utilize your cpu's multitasking abilities fully(all cores) Reply Duckeenie - Monday, August 08, 2016 - link Why did you continue to post your comment if you believed you were making poorly educated points?

We received the 10-core Core i7-6950X for review and while it was an attractive chip in terms of performance, it came at a seriously ugly price. At $1,650 we recommend taking a hard pass on the 6950X. Frankly, the older 8-core 5960X was difficult to justify at $1,050, so the slightly updated 6900K for $1,100 doesn't exactly have us whipping our wallets out. Spending over $600 on the 6-core 6850K isn't too appealing either... So, what's an enthusiast to do if they require more than the 4 cores in Intel's mainstream desktop Core i7 processors? One solution would be building our beastly 16-core/32-thread Xeon E5-2670 workstation featured back in April. For under $1,000 we picked up core components including two 8-core E5-2670 processors, a new dual-socket LGA2011 motherboard and 64GB of DDR3 memory. Throw in a case, power supply, graphics card and some storage and you have a seriously capable machine for the price of a Core i7-5960X. In terms of performance, our affordable Xeon build really stuck it to the 5960X by a rather large margin in more than one test. When the uber expensive 6950X appeared, we made sure to pit it against the dual-CPU system and to our surprise the Xeons stood strong, even coming out on top in a few tests. One solution would be building our beastly 16-core/32-thread Xeon E5-2670 workstation featured back in April. It was interesting to find that in many of the application and encoding tests, this older Sandy Bridge-EP build was able to put up a real fight. In terms of performance vs. price it tends to come out well on top with the only blemish being its power consumption. The dual-Xeon system pulled 300 watts in our Hybrid x265 test while the Core i7-6950X setup needed only half that amount. Of course we were comparing two 8-core processors to a single 10-core chip, but the main issue was the four-generation-old Sandy Bridge architecture. This put us on the hunt for affordable Xeon processors based on the Haswell-EP or perhaps even Broadwell-EP architectures -- it certainly seemed mere wishful thinking that we would come across a relatively inexpensive Broadwell-EP Xeon. Our search put us on the trail of Intel's Xeon E5 2630 v4, a 10-core Broadwell-EP part that runs at a base clock of 2.2GHz but can boost up to 3.1GHz depending on the workload. Typically, you'd spend something like $700 for this processor -- substantially more than the $70 we paid for each of our E5-2670 v1 processors -- however, it's possible to purchase the E5-2630 v4 for as little as $200 on eBay. The only catch is that they are engineering samples (ES), not retail chips. The examples we've come across are based on release stepping (SR2R7), so motherboard compatibility won't be an issue, providing the BIOS has been updated to support Broadwell-EP processors. Once upon a time it was rare to find Intel engineering samples, but today they appear online in huge volumes. Looking only on eBay for instance, thousands of these E5-2630 v4 ES chips have been sold with countless more still in stock. Typically, we suggest avoiding ES chips when possible, but $200 for a 10-core/20-thread Broadwell-EP processor really is too hard to refuse. With so many of you asking what these chips perform like over the past few weeks, we've decided to find out. The Build The previous build using the Xeon E5-2670 v1 processors was put together on a pretty tight budget and so we went with one of the most affordable Dual Socket R (LGA2011) motherboards we could find. Since we are spending more than twice as much on the processors this time ($400), we decided to go with a more capable motherboard. Having been so impressed with the previous Asrock Rack motherboard, we picked up the EP2C612D16-2L2T on Newegg for $580 (which is now $100 cheaper if you needed further temptation). This is a Dual Socket LGA2011 R3 motherboard that adheres to the SSI EEB form factor, measuring 12'' x 13'' (30.5 cm x 33 cm). Announced way back in September 2014, the EP2C612D16-2L2T gained Broadwell-EP support in March via BIOS version 2.10. At the heart of the EP2C612D16-2L2T we find the Intel C612 chipset, a 7w part that was built using the 32nm process and offers Gen 2 PCIe support for up to 8-lanes, six USB 3.0 ports as well as 10 SATA 6Gb/s ports. Asrock Rack has expanded SATA support to a dozen ports with the inclusion of a single Marvell 9172 6Gb/s controller. Given that this is a two-year old motherboard, you won't find fancy storage options such as M.2. High speed SSDs will need to be integrated using PCI Express adapter cards. There are a total of 16 DIMM slots with support for NVDIMM (Non-Volatile Dual In-line Memory Module). Each processor is connected to 8 DIMMs and of course quad-channel memory support exists. Both RDIMM and LRDIMM modules are supported at speeds of DDR4 2133/1866 and 1600. Onboard we find three PCIe 3.0 x16 expansion slots along with a further three PCIe 3.0 x8 slots. That means there are 72 PCIe 3.0 lanes on tap -- impressive stuff. One of the key highlights of the EP2C612D16-2L2T is network support. Out of the box you get a pair of 10G network connections courtesy of the Intel X540 controller. In addition there are a pair of Intel i210 controllers for a pair of Gigabit Ethernet connections. Finally, there is also a single dedicated IPMI LAN port. The ECC memory this board can support is generally meant for servers, where any data corruption is unacceptable. Since this isn't really a concern for most of our readers, we went with standard UDIMM modules from G.Skill, rather than equip the board with ECC memory. Ideally we wanted to populate every DIMM slot with DDR4-2133 memory so we reached out to our good friends over at G.Skill. Happy to oblige, they served up 16 4GB sticks of Ripjaws V DDR4-2133 memory for a total capacity of 64GB, which will allow both Xeon E5-2630 v4 chips to enjoy quad-channel memory support. G.Skill sells this memory in 16GB quad-channel memory kits for just $74 each, taking the total cost for this build to just shy of $300. For those wondering, the memory operates at CL 15-15-15-35 timings using 1.2 volts. The modules are available with either red or black heat spreaders and we went with red. As with our previous dual-Xeon build, we equipped the processors with Noctua NH-U12DX i4 coolers. Noctua's DX line have become a popular choice in high performance quiet cooling solutions for Intel Xeon CPUs. The latest i4 revision supports the LGA2011 platform (both Square ILM and Narrow ILM) and comes with a 120mm NF-F12 'Focused Flow' fan. Thanks to its slim design with a fin depth of 45mm, the NH-U12DX i4 ensures easy access to the RAM slots. When installed parallel to the slots, it will not overhang the memory even with two fans installed. For those concerned about space, the NH-D9DX i4 is an even more compact option. At $60, both the NH-U12DX i4 and NH-D9DX i4 are well priced and come backed by a six-year manufacturer's warranty.

High level IOT Co2 emission simulation. Download Edison_App.zip - 751 B Download Netbeans VANET Simulator with IoT Integration ( DropBox- 38 MB) Introduction Today, cities face several challenges. Traffic congestion control and pollution control are two of biggest challenges for any city. Various artificial intelligence systems and autonomous systems are being developed and deployed over the years to ease the traffic congestion as well as reducing the opollution level in a city. Often time, research and development of such products are tedious because product testing is expenssive. A Simulation environment gives much needed flexibility for such large scale solution deployment. It has been found in the past studies that overall pollution of a place is dependent on the industrial output in and around the place and the traffic. It is found that vehicles emit more Co2 while stationary with engines on. It is observed that the pollution at the junctions are more where vehicle wait with engine on for the lights to be turned green. In order to reduce such traffic volume, authorities have adopted flow based traffic light control where the traffic flow is being monitored throug either physical sensors or through machine vision techniques. However, as the type of vehicles differs and as each vehicle type has their own pollution signature, density based traffic control has failed to reduce the pollution level. We therefore need more intelligent system that can actually take into account of the pollution level while controlling the traffic light timer. As City traffic is interconnected from one traffic junction to another, it would require immense resource to deploy physical sensors across all parts of a jusnction, to observe traffic flow, pollution and then take light timing decisions. We want to reduce this cumbersome and difficult process by providing a framework that readily integrates IoT with a realistic city traffic and vehicle flow simulation. A physical sensor is integrated into the simulation environment such that the solution can be tested against real city jucntion even while in simulation mode. So, our solution offers:   A realistic traffic simulation using VANET Open source simulator An Intel Edison based Co2 sensing device A Mqtt gateway based integration of the sensing data to the simulation environment A ThingSpeak based gateway to mitigate the data into cloud for further analysis An intelligent object to attach the Co2 monitoring data with one of the traffic junctions of the simulation environment and then finally controlling the traffic light timing of that particular junction.   This is a high end simulation of a adhoc based traffic system which shows how co2 consumption happens in the way of increasinh vehicles.The condition blends in both of virtual and real world scenario in a map. This simulation works in a full indepth research that has happened in the field of traffic based system.We have taken data from various considerations and broken it in a map of small pocket where we can intensely classify the demographic of a vehicle.Keepin key considerations in mind such as the vehicle and their types plus they velocity amount of fuel burnt more of a carbon footprint of the vehicle and the causes of it.Here we measure the CO2 emission of the vehicles present the densely populated with different vehicles how it works. The project is an adoptation and improvement of the concepts presented in this paper The Physical world   The physical world comprises of an Intel Edison board with Grove shield where a Mq7 sensor is connected with one of the analog ports.   Fig. Intel Edison board with Mq7 Sensor The arrangement measure the gas in the environment and analog value varies accordingly. This 10 bit precision analog value needs to be mapped to the actual Co2 value in PPM which is done in following way: Methodology Create a realistic city traffic simulation using VanetSim (a java based open source vanet simulator). Implement a real time pollution sensing device using Intel Edison and Mq7 sensor. Mitigate the observe pollution level (CO2 level) to the simulation environment using high quality of service, low latency Mqtt protocol. Create a dependency graph between traffic flow and congestion level. Control city traffic light based on the vehicle flow. Integrate the pollution level into traffic light control system. To observe the performance of variation of the traffic light behavior in accordance to change in the pollution level at specific junction. To validate that such a system can ensure realistic results through huge number of vehicles and by incorporating movement of the vehicles through multiple junctions. The correlation of the monitored Co2 value with the traffic light is shown in following equation: Where 400 is the normal Co2 value in PPM, ParameterValue is the simulation object representing the actual pollution ( Co2 level) assigned to it through Mqtt by Intel Edison. 10 is the factor by which the green light phase is increased in the mapped junction   System Design     The main thing is to push the values to the simulation and at the same time keep the values into cloud. The iot.eclipse.org provides a cloud service but we want a real time visualization at large area by pushing the values into cloud analytic service called ThingSpeak. Simulation Overview   Fig. Way points in the open street map Fig. nodes (vehicles) moving through junction Coding Co2 Sensing and Publishing over ioT var mqtt    = require('mqtt'); 
var client  = mqtt.connect('mqtt://iot.eclipse.org');    In unix, push the data into any open websites like curl (command line URL).From javascript, access the curl command which is Unix base command. Then push data into the cloud calling http get method.The thingspeak use the JavaScript id. So thingspeak need http protocol, we call http protocol using curl command. Here node js doesn’t have http directives, so we can access Unix system commands from node js to use Unix as Unix http features to push the data into thingspeak http API. To do this process using the library function called ‘sys’. var sys = require('sys') It is Unix system library which means all APIs like word count,ls commands etc are access using ‘sys’ library.   var exec = require('child_process').exec; Here,’exe’ is a process, we take a JavaScript module by child process. We create a background process while we do network related operations, such that it doesn’t block the main process. The node js doesn’t create any thread and node.js is a system which runs a single thread. But the problem is that it cannot access the Unix command system because those are kernel level commands. The js runs a single thread which cannot run kernel command from the user a command. So we take a node module called child process, which allows node js system to fork a child process. If we can fork a child process. Then we can access kernel level program and id doesn’t run in the user level. The ‘exe’ is a variable of child process.   function puts(error, stdout, stderr) { sys.puts(stdout) } The ‘puts’ is a function which puts all the results coming from the child process.When we execute a any linux command like ls,wc etc.Then we get setup results.We want to put its results into the actual command prompts.So ‘put’ command going to put all error,stdout into current command.   The node js a program which of two types of libraries: Core library User defined library There are some set of function which is already available with node js and there are some other functions which are not available with node js.The functions which are not to be available with node js are to be installed by npm (node package manager).Once we install the npm package by saying npm-install.Now we can access any number of libraries. var mraa=require('mraa'); The ‘mraa’ is a library.This node js library used to access the hardware.Because we want to access digital pin called GPIO pin, hence we using the ‘mraa’ library.In javascript use the ‘require’ function to use the modules.There are two types of modules which are one is core module and another is use module.The javascript support some core modules including anything for example math library etc. //var LCD = require('jsupm_i2clcd'); //var myLCD = new LCD.Jhd1313m1(6, 0x3E, 0x62);   var a0=new mraa.Aio(3); The pollution sensor connected to analog port which is pin 3(Aio(3)).The analog pin3 used to reads the analog value of amount of CO2 emitted by vehicles coming from Mq7 sensor.It will measure the analog value. The formula is computed for calculating the ppm value. According to formulae that is ppm=a*(Rs/R0)^b, var a=116.602;
var b=-5.96;
var In=4.5/3.34e+4;
var R0=41000;
   These are the default resistance values.First we read the analog value from a0 pin where pollution sensor is connected.Then we go through all conversions in order to get the pollution value.The pollution will be in ppm.The CO2 level will be measure in the ppm’s.         var Rs=v1/In; // Rs is resistance value calculated by v1/In where In is a normal current value.

var v2=Rs/R0; // R0 is default value where R0=41000

v2=Math.pow(v2,b); // That is (Rs/R0)^b

var ppm=179.73*v2; //The formula for calculating ppm value as &lsquo;ppm=a*(Rs/R0)^b&rsquo;

console.log("x="+val+" vo="+vo+" Rs="+Rs+" ppm"+ppm);     // The console.log used to       display the &lsquo;x&rsquo;,&rsquo;vo&rsquo;,&rsquo;Rs&rsquo;,&rsquo;ppm&rsquo; values.

//myLCD.clear();

//myLCD.setCursor(0,1);

//myLCD.write(""+ppm);

//myLCD.setCursor(1,1);

//myLCD.write("Co2 in ppm");

 
if(ppm<420)

{

//myLCD.setColor(0,255,0);

}

else

{

//myLCD.setColor(255,0,0);

}
 The ppm value will be less than 420 then it display the value in display as green or else display the value in display as red color.     ///////////// Update ThingSpeak/////////////

   The ‘curl’ command used to call the thingspeak.com where the value are updated.The thingspeak.com/update is a API key,along with this API key only one field thingspeak.In thingspeak channel,we can push the eight sensors together.So we can pass upto 8 sensors.In our project using only one sensor in the field1 to display the ppm value. At the same time, we pushing this value to the simulator.So we need to publish the data in a channel using Mqtt protocol. The Simulation Part This is an adoptation of Open Source VANET Simulator Project where we have integrated our physical sensing model and embedded intelligence to control the traffic light based on environmental Co2 value. As the traffic gets congested at a specific road leading to a junction, the pollution increases. Now, the pollution level also depends upon several other factors like type of vehicles ( generally bikes and trucks will emit more co2 than cars). Normally modern traffic flow doesn't take into consideration of these factors and traffic lights at best adopts a density based control model where highly densed roads are given more priority and high timer value for the green light in order to clear the traffic in that road.  But as we elaborated at the top, that approch not always result in most optimum pollution control. We argue that instead of controlling the traffic through traffic lights, the authorities must adopt more intelligent solution and must integrate the environmental parameters like Co2 into traffic control. We have adopted a realistic city traffic scenerio with VANET simulator that can not only simulate the traffic lights, junctions, but also many important aspects of a realistic city traffic scenerio like accidents, pot holes, inter vehicular communication and so on.   We have been  through how the process works now it is important on how the data and the simulation works.The entire code is written in java.We have used netbeans ide to write the programs.OpenStreetMap allows the file which you want to work on to be loaded.It generates a *.osn file for our usage.Now that file is uploaded in the vanet simulator and can be worked upon.The starting point of the code is shown below.The buttons in the code are for exact choices of what we are doing.     /*

 Breaking down the code Now we will work on the scenario of the vanet simulator as soon as the osm file is uploaded we can generate the map of our area.It helps in replicating the best scenario for which we can consider amount of traffic load at time and place when it is at peak and when it is less.We can test the extremes of the traffic and the CO2 emission rate at a particular place. Getting the important things done The Intel edison board which will feed the data and communicate to internet and other services should be kept at the junction point that too for the first traffic light of the junction.This will help in creating the simulation environment starting point.

Let's put a particular stress on message arrived function.The key here is the declaration of the variable ParameterValue which fetches the CO2 values. Now in the next code block we will see as the ParameterValue increases the greenlight phase value too increases.       /*

</http:> Results   The Intel Edison board has two ports: one is closer to switch called power port. It directly get power from pc. The other one is serial port, from serial port pc can send commands to the board.Once board put into wi fi network, We can program the board remotely.The board is connected with pc using USB port.Once connected,the LED is glowing in the board,which means board is powered.Once USB puts,right click on my computer.Click on properties as shown below:                                 Fig. connecting the serial port. Next click on device manager,next click on COM&LPT ports to select the USB serial port for communication purpose where computer communicate with this serial port communication.                    Fig. selecting the COM and LPT port. To check the port number,then use a serial communication software called putty.Putty is very popular serial communication software.Next step is to just open the putty software.It has two connections,one SSH and another one is serial.Here board is connected using serial connection so click on serial from device manager and see which poet is configured.Its depend on pc’s,here my computer configured with COM18.In putty,click on serial tap then press 18 infront COM and this board has got a bit data rate is 115200.The speed change into 115200 and this number of bits per second.Now once we enter the value and say open then pc can communicate with this board.The black screen appear.                Fig. enters the serial line and bit rate We should enter, once entered. We should login with root and enter the password.First take Edison board into our wi-fi network.The board get connected with internet through our local network that is our wi-fi network.The command used is configure_edison  --wifi.Once run this command.                  Fig. login to putty and configure the wi-fi. It configure all the wifi networks available in the surrounding area as shown in below.Here my modem number is 4.It will ask for network SSID and make sure that oue network Id by entering Yes.Then enter the our network password.              Fig. Configuring the Edison wifi connection. Once enter the password,the Edison board get connected with our local network.Then it will shown the IP-address.It may have different IP-addresses for different pc’s,it using SSH connection.The ls command used to see our program. My pogram is PollutionSim.js.It can run by entering node PollutionSim.js.It will display x value where x is analog value.The analog value sensed by the sensor which sense the CO2 level from vehicles.The CO2 value display in ppm.                       Fig. Run the program to get ppm value. Next part is to run the project VanetSimulatorIoT: The VanetSimulatorIoT package has source packages to run the simulation such as IoTSimulatorInterface.java package.Here right click on IoTSimulatorInterface.java package and debug the file to connect the server.                                   Fig. Connecting simulation with IoT Once debug the IoTSimulatorInterface.java package,we are going to connect the Mqtt server.Mqtt is a machine to machine communication protocol which is pub-sub based service.The channel is created to store the data into channel and retrieve the data from channel.Here the channel is created for message exchange is rupam/simulator.We can create our own channel in Mqtt server. First we connecting the Mqtt broker.If broker is connected.The msg is displayed as broker is connected as shown in above figure. The Mqtt has two servers such as, iot.eclipse.org and test.mosquitto.org. Our aim to show the local plot on the simulator which one already plotting in thingspeak at the same time.We want to show in local plot of variations of the CO2 level.In order to show the simulation result,we taking the array of data where we are storing the data.The simulation result shown below. Before running the simulator, first connect the IoT device to system and login through putty software using COM18 serial port.The node PollutionSim.js is a javascript program to get the current ppm value.Then pinging to the google.com.Once pings to google then asure that the ppm value is updated.Run the project,at the same time open the thingspeak channel for real time visualization of simulation value.The channel is thingspeak.com/channels/105527 as shown in below figure. Fig. Thingspeak updated result Once we get connected with IoT.Run the simulation.During this observe that traffic light value do not hit the break points because we aren’t reset the map. Next step is to edit section of open street map. Fig. Edit section for taking the open street map. Fig. The map creation process using values Fig.Open street map of Gulbarga city Let starts the edit section by opening the open street map of any city. We are taking the Gulbarga’s open street map as gulbarga3.osm file.                                Fig. Selecting the particular junction Then enable the edit mode to put the traffic light at the junction and vehicles.                               Fig. Selecting traffic light at the junction After enabling the edit mode.Select the particular junction in open street map to put the traffic light and vehicles.Next go into the settings, select the one traffic light for one junction.                                Fig.Putting one traffic light at specific junction Next, selecting the number of vehicles from setting section only.                        Fig.Selecting the vehicle option from setting After selecting the option as vehicle, we are going to put the number of vehicles. Fig. Selecting the by click option Here, we use the by click option.By click we are selecting and adding the number of vehicles in the street map.                                          Fig. Adding the selected no. of vehicles Once we selected the number of vehicles for example consider the 30 vehicle.The vehiclesmove from source point to destination point with 10sec difference.We have to set the waypoint for the vehicles that is source and destination point for selected no. of vehicles and which must pass through the specified junction where traffic light is placed.                                      Fig.Selecting Road side units                                                     Fig. Putting the Road side units The road side unit option selecting by clicking on setting.Then select the road side units and put on roads on the open street map.The road side units are extended the communication range between vehicles.         Fig. Selecting the event action Now, let place the some events.The option event selecting from the settings only.                             Fig. Selecting particular event spots The events are nothing but hospitals, damaged road. schoolzone etc. We are selecting here damaged road as an eventspot.  Fig. placing the damaged road eventspot After selecting damaged road.This event placed on the roads.While vehicles move from one place to another place, the vehicle get the information about damaged road before reaching to that road,when vehicles are nearer to damaged road slow down the vehicles to avoid the accidents. Fig. Selecting the disable mode After completion of editing section, we disable the editing section by using disable mode (statistics).                                       Fig. Run the simulation part Finally, run the simulation. Once simulation will start the vehicles are pass through the particular junction where traffic light is placed. Once simulation will start, the green light timing display on the IoTSimulatorInterface.java interface of console based on CO2 level and traffic congestion.When CO2 level and traffic congestion increases the green light timing increases.So that the number of vehicle pass smoothly through the junction. Simulation-Real World Mapping simulation point when there is greater consumption of CO2 occurs. Let's check on how we did the simulation again The first figure shows how we started working on the code at netbeans. The second figure highlights with a red tick where green phase length is calculated. The third figures portrays how the traffic simulation have started and the traffic lights showing co2 consumption. The fourth figure also shows the same and depicts from where the traffic is arriving. The sigificant green light shows that how the green light has been created.So with the entire pictures we have shown how the simulation happens. Simulation results show that by controlling the traffic Conclusion  Often City traffic planning and management needs good simulation Engines. VANET Simulator is one such realistic simulator where any city's traffic scenerio can be projected with the aid of OpenStreet map. One of the toughest challenges that the cities phases these days is to reduce pollution. Even though simulation engines are good at developing functional algorithm for traffic planning and management, validating them against real world scenerio is difficult. In this work we have shown how a single pollution sensing physical node can be integrated into the simulation environment and how the data acquired through physical device can be used as a variable in simulation environment. This work can be used as a framework, the devices can be considered as assets deployed over different known geospatial positions, broadcasting their position and pollution data simultansously. By adding an asset discovery interface with the code, these real time assests can be imported into simulation environment and multi-junction poluution data can be used to develop better traffic planning scenerios. Also vehicles using Android phones if broadcasts their GPS data, entire traffic flow of real traffic can be observed on the map. In such scenerios a hybrid of simulation and real time data can be used with a collaborative context to develop more roboust city traffic planning scenerios.   History Keep a running update of any changes or improvements you've made here.

A real smart table clock with Gmail notification, Fire Alarm, temperature monitoring with Intel Edison Download SmartTableClockForSmartHome.zip - 1.2 KB Introduction Ah! Another 'smart clock'! You may well be thinking "what is even need of a clock project when phone does it?" Well, an IoT connected embedded device does many things which smart phones do not do that well. They respond to hardware and sensor events in a faster and smarter ways. When you connect such devices to cloud, you get some awesome use cases which a simple mobile fails to do any days. This is a project I worked on to explore the exciting new possibilities with a clock and connecting it to IoT. So what is so special about the clock? 1) The clock shows date and time ( which obviously all the clock shows) 2) It shows temperature ( which many table stand clock shows) 3) It shows Gmail notification and can respond to that. For example "coming home" mail turns on home light and "leaving  home" mail turns off the home light. 4) Shoots up fire alarm in case a very high and abnormal temperature pattern is detected. Because the clock is connected to cloud, you can perform several tasks like scheduling an event, automatic notification and many more. Before we start, let me make an honest confession. Like many of you, I am also new to IoT and Intel Edison Board. But when I was learning the IoT fundamentals, I saw most of the tutorials are Windows based. There are many differences when you develop an IoT framework on Linuc than on Windows. Even though Intel Edison runs on Yocto, configuring the board from a Linux platform and then coding needs many tweaks and twists. So, in this I would more or less share my learning experience with you. How to work with Intel Edision Board in Linux First you need to install putty on your linux system by using this command into your terminal $sudo apt-get install putty Putty is a ssh and telnet client.If you want to access your system remotely,for example suppose you have more than one systems with ubuntu , one with windows and another  with ssh server.Then you could be accessed ssh server from  the other systems using putty software by remotely login to the ssh server. You need to configure putty in order to work with intel edison board.To connect the intel Edison board serially, you have to set the custom serial baud rate 115200 to the serial line /dev/ttyUSB0 .Because the default baud rate is 9600.To set a custom buad rate you need to give a command on the terminal: $stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 When you execute this line ,you will get a error such as /dev/ttyUSB0 serial line permission denined.Because in the group category of /dev/ttyUSB0 serial line doesnot have read and write permission.Using the following command you can see the permissions of any file. $ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0                                                     Figure: Attriutes of /dev/ttyUSB0 Now you can reset the permission then in the unix using chmod command to see the changed permission of files,you have to use the  command with -l option.The following commands are: $sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0

$ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0 This is the following screen shot:                               Figure : Assign read and write permission to group category So in the above screen if you notice,group category assigned read and write permission.Now you can set the custom baud rate 115200 to the /dev/ttyUSB0 serial line.No error will be shown.This is the following screen shot:                                                 Fig:custom Baud rate 115200 set to /dev/ttyUSB0 Now configure the putty to access ssh server remotely,you can use the following command to open putty. $sudo putty /dev/ttyUSB0 -serial -sercfg 115200 This command will open putty window and after pressing Enter ,it is asking for the login.                      Figure : Putty window open                                                 Figure : Asking for login name and password       Now, you have to do the following steps.I am demonstrating  it using the following screen sorts: Firstly, give login name(root) and password.If the authentication is correct then you got the Edison prompt.In the prompt write 'ifconfig' to configure and get the connected IP address.                            Figure : Configuring putty Using this Ip address(192.168.1.2) you can also login using the command: $ssh <a href="mailto:root@192.168.1.2">root@192.168.1.2</a> Now to connect wi-fi,you need to write the following command: $configure_edison &ndash;wifi The wifi will be connected by giving the wifi password and this is the following screen sort:                               Figure: connecting wifi                            Figure : Assigning wifi password     Now if you want to check the internet connection ,you can ping to the terminal using the command: $ping google.com                            Figure  : Checking Wifi connecton                                          Figure : Command prompt appear when the edison prompt will return,it is ready to start with IoT(Internet of things).Here I am demonstrating my work on IoT(smart clock for smart home).This project is developed by javacript environment with node.js module on Linux based (ubuntu). Background  The smart clock is doing various different smart works.It consists with two modules.1. It displays current date and current time on the LCD. 2. Temperature indication with alarm,LCD display with background colour change and send  mail to Gmail Address. In the first module it displays time and date on the LCD with green backgroud color.In second module if temperature is crossed the limit temperature then smart clock display the temperature value and with current time and generate notification with alarm,change background colour of LCD(green to red) and send email to the gmail address. Using the code 1.To display current time and date on the LCD , you have to connect LCD with the Intel Edison board.Intel Edison has I2C port,you have to connect the LCD with the I2C.It is just like that:                                  Fig: LCD connected with Intel Edison Board   Now need to remotely log in to the ssh server using putty(steps given above) and create a file using the command $vi clock.js and write the code following to display date and time: var currentdate=new Date(); var jsUpmI2cLcd=require('jsupm_i2clcd');

var lcd=new jsUpmI2cLcd.Jhd1313m1(6,0x3E,0x62);

var loop=function()

{

var time=currentdate.getHours()+&rdquo;:&rdquo;+currentdate.getMinutes()+&rdquo;:&rdquo;+currentdate.getSeconds();

lcd.clear();

lcd.setColor(0,255,0);

lcd.setCursor(0,3);

lcd.write(time);

var date=currentdate.getFullYear()+&rdquo;-&rdquo;+('0'+(currentdate.getMonth()+1)).slice(-2)+&rdquo;-&rdquo;+('0'+currectdate.getDate)).slice(-2);

lcd.setCursor(1,2);

lcd.write(date);

setTimeout(loop,500);

}

loop();   In the above code i have used getHours(),getMinutes and getSeconds() methods to display current hours,minute and second.Time is displayed on LCD starting from 0 number row and 3 rd numer column.Display time on the LCD using write method.And getFullYear(),getMonth() and getDate() methods to display current date.It displays date from the 2nd row. To run this above code you need to write the following command: $node clock.js This is the following output:                                                       Fig:current time and date displayed                                                 Fig: smart clock with date time        Smart clock also can display the current time and date in the different way using the following code. var currentdate=new Date();

var jsUpmI2cLcd=require('jsupm_i2clcd');

var lcd=new jsUpmI2cLcd.Jhd131m1(6,0x3E,0x62);

var loop=function()

{


currentdate=new Date();

var targetTime=new Date(currentdate);

var timeZoneFromDB=+5.30;

var tzDifference=timeZoneFromDB*60+targetTime.getTimezoneOffset();

var offsetTime=new Date(targetTime.getTime()+tzDifference*60*1000);

//to separate the time

var time=offsetTime.getHours()+&rdquo;:&rdquo;+offsetTime.getMinutes()+&rdquo;:&rdquo;+offsetTime.getSeconds();

lcd.clear();

lcd.setColor(0,255,0);

lcd.setCursor(0,3);

lcd.write(time);

var date=new Date();

lcd.setCursor(1,0);

lcd.write(date.toGMTString());

setTimeout(loop,1000);

}

loop(); using the above code we display the current time in HH:MM:SS and display the date into 'thu, 28 Jul 2016'.This is the following screen shot:                                 Fig: Diffferent format time date display                                   2.In the second module you need to connect the temperature sensor groove connector with the Intel Edison board.You can connect it with any of the analog port of groove board.Here I connect it with A0 port.Here is the image is as follows: 2.Second you have to connect buzzar groove connector with any of the data port.Here I connect it with D5 data port.Here is the image is as follows: https://www.codeproject.com/KB/Articles/1111769/2.jpg You can connect a LCD for the notification also.It is display the current temperature and background colour is set to green.if temperature cross the threasold value then backgroung color change to red.This is the following way you can connect the LCD to the I2C port of Intel Edison board. https://www.codeproject.com/KB/Articles/1111769/3.jpg Afterwards you need to connect the Intel Edison board and get into the Edision command prompt. This is the following screen sort. https://www.codeproject.com/KB/Articles/1111769/4modi.png This is the following code that you can use to read single value temperature using temperature sensor. var mraa=require('mraa');

console.log('The varsion o0f mraa is:' + mraa.getVersion());

var AnalogPin0=new mraa.Aio(0);

var B=3975;

var a=AnalogPin0.read();

var resistance=(1023.0-a)*10000.0/a;

var temperature=1/(Math.log(resistance/10000.0)/B+1/298.15)-273.15;

var value=Math.round(temperature*100)/100;

console.log(value);
 In the above code signal of the temperature sensor is connected with A0.The B value is the value of thermistor.Formula (1023-a)*10000.0/a is used to get the registance of the sensor.Formula 1/(Math.log(resistance/10000.0)/B+1/298.15)-273.15 is converting to temperature via NBSP datasheet catalog. This is the following screen sort is as follows: https://www.codeproject.com/KB/Articles/1111769/5.png   Now if the displayed temperature cross the threasold value then notification is generated.This is the following code is as follows: var digitalPin5=new mraa.Gpio(5);

digitalPin5.dir(mraa.DIR_OUT);

if(value>35)

{

digitalPin5.write(1);

}
 You can write code for LCD color change notificaion .This is the following code is as follows: var AnalogPin0=new mraa.Aio(0);

var jsUpmI2cLcd=require('jsupm_i2clcd');

var lcd=new jsUpmI2CLcd.Jhd1313m1(6,0x3E,0x62);

var B=3975;

var a=AnalogPin0.read();

var resistance=(1023.0-a)*10000.0/a;

var temperature=1/(Math.log(resistance/10000.0)/B+1/298.15)-273.15;

var value=Math.round(temperature*100)/100;

console.log(value);

var digitalPin5=new mraa.Gpio(5);

digitalPin5.dir(mraa.DIR_OUT);

lcd.clear();

lcd.setColor(0,255,0);

lcd.setCursor(0,1);

lcd.write(&ldquo;Temprature&rdquo;+value);

if(temperature>25)

{

lcd.clear();

lcd.setColor(255,0,0);

lcd.setCursor(0,1);

lcd.write(&ldquo;Temprature&rdquo;+value);
lcd.setColor(0,255,0);
lcd.setCursor(1,3);
lcd.write("It is hot");

digitalPin5.write(1);

}

Novel Intel Edison smart helmet with portable air conditioner that can notify the relatives when a rider meets an accident, can automatically trigger the indicators based on head movement. Download Helmet Intel XDK Nodejs Code.zip - 9.4 KB   A Intel Edison based smart helmet that Changes In-Helmet temperature using Peltier based cooling system The cooling is based on temperature sensing Triggers indicator automatically when user moves his head in left or right direction Detects accident and notifies about the accident using Gmail and over Mqtt Cmpletely battery driven and working prototype  Motivation In many places, in INDIA like Kalaburagi, people tend to avoid the helmets due to excessive heat and severe irritation and discomfort, resulting from the heat. The country also suffers from rash driving & negligence. Many a time, such negligence by the riders for not using dippers and indicators results in road mishaps. Further we do not have a great accident support system. Hence many a times a rider loses his life because he remains unattended for a long time even after the accident. The major motivation for the work is to address a solution that can keep riders head cool, trigger the indicators automatically when he turns and notifies any authority or relatives when rider meets an accident. Our main goal is to save millions of lives that have been lost every year, not using the helmet, not using the indicators. Introduction Street car/bike accidents take the lives of about 1.3 million consistently and harm 20-50 million more on the planet. Refusal to utilize legitimate cruiser protective caps is among the fundamental variable adding to pass from street crashes - WHO said this in its report on 'Decade of Action for Road Safety '2010-2011'. All the more exasperatingly, an extensive number of passing from street mischances are borne by helpless Street clients, for example, people on foot, cyclists and motorcyclists. Around 13% of the casualties from street related passing are people on foot in India when contrasted with 15% of mischances from traveller cars, autos and taxis and 27% from riders of mechanized two-or-three wheelers. So in the event that it can be made required to make the general people wear the protective cap when they ride the bike then the rates of these mishaps can be relied upon to fall. Overall most governments have officially made stringent laws with respect to wear the protective cap. In any case, regardless of the laws such cases are still on an ascent due to the absence of legitimate execution. As of recently just the laws have been shaped however no mechanical work has been done in such manner. This is a circumstance we see in our everyday life, a considered discovering some answer for determination this issue we concocted this thought of giving the data about the mishap at the earliest opportunity and in TIME….!! Because after record-breaking matters a great deal, if everything is done in time, at any rate we can spare a large portion of the lives that are lost because of bike mischances. Considering three main considerations for keeping away from the mishap causes, for example, Make wearing the protective cap mandatory. Avoid drink and drive. If an individual is met with a mischance and if nobody is there to help him. Rather than basically leaving or overlooking the individual he may bite the dust (Die). In such circumstance, advising to an emergency vehicle or relatives through smart phone to safeguard him to a degree. In this work, we exhibit the configuration of the model we redesigned the head protector cap with Peltier module and GPS. With stock incorporated into head protector, agreeable temperature can be kept up in the cap by utilizing the Peltier module which deals with the premise of thermoelectric impact. In the event of street mishaps the exact area of the rider can be followed out utilizing GPS framework and gives the message to crisis vehicle. Also if any draining of blood happen can be coagulated by the thermoelectric module with the goal that individual can be safeguarded from basic conditions.     Problem  Few of the past works have proposed various embedded based solutions for helmets. Most of the past solutions adapt GPRS for generating the notification. One of the major problems with SMS (GSM) and web (GPRS) based notification is that the messaging is costly and secondly the web protocol is multitudes of time slower in comparison to M2M protocols being offered by IoT. Also, most of the past works are based on microcontroller architecture which has a serious limitation as far as parallel programming is concerned. Therefore parallel monitoring and controlling of the temperature, accident and indicators becomes very slow in the context of real time scenario. This problem can be addressed by replacing GPRS with IoT gateway, microcontroller with powerful microprocessors and using low latency sensors over conventional sensors. The challenge of fast communication, scalable messaging, channelling of the messages and alarm and better event trigger is solved by the proposed solution. We use Intel Edison with Arduino compatible extension board to increase the speed of prototyping. We used Wi-fi connectivity to connect the IoT board with internet. We have used I2C based Accelerometer sensor, which has got significant performance improvement over serial communication based on conventional Accelerometers. The notification system puts the data into Google cloud through which it can be channelled to other platforms like Facebook, Twitter through IFTTT’s cloud based event and message routing. We have also used MQTT protocol which betters the response time of both web services and http. As MQTT from core offers QOAS support, the delivery of every packet with optimal latency is guaranteed. The detailed architecture of the proposed system is explained in detail in the methodology section.    Highlights The objective of the work is to offer cutting edge near real time solution for road safety, head comfort, riding assistance to a rider through a smart helmet powered by new generation IoT processors and protocol structures. The overall objective can be summarized into below specifics. Maintaining a comfortable temperature for the rider and in case of head injury due to an accident, to accelerate the blood clotting process by rapidly reducing the temperature of the Peltier module. Besides this locating the precise location(civic address) of the rider in case of an accident and at the same time intimating it to a preset mobile number and also since the data is collected through the cloud via MQTT ,the real time civic address will be broadcasted to social media applications like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail etc via an IFTTT application to address it to the family members. Based on the movement of the head of a rider for certain duration, this device actuates indicators placed on helmet sensed by the Groove accelerometer sensor.       Specifications Hardware Specifications Intel Edison Arduino  Compatible Breakout board for Intel Edison Sensors(Vibration, Accelerometer Peltier module with Heat Sink 12v External power supply/ Mobile Power Bank Internet Connectivity(Wi-Fi), 3G Android Mobile (Android version 4.0 and above) SeedStudio Groove Kit   Software Specifications Linux Yocto Operating System for Edison Node.js IDE: Intel XDK IoT edition Language: JavaScript ( Node.js) PuTTY IP Gateway:  IFTTT  protocols: MQTT.SMTP Client IDE: Android Studio     Components In this section we will elaborate about the sensors and other components being used in this project   Grove Peizo Vibration Sensor  - For Accident detection You can learn more about the sensor in this wiki link     Grove temperature Sensor - For temperature detection and triggering cooling unit Grove temperature sensor is an electronic grove device that is basically used to sense the temperature changes in the surrounding. The Grove-Temperature Sensor utilizes a thermistor to identify the encompassing temperature. The resistance of a thermistor will be increment when the encompassing temperature diminishes. It's this trademark we use to compute the surrounding temperature. The recognizable scope of this sensor is -40 - 125ºc, and the precision is ±1.5ºc Following are the specifications of the sensor: Voltage: 3.3 ~ 5v Max power rating at 25 ºc:300mW Zero power resistance: 10KΩ Operating temperature range:-40 to 125 ºc 3-Axis Accelerometer -  For Head movement detection and automatic indication The 3-axis Accelerometer grove device basically uses a MMA7660FC and Digital Output I2C. This Grove device is basically applied for sensing the changes in the data, production direction and motion recognition via an interrupt pin (INT). This module uses less power and has a lower profile capacitive MEMS sensing element. Following are the features of the 3-axis accelerometer sensor: Grove compatible interface Axis motion/orientation sensing Digital Output (I2C) 10,000g shock survival RoHS/WEEE lead-free compliant 5V DC input Grove Relay -  For switching the Peltier module                                                                                            The Grove-Relay module is a computerized typically open switch. Through it, we can control circuit of high voltage with low voltage, say 5V on the controller. There is a pointer LED on the board, which will illuminate when the controlled terminals get shut. In my work the use of Grove relay is to switch on the Peltier module or the fan when the value of the temperature rises above some threshold value set. It will be triggered by the MCU. Specifications Operating voltage: 3.3V~5V Operating current:100mA Relay Life:100,000 Cycle Max switching voltage:250VAC/30VDC Max switching current:5A Grove RGB LCD Backlight -  For display (Ok, IoT device doesn't look good without a display :) ) This Grove empowers you to set the shading to whatever you like by means of the basic and compact Grove interface. It takes I2C as specialized strategy for the microcontroller. So the number of pins required for information trade and backdrop illumination control contracts from ~10 to 2, diminishing IOs for other testing errands. Moreover, Grove - LCD RGB Backlight underpins user characterized characters. In my work, it is basically used to display the live temperature information with the green colour and once when the temperature rises above the threshold value it changes it colour to red and starts blinking. Similarly it displays the state of the rider. In case if the rider meets with an accident it changes it colour to red and starts blinking. Specifications Vcc Voltage: 5V I/O Voltage: 3.3/5V Operating Current<60mA CGROM: 10880 bit CGRAM: 64*8 bit Colorful RGB Backlight Built-in English and Japanese fonts I2C communication, uses only two IOs Automatic power-on reset   Peltier Module Peltier is a  thermoelectric effect (TEE) device where thermal properties can be controlled using electrical signal. Basically there are two effects they are : Peltier effect Seebeck effect TE coolers, TE heaters and heat pumpers are all the devices that work on TEE and all these devices are referred to as the Peltier Effect. Peltier device is not a heat absorber. Rather it’s a heat driver. The heat that is driven out from the cooler side is accumulated on the hotter side of the device and it has to be debauched in one or the other way. Otherwise the device the device may tend to stop working and it may tend to increase the temperature at the cooler side which is practically not feasible.[Wiki] Heat Sink The heat dropper has to be taken as an essential part of the pettier device for cooling purpose. All its performance distinctiveness of the Peltier module change as the utility of the heat dropper temperature. Hence the ultimate heat droppers should have a capability of sponging in unlimited quantity of heat exclusive of increasing the device temperature. In general, we need to consider a heat dropper that can soak up the entire residual heat of the device and help in not increasing the temperature above the acceptable point. Hence in practice we can use a heat dropper that can increase the temperature of the device in the series of 5 to 15 ºC higher than the bearable temperature that is sensible. Operating Voltage: Utmost 13.5V. Voltage can be in both the directions. The only change is that the face that will rise in temperature or cool in temperature. Rating: Utmost 4.4 amps Power: Utmost 36 watts Temperature change: Utmost 59ºC at the normal temperature of 30ºC and with no stack. Number of p-n junctions: 127 Footprint: 4 cm x 4 cm Thickness: 4mm Weight: 28 grams Module Factory Number: TEC1-12704 The ground of the Peltier module is connected to one contact of the relay. When the temperature sensor reaches the threshold value set say 30ºC then the sensor will trigger the MCU to supply power to the grove relay switch and hence completing the circuit and allowing the base current to flow and hence switching the Peltier module to start cooling inside the helmet and hence providing the comfortable temperature for the rider. Design Block Diagram     Intel Edison will be connected with a pelting module through transistor as a switch. Peter is a temperature cooling solution that is driven by a 12v power supply. The supply will be given by a 12v battery pack. The ground of the poultice will be connected to one of the input of the grove relay. When the MCU provides supply to the relay and triggers it. This will activate pettier and trigger cooling. MCU will keep monitoring temperature through Grove temperature measurement sensor. When the inside temperature is high, the poultice will be activated using the method mentioned in step2. MCU will be integrated with Cloud through MQTT IoT gateway. Rider’s mobility will be integrated with the cloud using MQTT gateway. The mobile will keep on tracking the GPS data which will be sent back to Google cloud to obtain Civic Address for the latitude, longitude GPS data. MCU will keep tracking of the impact through Grove vibration sensor. In case of an accident, the sensor will generate a signal which will trigger a notification.GPS civic address with this notification will be pushed to the cloud. This can then mitigate the notification to Facebook/Twitter or any other channel through IFTTT gateway. Accelerometer will monitor the movement of the head. When the rider is looking at right/left for a long time, in helmet indicator can be triggered.     Circuit Schematic   Sequence Diagram Algorithm     Actor Edison

This collegiate ambiance touched everything, from the ways in which decisions were made and respect allocated, right down to sophomoric pranks and styles of dress. There's a fairly obvious reason for this, or at least for some of it: Microcomputers were a new field, ripe for rapid advances, and that's a situation that fits neatly into a collegial atmosphere in which information is openly shared. When discoveries are freely shared, it's easier to build quickly on those discoveries; conversely, when progress is rapid, there is less reason to hold onto yesterday's discoveries. This natural synergy between rapid progress and information sharing is one key factor in the spectacular growth in the use and acceptance of computers over the past 20 years. It's one of the reasons that the personal-computer revolution really has been a revolution. In time, companies like Apple and Microsoft would emphasize this synergy, explicitly calling their corporate headquarters "campuses." Even today, computer hardware and software companies often have a lot of the look and feel of grad school. But this predilection for a collegial atmosphere predates Apple and Microsoft. And while it didn't start there either, it was nowhere more evident in the early days than at one of the first personal-computer software companiesDigital Research. Digital Research could hardly have been anything but collegial: The company that gave personal computers their first operating system was the brainchild of a perpetual academic and born teacher. His name was Gary Kildall. Seattle Gary Kildall seemed fated to be a teacher. His uncle would later claim that it was what Gary had always wanted. Teaching certainly was in his blood: The Kildall family actually owned and operated a small college. More precisely, it was a school for the teaching of navigation, based in Seattle, Washington. The Kildall College of Nautical Knowledge, the family called it; it was founded in 1924 by Gary's grandfather. Many Kildalls taught or worked at the school, including Gary himself, for a while, after graduating from high school. But he had decided that year that he was going to be a math teacher, so he enrolled at the University of Washington. Newly married to high-school sweetheart Dorothy McEwen, he buckled down and applied himself to his studies, trying to put a childhood of mediocre grades, fast cars, and pranks behind him. Somewhere along the way to a math degree he got hooked on computers. On finishing his degree, Gary went on to graduate school in computer science. He was still headed for a career in teaching, only now it would be teaching computer science at one of the few colleges that had programs back then. But there was a hitch. He had joined the Naval Reserve, and it was the '60s, with the Vietnam war in full flower. The Navy gave him a choice: Go to Vietnam or take a faculty position at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Gary thought about it for a microsecond and chose Monterey. Even when the Navy told him what to do, the answer was the same: Teach. Monterey It was in Monterey that Gary created CP/M, the program that brought him success and that became the unquestioned standard operating system throughout the microcomputer industry. CP/M was a good product and deserved, for many technical reasons, to be the standard. But getting there first always helps, too. And CP/M actually appeared a year before the first commercial microcomputer arrived on the scene. Unlike operating systems before and since, CP/M was not the result of years of research by a team of software engineers. It was, like most software of its time, the invention of one individual. That individual was Gary Kildall, and if chance put Kildall in just the right place at just the right time, you would have to say, in retrospect, that chance chose well. As it did with Bill Gates, chance spoke to Gary Kildall through a note on a college bulletin board, college bulletin boards apparently being the Schwabb's Drug Store of personal-computer fame. The note talked about a $25 "microcomputer," a pretty good deal even at 1972 prices. It was actually describing not a computer but the first microprocessor, the 4004 that Ted Hoff had designed at Intel. Presumably, this note was an advertisement torn from a recent issue of Electronics News. Intel had hired Regis McKenna to write the ad at Hoff's urging. Hoff was convinced that techies would see the virtue of this new device, this general-purpose processor, and urged that it be advertised, extravagantly but not altogether inaccurately, as a "microcomputer." This would make it absolutely clear that it was not just another limited-purpose device, but something fundamentally different. Hoff was sure that engineers and programmers would get it. Kildall got it, literally, sending off his $25 for one of the first Intel 4004 chips. It was 1972. Kildall was busy teaching computer science at the United States Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. He and Dorothy (and son Scotty) had moved into a house in neighboring Pacific Grove. The Seattle natives loved this scenic coastal town, with its laid-back, fog-draped ambiance. The place suited the easy-going professor. Whether in class or among family and friends the lanky, shaggy-maned Kildall spoke with the same soft voice, the same disarming wit. Although he was teaching at a naval installation, he wouldn't have been out of place on any college campus in his customary sport shirts and jeans. When he had a point to make he would often cast about for chalk or a pencil; he was an incurable diagram drawer. Gary was happy in his marriage, happy to be living by the ocean, happy not to have gone to Vietnam, and most definitely happy in his job. He loved teaching, and the work left him time to program. Nothing in his life was preparing him to run a business, to handle a spectacularly successful software company supplying the essential software for hundreds of different computer models in an industry running wild. Everything argued for his staying right where he was forever, teaching and programming. At first, the 4004 seemed to fit in with that scenario. Gary started writing programs for the 4004. His father, up at that little navigation school in Seattle, had always wanted a machine that would compute navigation triangles. Gary made that his project, writing some arithmetic programs to run on the 4004, thinking idly that he might come up with something that his father could use. He was really just fooling around with the device, trying to see how far he could push it, and with what speed and accuracy. Not all that far, he soon learned. The 4 in 4004 meant that the device dealt with data in 4-bit chunksless than a character. Getting anything useful done with it was a pain, and performance was pitiful. Although he was frustrated by the limitations of the 4004, he was fascinated by what it promised. Early in 1972 he visited Intel and was surprised to see how small the microcomputer division (dedicated to the 4004 and the new 8008) was: The company had set aside only a few small rooms for the entire division. Gary and the Intel microcomputer people got along well, though, and he began working there as a consultant on his one free day a week. He spent months programming the 4004 in this day-a-week mode until he "nearly went crazy with it." He realizedand it was a radical idea for the time  that he would never go back to "big" computers again. Which is not to say that he stopped using "big" computers. With both the 4004 and the significantly more powerful 8008 that he soon moved on to, he was doing his development work on a minicomputer, much as Bill Gates and Paul Allen did later in writing software for the breakthrough MITS Altair computer. Like Paul Allen, he wrote programs to simulate the microprocessor on the "big" minicomputer, and used this simulated microprocessor, with its simulated instruction set, to test the programs he wrote to run on the real microprocessor. But unlike Gates and Allen, Gary had the benefit of a development system, essentially a full microcomputer spun out around the microprocessor, so he could try out his work on the real thing as he went along. In a few months he had created a language implementation called "PL/M," a version of the mainframe language PL/I that was significantly more sophisticated than Basic. The Lab As partial payment for his work, Gary received a development system of his own, which he immediately set up in the back of his classroom. This allowed him to combine his new obsession with microcomputers and his love of teaching. The system in the back of the classroom became the Naval Postgraduate School's first  if not the world's first  academic microcomputer lab. And academic it was. This was not just Gary's toy; he used it to teach students about the technology, and encouraged them to explore it. His curious students took him up on it, spending hours after class tinkering with the machine. When Intel upgraded this Intellec-8 from an 8008 to its new 8080 processor and gave Gary a display monitor and a high-speed paper tape reader, he and his students were working with a system comparable tofavorably comparable tothe early Altair computer before the Altair was even conceived. Gary realized, though, that he was missing an essential ingredient of a really useful computer system  an efficient storage medium. In the early '70s, paper tape was one of the standard storage media, along with the infamous punched card. Neither was very efficient, and the issue was particularly critical on microcomputer systems because the relatively slow microprocessors couldn't offset the inherent slowness of the mechanical process of punching holes in pieces of paper. IBM had recently introduced a new storage medium that was much faster and more efficient. It was based on the existing technology of recording data as patterns of magnetization on large rapidly spinning disks, a medium that had everything going for it except price. But IBM engineers figured out how to scale down this technology to something smaller and more affordable, creating the floppy-disk drive. One $5 floppy disk held as much data as a 200-foot spool of paper tape, and a floppy-disk drive could be had for around $500. The combination of the microprocessor and the floppy disk drive meant that, in Kildall's words, "It was no longer necessary to share computer resources." In other words, the elements of a personal computer were at hand. Well, most of the elements. Gary soon found that some important components were still annoyingly missing. By this time, an industry was developing to create these floppy-disk drives in volume, and Shugart was the pioneer of this industry. Once again, Gary traded some programming for some hardware, getting himself (and the microcomputer lab) a Shugart disk drive. But for the disk drive to work with the Intellec-8, another piece of hardware was needed, a controller board that fit in the Intellec-8 and handled the complicated communication between the computer and disk drive. This piece of hardware, unfortunately, did not exist. Gary tried his hand more than once at building the controller. When that proved more challenging than he expected, he explored the idea of using a different magnetic medium  ordinary audio tape, mounted on a conventional tape recorder. His efforts in interfacing a tape recorder with the Intellec-8 were no more successful than his efforts to build a disk controller. It soon became clear that his considerable programming expertise was no substitute for the hardware knowledge needed to build a device that would connect the Intellec-8 with an efficient storage device. It is worth noting that Kildall was well ahead of his time: When MITS, IMSAI, and other companies began marketing microcomputers, they began with paper-tape or magnetic-tape storage. It would be several years yet before disk drives came into common use on microcomputers. Finally, in 1973, admitting hardware defeat, Gary turned to an old friend from the University of Washington, John Torode. Torode would later found his own computer company, but in 1973, he was just doing a favor for his old friend. "John," Gary said, "we've got a really good thing going here if we can just get this drive working." Torode got the drive working. Entrepreneur Meanwhile, Gary found himself involved with another hardware engineer on another microprocessor-based project. This project, for all its apparent frivolousness, was the first hint of any genuine commercial ambitions on the part of Gary Kildall. The project was the ill-fated Astrology Machine. Ben Cooper was a San Francisco hardware designer who had worked with George Morrow on disk systems and later would, like Torode, start his own computer company, Micromation. In the early '70s, he thought he could build a commercially successful machine to cast horoscopes, and he enlisted Gary's help. The business was not a success  "a total bust," Gary later called it. Still, the Astrology Machine gave Gary the first field test of several programs he had written and rewritten over the past months: a debugger, an assembler, and part of an editor. He also wrote a Basic interpreter that he used to program the Astrology Machine. Since, for Gary, there was little distinction between his academic work and his commercial or consulting work, he passed on the tricks he came up with to his students. He passed the tricks he came up with in writing the Basic interpreter on to a young naval officer named Gordon Eubanks (today, president and CEO of Symantec). All the programs, with the exception of the interpreter, became part of the disk operating system he was writing to control the controller that Torode was building. 1 2 3 Next Related Reading News Commentary News Google's Data Processing Model Hardens Up Applause Launches Mobile Beta Management Docker Clocks In On Azure Sencha Licks Android 5.0 Lollipop, And LikesMore News» Commentary Application Intelligence For Advanced Dummies AppGyver AppArchitect 2.0 Appears JetBrains Upsource 1.0 Final Release Thriving Among the APIsMore Commentary» Slideshow Video Slideshow Developer Reading List Jolt Awards: The Best Books C++ Reading List Developer Reading ListMore Slideshows» Video IBM Mobile Developer Challenge Stephen Wolfram Interview IBM Watson Developers Cloud Open Source for Private CloudsMore Videos» Most Popular Most Popular Hadoop: Writing and Running Your First Project iOS Data Storage: Core Data vs. SQLite Lambdas and Streams in Java 8 Libraries Building GUI Applications in PowerShellMore Popular» More Insights White Papers The Role of the WAN in Your Hybrid Cloud Infographic: Challenges in Managing a Hybrid Cloud More >> Reports Will IPv6 Make Us Unsafe?

AMD's CPUs and GPUs were cheaper, but they always seemed to lag behind Intel and Nvidia in terms of architecture and power efficiency. Image source: AMD investor presentation. Between 2005 and 2015, AMD's annual revenue dropped from $5.85 billion to $3.99 billion. During that same period, Intel's annual revenue rose 43% and Nvidia's revenue more than doubled. AMD lost nearly 70% of its market value over the past decade and went through three CEOs before Lisa Su took over in late 2014. But under Su, AMD recently scored a major victory during its second quarter by achieving its first period of annual sales growth since the second quarter of 2014. Sales rose 9% to $1.03 billion during the quarter, beating estimates by about $75 million. AMD expects that growth to continue with about 18% sales growth for the third quarter. That news lifted AMD stock to four-year highs. AMD survives by expanding into niche markets Over the past few years, AMD realized that attacking Intel and Nvidia head-on was futile, since both companies had superior cash flows and higher R&D and marketing budgets. Instead, AMD pivoted toward certain niche markets which its rivals had overlooked. In 2013, it scored design wins with Sony and Microsoft to respectively power the PS4 and Xbox One with its semi-custom APUs -- which combine the functions of a CPU and GPU on a single SoC (system on chip). It also supplied the GPU for Nintendo's Wii U, which effectively locked Nvidia out of the eighth generation of gaming consoles. All powered by AMD. Image source: Company websites. Sales of semi-custom SoCs for consoles became a pillar of growth for AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which generated 58% of its sales last quarter. Revenue at the unit rose 5% annually and operating income more than tripled to $84 million. That growth offset an $81 million operating loss at its computing and graphics business. Looking ahead, the EESC business will likely get a boost from new updated consoles like Sony's PS4 Neo and Microsoft's Xbox One S and Scorpio. AMD also sees niche growth potential in data centers, a market which Intel dominates with its Xeon processors. Instead of competing against Intel with x86 CPUs for high-end servers, AMD has started shipping ARM licensed chips for lower-end servers. To complement that move, AMD formed a joint venture with Chinese firm THATIC earlier this year to develop SoCs for the Chinese server market. It also formed another joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics to expand its ATMP (assembly, test, mark, and pack) capabilities in China. AMD could benefit from the growth of virtual reality Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that the fledgling virtual reality market could grow from practically nothing today to $30 billion by 2020. That growth could benefit AMD in two major ways. When the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were launched earlier this year, consumers had to buy a $1,000 PC to use the headsets. Since the Rift costs $600 and the Vive costs $800, VR remained a hobby for rich tech enthusiasts instead of mainstream consumers. However, AMD recently lowered the price of VR-ready PCs considerably with its $200 RX 480, the cheapest VR-capable card on the market. Current PC builds using the RX 480 have reduced the price of a VR-ready PC to just $600. The Rift and Vive currently depend on the PC's GPU power, but companies will likely launch stand-alone headsets which aren't tethered to desktops in the near future. Like gaming consoles, these devices will run better on efficient semi-custom APUs instead of stand-alone CPUs and GPUs. AMD's market-dominating position in semi-custom APUs for consoles gives it a major advantage in this market. Don't call it a "turnaround" just yet... Posting 9% sales growth might not seem like a huge victory, but it's certainly AMD's biggest win of the year so far. However, investors shouldn't ignore three upcoming challenges that could derail AMD's turnaround. First, Nvidia's new GTX cards offer a lot of power for just a little more cash. The new GTX 1060, for example, offers better performance than the RX 480 for just $50 more. Second, AMD must prove that its Zen x86 chips, which will arrive at the end of the year, can effectively compete against Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake and stop the bleeding at its CPU business. Lastly, Nintendo has reportedly selected Nvidia's Tegra to power its upcoming NX console, which will likely arrive next March. If the NX is a surprise hit like the original Wii, it could hurt sales of the PS4 and Xbox One and AMD's EESC sales. I think AMD's outlook is improving, but I'd be hesitant to call it a "turnaround" until it can overcome those challenges. But if AMD's revenues can continue growing year-over-year for the next few quarters, it could be the start of a major comeback for the beaten-down chipmaker.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

One of the upcoming major advancements is the COM Express Type 7 pinout supporting up to four 10GbE-KR interfaces, making it ideally suited for the new edge node servers required by IoT and Industry 4.0 applications. By 2020, it is expected that data created and copied annually (much of it from IoT, cloud, and big data applications) will increase to around 44 zettabytes. That’s 44 trillion gigabytes. In order to minimize traffic between clients, central clouds, and data centers, data should be processed as close as possible to its place of origin or inquiry location. IoT and Industry 4.0 applications need this decentralized capacity to process sensor and measurement data in real time. In particular, data-intensive video streaming applications need local, virtualized systems with multiple cores and larger caches to achieve the required transcoding performance. This is not only relevant for video-on-demand in the telecom segment, but also for medical and security applications. Another important application for edge servers is deep packet inspection, which ensures data security and optimal quality of service. The structure of the network is thus transformed to an infrastructure which uses high-performance edge node servers distributed over the whole network that perform their functions close to the end user, reducing latency and backbone traffic. A high bandwidth of 10GbE is essential for such appliances. Examples of system-on-chip solutions which provide this performance at a relatively low power consumption of 65 watts or less are the Intel Xeon processor D family and the Intel Atom processor C family. ARM designs are also interesting, such as the recently launched AMD Opteron A1100 ARM processor and various PowerPC platforms, such as the QorIQ family from NXP. Developers do not, however, need to decide today which processor is the best platform. They can stay flexible using the new COM Express specification with Type 7 pinout. [Figure 1 | The new Type 7 pinout provides up to four 10GbE-KR ports for bandwidth- and data-intensive designs.] The new Type 7 pinout One of the most fundamental innovations of the COM Express Type 7 pinout is the support of up to four 10GbE interfaces, essential for the next generation of edge node appliances. On the module they are implemented as 10GbE-KR, i.e. as single backplane lanes according to IEEE 802.3, paragraph 49. The physical implementation of the 10GbE interfaces takes place on the carrier board itself. Developers can define the signal transmission as optical (SFP+), copper cable (T). This provides flexibility for new designs. [Figure 2 | The new Type 7 pinout provides up to 4x 10GbE-KR for bandwidth- and data-intensive designs.] To a large degree, the Type 7 pinout follows that of Type 6. To create the capacity for up to four 10GbE interfaces, the signal lines of the digital display interfaces (DDIs) on the CD connector of the Type 6 pinout are used. Since most new edge node appliances do not require high-resolution, multi-screen outputs, multiple DDI interfaces are not needed for these applications. For local management and maintenance consoles, the eDP/LVDS interface is still available and located on the AB connector. If developers wish to retain DDI, a hybrid solution with 2x 10GbE and a DDI interface will be supported by the specification. Together with the eDP/LVDS interface on the AB connector, solutions that offer both high network and video performance are also possible. No change is expected to the existing 1 GbE port on the Type 6 AB connector. However, there are discussions on expanding this port to 10GbE, including the physical definition and PHY for 10GBASE-T. This matter can only be decided when conventional non-server processors such as the Intel Core processor family have comprehensively integrated 10GbE including PHY, which is not likely to take place before 2018. 1U with up to 10 modules With COM Express Type 7, the benefits of the COM Express specification are made available to new, high-bandwidth, data-intensive edge node server applications. Thanks to the core-module design concept and standardized pinout, system design becomes independent of processor technology. Systems can be upgraded with a simple module exchange. And thanks to its compact dimensions, COM Express modules enable a high packing density: 10 modules can be integrated in a 1U enclosure, providing a maximum combined data transfer rate of 0.4 terabits per second. The modular COM Express design makes this type of solution highly flexible and scalable, minimizes development costs, and shortens time-to-market. OEMs also gain more design security and can use their designs for longer, thereby increasing their return on investment. [Figure 3 | ADLINK COM Express Type 7 block diagram. Check the ADLINK website for updated product information.] Further upgrades ADLINK has played a leading role in the PICMG subcommittee that is currently defining the new COM Express 3.0 specification. The new specification, which benefitted from the technical contributions of several key PICMG member companies, is expected to become available at the end Q2 2016, with the Type 7 CD connector pin assignment expected to be released at the end of Q1 to allow vendors to begin working on new designs. The COM Express Rev. 3.0 specification will include both the new Type 7 pinout as well as expected changes to existing pinout types to address minor issues and to migrate from the legacy LPC bus to the eSPI bus. The group is also trying to achieve greater unification on the AB connector between the existing Type 6 and Type 10 pinouts in order to simplify design considerations for manufacturers. Jeff Munch, Chief Technology Officer of ADLINK, has been Chairman of most PICMG COM Express subcommittees since 2009. In this role he has headed the last five of seven COM Express initiatives, including COM Express Type 7, and has brought together companies such as Advantech, Congatec, Kontron, MSC/Avnet and Intel.

The first reports about the issue appeared on the Avast forums on the 3rd of August, when the Windows 10 Anniversary Update was released. The antivirus company discovered that the issue is related to Intel Skylake CPUs and released a first emergency patch the next day after Windows 10 Anniversary update was released. The company also made modifications to the online installation application. The culprit was an Avast driver that didn’t properly work together with Intel Skylake CPUs with Intel Virtualization Technology (Intel VT) enabled. Avast has stated its currently investigating why the issue wasn’t detected earlier. Users of Avast antivirus software who want to use it together with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update are advised to install the antivirus software through the installation downloader tool that requires an internet connection. The offline version of the antivirus versions are updated later and might therefore not contain the appropriate fixes yet. Avast has posted information on their website for users who were affected by the Avast-Skylake issues.

I have a pretty awesome gaming rig that I love and am a fairly savvy enthusiast but it has me stumped. My system consists of a Giga Z68XP-UD3, i7 3770k with an Intel closed-loop water cooler, 16GB GSkill DDR3 1866mhz, a Thermaltake Toughpower 850w Gold PSU, a Giga 980Ti Xtreme, a 128GB Sata SSD boot drive, 2 X 2TB Seagate storage drives with one of them (the one games are installed on) using a 64GB SSD as an Intel Rapid Storage Technology cache drive, all enclosed in a white Corsair 760T, and an Acer CB280HK 4K monitor. Im providing as much detail as I can to assist in the troubleshooting! (Haven't updated my sig for a while by the way) Recently, at very intermittent times, the system will just, without any warning, turn itself off. Most often its while playing a game, but it has happened while browsing the web and on the desktop. Its so random that I cannot work out where the problem lies. I have looked in Windows reliability history which just shows the computer was shut down incorrectly. I also changed the Startup and Recovery setting where on system failure the PC should not automatically shutdown, hoping for a blue screen to see an error message. The system still just turns off randomly and without warning. Plus, I cant find the dump file its supposed to create. I have also tried using the second PCI-E slot for my GPU, running with peripherals removed, removing RAM sticks, but it still occurs. I havent tried using the integrated graphics yet (cant bring myself to!), but I suppose I should? The GPU is only about 9 months old  I know problems can still happen though. Its very intermittent and I have been getting by, but I would like to know where the problem is so that if I upgrade my motherboard, RAM, and CPU combo, it wont still happen! I dont think its the PSU because its only a couple of years old, gold rated and pretty good quality. I was, however, running 2 X R9 290s on it for a while which may have pushed it to limits, but its now on a much more efficient single 980Ti, and the system still boots fine and so on. So Im personally thinking its the motherboard as its the oldest component, and it was fairly budget to start with. But its so random that I dont know if its a corrupt sector, RAM issue, processor problem, argh! Im looking at upgrading my motherboard, RAM and CPU anyway but again, Id like to not have the problem occur again if I do. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated! Please let me know if you need any more info and I will happily provide it. Im sure theres more I probably need to troubleshoot and provide. I know it's hard so I'm not expecting much, just trying my luck. Thanks guys.

Turns out to be moisture due to the humidity. When the PC was not really in heavy use the humid air cooled down enough so condensation built up. Opened the case, blew a dehumidify into the MB and component area for 20-30 mins while PC was off, A/C full on on dehumid mode. Then PC came back on. Ever since it has no issues so long as he keeps the room fairly dry. The other issue may be PSU or MB going bad due to lighting spikes or surges which had happened to my system about a year ago. Brownout the PSU which was also a Corsair RX850 but it kept going until the MB shorted out. Replaced PSU, CPU, MB and RAM with new parts. Check the cable from the PSU to the MB. Make sure both connectors are super clean and no dark spots. CPU and rest of the parts should / would not burn out due to all the power regulation on the MB. The MB would go before the other parts.

How Fast Is It? linux-on-windows-dustin-kirkland-firefly.jpg Canonical developer Dustin Kirkland is a space cowboy on the great Ubuntu-on-Windows frontier. Used with permission My primary laptop is a Lenovo x250, with an Intel i7-5600U CPU, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB Transcend SSD, and a 2TB Samsung SSD.  Let’s run some benchmarks on the CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network. We’ll first run each test in Ubuntu running natively on the hardware, and then reboot, and run the same benchmarks on the same machine running Ubuntu on Windows. We’ll use the utilities sysbench, dd and iperf, as well as compile the Linux kernel to do our benchmarking.  If you want to reproduce these tests, you may need to: sudo apt install sysbench iperf CPU To execute our CPU benchmark, we ran the following: sysbench --num-threads=4 --test=cpu run And, we see almost identical results!  Basically 2.8 seconds to run 10,000 CPU instructions, in both cases (Ubuntu on Windows was ever so slightly faster, in fact, in these runs).  For CPU bound workloads, Ubuntu on Windows should perform just as well as Ubuntu running natively on hardware: Memory To execute our Memory benchmark, we ran the following: sysbench --num-threads=4 --test=memory run Here, we’re moving 100G of data through memory.  Native Ubuntu was able to move data through memory at 4,253 MB/s, while Ubuntu on Windows worked at 2,309 MB/s.   This difference exposes a bit of a difference in the IO performance of the two systems.  When dealing in heavy IO, Ubuntu on Windows does involve a bit more overhead. Disk For our disk performance test, we ran the following command: dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1G count=1 oflag=dsync Basically, we’re writing a 1GB file of zero’s, synchronously, to disk.  Interestingly, the native Ubuntu test yields about 147 MB/s average write speed to disk, while the Ubuntu on Windows environment average 248 MB/s write speed to disk!  How is that possible?  Well, it’s a bit of trickery on the Windows part.  The flag that we’re sending the dd command, oflag=dsync, is supposed to guarantee synchronous writes to disk -- ensuring that every single byte is in fact written to disk and not cached in a buffer in memory.  While we used that same flag on the Windows test, it seems that Windows doesn’t yet know what to do with that flag.  It seems pretty clear that the Ubuntu on Windows writes are not entirely synchronous to disk.   Network Next, we’ll test network throughput.  Specifically, we’re testing TCP bandwidth, using the iperf utility.  I’m running an iperf server on an Ubuntu machine hardwired to a Gigabit network: iperf -s And we’re going to connect the iperf client from the native Ubuntu machine, and the Ubuntu on Windows machines: iperf -c The native Ubuntu machine averaged 935 Mbps, while the Ubuntu on Windows average 805 Mbps of bandwidth. Linux Kernel Compilation Finally, let’s take a tried and true performance benchmark at every Linux developer is familiar with -- let’s build the kernel!  The beauty of this sort of test is that it includes lots of CPU number crunching (compilation) as well as tons of disk reads (loading libraries and source files) and disk writes (binary output).  It’s much closer to “real world” use cases than some of the academic benchmarks we’ve run above. To reproduce these tests, you’ll need to: sudo apt install git build-essential git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git cd linux make defconfig time make -j 4 Note that we’re using the default configuration for the build (defconfig), and we’re telling the compiler to use 4 CPUs (-j 4), since my Intel i7 is dual-core, hyperthreaded. The native Ubuntu build took 5 minutes and 38 seconds, while the Ubuntu on Windows build took 8 minutes 47 seconds.  I discussed this with the Windows developers and they suggested re-running the tests with Windows Defender disabled (just for testing -- don’t do this long term, as Windows Defender detects malware).  I wasn’t able to re-run the test in time to publish this post, but perhaps some of our motivated readers will reproduce the tests here and post their results! Conclusion The Windows Subsystem for Linux is nothing shy of amazing.  Tremendous credit goes to the entire Microsoft team working on this technology.  When coupled with Ubuntu, WSL really shines, bringing tens of thousands of open source utilities directly to the Windows desktop command shell. From a performance perspective, CPU and Network bound processes will perform nearly identically in Ubuntu on Windows, as native Ubuntu on bare metal.  For heavily cached disk IO operations, Ubuntu on Windows might even outperform native Ubuntu on bare metal.  But for heavily randomized reads and writes, and memory heavy operations, Ubuntu on Windows does introduce a bit of overhead that might be noticeable in some developer workloads. In any case, Ubuntu on Windows is a fantastic bridge between two worlds.  Two worlds, that will learn a lot from one another.  I’m proud to live in a new world where those two worlds are one.

News & Analysis Big Three Chipmakers Likely to Boost Capex Alan Patterson 8/8/2016 08:01 AM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet TAIPEI — The big three chipmakers — Intel, Samsung and TSMC — are likely to increase capital expenditures during the second half of this year while the rest of the semiconductor industry tightens the belt, according to a market research firm. The top-three companies will probably spend $20 billion for capex, representing a 90 percent increase from the first half of 2016, IC Insights said in a report emailed to EE Times on August 4. The companies will need to boost spending later this year to meet full year capex targets, according to the Scottsdale, Arizona-based company. “In contrast to the ‘Big 3’ spenders, capital outlays by the rest of the semiconductor suppliers are forecast to shrink by 16 percent in the second half of this year as compared to the first half,” the IC Insights report said. “In total, 2016 second-half semiconductor industry capital spending is expected to be up 20 percent over first-half 2016 outlays, setting up a busy period for semiconductor equipment suppliers through the end of this year.” The boost in spending is likely to widen the technology gap between the big three chipmakers and their smaller competitors. Samsung, Intel and TSMC are so far the only semiconductor companies to have announced plans to ramp up production of geometries in the 10nm range and adopt EUV lithography in the next few years. Combined, the big three spenders are forecast to account for 45 percent of the total semiconductor industry outlays this year, according to IC Insights. A table of each company’s actual spending during the first half this year and IC Insight’s capex forecast is as follows: (Chart: IC Insights) Click here for larger image In total, IC Insights forecasts that semiconductor industry capital spending will increase by only 3% this year after declining by 2% in 2015. With many chipmakers moving to fab-lite business models and continued growth in fabless companies, wafer foundries have gone from representing just 12% of total industry capex spending in 2008 to what is expected to be 34% of worldwide capital outlays in 2016, according to IC Insights.  Flash memory is the second largest industry segment for capex, projected to account for about 16% ($15.7 billion) of the total expenditures in 2016, the company added. —Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 August 2016 | MYT 10:30 AM AMD hopes to redeem itself with focus on virtual reality by thomas lee Banking on VR: AMD wants to move beyond gaming to corporate uses of VR, especially in industries like retail, health care and education. — Reuters There was a time in the not so distant past when the arrival of a next-generation microchip for a personal computer created as much as buzz as the release of a new iPhone.  But as people shifted from personal computers to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices were left in the dust, grasping for both sales and relevance as companies like Apple and Samsung developed chips.  However, AMD sees a redemption of sorts in virtual reality, an emerging technology that allows a user to seemingly interact with digital 3D images.  If AMD failed to grasp the importance of mobile devices, the Sunnyvale company is determined not to repeat the same mistake with VR. Last year, AMD created a new division, the Radeon Technologies Group, dedicated to developing low-cost graphics cards that can convert a personal computer into a VR video game machine on par with a PlayStation or Xbox console.  More importantly, AMD wants to move beyond gaming to corporate uses of VR, especially in industries like retail, health care and education.  "When we look at the market five or 10 years from now, the world we are going to live in will be surrounded by millions and millions of pixels," said Raja Koduri, a former Apple executive recruited by AMD to run Radeon. "Our vision is that we want to be the engine that powers all of those pixels."  During the 1990s and early 2000s, AMD battled Intel in Santa Clara to produce the best-performing PC chips. It was a fierce if one-sided rivalry, because Intel dominated the PC market. But AMD proved to be a feisty competitor both in the marketplace and the courts, as the two took turns suing each other for copyright infringements and allegations of unfair business practices.  But both companies failed to recognise the growing popularity of mobile devices. As PC sales sunk, so too did the fortunes of the chipmakers, especially AMD. The company's stock now trades around under US$7 (RM28.19) per share, compared with over US$40 (RM161.09) a decade ago.  Last year proved to be particularly tough for AMD. Revenue from computing and graphics, the company's bread-and-butter business, plummeted 42% from 2014 to US$1.8bil (RM7.24bil). As a result, the division reported a loss of US$502mil (RM2.02bil).  But as VR began to take off, AMD saw an opportunity to piggyback its strong reputation in gaming to jump on the new technology. The first step was to create Radeon and hire Koduri away from Apple, where he oversaw graphics.  It seems odd for someone to leave a powerhouse like Apple to join a struggling firm like AMD. But Koduri told me that AMD is committed to building the best graphics possible, but that Apple didn't give it as much priority.  "At Apple, we only built things internally when we could find it externally," Koduri said. Co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs "was like a chef that assembled the best meal for you, but those ingredients didn't need be in your backyard. AMD, though, is investing in uncharted territory."  Most PCs aren't equipped to run VR video games because they lack the power to process the graphics. So people would need to buy a graphics card that cost US$400 (RM1,610) or more. But in June, AMD introduced a graphics card that costs less than US$200 (RM805).  According to the company, it will provide a VR experience on par with high-end computers and video game consoles – though AMD is competing with the likes of Nvidia, a graphics chipmaker in Santa Clara that has a following among avid video game players and is also counting on virtual reality. AMD's old nemesis, Intel, is also competing hard in the VR space.  Industry surveys suggest that most consumers, beyond the hard-core gamers, are not familiar with VR technology. And while VR games may help boost PC sales, Koduri suggests that AMD is simply using gaming as a springboard to reach businesses in industries like education, health care, and real estate.  Imagine a school using VR to create a science laboratory on a PC screen where students can safely experiment with chemical compounds. Or a home buyer in one state inspecting a house in another state without having to travel. AMD's graphics cards go into PCs, which have "always been the centre for innovation," Koduri said.  By 2025, the VR market for real estate and health care uses could total a combined US$7.7bil (RM31bil), according to a recent report by investment bank Goldman Sachs.  So far, it seems that Wall Street likes AMD's strategy. Since February, AMD stock has more than tripled to US$6.30 (RM25.37) per share.  Graphics cards developed by AMD "are emerging as the choice of several nascent but potentially explosive markets like virtual reality," said Mark Lipacis, an analyst with investment bank Jefferies Group.  If successful, AMD can brag about how it quickly jumped on the VR bandwagon, rather than having to dwell on missing the mobile device train. — San Francisco Chronicle/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Kenya uses new technology to nab poachers at night: WWF Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Lavishing patrons with ‘arty’ delights M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

Sami Peretz Aug 09, 2016 12:26 AM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Finance Minister Kahlon, in 2015. Moving to lower the huge exporters' corporate tax to an especially low 6 percent. Michal Fattal This year’s Israeli high-tech frenzy: $6 billion in six months Israeli high-tech exits reap billions - for investors, not the state Israel's Teva buys top competitor Allergan's generic drug distributor Is Israeli government policy widening the gaps between advanced industries and low-tech companies? Is the government deliberately making life harder for local trading and services firms – and thereby, causing the cost of living in the country to climb? Seems so. Giant export companies with lots of employees are the alpha dog when it comes to government incentives, and if the giant is a multinational that's based overseas, all the better. These are the types of corporate entities – the ones that undertake to export a lot, and also employ a lot – that are boosted by the state through the Investment Encouragement Law. The encouragement takes the form of tax breaks or outright grants, or both. The recipients of such largesse over the years include the likes of Intel, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Israel Chemicals and Check Point Software Technologies. All of them huge, powerful export companies. On top of the candy they have already received, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon is moving to lower their corporate tax to an especially low 6%. Regular corporate tax in the country is 25%, but in practice, many high-tech companies pay less, because of the Investment Encouragement Law (which applies to companies with revenues greater than 10 billion shekels, or about $2.6 billion, a year). They also pay lowered dividend tax of just 4%. It is easy to find rationale for being generous to multinational high-tech companies: The idea is to attract them to Israel. The phrase “high-tech” evokes images of global corporations, international conventions, terrific employment conditions, keyboards being tapped in air-conditioned rooms, exports. It’s easier to envision the future there than in greasy metal workshops or tomato-canning factories. We’d all prefer to see the kids working in gorgeously designed work spaces with free espresso. But most Israelis don’t work in places like that. Last week the chief economist at the treasury reported that the multinationals operating in Israel achieve better productivity than local companies do. It makes sense. The companies that come here are at the forefront of technology, selling advanced products and services. They are highly productive, and would inevitably win in a contest in that realm against virtually “all” Israeli industry, which includes high-tech and low-tech as well. The system of incentives leads to a single conclusion: The state lavishes its largesse mainly on the strong and powerful. There are explanations, some Darwinistic: the strong win, and the winner takes all. If they’re so good at making products or services, they’re probably great at wresting perks from governments, too. They want to make money and the government wants jobs to be created and more exports, and likes the fact that they bump up the quality of the labor force in Israel. Multinationals have alternatives. They don’t have to work in Israel. They need wooing. But wooing them means that the government is neglecting local companies. Absent incentives to grow more efficient and to improve their productivity, the local entities keep lagging behind. Their workers do not improve, and neither does their equipment, resulting in high prices that jack up the cost of living in Israel. Zvi Eckstein, dean at the Interdisciplinary Center, Herzliya, has been pushing for the government to change its policy on prioritizing exporters. He sees no reason to encourage the latter because Israel doesn’t need foreign currency any more (some argue that its foreign currency reserves, approaching $100 billion, are already top-heavy). And favoring the exporters is bad for the local companies and pushes up the cost of living in Israel. It’s like taking a classroom of 40 kids and deciding to invest mainly in only the two brightest ones, leaving the rest of the pack to their own devices. Some would argue that the two brightest merit the investment because they’ll contribute more to the rest by creating prosperous businesses, or managing public systems. Maybe so, but it also means forgoing the option of getting better achievements from the rest, and realizing their potential. So here we bend over backward to court Intel and make sure it operates out of Israel, because it’s an MVP and the figures it generates, in terms of jobs and exports, are very big, and immediately impact the national accounts. The results of the state’s encouragement of Intel are palpable compared with, for instance, a national project to stimulate productivity in thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses. And this neglect carries a price that nobody measures, until it hits us in the form of the high cost of living and meager productivity.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS SEARCH Policy Can California Strike a Balance on Drone Regulation? The popularity of drones poses challenges for policymakers and legislators: How can they minimize the drawbacks of the technology while it’s still under development, without stifling the innovation necessary to make the field grow? by Michael Hiltzik, Los Angeles Times / August 8, 2016 0 flickr/Peter Linehan (TNS) -- Most Californians have probably never heard of DJI Technology, but legislators in Sacramento are hearing its message. Over the last year, the company has sharply ramped up its spending on lobbying in the state capital, moving from zero in the third quarter of 2015 to $155,000 since then. It’s also spending about $200,000 on lobbying in Washington. It’s the largest manufacturer of drones. They’re those buzzy, compact remote-controlled aircraft that have become all the rage among hobbyists and are being eyed by industry and government agencies to perform work that’s too costly, dangerous, or difficult for humans, including the prompt delivery of merchandise, inspection of remote facilities, filming, firefighting and police surveillance. The drone industry emphasizes the potential for expanding the use of unmanned aircraft in arguing for measured regulation or self-regulation. RELATEDCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown Vetoes Drone Regulation BillDrone Regulations Won't Land Until 2017Drones Take Off, but Regulations Remain Grounded Fans and critics of drones alike expect the skies to become very crowded in coming years, as the devices become cheaper and acquire greater capabilities. Shenzhen, China-based DJI, which is reported to command as much as 70% of the drone market, sells its camera-equipped products today for prices ranging from $6,500 to less than $500. Estimates of the drone market vary, but all agree that it’s exploding. At a White House workshop on drone policy Aug. 2, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, whose company produces control circuits for the units, projected that the consumer drone business will be worth $16 billion by 2020, and the commercial market another $4 billion. The Consumer Technology Assn. expects some 700,000 drones to be sold this year. Statistics from the Federal Aviation Administration attest to the growth trend: 520,000 of the devices have been registered with the FAA since it began requiring registration at the beginning of this year of any drones heavier than a half-pound. The number of manned aircraft registered with the FAA is only 320,000 — “and it took us 100 years to get there,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told the White House workshop. The popularity of drones poses challenges for policymakers and legislators, not unlike those posed by other new technologies with obvious benefits and possible dangers, such as self-driving cars: How can they minimize the drawbacks of the technology while it’s still under development, without stifling the innovation necessary to make the field grow? The FAA leaves most drone regulation to state and local authorities, though it does prohibit flying drones higher than 400 feet, within five miles of an airport or after dark, and requires that the devices remain within the line of sight of the users. But government officials have found it almost impossible to keep up with the mushrooming private drone fleet. Of 921 encounters between drones and manned aircraft reported to the FAA from mid-December 2013 to mid-September 2015, more than a third were “close encounters” carrying the possibility of a collision. According to an analysis by the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College, more than 90% occurred above 400 feet. Most also occurred within five miles of an airport.The stakes in these incidents are enormous. Any “collision between a drone and a manned aircraft could lead to a potentially catastrophic incident,” the analysis observed. Some locations that are off-limits to manned aircraft have been bedeviled by drones. That includes the Golden Gate Bridge, which has become such a popular subject of high-flying remote videography — including by a drone that crashed onto the roadway in 2015 — that bridge officials had to post signs warning that drone flights are illegal over the bridge and nearby federal land. More than a dozen bills to regulate drones are awaiting action in the state Legislature. Some resemble three bills that Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed last year that would have prohibited flying the devices over wildfires or other emergency scenes, K-12 schools and prisons or jails. Brown said he vetoed the measures because they criminalized conduct that was already illegal. But he did sign a measure aimed at paparazzi, prohibiting drone flights over private property to make a recording or snap a photo. “The overarching themes of these bills,” says Steven D. Miller, an expert in the emerging field of drone law at the San Francisco law firm Hanson Bridgett, “are safety, security and privacy.” Some, including one measure Brown vetoed, aim to prohibit interference with firefighters or other first responders. They’re a reaction to numerous reports of drones getting in the way of firefighting aircraft; just last month a drone hobbyist was arrested for allegedly flying a drone over the Trailhead fire, which burned 5,600 acres in Placer and El Dorado counties. Other bills aim to grant government officials immunity for destroying or damaging drones that get in their way. Several aim to limit the ability of law enforcement officials to use drones to conduct surveillance. That addresses a key question not yet specifically considered by the courts, Miller observes: “Do police need a search warrant to fly a drone over your backyard?” Lobbying disclosures by drone makers and other companies only hint at the breadth of commercial interest in these devices. Both Amazon and Google have lobbyists watching the drone bills in Sacramento. Google has its eye on bills that would mandate insurance coverage on drones and GPS systems that would prevent drones from entering prohibited airspace. Google hasn’t taken a position on those measures yet, although DJI and GoPro, the camera maker whose devices are often attached to drones, oppose them. California isn’t the first state to ponder drone regulations — 14 states have enacted rules governing some aspect of drone flights. But as a high-tech center, Miller says, “California may be more likely to come up with a creative approach that accommodates innovation.” So far, however, that prospect still lies on the horizon. As my colleague Jazmine Ulloa reported last month, industry is already flexing its muscles to block drone legislation in California, including a bill that would have placed limits on drone use by law enforcement and another that would have expanded no-fly zones around critical infrastructure, private property and parkland. State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) who introduced the latter bill, complained that the technology industry hadn’t been willing to work with her to shape a compromise. The consequence of such blocking-and-tackling is exactly what the drone industry fears most — a patchwork of federal, state and local rules and ordinances to fill what Miller calls “a Wild West void.” “Our interest is in reasonable outcomes and, most important, consistency,” says Brendan Schulman, vice president of policy and legal affairs for DJI. Generally, he says, DJI doesn’t object to measures that simply extend existing prohibitions to drones. The industry supports a proposed measure specifying that restraining orders protecting individuals from stalkers applies to drones flown within the prohibited space. “You shouldn’t be stalking somebody, including with a drone,” he says. But the industry objects to rules that single out drones, say, by requiring special permits for activities that would be otherwise legal. After Brown issued his vetoes last year, the San Diego County community of Poway enacted its own ban on flying drones within the city during emergencies. “Poway has had a bull’s-eye on its back when it comes to wildfires,” Mayor Steve Vaus said then, targeting drone pilots “trying to get footage that they can monetize on YouTube … on the backs of our first responders.” The Los Angeles City Council last year passed an ordinance that resembles FAA rules by prohibiting flights higher than 500 feet, within five miles of an airport or 25 feet of a person, while imposing local punishments of up to $1,000 in fines and up to six months in jail. Drones aren’t going away. That buzzing you hear is just the front edge of a tidal wave. Before it arrives, California legislators should have a single, consistent legal regime in place to protect the public from untrained and heedless remote pilots, and the drone industry should get behind reasonable rules. The first time an accident occurs that demonstrates how lax our oversight is of this emerging industry will be the last time it will have the credibility to sit at the table. ©2016 the Los Angeles Times.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Report: Apple boosted by corporate customers as consumer demand falters By Ethan Baron / August 8, 2016 at 12:34 PM Apple co-founder Steve Jobs sneered at corporate customers, but with iPhone sales dropping and the company’s revenue slipping, business clients have become a key base for the Cupertino firm. Jobs in 2008 demonstrated his contempt for the corporate buyer, referring in a meeting with Intel officials to the position of chief information officer. “Why would I do anything for that orifice called the CIO?” Jobs said, according to Computer Dealer News. Now, however, Apple is increasingly reliant on big-business customers, who occupy a crucial role now that the firm’s phone sales have been slowing down. Last year’s $25 billion in sales of equipment and services to companies and other large customers represented only about 11 percent of total revenue, but also reflected a 40 percent jump over the previous year, compared with 28 percent revenue growth overall for the company, according to The New York Times. “Sales of high-end iPads to business customers in particular have been strong,” the paper reported. “Nearly half of all iPads are now bought by corporations and governments. Companies are turning to Apple’s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. “Aiding Apple’s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google’s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.” The company’s iPhones and iPads “have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets,” the paper reported. And Apple CEO Tim Cook takes a different view of the corporate customer than Jobs. The firm started taking “enterprise” buyers more seriously when people began using their iPhones and iPads at work, Cook told a conference in September, according to Bloomberg. “When the world was bifurcated between consumer and enterprise, we focused on the consumer,” Cook said. “But now if you want a smartphone, you don’t say, ‘I want an enterprise smartphone.’ “Enterprise is a huge opportunity for us.” Photo illustration: An iPhone held up in front of the Apple logo.

Now, with BYOD, IT has to support Macs, iPads and iPhones. Apple wisely partnered with IBM who have been selling support and ‘solutions’ usually on a per user basis. The IT department simply passes IBM’s bill to each department (plus their internal mark-up). Users get the devices they want. IT takes no risk. Apple’s devices are more secure and manageable. Cisco and SAP joined the party more recently. Apple, IBM, Cisco, SAP, and end users all win. TrickyDickie “more secure and manageable” Lol! Matt Perkins iOS devices are proven more secure and easier to use than Android devices. You can be an Android fanboy all you want but the facts are facts. Security Researches all agree iPhones are more secure than Android devices. Hackers all agree iPhones are harder to hack into than Android devices and even Consumer Reports says iPhones offer the best out of box experience compared to Android. So not sure why you’re laughing unless it’s at your own ignorance. William Haynes IBM now sells and makes apps for the SURFACE tablets too. fstein No doubt. Windows and it’s variants must be supported too. AAPL.To.Break.$95.Soon.>:-) How long has it been since Steve Jobs passed away? Do people really think Apple is going to follow his way of doing business forever. Times change and the business has to change with it. When Steve was alive Android didn’t have 85% market share like it does now. All that’s left is poor countries with poorly-paid consumers only wanting to buy the cheapest piece of smartphone they can get their hands on. Apple had better find some other customers willing to pay for their products no matter where they come from. Apple should try as hard as possible to woo the enterprise and maybe the company will eventually lose that doomed reputation. Heck, no one is saying Microsoft or Tesla is doomed, so why should Apple be considered doomed. It would be nice if Apple could take over where BlackBerry used to be. Wall Street once worshipped RIM for having a lock on the enterprise. TrickyDickie “why should Apple be considered doomed?” Because even the fanboys are starting to wake up to their marketing tactics lol CelestialTerrestrial Tim did manage to get IBM and Cisco to promote Apple products in the Enterprise. IBM is now a reseller of Apple products. IBM is a Authorized Service Provider for Apple in the Enterprise. IBM is also a large and growing customer and case study as an Apple customer. Check out the JMAF conference presentation from last year, it’s a pretty good video to watch what IBM did last year and what benefits they are seeing. I think the old CIO mentality has been changing over the years and Apple’s benefitting. It sure doesn’t hurt that Tim is an ex-IBM and ex-Compaq manager with a degree in Industrial Design and an MBA. As brilliant as Jobs was, he really never understood the business world and that’s partly his own fault. He was too busy with the consumer and education space, he forgot who spends the most in IT. plus, IBM had the control and pushing PCs along with every PC clone mfg. So Microsoft benefitted by slapping their OS on anyone’s hardware. The problem is that it’s just flat out more costly to manage from an IT perspective and they forced their users to use Microsoft based OS, and then the employees bought PCs for the home because that’s all they knew. The iPhone really turned a lot of PC users over to Apple, and the Mac business has been increasing since. I think if everyone that has an iPhone were to use Macs, then Mac market share would reach 18% global market, which isn’t too shabby, they currently have only 7 to 8% global. The thing that people STILL can’t wrap their heads around is that if you add up the Net Profits of Microsoft, Google, Samsung, HP Inc., Dell, Lenovo, Acer and ASUS (All of Apple’s biggest competitors for desktops/laptops, smartphones and tablets), Apple makes as much as they do COMBINED. Apparently Apple’s business model works, and these others don’t. Apple only works on a 40% Gross Margin and retains a 20% Net Profit. For those idiots that think that Apple’s products are overpriced… I have one thing to say. NO, Apple’s products are not overpriced. It’s their competitors that are selling their products too cheaply, not managing their inventory/product offering well and they don’t have a strong efficient retail store model that works. If you look at Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc. they just make too damn many products and what happens is they overspend R&D, Support, and most importantly Inventory and they end up discounting them because they not only confuse the customer, but they can’t sell everything they make. It’s called TOO many SKU’s, TOO much inventory, TOO much discounting, and that’s TOO many TOO’s. Going after market share is the DUMBEST thing to do if you go after business that’s not profitable. A big number (customers) multiplied by zero (no profits) is still zero profits. That’s why IBM, Compaq and others got out of the PC industry and sold their businesses to someone dumber than they were. When people say that Android has the biggest market share. Well, yes and no. If you look at the smartphone business of products sold under the MSRP of $400, Apple has no market share, but if you look at the $400+ market, Apple has a pretty damn good market share. It’s just that the there are more people buying the sub-$400 smartphones and those don’t make any profit. They have those Freedom phones for $10, how can anyone make a phone for $10 and make an actual profit? I think the Chinese government has to subsidize a lot of these China based smartphone mfg. that lose money on selling smartphones, but for how long can they do that? I’m surprised there isn’t more fallout in the Android world in terms of Android mfg going out of business.     About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter GMSV     Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Older Silicon Valley techies pushed out onto the ice floes… Apple admits to iPhone ‘touch disease,’ blames… Donald Trump says he and Tim Cook talked Apple… Crucial Silicon Valley H-1B visa issue unclear under Trump Why did Oracle’s co-CEO Safra Catz visit Trump?     Archives Archives Select Month November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2016 Bay Area News Group.

Could perhaps Intel media engine somehow be used remote management? Since the uefi bios has a "Asrock remote support" button available I suspect there is a more advance tool somewhere that I could use. At the moment it feel like my PC is running a secret admin system which I has absolutely no way of accessing. Any advanced tools out there that you could share? What Im also trying to get my head around is how Windows 10 pro treats this motherboard and sets it up, I want to learn all there is so if you have any input here I would appreciate it.   Log in Register Full Site Top Powered by vBulletin® Copyright © 2016 vBulletin Solutions, Inc.

Jobs in 2008 demonstrated his contempt for the corporate buyer, referring in a meeting with Intel officials to the position of chief information officer. “Why would I do anything for that orifice called the CIO?” Jobs said, according to Computer Dealer News. Now, however, Apple is increasingly reliant on big-business customers, who occupy a crucial role now that the firm’s phone sales have been slowing down. Last year’s $25 billion in sales of equipment and services to companies and other large customers represented only about 11 percent of total revenue, but also reflected a 40 percent jump over the previous year, compared with 28 percent revenue growth overall for the company, according to The New York Times. “Sales of high-end iPads to business customers in particular have been strong,” the paper reported. “Nearly half of all iPads are now bought by corporations and governments. Companies are turning to Apple’s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. “Aiding Apple’s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google’s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.” The company’s iPhones and iPads “have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets,” the paper reported. And Apple CEO Tim Cook takes a different view of the corporate customer than Jobs. The firm started taking “enterprise” buyers more seriously when people began using their iPhones and iPads at work, Cook told a conference in September, according to Bloomberg. “When the world was bifurcated between consumer and enterprise, we focused on the consumer,” Cook said. “But now if you want a smartphone, you don’t say, ‘I want an enterprise smartphone.’ “Enterprise is a huge opportunity for us.” Photo illustration: An iPhone held up in front of the Apple logo.

Now, with BYOD, IT has to support Macs, iPads and iPhones. Apple wisely partnered with IBM who have been selling support and ‘solutions’ usually on a per user basis. The IT department simply passes IBM’s bill to each department (plus their internal mark-up). Users get the devices they want. IT takes no risk. Apple’s devices are more secure and manageable. Cisco and SAP joined the party more recently. Apple, IBM, Cisco, SAP, and end users all win. TrickyDickie “more secure and manageable” Lol! Matt Perkins iOS devices are proven more secure and easier to use than Android devices. You can be an Android fanboy all you want but the facts are facts. Security Researches all agree iPhones are more secure than Android devices. Hackers all agree iPhones are harder to hack into than Android devices and even Consumer Reports says iPhones offer the best out of box experience compared to Android. So not sure why you’re laughing unless it’s at your own ignorance. William Haynes IBM now sells and makes apps for the SURFACE tablets too. fstein No doubt. Windows and it’s variants must be supported too. AAPL.To.Break.$95.Soon.>:-) How long has it been since Steve Jobs passed away? Do people really think Apple is going to follow his way of doing business forever. Times change and the business has to change with it. When Steve was alive Android didn’t have 85% market share like it does now. All that’s left is poor countries with poorly-paid consumers only wanting to buy the cheapest piece of smartphone they can get their hands on. Apple had better find some other customers willing to pay for their products no matter where they come from. Apple should try as hard as possible to woo the enterprise and maybe the company will eventually lose that doomed reputation. Heck, no one is saying Microsoft or Tesla is doomed, so why should Apple be considered doomed. It would be nice if Apple could take over where BlackBerry used to be. Wall Street once worshipped RIM for having a lock on the enterprise. TrickyDickie “why should Apple be considered doomed?” Because even the fanboys are starting to wake up to their marketing tactics lol CelestialTerrestrial Tim did manage to get IBM and Cisco to promote Apple products in the Enterprise. IBM is now a reseller of Apple products. IBM is a Authorized Service Provider for Apple in the Enterprise. IBM is also a large and growing customer and case study as an Apple customer. Check out the JMAF conference presentation from last year, it’s a pretty good video to watch what IBM did last year and what benefits they are seeing. I think the old CIO mentality has been changing over the years and Apple’s benefitting. It sure doesn’t hurt that Tim is an ex-IBM and ex-Compaq manager with a degree in Industrial Design and an MBA. As brilliant as Jobs was, he really never understood the business world and that’s partly his own fault. He was too busy with the consumer and education space, he forgot who spends the most in IT. plus, IBM had the control and pushing PCs along with every PC clone mfg. So Microsoft benefitted by slapping their OS on anyone’s hardware. The problem is that it’s just flat out more costly to manage from an IT perspective and they forced their users to use Microsoft based OS, and then the employees bought PCs for the home because that’s all they knew. The iPhone really turned a lot of PC users over to Apple, and the Mac business has been increasing since. I think if everyone that has an iPhone were to use Macs, then Mac market share would reach 18% global market, which isn’t too shabby, they currently have only 7 to 8% global. The thing that people STILL can’t wrap their heads around is that if you add up the Net Profits of Microsoft, Google, Samsung, HP Inc., Dell, Lenovo, Acer and ASUS (All of Apple’s biggest competitors for desktops/laptops, smartphones and tablets), Apple makes as much as they do COMBINED. Apparently Apple’s business model works, and these others don’t. Apple only works on a 40% Gross Margin and retains a 20% Net Profit. For those idiots that think that Apple’s products are overpriced… I have one thing to say. NO, Apple’s products are not overpriced. It’s their competitors that are selling their products too cheaply, not managing their inventory/product offering well and they don’t have a strong efficient retail store model that works. If you look at Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc. they just make too damn many products and what happens is they overspend R&D, Support, and most importantly Inventory and they end up discounting them because they not only confuse the customer, but they can’t sell everything they make. It’s called TOO many SKU’s, TOO much inventory, TOO much discounting, and that’s TOO many TOO’s. Going after market share is the DUMBEST thing to do if you go after business that’s not profitable. A big number (customers) multiplied by zero (no profits) is still zero profits. That’s why IBM, Compaq and others got out of the PC industry and sold their businesses to someone dumber than they were. When people say that Android has the biggest market share. Well, yes and no. If you look at the smartphone business of products sold under the MSRP of $400, Apple has no market share, but if you look at the $400+ market, Apple has a pretty damn good market share. It’s just that the there are more people buying the sub-$400 smartphones and those don’t make any profit. They have those Freedom phones for $10, how can anyone make a phone for $10 and make an actual profit? I think the Chinese government has to subsidize a lot of these China based smartphone mfg. that lose money on selling smartphones, but for how long can they do that? I’m surprised there isn’t more fallout in the Android world in terms of Android mfg going out of business.     About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter GMSV     Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Older Silicon Valley techies pushed out onto the ice floes… Apple admits to iPhone ‘touch disease,’ blames… Donald Trump says he and Tim Cook talked Apple… Crucial Silicon Valley H-1B visa issue unclear under Trump Why did Oracle’s co-CEO Safra Catz visit Trump?     Archives Archives Select Month November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2016 Bay Area News Group.

The announcement was made at the 22nd annual NIWeek conference in Austin, Texas, at the National Instruments (NI) Engineering Impact Awards ceremony, August 2, 2016. Paul Harris, from the University’s EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Communications together with Steffen Malkowsky, from the University of Lund in Sweden, won NI’s Wireless and Mobile Communications category together with NI’s Engineering Grand Challenges Award, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Edgeline Big Analog Data Award, Powered by Xilinx Award, and the 2016 Customer Application of the Year Award. In the 2016 NI Engineering Impact Awards - an annual set of awards that showcase extraordinary and innovative projects - over 100 entries were submitted, which were narrowed down to 14 finalists in seven specialisations. From these shortlists the winner was selected in each individual category. A further nine additional awards were presented, including NI Global Student Design Showcase, NI Community’s Choice, HPE Edgeline Big Analog Data, Intel Internet of Things, Powered by Xilinx, Engineering Grand Challenges, Humanitarian, Innovations in STEM and the 2016 Customer Application of the Year. Paul and Steffen used a 128-antenna massive MIMO testbed to demonstrate simultaneous real-time wireless connectivity to multiple users in the same radio channel through a technique known as spatial multiplexing. In their April submission they described how 12 users could be simultaneously connected using a single 20MHz channel at 3.5 GHz. They achieved an aggregate data rate of 1.59 Gbps and set a new world record in wireless spectrum efficiency of 79.4bit/s/Hz. In May, Bristol and Lund supported 22 simultaneous users and smashed through the 100 bit/s/Hz barrier; eventually setting a new world record of 145.6 bit/s/Hz. The research team’s achievement with massive MIMO arrays, which are cellular base stations with more than 100 antennas, demonstrates that this technology could deliver ultra-fast data rates to high densities of smartphones and tablets. Massive MIMO is a key technology for 5G, the next generation of wireless access. The hardware behind this demonstration was provided to the University as part of Bristol Is Open, a joint venture with Bristol City Council that aims to become the world’s first Open Programmable City.  The team used a NI flexible prototyping platform based on LabVIEW system design software and PXI hardware. Spectrum and power efficient wireless communications are core to the University of Bristol’sCommunication Systems & Networks (CSN) Research Group as well as the EPSRC CDT in Communications and the Department of Electrical and Information Technology at Lund University. Mark Beach, Professor of Radio Systems Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Manager of the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Communications, said, “We’re justifiably proud of Paul and Steffen and these awards truly exemplifies both their technical contributions to the field of Massive MIMO 5G wireless spectral efficiency and our collaborations with European universities and the NI engineering team in the US.” Today [Wednesday 3 August], as part of the NIWeek conference, Professor Andrew Nix, Dean of Engineering and Head of the CSN research group, took to the NI stage as part of a keynote presentation entitled ‘5G: What’s the Big Deal?’  This event attracted more than 3,200 innovators, with thousands more watching around the world on a live stream.   Professor Andrew Nix said, “The demands for mobile data are increasing exponentially and operators are struggling to keep up. In the sub 6GHz bands, Massive MIMO is the 5G technology of choice. By breaking the work spectral efficiency record twice, compared to 4G we’ve managed to demonstrate an order of magnitude increase in spectral efficiency.” As part of the NI 5G summit, Professor Mark Beach participated in an IEEE Communications Society panel session entitled ‘‘How will record-setting spectral efficiency impact real 5G systems?"  Mark spoke along with fellow international experts in the field showcasing Bristol’s on-going contributions to international 5G R&D.

In the strategic marketing world, we often talk about motivating innovators and early adopters sufficiently to catalyze a “crossing of the chasm.” The concept can be viewed in terms of a product adoption model that breaks up markets into customer segments, as shown below: It is often assumed that this model, promoted by Geoffrey Moore in Crossing the Chasm, fits our industry’s smart grid and grid-edge efforts. But does it? Has your transformer’s or circuit breaker’s cost been cut in half while doubling its electric capacity every 18 months? No.  Why do I refer to 18 months? Because the chasm-crossing model is driven not by our industry but by the more rapid pace of change in the IT and semiconductor industries, due to the 18-month “rule” in Moore’s Law. (Moore’s Law — from Intel’s Gordon Moore, not “Crossing the Chasm’s” Geoffrey Moore — says that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every 18 months, and has been born out since the invention of the transistor in the 1950s, with ongoing reductions in associated costs and increases in associated computing power.) Here are two examples of smart grid "forced fits": 1. We have numerous smart grid programs that take a "focus group” marketing approach, designing different messages to keep each segment “happy,” including a lot of segments that overlap with Geoffrey Moore’s chasm-crossing segments. Is this a forced fit? 2. We have numerous attempts to apply this chasm-crossing model to grid-edge technology uptake as well. The Networked EV: Smart Grids and Electric Vehicles; First Stop, California by Greentech Media (Feb. 2010) is a classic example. The article states that the “chasm” had not yet even been approached for EVs and talks about needs for a greater smart grid infrastructure to support EVs as “a future ‘killer app’ of the smart grid.” The fundamental assumption of these two examples is that the chasm-crossing model fits — somehow. Isn’t it naïve to think everyone to the right of the chasm — the pragmatists, conservatives, skeptics and laggards — will simply start buying EVs or Nest thermostats like hotcakes once the needs of innovators and early adopters are met? My question for our IdeaXchange Xperts is this: How well do you think “chasm-crossing” theory fits our industry, and what are the bad consequences of “force-fitting it” where it does not belong? Don McDonnell » 1 2 3 4 5 6 Next Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 Ike Kiefer on Aug 10, 2016 Excellent topic. I appreciate the evenhanded setup to the question. Also some very insightful comments made by others already on this thread. Working 25 years in the military, I have been on the receiving end of many top-down, force-fed early adoptions. Most were flops. The ones that stuck were still painful lessons in the costs of a naive approach to premature change. Some failed because they were nothing more than bumper sticker slogans lean on real original content. Others failed because they were ephemeral fads cooked up by ivory tower intellectuals uninformed by practical life experience. The outcome of all the rapid (i.e., revolutionary or "transformational") changes I saw were either a fade to failure that eventually yielded back to tried and true methods, or a persistent but regrettable and clumsy bolt-on to existing methods that just added unhelpful layers of complexity and bureaucracy. The pace of harmful change was at its peak under Rumsfeld and his vision for "transformation." I was at the epicenter of this mostly pointless churn working in the aptly titled Joint Transformation Division of the Joint Staff. The pearls of genuine wisdom and value that did come along on occasion during my career, such as some of the principals embedded within Deming's TQM, were generally not applied with the understanding or discipline necessary to take root and bear fruit before moving on to the next fad. I have come to the opinion that change for change's sake is one of the most self-destructive activities there is, and we often do more harm to ourselves with misguided change than our worst enemies could hope to inflict upon us by design. A long view of history shows that much of the change is cyclic, as we chase what we think are new ideas that are really old ideas that have simply slipped from the collective consciousness in a generational turnover. Leaders who don't know history are suckers for the snake oil salesmen peddling their proprietary/best-selling version of the next coming revolution or transformation. The great Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz was careful to distinguish between the changing character of war and the unchanging nature of war. The character of war may change with new technologies and environments (e.g., aircraft, submarines, missiles, robots, outer space, cyberspace, etc.), but the nature of warfare remains the same -- a lethal competition between humans governed by passion, reason, and chance. Similarly, while the electric power utility industry may change in character with technology (DG, storage, HVDC, microgrids, EVs, etc.), the nature remains the same: a second-by-second operational balancing act of interconnected generation and load, and a year-by-year balancing act of apportioning capital investment among the four competing mandates of accessible, reliable, affordable, and safe electric power. Resources are finite and needs are infinite. We should not overspend on one mandate to the detriment of the others or to the detriment of grid stability. Energy sector leaders who know their energy history recognize that wind and solar and hydro and biofuels and electricity storage are all ancient technologies that long predate the first power grid. They know that each technology has a painfully slow evolutionary arc when measured by actual, large-scale, un-subsidized economic performance of fielded hardware, rather than measured by peak performance in laboratory conditions at pilot scale, or measured by popularity during cyclic waves of partisan political ideology propaganda and public sentiment. In military studies, we found that it was often economists rather than generals who were the best predictors of revolutions in the character of warfare. For example, economist Ivan Bloch predicted the machine gun and artillery shell-saturated no-man's land of World War I, and its escalation to a nation-state industrial duel, while the generals at the military academies of France and England were teaching that the next war would be won by cavalry charges and bayonets and moral courage. Economics is largely a black box science in that it illuminates trends and tipping points more than it explains the why behind them. But we should look for substantial empirical evidence and durable trends rather than relying on simplistic theories based on only a handful of favored variables and manipulated data points (i.e., incipient ice age predictions of the 1970s, global warming predictions of the 1990s, hurricane swarm predictions following 2005-2006). And the best leaders know their craft well enough to know the absolute limits of what is possible and what is not (i.e., the boundaries of physics and human performance) so as not to be duped by snake oil salesman. The advocates of early adoption will claim the time to change is when the new thing is just marginally better than the old. This ignores the economies of integration and optimization that are disrupted by change. Change has a cost. The real time to change is when the new thing is mature enough to be well-understood and the advantages can be calculated with some assurance to be large enough to make a sound business case for enduring the cost of the transition. So what do the empirical evidence and the economic trend lines indicate for the USA? - Wind: annual capital investment peaked in 2009 and is declining year on year. Capacity factors of new terrestrial installs are the same as older installs despite larger turbine size due to less optimal siting (i.e., declining WRI). Capital cost and O&M of offshore remains daunting, as does environmental opposition. Combined with increasing need for recapitalization of older turbines, these trends argue for a not too distant plateau in capacity. - Hydro: over 1,000 dams dynamited in the past 20 years. New initiatives to power unpowered dams offset by ongoing efforts to restore rivers. Environmental opposition likely to thwart new projects. No significant change in capacity likely. - Solar: Have transitioned from phase of exponential growth to linear growth. Rooftop solar market growth has peaked and is declining. Same is now happening to community solar. Market of credit-worthy homeowners with suitable rooftops and desire for this lifestyle choice is largely tapped out. Creative financing and leasing schemes for non-home owners are also hitting saturation. Additional state funding to put solar or roofs of poor faces subsidy fatigue. Utility-scale is now a long-term buyers' market in PPA pricing and will sustain the bulk of solar growth through the end of the ITC. Then expect a plateau in capacity. - Nuclear: Small oscillations in U.S. capacity ongoing during an extended period of recapitalization. No evidence of a renaissance that will displace other generation capacity in USA. However, capacity will continue to grow in the developing world, and there is likely to be a growing diversity of technologies and fuel cycles. This will be a regulatory and proliferation challenge. - Natural gas: The glut that began in 2012, but was not popularly recognized until 2014, will continue beyond 2020. Supply is extremely elastic and small changes in price will bring quick adjustments in supply, and quick price corrections. The price volatility that remains will be due to unpredictable speculation and conflict, not significant swings in market fundamentals. U.S. will continue to enjoy a price trough compared to rest of the world. Low natural gas prices support continuing trend of onshoring of energy-intensive business, particularly those suitable to automation and robotic manufacturing rather than needing large labor forces. Pipeline infrasture will be limiting factor for electric utilities. - Coal: Not likely to recover much in the U.S. due to cheap NG. However, coal remains the fastest, cheapest, and most reliable way to bring urban-scale electricity to the billions in the developing world who are underserved. Coal will continue its trajectory as the fastest growing fuel for global electricity generation, particularly in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Africa. (China's economic growth rate peak is permanently behind it due to demographics. Coal and other energy consumption is currently languishing as they are in recession, but energy consumption growth rate will never return to what it was between 2000 and 2010). - Biofuels: Slow fade to end with a whimper. Liquid biofuels now recognized by national academies and environmentalists and humanitarian agencies as not clean, not green, not sustainable, increasing GHG emissions, damaging the enviroment, increasing fuel costs, and competing with food agriculture regardless of feedstock. Lobbyists losing traction as price remains at a premium to refined petroleum, bulk of production still coming from food crops, and the remainder coming from GMO versions of weeds and invasive species. Doomed by poor EROI due to physical limitations of photosynthesis and thermodynamic losses in converting carbohydrates to hydrocarbons. Abengoa, Dupont, Poet all have quarter million dollar cellulosic ethanol refineries that are about to go the way of Cello, Range Fuels, and KiOR. E10 will not survive the eventual repeal of RFS. Expect power industry to continue low levels of co-firing with cheap wood harvest and mill waste. - Electric Vehicles: U.S. EV sales growth peaked in 2013 and has been declining year on year since. Despite the hype, EV performance lags coventional cars. Tesla S85 propulsion system generates half the horsepower per pound and has half the range per pound of the gasoline propulsion system of a Ford Mustang GT. But the Tesla costs 3 times as much and takes 50 times longer to refuel. Lifecycle GHG emissions of a Tesla are the same as a Jeep Grand Cherokee, particularly attributable to battery fabrication and disposal. We are fast approaching market saturation for EVs, and this will not change without a battery breakthrough. - Storage: Continued incremental progress, but no revolutionary breakthrough that the public will embrace (real progress would require shift to nuclear rather than chemical energy storage). Electrons are real; bits are virtual. Moore's Law is a description of how we have progressed in shrinking the amount of concrete macro stuff it takes to represent and handle a virtual abstract entity of zero size and mass. Electrons stubbornly have fixed mass and size, and cannot be shrunk or substituted. Moore's Law does not apply to electricity (nor to anything but computing, despite claims from some futurists and snake oil salesmen). What storage progress does occur will favor coal and nuclear baseload generation as much as intermittent wind and solar, as it enables both to become load-following. Expect advancement beyond LiON performance only to be implemented at utility scale in dedicated plants and substations due to exotic technology, toxicity, and explosive energy danger. - Climate: Evidence is that warming and melting is not proceeding as originally forecast. 2013 IPCC scientific report recanted almost all the alarmism of the 2007 IPCC report, but White House and pundits vested in alarmism continue to quote from the 2007 report and use the invalidated warming coefficients that predict 2 degrees by the end of the century. Current data supports 0.1 to 0.2 degrees by end of century, which is actually net beneficial to humans and the planet. The Sun is currently in a near record drought of sunspots, and many solar scientists are predicting a reduction in total solar irradiance, and particularly in the solar wind the ultraviolet spectrum that affects upper level cloud formation. Some see this as a long phase that will last until 2050, and that may overpower CO2 effects with a cooling trend similar to the Maunder Minimum of a couple centuries ago. In any case, the data is that sea level rise is not accelerating from the rate it has been for thousands of year, the oceans remain firmly alkaline (pH of 8.0), global sea ice coverage is unchanged from what is was when satellites starting measuring in 1973, hurricanes and severe weather are not increasing (the USA has been in a hurricane drought since 2006), beneficial terrestrial precipitation is slightly increased but flooding is not (drought-ravaged Ethiopia is now getting rain), the U.S. drought index is unchanged from 2000 to 2015, the total acreage burned by wildfires is the same today as it was in 1960 but the number of fires is lower, the IPCC and NOAA agree that the weather in the 20th century was milder than the weather in the preceding five centuries based on statistical and archaeological evidence of storm landfall, floods, and fires. Bottom line: while weather remains a violent force on the planet that we must respect and engineer against, there is no evidence that it is becoming more violent. However, we have greatly increased our exposure to severe weather by adding huge amounts of population and capital to vulnerable coastlines and flood basins. Thus our damages from extreme weather events are likely to rise, even though human casualty rates have decreased by multiple orders of magnitude over the past century due to improved warning, evacuation, and medical attention. In summary, I currently see the U.S. electric utility industry suffering from the same uncritical infatuation with change that I experienced in the military. We have been decreasing our power grid resilience by decommissioning dispatchable coal and nuclear power plants, adding natural gas plants without the commensurate pipeline capacity, and forcing must-take intermittent generation onto the grid. We have also been increasing energy poverty by a spending spree on duplicative and low capacity factor generation and transmission during a time of negligible load growth, and this has raised national retail power rates faster than inflation since 2005. Most AMI installations to date, while bringing some significant advantages to both providers and consumers, would likely not pass a business case test for basic payback -- especially those installed by early adopters without remote cutout capability and not taking full advantage of pre-pay rates and big data for maintenance and theft. If this technology was a great efficiency boon and money saver, why are we charging opt-out fees instead of giving opt-in credits? I see plenty of examples of good change, but it is typically evolutionary, not revolutionary. Labor reducing machines like bucket trucks and digger derricks. Growing safety culture and PPE improvements. Lightning-resistant transformers. Telemetry and SCADA. Improved field communications and operations centers. 811 and better coordination with other utilities and municipal services. Better ROW maintenance. But there is no killer technology or app that offers revolutionary improvement in SAIDI or CAIDI or ROI or consumer satisfaction or other objective metrics. And some things remain virtually unchanged over the past century because they are still the optimal solution for balancing the mandates. We have alternatives to wooden poles and bare conductor, but these remain in widespread use today because they are efficient and effective means to accomplish the mission in many situations. Most change is evolutionary, not revolutionary. Most things that appear new have come around before. Change is costly. Like most things in life, direction and timing are critical. The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. Good change requires good leadership. reply Log In or Register to post comments Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your TDWorld ID Email: Your comment: * Related Articles ComEd Smart Grid Program Supported 2800 Jobs in Third Quarter Top 5 Smart Grid Trends From 2013 to Watch in 2014 FPL Unveils New Smart Grid Technology Center 2 AEP Ohio Files To Expand Smart Grid Technologies Union City Electric Harvests AMI Benefits Advertisement Featured Video The changing role of HVDC in the U.S. HVDC is making it possible for utilities in the US to accomplish many goals.

It boots to both Microsoft Windows 10 and Android 5.1 Lollipop operating systems. It has 4GB RAM and 64GB ROM storage. It has a Quad core Intel Cherry Trail Z8300 64-bit 1.84GHz processor, an 9.7 inch IPS retina 2048 x 1536 display screen. There is a slot for TF cards up to 128GB, 2.0MP front and rear cameras and an HDMI output. There is also a Micro USB, a 3.5mm earphone jack and a 2.5mm DC port. It has an 8,000 Li-ion battery and weighs 580g, just over one pound. The dual boot screen gives ten seconds to choose which operating system to go to. Booting to the Android platform is instantaneous. However, whilst using the Android UI, I found connecting to Wi-Fi access points difficult from time to time. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 I did not like the Android UI as much as the Onda tablet I reviewed last month. The Teclast UI did not seem as intuitive as the other tablet I trialled. All the features are there, they are just a little harder to find. There is an icon on the home screen to boot to Windows from within the Android UI. There are a few Chinese icons including Ifeng, and Phoenix News. Booting to Windows 10 invokes a full reboot of the device. The first time this happened I had to go through the entire Windows 10 build on the device - unlike the first boot to the Android UI. There is an app on the task bar called TODO which, when clicked, brings up a user account control dialog. According to Microsoft Translator the app is published by Guangzhou business information technology ltd. There is no further information about what the app does or why it is there. However scrolling through the complete app list shows a similar icon called Switch Now which invokes the same dialog box. This gives the user the option to switch to the Android OS. The Windows 10 OS has Excel Mobile, OneNote, PowerPoint Mobile, Sway, and Word Mobile. There are also Chinese apps such as Notes, Micro Tablet Assistant, Mango TV, and Favourites. A phone app interfaces with Skype for PC. I found myself using the Windows 10 for anything work related - but I found myself booting into Android more and more for my social apps. This tablet is the sort of tablet that could fulfil the needs of a family that had one device for both work and play. It is responsive, compact, and would be the only device that I would take away on holiday. I could still have access to all of my work documents through One Drive whilst travelling. I miss having an Outlook app on the device for the extra functionality that Outlook gives me. However the Mail app performed adequately enough. The Teclast surprised me. I expected to use only one operating system but I was delighted to have a choice of OS each time I booted up the system. This is a good performing tablet, at a reasonable price, with an added bonus of getting two operating systems for the price of one. This tablet is well worth it overall.

(Photo U.S. Army released) Almost two weeks after several U.S. Special Operations troops were wounded fighting Islamic State militants in eastern Afghanistan, the militant group’s media arm has posted photos of American equipment, including weapons and a radio that, they say, were captured from U.S. soldiers fighting in the same region. In an emailed statement Tuesday, Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland, the deputy chief of staff for the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan, confirmed that equipment was lost during recent operations in the country’s restive Nangahar province. Cleveland said the equipment was lost when moving to what is called a “casualty collection point” from one area to another. A casualty collection point is often predesignated on the map prior to any mission. In this case, Cleveland said, the initial collection point came under “effective” fire, forcing the U.S. unit to move to a more covered position. “In the course of moving the [collection point] to a safe location, some equipment was left behind,” Cleveland said. “For understandable reasons, the lives of soldiers were not put at risk to recover the equipment prior to the scheduled exfiltration from the area at the already planned conclusion of the operation.” It is common when treating casualties in a combat zone that the patient’s gear and equipment is stripped off to ensure that there are no hidden injuries. This usually results in a plethora of equipment being scattered around the casualty and can sometimes be problematic to recover when under enemy fire. In this case, Cleveland declined to discuss specific injuries from the operation. [Five U.S. troops wounded in Afghanistan fighting Islamic State, top general says] Last month the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson, told reporters that five U.S. Special Operations soldiers were wounded alongside their Afghan counterparts during “clearing operations” against Islamic State militants in Nangahar. Over the course of a week, the soldiers received wounds from gunfire and shrapnel, he said. On Saturday, the Islamic State’s Amaq media agency posted pictures of the American equipment including the identification, or CAC card, of a U.S. soldier. Cleveland said the soldier had not been captured and is currently with his unit. #ISIS 'Amaq posted photos of documents and gear of #American soldiers allegedly taken by ISIS fighters in #Nangarhar pic.twitter.com/UDat7qOFvX — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) August 6, 2016 “The loss of equipment is regrettable, but no equipment is worth undue risk to those involved,” Cleveland said. “And we do not expect any measurable operational impact due to the loss.” The pictured equipment includes what appears to be a 66mm single-shot rocket launcher, 40mm grenades, medium machine gun ammunition, multiple rucksacks, including two smaller assault packs, a sandbag, a handheld radio, pin flares, knee pads, a body armor carrier, a kit bag, a spare machine gun barrel, multiple rifle magazines, notebooks, medical equipment and goggles. The U.S. military has been operating in eastern Afghanistan for years, and while some of the equipment could have been captured from a recent operation, it is also possible some of it might have been left behind or captured in the past and pulled into the picture for added propaganda value. [U.S. widens war in Afghanistan, authorizes new action against Taliban] The type of equipment, along with an additional list of gear that is also pictured in the cache, indicates that at least some of the radio batteries, ammunition and kit likely belonged to a Special Operations unit. The list, partially handwritten and featured in one of the photos, has what appears to be a breakdown of the serialized equipment carried by a U.S. soldier, although it is unclear if the equipment belongs to the soldier whose ID was also captured. The list includes a pair of nonstandard night vision goggles, a Mk. 48 medium machine gun and an FN SCAR, or Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle. The SCAR is a futuristic rifle that is billed as a highly modifiable weapon and comes in a number of variants that can be used in both close-quarters combat and long-range engagements. The SCAR, while in use by a number of Special Operations units, is a favorite of the 75th Ranger Regiment, a unit that has operated in Nangahar for some time. Last year, two soldiers from the regiment’s 1st Battalion were awarded Silver Stars for their actions in the province in 2014. Also in the picture, and on the list of equipment, is a PRC-148 MBITR radio. The small black device is a favorite of ground troops and is often used for interteam communication and, when equipped with the right antenna, can be used to talk to overhead aircraft. Like most American radios, the PRC-148 allows for encrypted communication, and the presence of one in the Islamic State’s hands simply means U.S. forces in the region likely had to refill their radios with new encryption keys to prevent ISIS fighters from listening in. From the picture, the Islamic State appears not to have captured any rifles or night vision equipment. Although the assorted explosives will likely find their way into local bazaars or improvised explosive devices, the haul bolsters the group’s visibility more than adding any real operational capabilities. In January, President Obama granted additional authorities to U.S. troops in Afghanistan to target the Islamic State, along with the other terrorist groups the United States has systematically targeted in the country since 2001. When U.S. strikes began against Islamic State fighters, their numbers were estimated to be around 3,000 and they controlled a cluster of villages in Nangahar. In the past six months, that number has been halved, Nicholson recently told reporters, and the group’s offshoot in the country is steadily losing ground. This story was updated Tuesday with new reporting and comments from Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland.

As inevitable controversy continues to erupt between artists and politicians regarding the use of music at political events, George Howard takes a closer look at exactly what rights these artists have, and how Blockchain Technology might be used prevent such tension in the future. _____________________________ Guest Post by George Howard on Forbes Every election cycle since Reagan’s 1984 campaign has included – to a greater or lesser degree – tension around the use of music by candidates during their events. In fact, while Reagan’s misguided use of “Born in the USA” was the first truly memorable and visible kerfuffle, it’s likely that, to paraphrase, Raymond Kurzweil, it’s not that the (mis)-usage of music is getting worse, but that our information with respect to reporting it has gotten better. In any case, here we are again, and nary a day goes by when there aren’t pleas/demands from artists for politicians to stop using their music, and the media seems to be more engaged than ever in reporting this phenomenon. Yours truly was even recently on NECN discussing Donald Trump’s use of music during the RNC, and – at only a slightly more visible level [wink] – John Oliver devoted a large portion of his weekly show to the subject, and even created a song – featuring artists like Josh Groban, Usher, Sheryl Crowe, and others – that articulated these artists’ frustrations around the issue (I’ve written about how problematic this song is in terms of the artists’ seeming misunderstanding of the rights issues, entitled, “Do Artists Like Usher And Josh Groban Really Not Know How They Make Their Money?“). With respect to whether or not politicians can use artists’ music: Briefly, if these artists are the songwriters and have affiliated with a Performance Rights Organization (PRO), like ASCAP, SESAC, or BMI, and the venues in which these events are taking place have purchased a blanket license to publicly perform the songs that are in the catalogs of these organizations, these candidates are within their rights to do so. With an increasing number of artists asserting that they have not authorized their music to be played at Donald Trump Campaign events, George Howard explains what rights these artists do or don’t have, and suggests a Blockchain Tech solution to avoid these types of issues.(Photo credit ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images)  While in most other countries creators of works can rely on “Moral Rights,” the United States does not recognize this concept. This concept of Moral Rights is succinctly summed up by Betsy Rosenblatt from Harvard Law School: …the ability of authors to control the eventual fate of their works. An author is said to have the “moral right” to control her work. The concept of moral rights thus relies on the connection between an author and her creation. Moral rights protect the personal and reputational, rather than purely monetary, value of a work to its creator. While authors in the US can conceivably rely on claims such as False Endorsement, to stop those who are using their works against their wishes, this approach is time-consuming and costly, and certainly victory is not guaranteed. Thus, there is currently no practical legal mechanism for artists to avail themselves of in order to stop the unwanted use of their work. The problem, however, is less a legal one, and more a systems problem. The reason, for instance, that Queen doesn’t just withdraw their music from the PRO with whom they are affiliated, and thereby force candidates and/or venues to directly license their work, is because this would also preclude them from collecting the massive amounts of money their songs generate via usages that one assumes they are OK with. Undoubtedly, the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, where the RNC Convention took place, has blanket licenses with the PROs in place. And, certainly at some point after the RNC Convention ended, some other event took place in this arena – perhaps a sporting event – during which songs like “We Are the Champions” and/or “We Will Rock You” were played (because one or both of those songs are always played at a sporting event), and the members of Queen who wrote those songs would eventually receive compensation for the public performance of those songs via a percentage of the blanket license fees collected and distributed by their PRO (this, of course, also means they will eventually receive payment for Trump’s usage). This issue – Queen and most other artists being stuck in a dynamic where they can not feasibly select where, when and how their music is publicly performed – highlights how we must aggressively move from a system of “modeling” to one of “measuring.” This “from modeling to measuring” phrase was coined by my brilliant friend, Kelly Olson from Intel INTC +1.13%, and it succinctly sums up the problem [disclosure, Intel is a client of my consulting firm]. Think of it this way: For decades (and for many still today), your electricity usage was “modeled.” That is, very occasionally, the energy company would send a representative out to take a meter reading, and, based on these periodic readings, the energy company would model (estimate) a bill for the other months when they didn’t (because it wasn’t technologically/economically practical to do so) take actual readings (i.e. measure). As technology advanced, of course, energy companies have been able to move from a modeling approach of approximation, to a measuring approach of knowing precisely how much energy you are using. Certainly, music being played at arenas – particularly pre-recorded music – could easily be measured, rather than still being modeled. For example, a Shazam-like listening device could be deployed to capture which songs are being played in real time. In this manner, artists would know precisely when and in what context their music is being used. This would not only allow for artists to have better information, but for venues too to be able to have a better sense of the precise cost related to their music use. In other words, currently venues must pay a blanket license fee that allows them to publicly perform anything in the PROs’ catalogs. Of course, they play only a fraction of the songs in the catalog, even though they’re paying for the right to play everything. But, if, instead, they could simply choose the precise songs they want to play, they could do a cost/benefit analysis, and pay for the songs they perceive as creating value, and not pay for the ones they don’t desire to use. The artists could add conditions – for example, they might refuse to allow to have their music publicly performed during political events – and, via this measuring approach, the artists would know if these explicit conditions had been violated, and be able to take legal action, and/or raise their prices to address these unwanted usages. Of course, there are issues with this approach. Dominantly, that while this modeling approach appears to be technologically feasible for recorded music at venues, this type of usage is only a fraction of the total usages – music in restaurants; small clubs; live music, generally, etc. – that require licenses. Certainly, blanket licenses (i.e. the modeling approach) was, and still may be, the most efficient way to address these types of usages. However, as technology continues to advance, the ability to measure rather than model will become more pervasive, and even music performed live in small clubs will be able to be accurately tracked. In this manner, actual free markets – rather than “markets” governed by Consent Decrees [see HERE and HERE] – could emerge. Would such a measuring model obviate the PROs? Perhaps. I suggested as much over a year ago in an article in this space entitled, “Bitcoin Can’t Save The Music Industry Because The Music Industry Will Resist Transparency.” But, perhaps not. The PROs – like any other firm – must innovate or die. Certainly, they could play the dominant role in leading this change, and, in so doing, secure their places going forward via adding value. With respect to specifics around howBlockchain Technology would come into play, there are several reasons why this techwould facilitate this measuring approach in a superior way to a simple database solution: First, the distributed nature of Blockchains would ensure that the data is immutable, and therefore difficult to be altered/co-opted. Second, the potential for a more transparent record of the usages would allow for both those using music and those whose music is being used to not only know with some degree of precision the types of usage, but – through this knowledge – to more efficiently price the usages and provide evidence in the case of disputes. Third, via the “smart contract” functionality related to Blockchain Tech, a set of rules and requirements could be created by both those who desire their music to be used, and those who desire to use music, and – when these requirements are met – transactions could occur in real time with more efficiency. Fourth, new value could be created around the use of music, in particular with respect to those currently left out of the equation: Performers. Currently, if a song is publicly performed, for instance in a venue, only the writer is compensated; the performer of the song is not (when Whitney Houston’s version of Dolly Parton’s composition “I Will Always Love You” is plated at a stadium, Dolly Parton is paid, Whitney Houston’s estate is not). Rightsholders could require – via contract – that both performers and writers be compensated. Fifth, dynamic pricing could emerge. As an example of going from modeling to measuring, think of how Uber dynamically raises their prices (the dreaded “surge pricing”) – via measuring – when demand exceeds supply, while the taxi industry dominantly uses a modeling approach, and does not dynamically alter their pricing. Music could do the same. We’re moving from a society that models to one that measures. We see data going from unstructured to structured in everything from wearable health to sleep to productivity; soon we’ll quantify virtually everything in our lives in order to optimize our usages. Music will – sooner or later – move to this measuring approach as well, and – at that point – musicians will have vastly more degrees of not only control of how/when their music is used, but also how to monetize these usages.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Gene Marks August 8 Follow @genemarks Is one of your employees about to steal your data? It happens a lot – both to big companies and small.  According to a 2014 survey by the National Small Business Association, 44 percent of respondents had been victims of at least one cyberattack, with an average cost of$8,700.  Many of the attacks on small businesses come from the outside.  But, in some incidents, it’s the firm’s employees who are the culprits. A software firm called RedOwl Analytics is trying to do something about this growing problem, according to this report from Quartz.  The new service – introduced recently – is designed to track the behavior of all of the employees at a company with the goal of finding that one who is planning a data breach or possibly looking to steal intellectual property or other sensitive information. The report cites evidence studies by Oxford University and Intel that found more and more employees are increasingly attacking their companies and that internal employees were behind 43 percent of data breaches. Maybe that employee is working unusual hours. Or suddenly sending emails in different languages.  Or sending and receiving more external emails over internal ones than before. It’s all about their behavior – and what they’re doing that may trigger a red flag. “Think about yourself, probably pretty much every day looks the same,” says Brian White, the chief operating officer told Quartz. “You go to work around the same time, you’re sending a certain amount of emails. There are spikes and changes but often those are driven by deadlines or holiday. We’re looking for something outside the norm.” Sure, there are privacy concerns. But many companies I know already use software to monitor whether employees are visiting frivolous or unsavory sites. And yes, most of Red Owl’s customers are big companies – defense contractors and large financial services firms. But small businesses suffer these same problems and many clients I know would have great interest in this type of predictive analytics. Is it foolproof?  Can this software actually predict when an employee is going bad? I’d like to think it improves our chances. And as the technology grows in popularity it’s likely we’ll see more products like these packaged and priced for the small business market. business on-small-business on-small-business true Please provide a valid email address.

Highs As feature-packed as more expensive Radeons Fast enough for 1080p in many games Compact size Lows Performance has limits, even at 1080p DT Editors' Rating 8.0 DT Recommended Product Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Video Card Reviews > Sapphire Nitro Radeon RX 460 OC review By Brad Bourque Posted on 08.08.16 (updated on 08.09.16) Research Center: Sapphire Nitro Radeon RX 460 OC At the PC Gaming Show in 2015, AMD rolled out the high-end Fury cards. Meant to compete with Nvidia’s 980 Ti, the card came up short. This time around, AMD is refocusing the Radeon line on a market the red team has won over before – builders on a budget. The top-end RX 480 starts at just $200, and is well equipped for VR and 1440p gaming. The RX 470 starts at $179 and more than holds its own at 1080p. The RX 460, meanwhile, is marketed for “eSports gaming.” That’s may seem vague, but it’s a clear reference to titles like League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. These games prioritize high framerates over brilliant graphics. Related: Sapphire Radeon RX 470 OC review In any case, the wallet-friendly RX 460 is pushing the bottom end for modern GPUs. At just $109, the RX 460 is about as inexpensive as video cards get before they lose any gaming credibility. Our Sapphire model, with an extremely modest overclock and 4GB of memory, retails at $139. Is this new card a legitimate choice for players lacking cash, or does is deliver too little even for its bottom-dollar pricing? A numbers game AMD’s new platform, Polaris, marks Radeon’s move to a smaller 14-nanometer manufacturing process, as well as the switch from flat transistors to FinFET 3D transistors. We’ll spare you the nitty-gritty, except to note the standout features are greatly improved power efficiency, which results in a 75-watt thermal design power, asynchronous compute support, and a high level of compatibility with both DirectX 12 and Vulkan games. If you’re interested in learning more about Polaris, our Radeon RX 480 review and introduction to the platform are a great place to start. The RX 460’s particular flavor of the Polaris architecture sports 896 Stream Processors clocked at a 1,090MHz base clock, with a Boost Clock of up to 1,200MHz when thermals and power allows. Users will have a choice of either 2GB or 4GB of 128-bit GDDR5 memory, for a total of 112GBps of memory bandwidth. Related: AMD Radeon RX 480 video card review Our review unit was a 4GB Sapphire Nitro with a slight overclock to 1,175MHz base and 1,250MHz boost. Despite the technically low-enough thermal design power, it also sports a six-pin PCIe power connection. Technically, the RX 460 can run without an external PCI power connection. That’s great for gamers who have an extremely basic rig, and can’t afford to upgrade the power supply. The RX 470 and 480 boast at least 2,000 Stream Processors each, and 200 GBps of memory bandwidth, or higher. The RX 460 basically sits at less than half, although its clock speed is higher than the RX 470. On paper, then, its performance looks a lot different than its more expensive cousins. Its feature set, however, matches the higher-end cards. That means EyeFinity, FreeSync, Crossfire, and DirectX 12. Performance We tested the Radeon RX 460 in our X99 test system. With an Intel Core i7-6950X, 8GB of RAM, and an Intel 750 Series SSD, our rig is clearly much more powerful than you’d usually expect to see alongside this budget GPU. The upshot to this is that the card will be able to hit its full potential without the CPU bottlenecking it. So, how does it perform? The RX 460 average about 46 percent of the RX 480’s performance in the synthetic 3DMark test. That score means it trades blows with the previous generation’s Radeon R7 370, a 2GB card that sits right around $140. That isn’t the most impressive score ever, but it certainly beats out integrated graphics options several times over. It’s also essentially tied with the GTX 960 in the Alienware Alpha R2, which is likely a underclocked version of the GPU, given the Alpha’s small size and power limitations. Sapphire Nitro Radeon RX 460 OC Compared To Zotac GeForce GTX 1050 Mini ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1060 AMP! Edition AMD Radeon RX 480 AMD Radeon R9 380X NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan X Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 AMD Radeon R9 295X2 NVIDIA DualTV MCE ATI All-In-Wonder X1900 MSI RX800 XT ATI Radeon 9800 XT 256MB ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 9800 Pro Matrox Parhelia 128mb We typically consider 60 frames per second to be the goal for most gaming machines, and the RX 460 certainly falls short of that in modern, demanding games, at least with the graphics turned up. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive runs quite well, though, and that’s certainly an eSports-focused game, even if it is a little on the old side. On the other hand, the RX 460 performs much more admirably with the settings turned down a bit. It averages 62 FPS in Fallout 4, and 123 FPS in Battlefield 4, at medium settings. Most users don’t have the luxury of being able to crank the settings up in every game, and neither will RX 460 owners – but this video card can indeed play modern titles at respectable framerates. Without hitting optimum performance at 1080p, it’s not worth covering all of the 1440p results. There were a few standouts, however, including 31 FPS average in Fallout 4 at Ultra detail. If you’re comparing console performance to gaming PC performance, even the modest RX 460 beats out the PS4 and Xbox One handily. Those systems usually render at 900p or 1080p resolution and just manage 30 FPS, with some drops in more demanding areas. Warranty Warranty terms will vary depending on the company that makes the RX 460 you choose to buy. Most have a one-year warranty against manufacturer defects. Warranty terms regarding overclocking and third-party coolers can differ significantly from one company to the next, so check that information if you plan to push your RX 460 to the limit. Welcome to the family In our tests, the AMD Radeon RX 460 generally came in just a bit short of the Radeon R7 370. That may sound disappointing, given the R7 370 was already the star of AMD’s previous budget line – but the R7 370 is currently priced from $130 to $160. The RX 460, at $109, is significantly more affordable. It should be noted, of course, that the RX 460 we reviewed is $140. We don’t think you should buy this particular Sapphire model. The extra video memory is unnecessary and contributes almost nothing to the performance. If you do have $140 to spend, it’s clear the R7 370 with 2GB of memory is where you should head. Even the modest RX 460 beats out the PS4 and Xbox One. There’s a definite spot for an ultra-budget card in the marketplace. If you’re looking to build a home system for less than $500, but you want to play the occasional round of Rocket League or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the RX 460 will likely be your only option. Its small size and low power requirements are a boon for prebuilt and cobbled-together systems, as well. Surprisingly, the RX 460 is a reasonable card for 1080p, if you’re willing to accept some restrictions. It can’t play the latest games at the highest detail while maintaining 60 FPS, but it can score above that goal at medium detail in popular games like Fallout 4 and Battlefield 4. Every PC gamer yearns for the best hardware, but if you can’t afford it, you might be surprised by what the RX 460 can do. The DT Accessory Pack Logitech MX Master wireless mouse $70 Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate Clicky MX Blue mechanical keyboard $166 Steam Controller $50 We also think the RX 460’s purpose is a lot clearer than the Radeon RX 470. That card is too close to the RX 480 to really define itself, but the RX 460 fits right into small machines, and with some models ditching external PCIe power, it can fit places other video cards can’t. The RX 460 is the first budget card worth excitement since Nvidia’s 750 Ti, and there’s no shame in that. In fact, it’s exactly what we were hoping to see.

MSI gaming models such as the GT, GS, GE, and GP series will benefit from new components, improved performance, and the latest cooling design. Specific details are thin on the ground, and what we are told is in a rather unstructured press-release, but the list of new models is as follows: GT83VR, GT73VR, GT72VR, GT62VR, GT72VR, GT62VR GS73VR, GS63VR GE72VR, GE62VR GP62MVR While you might hope to hear tech specifics like what CPUs and GPUs the new VR-Ready range of laptops come equipped with, those details haven't been outlined as yet. We are told that some of the laptops come with Intel's Core i7 6820HK CPU but nothing is said about the GPUs – perhaps that information will come following a launch of new Nvidia GeForce mobile GPUs. The powerful MSI GT72VR / GT62VR Dominator series get new cooling designs using 'Cooler Boost 4', new Whirlwind fans and up to 12 heatpipes. MSI's lower tier models, the GE72VR and GE62VR Apache also benefit from 'Cooler Boost 4' with a 5~10 per cent lower CPU temperature under heavy loads. Users can instigate the Cooler Boost via a dedicated quick activation button. Touching upon visuals, MSI says it has kitted out the GT72VR Dominator with a 120Hz/5ms panel, "the fastest mobile display". This display offers 'True Colour Technology', near 100 per cent sRGB ready. If you opt for the 4K IPS version it reaches 100 per cent AdobeRGB. Many models are said to offer upgraded audio experiences. Sound by Dynaudio speakers are built-in to GT83VR / GT73VR Titan laptops as is Nahimic 2 and Audio Boost 2 technology. GE72VR and GE62VR Apache laptops feature better audio quality from Nahimic 2 and Audio boost AMP. The slim and light (for gaming) MSI GS63 Stealth Pro features ESS SABRE HiFi Audio and Nahimic 2 Audio Enhancer. Other notable improvements to the VR range come from upgraded keyboards present in both the Stealth and Apache models mentioned above. It looks like we will have to wait for the specific details and highlights of the above laptops. I'd guess we will hear more about MSI's VR Ready range at Gamescom, Cologne which is held between 17th and 21st August. In other MSI news, the firm is expected to ship a total of four million graphics cards this year. That's about 15 per cent better than last year.

Possibly a 1060m if it maintains the performance of the desktop 1060 (i.e. bucks the trend of previous xxxm variants) - No Optimus, display output connected directly to the GPU rather than via the PCH.

We like to remind readers about the impact total return has on portfolios because it is one of the best ways to help improve the chances for overall investing success. Total return is the combined increase in a stock’s value plus dividends. For instance, if you buy a stock at $20 that pays a 3% dividend, and it goes up to $22 in a year, your total return is 13% — 10% for the increase in stock price and 3% for the dividends paid. The UBS Dividend Ruler portfolio continue to outperform the overall market, and we continue to think that the outperformance will stay in place for the rest of the year and beyond. The analysts focus on stocks with solid dividends that have consistently grown over time, and their performance this year is outstanding. Through the first seven months of 2016 the portfolio is up 10.4% on a total return basis, versus 8.2% for the S&P 500. We screened the holdings for the current highest yielding stocks and found four that still make good sense for the last half of 2016. All are also rated Buy at UBS. Coca-Cola This company remains a top Warren Buffet holding and offers not only safety, but an incredible strong worldwide brand. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) is the world’s largest beverage company, refreshing consumers with more than 500 sparkling and still brands. Led by Coca-Cola, its portfolio features 20 billion-dollar brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, Powerade and Minute Maid. Globally, it is the top provider of sparkling beverages, ready-to-drink coffees and juices and juice drinks. Through the world’s largest beverage distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy its beverages at a rate of more than 1.9 billion servings a day. Despite reporting second-quarter earnings that came in above some estimates, slower growth and flat volumes brought out the sellers and they tagged the stock big time. It is important to remember though that the company own 31.5% of Monster Beverage, which continues to deliver big numbers. Coca-Cola investors receive a 3.22% dividend. The UBS price target for the stock is $50, while the Wall Street consensus target is $47.88. The stock closed Friday at $43.48. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline first quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations for the tech giant.

New software programs aim to do what unconscious bias training has not yet accomplished: Create blind hiring processes and diversify tech workplaces. By Alison DeNisco | August 8, 2016, 4:00 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/Leo Wolfert Last month, Qualcomm Incorporated agreed to pay $19.5 million to settle a gender discrimination class action suit—the latest high-profile case to hit headlines and make tech companies reevaluate their own hiring and retention practices. More about Innovation Our autonomous future: How driverless cars will be the first robots we learn to trust Google Fiber pivots: What it means for the future of gigabit internet IBM Watson's latest gig: Improving cancer treatment with genomic sequencing Subscribe to TechRepublic's Next Big Thing newsletter. As tech giants release employee statistics and draw criticism against their overwhelmingly white male ranks, a number of startups launched in recent years aim to offer more blind hiring practices and increase numbers of women and minorities at companies. These span from job posting tools like Textio, which analyzes job postings for gender bias, to Ellen Pao's Project Include, which focuses on managing talent once it's in-house. Several studies demonstrate the benefits of diverse workforces, including increased financial returns. Yet, the percentage of women among US tech workers has steadily declined over the past two decades. Women held 25% of professional computing occupations in 2015, according to the National Center for Women & Information Technology—down from an all-time high of 36% in 1991. SEE: Women in tech: 20 stories of women doing big things with their tech skills As a fix, industry leaders such as Apple, Intel, Google, and others spent millions of dollars in recent years on diversity initiatives and unconscious bias training. But, several studies show that this training usually does not increase workplace diversity. Even worse, another study found that raising awareness of bias can actually strengthen it. "In tech companies, things are not getting better nearly as fast as they should," said Laura Mather, founder and CEO of Unitive, software created to remove unconscious bias in the hiring process. "Silicon Valley claims to be a data-driven society. But we look at the data and see not much has changed, yet continue with the same behavior, thinking that if we keep training people it will go away." Read on for some of the tech tools that may help your company diversify its pool of candidates and select the person who is truly best for the job. Helping hiring managers Programs such as Unitive aid hiring managers in constructing a job post, reviewing resumes, and performing structured, quantifiable interviews. Unitive launched in 2015, and hundreds of companies now use it, said Mather. A lack of diversity means missing out on products that could benefit more than half the population, Mather said. "The companies who get to it first are going to win on multiple dimensions—hiring better people, getting better market share, and beating competitors," she added. "The companies who wake up to what is happening and create change will have a huge competitive advantage." Lever, an applicant tracking company, highlighted the work of customer KeepSafe on a "no resume campaign," in which they asked job candidates to describe projects they worked on without naming the companies they worked for. "It opened their eyes to a whole slate of candidates who probably wouldn't have made it through a resume screen because they hadn't worked for flashy brands," said Leela Srinivasan, CMO of Lever. "At the end of the day, an interviewer should be diving into someone's experiences, and understanding what the candidate has accomplished and how they could bring value to their organization." SEE: How venture capital must change: Gender equality as a business opportunity Retaining women Gender bias often creeps into not only hiring practices, but employee performance reviews, with women less likely to be marked as having leadership potential, said Gabby Burlacu, human capital management researcher at SAP SuccessFactors, a program that aims to objectively assess employee potential and identify, develop, and retain talent. SuccessFactors offers a Calibration tool designed to help managers with performance management. In the coming months, a new version will alert managers to gender bias issues. For example, if all of the employees designated "high potential" are males, or if a woman who went on maternity leave was demoted. Measuring the problem is only the start, Burlacu said. "None of these product features by themselves are going to solve everything," she added. "You need to keep coming back to the numbers as you create programs and drive change." Equity for freelancers In response to the federal government's Hack the Pay Gap effort, Accenture developed a prototype to address gender pay issues among freelance workers—a growing problem, since over 40% of the US workforce will be part of the freelance labor market by 2020, according to a study by financial services company Intuit. "In freelance labor markets, people are negotiating their pay on a daily or weekly basis," said Mary Hamilton, managing director of the Accenture Lab in Silicon Valley. "If women undervalue themselves, they will be consistently growing the pay gap." The program examines the language of job posts to determine gender equity. For example, the team learned that women will often self-select out of jobs if a posting has a long list of job requirements. "A woman will typically look at that and say, 'I don't have all those qualifications, I won't apply,'" Hamilton said. "But a man will look at it and say 'I have a few of those, I will apply.'" Gender bias also sneaks into the freelance hiring process during the vetting process, when certain candidates are selected and given a sample task. The Accenture prototype asks all candidates applying to complete the same set of exercises to show their abilities. A dashboard shows companies where in the hiring process they are losing diverse candidates—be it the job posting, the vetting stage, or the interview stage. Additionally, a list of relevant comparable salary and hourly wage data will help both candidates and job posters to negotiate more consistently and fairly. Going beyond software Some researchers remain skeptical of the ability of software and algorithms to truly lead to change. "While employers might see these algorithms as efficient and fair, they also have to be cognizant about how the algorithms are being programmed, and vigilant that the programming doesn't continue the discriminatory practices," said law professor and sociologist Ifeoma Ajunwa. And, humans ultimately end up deciding what factors to weigh and who gets the job, she added. Ultimately, companies must use these tools as part of a larger diversity plan to lead to stronger products and profits. "Beyond hiring algorithms, a workplace diversity effort needs to look at the pipeline," Ajunwa said. "By the time you get to the people who are actually applying, the pool has already been significantly narrowed because of issues of access to education needed for that kind of job." Diversity efforts from corporations should start at the high school and college level, encouraging women and minorities to take the steps that would make them competitive at the hiring stage later, Ajunwa added. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Women working in professional computing dropped to 25% in 2015. Several startups that launched in the past few years hope to get more women hired in the field using algorithms to diversify candidate pools. These companies offer service that analyze job posts, interview methods, salary offers and performance management systems for gender bias. Though these tools may be part of a solution to increase diversity, tech managers must also examine factors such as how the algorithms work and talent pipeline issues in order to draw the best candidates from all backgrounds.

Online stores are an immense hit with shoppers, simply because of the constant price war between retail giants. This means price cuts and discounts are on offer more often than not, apart from the “shopping festivals” that happen from time to time. The latest is Amazon India’s Great Indian Sale, from 8-10 August. If you are looking to splurge on gadgets, here are some good deals. Xiaomi Mi 5 Rs.22,999 (earlier Rs.24,999) Xiaomi’s mid-range smartphone, the Mi 5 has all the ingredients of a flagship killer. The phone is powered by the 1.8GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor with 3GB RAM. It is a smooth performer, runs Android Marshmallow with MIUI over it and offers 32GB of storage. The 16-megapixel camera works best in daylight and the 5.2-inch display with its 1902x080p display is good enough for reading and watching movies. And above all it looks very similar to Samsung’s flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S7. Read more: Review: Xiaomi Mi 5 can be the genuine flagship killer OnePlus 2 Rs.20,999 (earlier Rs.22,999) OnePlus 3 offers a lot more over its predecessor the OnePlus 2, but if you are looking for something in the vicinity of Rs.20,000, the OnePlus 2 is one of the better bets. Powered by a formidable Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 quad-core processor, paired with 4GB RAM, the phone runs Android 5.1 with a clutter-free interface of the Oxygen OS. It offers 64GB of storage which is impressive and is still a rarity at the price point. The phone offers 5.5-inch display with resolution of 1920x1080p and a layer of scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3. Read more: Review: OnePlus 2 and Vivo X5Pro Apple Macbook Air 13 Rs.81,473 (earlier Rs.96,900) Apple Macbook Air 13 with 256 GB storage is one of the most well-endowed ultra-thin notebook you can buy right now. The aluminium exterior boosts its durability, while the sleek form (it measures 17mm with the lid down) helps keep its weight in check (1.3kg). It offers 256 GB of SSD which means your device will not just boot up and work faster, but also has enough storage of its own. The 13-inch display with 1440x900p resolution is big enough for work as well as watching movies. The Macbook Air 13 is driven by Intel’s 6th Gen Core i5 processor with 8GB RAM and Intel series 600 graphics. Tewee 2 Rs.1,499 (earlier Rs.2,399) This is a unique media streaming device which allows users to stream content from their smartphone, laptop or tablets straight on their TV screen. The fact that it can be used with Windows- or Linux-based laptops and Android smartphone makes it more applicable than the Google Chromecast. It runs on 1.6GHz dual core processor with 1GB RAM and a quad-core GPU which can handle up to 1920x1080p of video playback with ease. It’s light and compact (209g), and connects to any TV screen with an HDMI port. InFocus II-50EA800 Rs.29,990 (earlier Rs.34,800) For a newcomer in the TV segment, InFocus’ 50-inch LED TV is an impressive option for users looking for a good big screen TV at a budget price. The 50-inch display packs in a 1920x1080p resolution and uses Direct ELD panel which delivers better sharpness and detailing. The wide viewing angles and black levels are pretty good too, while the audio quality is good enough for watching movies or gaming. It has only two HDMI ports which is a bit of a letdown. Even before the discount, it is a pretty good deal, and the discount makes it even better. Read more: Review: InFocus II-50EA800 GoPro Hero 4 8MP Rs.22,650 (earlier Rs.29,990) If you are into hiking and travelling and don’t wish to miss out on any of your adventures, you can consider GoPro’s Hero 4. This 8-megapixel camera is lighter (127g) and more compact than other Hero 4 series cameras. It can record full HD videos which you can save on the microSD card up to 64GB. The rugged design and up to 10 metres of water-proofing makes it more durable than a regular point-and-shoot or smartphone camera. It comes with built-in chargeable battery which can record for up to 2 hours in one go. You can wear it on your head with a GoPro Head strap which cost about Rs.2,000.

The photos show a variety of weapons, ammunition, communications gear and accessories. Perhaps the most chilling image is a closeup of someone holding two ID cards belonging to a U.S. soldier, Spc. Ryan Jay Larson.   #ISIS 'Amaq posted photos of documents and gear of #American soldiers allegedly taken by ISIS fighters in #Nangarhar pic.twitter.com/UDat7qOFvX— SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) August 6, 2016 It's unclear when the photographs were taken and what precisely transpired, although there are no reports of any American military personnel having been captured, said Henrietta Levin, a Defense Department spokeswoman. "We are aware of erroneous reports that U.S. Army Specialist Ryan Jay Larson was captured by ISIL in Afghanistan," Levin said, referring to one the Islamic State group's other monikers. "These reports are false. He has been accounted for and remains in a duty status within his unit. We are looking into how he lost possession of his ID but can confirm he has been accounted for with his unit.‎" Levin provided no additional details about the photographs and declined to address several questions submitted by Military Times. A White House official referred questions to the Defense Department. The images were shared on social media Saturday by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors ISIS and other terrorist organizations. SITE indicated that the photos were originally published by the Islamic State group's Amaq news agency after ISIS fighters confiscated the equipment and documents in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province. American special operations troops are operating in Nangarhar province, which borders Pakistan. The region has become a stronghold for the estimated 1,000 to 1,500 ISIS militants in Afghanistan. Most are believed to be disaffected Taliban who were forced out of Pakistan.   In late July, five American troops were wounded there during separate engagements with ISIS fighters, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army Gen. John Nicholson, said recently. The Americans were accompanying a group of Afghan troops on what Nicholson described as a clearing mission intended to help the Afghans reclaim territory lost to ISIS. None of the injuries was life threatening, Nicholson said. It's not immediately clear how ISIS came into possession of equipment that was photographed. But it's fairly substantial, said Fred Galvin, a retired Marine Corps officer who led a special operations unit in Nangarhar province in 2007.  Among the items is a M72 single-shot rocket launcher and a spare barrel for an M240 machine gun. There are 40mm grenades, a hand grenade and smoke grenades, and numerous 5.56mm rifle rounds and bigger 7.62mm rounds, which are fired from M240s and sniper rifles. There's a ruck sack, some body armor, knee pads, eye goggles, gauze, tourniquets and other medical supplies, a multiband radio and flex cuffs used to detain bad guys. Some of the gear appears to be standard issue, Galvin said, while other items are used only by "more advanced" military units. An American flag appears in one of the images. "From the looks of all of this," Galvin said, "it appears [the perpetrators] may have hit a fixed position. Maybe they ran across an observation post, or a site where guys were sleeping, bedding down. You can't tell 100 percent. But it does look like someone was caught in a hasty attack. If they knew they were going to be attacked like that, they would have been wearing their body armor." The volume and variety of items could suggest the Americans were forced to leave it behind — quite possibly in a hurry.  The radio is most concerning, said Shawn Snow, a Marine Corps veteran who served as a signals intelligence analyst during multiple tours to Afghanistan and Iraq. It's a PRC-148, also known as the Multiband Inter/Intra Team Radio, or MBITR. "It's one of the most commonly used portable radio systems employed by coalition and NATO forces. If ISIS has captured several of these radios, it would provide them with deadly capabilities," Snow said, noting the device was developed by U.S. Special Operations Command during the 1990s. "Usually, the Taliban communicates on a simple push-to-talk walkie talkie. These radios are very easy for coalition forces to intercept, providing timely indications and warnings of pending attacks. If ISIS has several of these MBITR radios, it could provide them with the ability to escape detection and interception through its programmable cryptologic function and frequency hopping abilities. "Even a small command and control node could do considerable damage being able to operate undetected with little to no warning. It would also provide them with extended range over their small hand held Chinese made radios."  ISIS is hoping to capitalize on this propaganda, Galvin surmised. He cautioned, however, that until there's confirmation from the Pentagon, it's impossible to know for sure whether this is a legit score for the enemy.  "Americans have been in Nangarhar for years," he added. "All of that equipment could have been bought in a local bazar. It's possible this is just a deception operation. 'Hey look. We attacked them. We destroyed them.' It could be a complete ruse."

Colm Willis, who won the Republican candidate nomination for Oregon in the May US Primary elections recently took a break with his family to visit his ancestral home in Knockacullion, Aghacashel. Colm's parents Tom and Mary, along with his cousin Bridie Reynolds (nee Boyle) and her husband Dennis, own the homestead in Knockacullion and the area remains an important part of his family's heritage. “I have lived in Oregon all my life but my great-grandfather, Jimmy Skinnon, came from Leitrim. He left school at just 10 and came to work on the docks of New York,” said Colm. Jimmy's daughter was brought up in New York, married and, with her husband, started a Ford dealership following WWII. Her son, Colm's father, Tom, went to Harvard Business school and eventually worked for Intel. “So for my family it has been a story of coming to another country, coming as my great-grandfather did, with just a 5th grade education and then, through the generations, taking advantage of opportunities and seeing success. For Jimmy coming to America it was a chance to come to America and live the dream and we, his descendents, have built on that,” he said. Acknowledging that his family had no previous involvement in politics, Colm explains that his interest stemmed from his first job after college where he worked for the Joint Economic Committee in May 2008. “I got hired just as the economy crashed and I saw leaders of both parties (Republican and Democrat) giving money to big lobby groups . I became very disillusioned and I left after about a year,” he explained. However, after he married, his wife Joan and became the father of two little girls, Ainne and Roisin, Colm says that his interest in politics was rekindled. He describes America as the “most free place in the world” and says that their political system reflects this freedom with anyone able to put themselves forward and very little, to Irish eyes, restrictions on what can be spent or said during election campaigns. “People say to me, “why don't they (those in charge) stop people from saying and doing things in the election, that they find outrageous, but the reality is that there is no 'they' running things. People have the freedom to say and do what they want and that is something we, as Americans, believe is important, freedom.” Colm's home town in Oregon is part of a large farming district and crops such as blueberries, hazelnuts, hops and pinot noir wine grapes are all grown in this area. Another big issue is the timer industry and, in particular, the impact of conservation on the industry and the job losses resulting from reduced harvesting. “Harvesting was a major source of funding for our police force and our education system. When harvesting declined so did our funds. The Federal Government said they would give us direct payments to make up the loss but in the last five years they are cutting payments and a lot of counties are struggling to fund their police and education systems,” he said. He acknowledges that immigration remains a key issue in America. “For our voters the question is not about the immigrants themselves, it is about our leaders in Congress and how they have failed to deal with the issues surrounding immigration,” he explains. “People are very disillusioned with how immigration has been dealt with. The fact is that most Americans are descended from immigrants and when they look back at the way their families came through Ellis Island, the health checks and suitability checks they went through to come into America, and now, we have a situation where people are being let into the country without any of this checks. “People want a proper structure in place so we know who is coming into our country and why.” Colm will be seeking election to Congress in November and, if successful, will take up a two year term in Congress. In Oregon, voters won't take to the polls like they do here in Ireland, instead, voting is done by postal vote. While voting in the US, as in Ireland, isn't compulsory, Americans typically have a much higher turnout for elections (70-80%), something Colm attributes to a tradition of much stronger involvement in the political system for the average American. And if he is elected? “My hope is to fight for the people in West Oregon. To fight for the values, for jobs and to be a true advocate for the people,” he said. However he says that Ireland, and in particular Co Leitrim, will always hold a special place for his family and himself. “I was brought up with a strong love for Ireland. I play the flute, I went to the Gaeltacht twice growing up, I learned set dancing and I have visited here often throughout my life “This is the place we can always come back to , a place to remember the love and sacrifice so many made through the generations for us. People like my great-grandfather Jimmy, who left with the hope that his children could have a better life, could be free,” he said. “The people of Ireland are the guardians of that legacy, that history and love of Ireland and every time I come home I feel a part of that.” Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500   Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition The late Ryan Doyle.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Jobs Homes Cars Classifieds Member Rewards subscribe COLUMN: Corruption continues to define Hillary's character Monday Aug 8, 2016 at 11:53 AM Aug 8, 2016 at 11:54 AM This column is a plea to all the Marines and sailors who haven’t registered to vote or who are registered but may feel casting a vote doesn’t matter. I have news: Your vote does matter and it is extremely important that you exercise your franchise this November because your life may hinge on who is elected as this nation’s 45th president. To understand the gravity of the situation I’m about to describe to you, one must have a basic knowledge of several things — all involving the Democratic Party’s nominee for president, Hillary Rodham Clinton. She, her husband Bill and daughter Chelsea are the three directors of the Clinton Foundation and its subsidiary the Clinton Global Initiative, a nonprofit established in 2005 that “convenes global leaders to create and implement innovative solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges,” according to its website. This lofty mission statement, loosely translated, actually means the CF and the CGI are convenient repositories through which international countries and foreign agents can channel money — ostensibly to use for humanitarian endeavors — but in reality as a way to curry favor with the U.S. via Hillary Clinton’s State Department and, as they hope, a Hillary Clinton White House. Since its founding, the Clinton Foundation has received more than $2 billion in cash and pledges, according to a Feb. 18, 2015, Washington Post article on the Clintons. But not every dollar pressed into Bill’s palm makes its way to needy hands. In a New York Post story published April 26, 2015, staff writer Isabel Vincent wrote: “The Clinton family’s mega-charity took in more than $140 million in grants and pledges in 2013 but spent just $9 million on direct aid. The group spent the bulk of its windfall on administration, travel, salaries and bonuses, with the fattest payouts going to family friends. On its 2013 tax forms, the most recent available, the foundation claimed it spent $30 million on payroll and employee benefits; $8.7 million in rent and office expenses; $9.2 million on conferences, conventions and meetings; $8 million on fundraising; and nearly $8.5 million on travel. In all, the group reported $84.6 million in “functional expenses” on its 2013 tax return and had more than $64 million left over — money the organization has said represents pledges rather than actual cash on hand.” Hillary Clinton was U.S. Secretary of State from January 2009 until February 2013. Now add the state of American / Russian relations in 2009 when President Barack Obama announced after a state visit to the communist country a need for a “reset” in the two countries’ relationship with one another and the formation of the U.S.–Russian Bilateral Presidential Commission. The U.S. delegation was headed by Secretary Clinton and the Russian side was represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The intent of the endeavor was to increase peaceful cooperation through joint projects involving international security, economic initiatives and strengthening social ties between Americans and Russians. The incubator for much of this collaboration was centered in the Moscow suburb of Skolkova, a small town with half the population of Jacksonville. Skolkova is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s pet-project of turning this tiny enclave into the equivalent of America’s Silicon Valley. Putin anted up $5 billion to finance Skolkova while Secretary Clinton recruited American companies such as Google, Cisco and Intel plus nearly two dozen venture capitalist. In 2012, after a letter of understanding was drafted, more than 28 partners were identified as committed to the project. And what shouldn’t come as a surprise for anyone who has followed Bonnie and Clod Clinton from their days at Yale, through Little Rock, Ark. and Washington, D.C., of the 28 entities, 17 of them are on record contributing tens of millions of dollars to CF and CGI in the form of outright donations or payments to former President Bill Clinton for speeches. But as money was flowing like water from well-heeled U.S. companies, venture capitalists and Russian investors, including the Kremlin, research and development taking place inside the communist “Silicon Valley’ was raising red flags with U.S. intelligence agencies. Since 2011, U.S. analysts believed Skolkova engineers were developing military components including a hypersonic cruise missile engine, delivering lethal munitions to strike anywhere in the world within 60 minutes from launch. Imagine this capability in the hands of Putin, his proxies or rogue nations or terrorist groups? The Federal Bureau of Investigation warned state department officials, including Secretary Clinton, of the dual role they believed was unfolding in Skolkovo. Those concerns were ignored by Secretary Clinton either because she had faith in Putin’s promise of only good intentions emanating from the high-tech collaboration or that she didn’t want to curtail the flow of money from wealthy Skolkova participants to the CF and CGI. The Clintons’ greed channeled through their nefarious foundation has surely made them all uber-wealthy; but their avarice may have given our enemies the ability to develop lethal weapons that members of the armed forces could confront someday on the battlefield. The Clintons have a long history of self-gratification at the expense of others, from Hillary’s 1,000-percent return on a cattle-futures contract, their involvement in the Arkansas land deal called Whitewater to the Clinton Global Initiative, an entity that when the light of truth is shined upon it may bring new meaning and raise the bar in the pay-to-play arena. A wise man once told me — Charlie Smith, are your ears ringing? — “Zebras don’t change their stripes.” Hillary Clinton has proven through her tenure as secretary of state that she does not have the best interests of America at heart — think Benghazi and now, it appears, Skolkovo. Her motives are and have always been-self-serving, which is why she has remained tethered to her partner in crime, Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton certainly has not earned a reset on her character and does not deserve to be elected president of the United States and commander-in-chief. And so, to my active duty and retired friends: Please take the time to register to vote and when Nov. 8 rolls around make time to cast your vote. Your survival, as well as the survival of your country, may depend on who wins in November. Swansboro resident Mike McHugh is an advertising account executive with The Daily News.

Credit: DobaKung Related Review: Windows 10 Anniversary Update fails to excite 20 fixes for a Windows 10 update meltdown After the Anniversary Update: What’s next for Windows 10? Video The top 5 features of Windows 10 Microsoft announced in a TechNet blog post last week that it will not be adding any more features to Windows 10 this year but instead will hold off for two major upgrades planned in 2017. The news comes on the heels of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which added many new features—and broke a few things in the process. The announcement came in a blog post titled, "What's new for IT pros."  Windows 10, version 1607 is our third Windows 10 feature update released. Based on feedback from organizations moving to Windows 10, this will be our last feature update for 2016, with two additional feature updates expected in 2017. This is in line with what Microsoft has already said. Back in May, the company said it would offer two major feature updates to Windows 10 per year. That would be a bump over the current rate, which has been one update per year. The Anniversary Update had been code-named "Redstone," and a second Redstone is planned for April of next year. There has been chatter of a Redstone 3, but at this point would be at least a year off.  While all the chatter has been about the Anniversary Update (a.k.a. Redstone, a.k.a Build 1607) for consumers, it has a lot for IT managers to love as well: Windows Information Protection (WIP), which helps to protect enterprise apps and data on enterprise-owned and personal devices against potential data leakage without otherwise interfering with the user experience. Improvements to Windows Hello for Business, which now includes both Windows Hello and Microsoft Passport. Simplified provisioning with Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD), and the ability to install Windows ICD with the full Windows Assessment Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) or by itself. The ability to connect to a remote PC that is joined to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Improved taskbar management, including the ability to add and remove pinned apps from the taskbar as an administrator, while still allowing users to pin/unpin apps and change the order of pinned apps on the taskbar after the enterprise configuration is applied. Expanded mobile device management (MDM) capabilities. Shared PC mode, which optimizes Windows 10 for shared use scenarios, such as touchdown spaces in an enterprise or temporary customer use in a retail business. The inclusion of App-V and UE-V as Windows features (instead of inclusion in the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP), which required a separate download and installation). Windows Defender enhancements, including the release of Windows Defender Offline (which allows you to run offline scans), Block at First Sight (which dramatically improves detection times for new malware), enhanced notifications, and potentially unwanted application (PUA) detection. Problems with the update And like any major update, there seem to be problems with it. Reports of freeze-ups are piling up in a Reddit thread. There doesn't seem to be any one hardware issue with this, as people all have a variety of different components. So, it can't be blamed on, say, bad drivers from Intel or Nvidia.  Windows Central has its own list of fixes for problems that have cropped up, particularly around the installation. And Ubuntu users report that the update is messing with their Linux partitions if shared on the same drive. As for me, yes, I had problems with the update, too. After a long update, my computer wouldn't work. All I got was a black desktop with a mouse arrow for a desktop. When I couldn't soft reboot, I hit the reset button on my PC and on reboot, up came a window saying it was restoring my PC to its prior version. Within five minutes I was back to Build 1511. Microsoft had a long gestation for Redstone, so I'm really surprised at all these problems. I'd have expected it to go much smoother, even if it was a seriously ambitious upgrade.

"Ikey has finished the GNOME 3.20 stack upgrade and we’re currently evaluating the latest applications and resolving pain-points around the upgrade, such as GNOME Calendar," says Joshua Strobl. "We’re currently in the process of enabling further hardware support by way of Linux 4.7, which will bring a plethora of improvements." LibreOffice 5.2 now available in Solus Of course, there are also numerous enhancements to the Solus platform, such as support for Go 1.6.3, and many up-to-date applications like Mozilla Firefox 48.0, LibreOffice 5.2, Docker 1.12.0, Rust 1.10.0, LLVM 3.8.1, Atom 1.9.6, FeedReader 1.6, Fotoxx 16.08, GNOME-MPV 0.10, Mercurial 3.9, nginx 1.11.3, node.js 6.3.1, OpenSSH 7.3p1, Telegram 0.10, and lots more.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS SEARCH Justice and Public Safety White House Recognizes North Dakota Drone Effort The state's test site received recognition for requesting permission to fly drones beyond the line of visual sight at the Grand Sky business park on Grand Forks Air Force Base. by Brandi Jewett, Grand Forks Herald / August 8, 2016 0 (TNS) — WASHINGTON, D.C. — Accomplishments made with unmanned aircraft systems in North Dakota were recognized recently during a workshop hosted on the White House campus. The "Workshop on Drones and the Future of Aviation" assembled leaders from areas of industry, academia and government to outline the future of integrating unmanned aircraft, also known as drones, into the national airspace and discuss necessary policies to ensure that happens, according to a news release. "Recognizing the fact that North Dakota as a test site is helping to pave the way for regulations really solidifies the reason why it was important that we were there," said Nicholas Flom, director of safety for the Northern Plains UAS Test Site, who attended the workshop. RELATEDWill Drones Become as Commonplace as Laptops?North Dakota Drone Test Site Gets Night-Flight Approval The North Dakota test site is one of six designated by the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct research into drones' airspace integration. The test site received recognition for requesting permission to fly drones beyond the line of visual sight at the Grand Sky business park on Grand Forks Air Force Base. The test site is seeking to fly the aircraft up to 29,000 feet above ground without the use of a chase planes. These planes are tasked with tailing a drone during flights beyond the sight of the drone's pilot, which is otherwise prohibited. Another effort highlighted was the test site's success in securing a block of spectrum from the Federal Communications Commission for transmitting commands and data during drone flights. Accessing spectrum an increasingly challenging feat nationwide, Flom said. "Spectrum is not readily available throughout the country," he said. "One of the things they were discussing was airspace might be a challenge to get, but what we're finding is dedicated spectrum is even more difficult." Spectrum will play a large role in beyond-line-of-sight commercial drone flights, which could utilize secure transmission bands for their control systems. Next steps Flying beyond the line of visual sight — along with accompanying sense and avoid technology — is considered by many in the industry as the next significant step needed to fully integrate commercial drones into the national airspace. "Safely integrating drones into our airspace is one of the FAA's top priorities, and we're determined to get it right," Michael Huerta, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, told the workshop crowd. "It's essential for our economy and our role as a global aviation leader." Also speaking were representatives from the U.S. Department of the Interior, Intel, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Edison Electric Institute. The Edison Electric Institute, which represents all U.S. investor-owned electric companies, highlighted its work with Sharper Shape, an aerial inspection company with a research office in North Dakota. Sharper Shape and EEI announced a partnership in March that will work to develop capabilities for beyond-line-of-sight flights for electrical companies to use to inspect infrastructure. Part of that will include seeking approval to bring a beyond-line-of-sight demonstration to the FAA. "That was a great plug for a North Dakota company doing great things," Flom said. The workshop was co-host by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Foundation. In addition to Flom and other test site representatives, stakeholders from organizations such as Trumbull Unmanned, Lockheed Martin, Google and the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership were present. The workshop comes a few weeks prior to the effective date of new federal regulations for commercial and governmental drone use. The rules, known as Part 107, will be implemented Aug. 29. "The White House has really not been involved with this but, now that we have set rules, they wanted to learn as much as possible," Flom said. ©2016 the Grand Forks Herald (Grand Forks, N.D.)

Technology Tesla Partner Nvidia Expected To Flex Its PC-Gaming Muscles In Q2 Nvidia is slated Thursday to report a fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating sales following PC-positive commentary from Intel and AMD. (Nvidia) ALLISON GATLIN 8/08/2016 Reprints Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) is slated Thursday to report a fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating sales following PC-positive commentary from Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in June, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said Monday. Lipacis boosted his price target on Nvidia stock to 69 from 56 and reiterated his buy rating. Nvidia rose 0.9% to 58.74 on the stock market today, hitting a fresh high. Shares are up 78% for the year. For Q2, analysts expect Nvidia to report $1.35 billion in sales and 37 cents earnings per share, up a respective 17% and 640% vs. the year-earlier period. Nvidia stock is Lipacis' top pick. He expects upside over the next six to 18 months on the 16-nanometer Pascal architecture Nvidia launched in May for high-end gaming. Pascal is Nvidia's first node change in four years. "Historically, Nvidia has seen GPU (graphics processing unit) revenues increase as much as 70% (trailing 12 months) following a new platform launch," Lipacis wrote in a research report. Better-than-expected PC commentary from Intel and AMD could buoy Nvidia into its Q2 print. PC gaming remains a strong segment, outplaying broader macro declines in the PC industry. Two-in-one products continue to drive robust sales. IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia has an IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is fifth in the Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, which is up 17% for the year. The group is ranked No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked, climbing from No. 97 over 13 weeks. For more information on Nvidia stock, check out the IBD Stock Checkup. Lipacis also sees upside in data center and deep learning. During the May-quarter conference call with analysts, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang identified deep learning as "a very important field of machine learning." Machine learning is being used "to discover insight that, quite frankly, isn't possible otherwise," he said. Nvidia is parlaying its Tesla partnership into an autonomous platform that uses two systems-on-a-chip and two GPUs. In the automotive market, Nvidia is facing stout competition from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), the latter of which has also unveiled an autonomous-driving platform. For 2016, Lipacis models $5.67 billion in sales and $1.60 EPS ex items, up 7% and 17%, respectively, vs. 2015. He models $2.50 EPS ex items in 2018. Over three years, Lipacis expects Nvidia to reach $3.50 EPS minus items.

Aside from the previously announced new iPhone 7, fans are expecting the company to release a brand-new 2016 update for their all-in-one desktop computer, the Apple iMac. According to the latest reports regarding the new Apple iMac, the company is expected to incorporate some of the latest technologies that are currently available into their new desktop computer. The new 2016 iMac is reportedly going to be coming with the latest AMD Polaris 10-based graphics processing unit (GPU). The new graphics chips are based on the latest FinFET 14-nanometer architecture technology that promises extremely fast performance along with significantly less power consumption. AMD has already released a number of consumer grade products, and it is highly likely that they will also be making these products available for Apple for them to add to their machines. If the cards are indeed incorporated in the new iMac, it will be making the all-in-one computer completely ready for virtual reality (VR) applications. This would be a big step for Apple as, currently, none of their computers are VR-ready. Oculus' Palmer Luckey had even mentioned that their device will not work with Apple machines as they apparently do not have the hardware capable of running VR programs. There are several reports that predict that the 2016 iMac may also be coming with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processor. However, some publications have claimed that it is possible for Apple to go with AMD Zen processors, which are also quite capable. Other components such as the storage, display, RAM, and other hardware will also reportedly be upgraded. For now, there hasn't been any confirmation yet as to the actual specs of the 2016 iMac, but reports have claimed that the new device may be coming out as soon as October this year.

 One of Apple's biggest weaknesses is becoming a strength Kif Leswing Aug. 8, 2016, 10:14 AM 7,560 facebook linkedin twitter email print Andy Hertzfeld Apple, famous as the computing company that likes to "think different," is going corporate.  In fact, nearly half of all iPads are bought by corporations and governments, according to a Forrester estimate included in a feature about Apple's enterprise strength.  Since teaming up with IBM  in 2014 to sell iPhones and iPads to big Fortune 500 companies, Apple's products have become the "preferred mobile computing devices for corporations," reports the Times. Companies like British Airways deploy as many as 40 custom iPad apps for flight attendants, pilots, and airline workers. These apps allow the airline to, say, rebook a passenger or check a passenger manifest. British Airways has already bought 17,000 iPads for its workers and is looking to buy more.  Many enterprise apps are developed by IBM, which has created 100 enterprise apps for over 2000 companies, and now generates more than half a billion dollars from Apple-related services. IBM has made apps for insurance companies, retailers, and other specific industries. One of the reasons why businesses have decided to embrace iPhones and iPads is that Apple's security is superior to Android's, thanks to the way Apple controls both the hardware and software.  It's quite a turnaround for Apple, which is seeking new sources of revenue as sales have dropped on an annual basis for the past two quarters. Apple's always sold computers to businesses, but while CEO Steve Jobs was in charge from 1998 to 2011, the company was significantly more focused on consumers. Aside from the famous photo of Jobs flipping off the IBM logo, there's one fun anecdote that hammers the change home. Back in 2008, Jobs called chief information officers, the people who buy computers for big businesses, "orifices," according to a story told by VMWare CEO Patrick Gelsinger: “I went with (former Intel CEO Paul) Otellini to meet with Jobs and his lieutenants. We go into this meeting and say Steve, let’s work together to make your Macs better for enterprise customers. Jobs looks at us and says ‘why would I do anything for that orifice called the CIO?’ At Intel we’re aghast; two-thirds of our business is that orifice called the CIO. He went on to say ‘I’m going to build devices that are irresistible for consumers, and CIOs will just have to deal with it.”   NOW WATCH: Scientists have discovered why American honey bees are turning into zombies Loading video...

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 08, 2016 8:23am   Comments Share: Related NVDA Vetr Crowd Thinks AMD Is Running Hot 7 Biggest Price Target Changes For Tuesday Is A Short Opportunity Brewing At AMD? (Seeking Alpha) Noting that NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) products exhibit momentum, Jefferies’ Mark Lipacis expressed optimism regarding more upside surprises over the next six to eighteen months. The analyst maintained a Buy rating on the company, while raising the price target from $56 to $69. The stock continues to be “a top pick” at Jefferies. Analyst Mark Lipacis expects NVIDIA to achieve the July-quarter expectation of 4 percent sequential growth. He added, however, that the expectations for the October and January quarters, of 7 percent and 2 percent growth, appears conservative, given the launch of the company’s new 16nm GPU platform Pascal and initial ramp of its high-margin Virtual Reality products. 16nm Pascal NVDA launched two high-end graphics cards - GTX 1080 and 1070 - for the gaming market in the July quarter. “Pascal marks NVDA's first mfct-node change in 4 years…We expect Pascal will translate to increased visibility if not upside surprises in 2H16/1H17,” Lipacis wrote. Better PC Commentary Both Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) indicated better-than-expected PC strength in the July quarter. Datacenter Upside from Deep Learning Applications “While DL [Deep Learning] is not new, recent improvements in data access, cheap storage & faster GPU processing are finally allowing DL training on a broad scale of applications. We think DL-driven demand for GPUs could result in upside to our estimates over the next 18 months,” the analyst added.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Fossil Could Have A New Smartwatch In The Works By Tyler Lee on 08/08/2016 02:03 PST Fossil is a company some of you guys might associate with leather goods such as handbags, backpacks, bracelets, and so on. However the company is also known for their watches, and more recently in 2015, the company also dived into the smartwatch scene with their Fossil Q lineup. That being said, could we be getting close to seeing another Fossil smartwatch? Turns out we could, thanks to the folks at Ausdroid who have spotted an FCC filing by Fossil which seems to indicate that a new smartwatch could be in the works. According to their findings, the device in question is said to sport a 1.4-inch display, a 320×290 display which means that we can expect another flat tyre design, a 400mAh battery, wireless charging, and Bluetooth connectivity. Other than that the rest of the specs are anyone’s guess. Assuming that Fossil keeps doing what they have been doing, we’re also probably looking at the return of Android Wear as their operating system of choice, and we could also expect an Intel CPU under the hood. In any case this is just speculation, but either way we’ll have to wait and see. The company made the announcement for their smartwatches back in August 2015, so if they’re on an annual refresh, we probably won’t have to wait too long for the details. Filed in Gadgets.

I will be ordering a second one for him. This computer is ultra portable, fast and functional. Every time I open it up at a meeting people ask about it. Once I pop off the top and show the tablet they are amazed and say it feels like an iPad. Along with the built in hard drive I have added a microSD card for another 32 GBs of storage. I go back and forth between the keyboard and touch screen. I upgraded to Office 365 and it's now as functional as my work laptop. Perfect for travel and powerful enough for every day use. Date published: 2016-02-04 Rated 5 out of5 byfpettjr fromGreat Portable Windows 10 DeviceI first discovered ASUS when I use to build my own computers from their components. I never had a problem or part failure. I've also owned several of their notebooks and an Android Transformer Pad . I was not impressed with the older Win 8 Transformer which was under powered (and suffered from Win 8 which was a disaster). The T100HA-MS is another story. I needed portable access on a Win 10 platform for my work and discovered this device. It does everything my desktop can do in a small package with decent speed and a great screen. The only thing that could be better is the keyboard which is a bit flimsy compared to my older Transformer. I highly recommend Date published: 2016-03-29 Rated 4 out of5 bybortech fromExcellent for the money!I bought because it was a very good price for the specs, but I wasn't too excited in terms of hardware quality. I was gladly surprised when I received it and started to use it. The tablet itself is very good quality. It's fast, smooth, display is fine. I just don't give 5 stars for two reasons. The keyboard is not as solid as the tablet, but it works fine. The other bad thing is the sound... it's really poor but it's not a deal breaker for me. Very happy with this purchase so far!

The 4GB makes a great difference compared to the 2GB. The battery Lasts enough for a whole day of work. Great performance for the price and portability.

And I can use for work!The magnifier is essential for me and works well. BTW, Win 10 was a success on the 2nd try. Date published: 2016-05-24 Rated 5 out of5 byMikeGNO fromGreat value for what it is - quick and portable.I needed something inexpensive, small, and light for traveling. Plus it had to be faster than the old Latitude 10 tablet with an Atom and 2Gig ram that bogged down quickly and required carrying a Bluetooth keyboard. This fits with power supply and cables in my 3 yr old Rick Steves iPad bag which, as he advertised, v. seldom has to be checked when you enter a museum. The bag marks you as a tourist, but I expect that tourists are easy to pick out anyway.Almost all of the current inexpensive 2-in-1's have only 2GB ram. This was a non-starter for me. I ran across a reference to this model and researched it.I tried it out, opening a lot of browser tabs and programs. It did not bog down like the lower ram models. Having an atom X5 and quicker than usual mass storage apparently help also. The model I got had a 64GB mass storage. It's not an SSD, but it fairly quick. It comes with an SD card slot and I added a 128GB card which gives me plenty of storage. If you are using storage-heavy apps, like the Windows 10 Maps program with offline maps, remember to use the settings to allow everything (almost) to be put onto the SD card. With many apps and a few maps, I still have 30GB free on internal storage.The screen is "only" 1280X800 which snobs sneer at, but what do you want for the price? OTOH, it's very bright and I almost always use it at 30-40% brightness which makes it easy to meet the claimed 6hr life. If you are watching Flash movies on United Airlines Wi-Fi you will only get 4 hours because Flash eats power. The screen viewing angle is also very good. The screen is fine for Office use and browsing.Cons: The keyboard sorta sucks, mainly because there is no palm rejection and you keep moving the cursor by accident. Keyboard is small, but this is a 10" device and it has to be. Works better with practice.Other:keyboard/screen attachment very solid and positive, but releases easily when you pull it hard. Seems to be magnets as it picked up some Canadian coins on a trip to Montreal :)Hard finish is nice and the clamshell design protects the screen and innards nicely when closed.Windows 10 works well, on it, the only bug I've seen is occasionally the graphics driver displays a warning that the device driver crashed and restarted. Not common. An Intel problem that I hope will be fixed with an update.Comes with the mobile version of Office apps as a plus. I have an Office365 subscription but there's no need to install it as Word Mobile and OneNote work nicely on this size device and show the convenience of OneDrive. Example: I used OneNote on my phone to document a nice steak dinner I was having. It even lets you add pictures to the Notes. When I later wrote a Trip Advisor review, opened the Note from OneDrive one the Asus and typed the review in Word while referencing my Note. Very handy for that and I'm sure it would be handy for documenting business meetings. Date published: 2016-05-22 Rated 5 out of5 byTinkerTom fromAn excellent buy.An excellent buy. Something can be cheap and not work well or it can be inexpensive and work very well; this is the latter! Date published: 2016-01-01 Rated 5 out of5 bypc615 fromLove ItFast and responsive.

New Delhi: Car rental firm Carzonrent is looking to invest up to Rs.400 crore over the next five years to beef up business verticals, including self drive car service ‘Myles’, besides technology upgradation as it eyes Rs.5,000-crore revenue by 2021. The New Delhi-based company offers chauffeured vehicles on rental basis to corporates, institutions and SMEs, besides self drive vehicles. “It seems to be quite an aggressive target but with the kind of work we have done in the past 15 years to consolidate our operations, technology and network, we are quite confident of achieving a revenue target of Rs.5,000 crore,” Carzonrent MD and CEO Rajiv Vij told PTI. The industry as a whole has reached an interesting and inflection point, ready to expand rapidly, he added. The company’s current turnover is around Rs.350 crore. “We are adding new clients everyday. We have built a reputation over a period of time, enhanced technology, added new partners and all these things give us confidence to achieve our set targets,” Vij said. When asked about investments, he said that in order to expand fleet and enter new cities, the company will invest in the range of Rs.300-400 crore over the next five years. “Some of it will come from internal accruals. Besides, we may also look at some stage to raise capital by either public listing or raising from the equity partners,” Vij said. Carzonrent has already invested around $9 million in the last two-and-a-half years. The company offers its car rental services to various corporates, including Emirates, Accenture, Intel, TCS and Amazon, across 21 cities. Carzonrent currently enjoys a market share of around 22% in the organised car rental market and is growing at 30% year-on-year, Vij said. Its self drive service Myles, which started operations with just 14 vehicles two years back, now has a fleet of 1,200 vehicles. “It (Myles) is going to be very huge business for us. By the end of the year, we aim to have a fleet of around 5,000 cars,” the CEO said. He added that the company has established Research and Technology Development Lab in Delhi and Bangalore, besides a National Command Centre (NCC). The company is adding manpower in these centres in order to support future growth, he said. “The current strength of NCC will go up from 200 to 600 while employee strength in Bangalore will go up to 200 from the current 50,” he added.

Conflicts Terrorism Disasters Global Economy Environment Religion Scandals Regions isis ISIS claims to have captured trove of U.S. military gear By Lucas Tomlinson Published August 07, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print   ISIS fighters in Afghanistan claimed to have recently seized a trove of sensitive U.S. military equipment – including communications gear, a rocket launcher and the ID card of a U.S. soldier –but it remains unclear how the items came into the terror group’s possession. There was no immediate information on when the pictures, posted to social media on Saturday, were taken, though the U.S. soldier’s ID expires in 2017, a possible sign the photos are relatively fresh. There was also no information on how the extremists captured the gear. The American soldier whose identification was pictured, U.S. Army Specialist Ryan Jay Larson, was not captured by ISIS, Brigadier General Charlie Cleveland told Fox News on Sunday. “Obviously, SPC Larson is not captured – he is accounted for and with his unit despite having lost his ID card and possibly some of his equipment during recent operations,” Cleveland said in an email. “Beyond that, there is a lot of equipment in those pictures. “At this point, we don't know if all of the equipment in the pictures was lost during recent operations or at some other time in the past.” #ISIS 'Amaq posted photos of documents and gear of #American soldiers allegedly taken by ISIS fighters in #Nangarhar pic.twitter.com/UDat7qOFvX— SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) August 6, 2016 It’s possible some of the equipment was left behind during a recent operation, but it was not lost due to any kind of hasty withdrawal, Cleveland said. “We do know that U.S. troops were not forced to retreat during any operations,” he said. SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi web activity, published the pictures and said they originated in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province. That’s the location where a company of nearly 150 U.S. Army Rangers recently took part in a multi-day assault against up to 1,500 ISIS-affiliated fighters. Mostly composed of former Taliban members, the fighters have a heavy presence in two districts near Pakistan. Fox News reported the Army Rangers killed “hundreds" of the ISIS fighters, although at some cost – five Rangers were shot and at least two remain hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries. None of the Rangers were killed. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter told Bret Baier on Thursday that the Army Rangers' actions in the operation were “heroic” and confirmed they were involved in heavy combat.

Some people are facing random system freezes that occur shortly after startup and leave their PC unusable. First noticed by Neowin, the scale of the serious issue is revealed by a Reddit thread that now has over 600 replies. No single cause for the freezing has been established. The users are all experiencing the same consequences: a total system lock-up at seemingly random intervals. The freezes usually trigger very soon after turning the PC on. The original poster in the Reddit thread said his computer is usable for little more than 20 seconds. After that, hovering the mouse over the Start menu or taskbar leaves the entire system unresponsive. The only way to recover from the bug is to reboot the PC. This allows for another 20 seconds of usage before it freezes up again. The period of time before the computer will freeze varies for each individual. The bug has been observed to occur across a wide range of hardware configurations and form factors. It persists after disabling third-party startup programs, indicating the problem is caused by system code introduced with the Anniversary Update. A variety of fixes have been suggested by various users. So far, there doesn't seem to be a general solution though. Some procedures work for some people but produce no results for others. One popular idea is to move the locations of the app installation and user files directories back to the system drive. This is only applicable to people that have previously moved the location of these folders. Other suggestions include updating Intel Rapid Storage technology and installing the Anniversary Update from an ISO file rather than a download. After staying quiet for a while, Microsoft has now responded to the rapidly increasing number of reports. The @MicrosoftHelps Twitter account acknowledged the company is aware of the problems and directed affected users to seek assistance on its support forums. In a post on its support site, Microsoft suggested users run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter in a first attempt to fix the bugs. If that fails, it advises the computer is started in safe mode and then clean booted to disable third party software. Replies in the Reddit thread already indicate this approach doesn't always work however. With Microsoft now admitting to the issues, its engineering teams should begin diagnosing the cause of the problems. It can then be patched in an upcoming update, although with some PCs unusable for more than a few seconds Safe Mode may again be required. This isn't the first major issue to appear since the launch of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. Other problems include severe bugs when using Xbox One controllers in games and the inability of some laptops to update at all. They end up stuck in a reboot loop and displaying a black screen. While the update has been extensively tested internally and with Windows Insiders, it looks like Microsoft could have done better on quality control.

Sixty-eight percent of Apple's worldwide workforce is male and 56 percent of them are white, although Cupertino is slowly becoming more diverse, according to the company's latest report. Women and people who Apple considers to be underrepresented minorities in the US made up 37 percent and 27 percent of new hires, according the the report. Both categories are 5 percent higher than Apple's overall employee makeup, and are also 6 percent higher than they were in 2014. Apple says 54 percent of new hires in the US are now minorities. Asians make up the largest group at 24 percent, followed by blacks and Hispanics at 13 percent each. Whites, meanwhile, make up 46 percent of new hires. Apple releases its diversity report each summer. It celebrated the diversity advances it reported this year as a key step in helping to "break down historical barriers in tech." Those barriers, which include not only underrepresentation of minorities but also unequal pay that favors men, are well-known to Apple and its competitors. Intel last year announced it would spend $300 million to attract more women and minorities for engineering and computer science positions. //Related Articles How to Tackle Tech's Diversity Problem Facebook also wants to close the tech diversity gap, and one of its many initiatives is TechPrep, a website in English and Spanish that offers underrepresented groups information about computer science and resources to help them get started in the industry. Apple CEO Tim Cook has admitted in the past that he is not satisfied with the diversity of the company's employees. In a note accompanying 2014's diversity report, Cook said that the stats showing a majority white, male workforce are "not new to us, and we've been working hard for quite some time to improve them." It appears that those efforts are gaining ever-so-slight momentum; the percentage of employees who are male has been decreasing 1 percent per year for the past three years.

The New Delhi-based company offers chauffeured vehicles on rental basis to corporates, institutions and SMEs, besides self drive vehicles.

These days, however, things are different. The arrival of Chromebooks has driven PC makers to change their approach and release laptops that are much more appealing to consumers shopping in this segment. With a thin profile, solid specs and a nice design, the Jumper Ezbook 2 seems to be the perfect example of a new-age entry-level Windows laptop. It is priced well below the magical $200 mark, which, at least on paper, makes it a very attractive option. But just how good is it really? Design and Build Quality Straight after taking the Ezbook 2 out of box you will remark just how similar it looks compared to an Apple MacBook Air. It's all silver, with the exception of the keyboard, which is done in black with silver characters. Power it up, and you will notice that the Jumper logo on the back is backlit, just like on a MacBook. It looks much more expensive than it actually is. Of course, the Ezbook 2 is not made out of aluminum, but rather plastic. And it feels like it. The use of plastic is to be expected at this price point, after all, so I do not perceive it as a negative. What I did not expect is the amount of flex in the keyboard, which is pronounced, and the creaks that can be heard while handling the device. It may be down to the strength of the chassis or the quality of the plastic but, either way, this is something worth mentioning. You can see further evidence of build quality issues when looking at the port cutouts, which do not have straight edges. The USB ports, of which there are two, are not without problems either, as the only way I can connect my mouse is by forcing the connector in. Also, the ports are not labeled. This can be an issue when you want to charge the Ezbook 2 and you plug the round power connector in the 3.5 mm headphone jacket instead of the dedicated port. They look identical, so it is easy to get it wrong the first time. Just like the MacBook Air, the Ezbook 2 has a black panel at the rear. But, unlike the MacBook Air, there is a gap on the left side of it where it meets the silver plastic. It is not bothersome, however. But it all adds up to make me question just how much effort has been put into developing this laptop. Another problem, this time more serious, is that one of the screws holding the plastic cover at the bottom popped off recently. It landed on the floor next to my bed, but had it fallen off somewhere else I may not have found it. This is the first time that I have ever noticed this on a laptop. Display One of the main things that appeal about the Ezbook 2 is its display. Jumper has opted for a 14-inch panel with a resolution of 1,920 by 1,080, which makes it stand out in a sea of entry-level laptops. It does not disappoint. The high resolution works fine for a screen of this size. Using a scaling setting of 125 percent in Windows 10 everything is easy to read and sharp. Viewing angles leave something to be desired, and colors are not as vibrant as I would like them to be, but for casual use it is more than adequate. Keyboard and Touchpad The keyboard is another area where Jumper has tried to imitate the MacBook Air, but while adding its own touch. It looks similar, though it is designed to integrate nicely with Windows 10. So, there are dedicated buttons at the top for things like search, disabling the touchpad, and sending emails, but also for adjusting the volume and brightness. These functions are activated in conjunction with pressing the Fn key, which is positioned right where it should be, exactly to the right of the control key. So, if you are coming from a different keyboard, chances are you will feel right at home in a matter of minutes. The layout works nicely for typing, and key travel is good. I like the fact that there are home, page up, page down, end, delete, print screen and pause keys on the right side. Jumper has put some thought into the keyboard layout. But, and this is a huge but, the quality of the keyboard itself disappoints. A lot. I mentioned the travel in the keyboard, but that is not the real issue. No. In fact, it is relatively common on entry-level laptops based on my experience. What is frustrating is that some presses do not always register, so you end up going back and forth while typing to fix that. And, afterwards, you might see the cursor suddenly jumping to a different row. While I have noticed the first problems on other keyboards it was less pronounced. But I have never ever seen the cursor moving randomly on the screen. The cursor issue manifests itself when hitting certain keys on the right side of the keyboard. It is likely that the problem is caused by the considerable travel, which may lead the circuitry to believe that certain keys have been pressed when they haven't. Regardless of what causes it, these issues make the keyboard unusable for me, which is a shame because the laptop has some potential. The touchpad is another major disappointment. The problems that I have are that the cursor sometimes hangs or moves slowly while running my finger over the touchpad, and when I use two fingers to scroll up or down it typically sees that as a zoom gesture. This is clearly a software issue. The touchpad seems to work with the default Windows drivers, so there are no useful customization options available to tweak how it works. And it is a shame, because I believe that it could be optimized to work much better. However, out of the box, you need to use a mouse to browse the web, otherwise it is a frustrating experience. Performance The Ezbook 2 is equipped with a 1.34 GHz quad core Intel Cherry Trail X5-Z8300 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB eMMC storage. On paper, that means it should handle tasks like web browsing and watching YouTube videos just fine, but ask more than that from it and it will struggle. The processor and storage are really meant for low-power applications, so performance is not a priority. Knowing this, I did not have high expectations, but I did expect the Ezbook 2 to handle web browsing just fine. And, generally, it gets the job done. But if you throw more than a few tabs at it that takes a toll on performance. It heats up on the right side (left side in the photo below), but not to the point that it becomes unbearable, and it struggles to play YouTube videos smoothly. Even going down to 720p levels of quality did not help much. I know that Windows 10 is not a resource hog, so the performance issues likely stem from the hardware side of things. With a cooler the Ezbook 2 could perform much better, but these chips are designed with passive cooling in mind so the temperature goes down only by throttling the chip. The only holes that you can see are in the black panel at the rear, and they are quite small. Charging the battery while using the Ezbook 2 leads to overheating though, and that is when I am tempted to put it down and do something else until it is ready to go again. A full charge is estimated to take in excess of five hours, during which it can be used comfortably only on a table. Battery Life Battery life is good on the Ezbook 2. I can typically use it for more than a couple of hours while browsing before having to pull out the charger, and it seems to hold up fine too while sleeping. The specs sheet points to a 10,000 mAh battery operating at 3.7V, which means that it is a 37 Wh unit. That is slightly larger than the battery on an 11-inch MacBook Air, to put things into perspective. Portability The Ezbook 2 is a fairly small and light laptop. It measures 34.65 x 22.95 x 1.76 cm (13.64 x 9.04 x 0.69 in) and weighs a claimed 1.18 kg (2.6 lbs). The small footprint makes it easy to carry in a bag, and the weight does not get in the way at all. If you want to use it on the go, you should know that it comes with a mini HDMI port, microSD card slot, and 3.5 mm headphone jack, so you will be able to connect it to an external monitor, expand the storage, and plug in a pair of headphones if you need to. Software Another positive of the Ezbook 2 is the fact that it comes without any bloatware that I can find. There are no strange programs installed on it, only a copy of Windows 10 Home. There are some tweaks, like the availability of a single power profile instead of the usual three, but other than that it is pretty close to a vanilla experience. The fact that it ships with a x86 processor means you can install most Windows software and run it without issues. It is meant for light applications though, so you should stick to programs that do not require a great deal of resources. There is enough storage out of the box for Windows 10 and lots of apps, and if you need more you can always get a good microSD card to offload some of the content from the internal storage. Windows 10 is nicely optimized for such scenarios, so it should make for a pleasant experience. Verdict As you can see, the Ezbook 2 is a mixed bag in the worst possible sense. It has some quality bits, which will appeal to consumers shopping for an affordable laptop, but it also has some terrible bits, which make it impossible for me to recommend it. The trouble with the Ezbook 2 is that Jumper has thrown a lot of good components at it but did not go the extra mile to make sure they all work together nicely. It feels like a collection of parts not as a whole, and, sadly, it cannot be improved as it stands. GearBest currently has the Jumper Ezbook 2 available for preorder for $167.89.

While Apple, the Magellan Global Fund’s top holding, lost 13 percent in the past 12 months and has been one of the biggest drags on its performance, the others have both gained more than 20 percent over the same period. Magellan wants to own businesses where artificial intelligence “will get monetized” and companies such as these provide avenues to do so, Magellan Chief Executive Officer Hamish Douglass said in an interview Monday. Artificial intelligence is approaching a “tipping point of exponential technological advancement,” he said in the company’s annual report to investors. The A$7.9 billion ($6 billion) Magellan Global Fund has beaten all but 2 percent of its peers in the five years to July 27, delivering an average annual return of more than 20 percent, although its 0.9 percent loss over the past 12 months has been less stellar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of July 28. Douglass said the fund has more than doubled its exposure to technology stocks in the past two years as it bets innovations in artificial intelligence will reshape how companies conduct business. Massive Advances “I describe it as a nuclear arms race that’s occurring,” he said by phone. “Many of these big technology platform companies appear to be making massive advances in machine-learning, voice recognition.” Other technology firms that feature in Douglass’s portfolio include Larry Ellison’s Oracle Corp., chipmaker Intel Corp. and online marketplace eBay Inc., according to the annual report. He is also backing credit card company Visa Inc. and fast-food franchiser Yum! Brands Inc., while home improvement chain Lowe’s Cos. and CVS Health Corp. round out his 10 biggest investments. The biggest contributors to the fund’s returns in the year through June 30 were Microsoft, Lowe’s and Visa, while the biggest detractors were U.K. lender Lloyds Banking Group Plc, supermarket owner Tesco Plc and Apple.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 7 August 2016 | MYT 9:00 AM Google, Facebook and Apple draw hordes of tech tourists by ethan baron On the itinerary: A tourist posing for photos at the Android Garden on the Google campus in Mountain View, California. Iconic high tech firms in Silicon Valley have become tourist destinations. — Bay Area News Group/TNS SAN FRANCISCO: Move over, Alcatraz; clear some way, cable cars; and back off, Mickey: Silicon Valley is giving San Francisco and other Golden State attractions a run for their money when it comes to drawing hordes of tourists.  Because for some tourists, taking a selfie in front of Facebook is all part of the vacation plan.  "We are all the way from India," said Pavi Rajkumar, with family members at Facebook's "thumbs-up" sign outside its Menlo Park headquarters on a recent morning. Alongside Rajkumar was her nephew Shriman Sendhil, who spends two to three hours a day on the social network and claims 1,000 Facebook friends.  "This is the only thing that woke him up," Rajkumar said of the visit to the company. "Disneyland didn't work."  Quietly but indubitably, tech tourism has become a thing. Hundreds of people a day visit the Facebook sign and Google's Android sculpture garden in Mountain View, with many stopping at other tech giants as well, snapping photos and shooting video. And they don't even get to go inside.  "What you're seeing are people on a pilgrimage," said Stanford communications professor Fred Turner, who regularly drives past Facebook and ponders the selfie-seeking travellers. Most technology tourism is of the do-it-yourself variety, but several companies offer customised tours.  Turner compared the new breed of tourists to pilgrims who travelled to the Holy Land in the Middle Ages to visit churches engaged in large-scale colonialism.  "We now see pilgrimages to firms that in ways both good and bad are colonising our everyday lives," Turner said. "Folks are looking for a physical place behind the kind of dematerialised experience that they have online."  A visit to Google's Android garden in Mountain View presents a physical place, and more: Here, tourists walk among super-sized representations of the operating system's mascots, including a hulking doughnut, immense cupcake and giant ice-cream sandwich, representing the 11 Android iterations.  "We use Google every day, every hour, so we wanted to visit it," said Daniel Rezende, 34, an electrical engineer from Brazil on vacation with his wife, Monica, a 37-year-old dentist. "It's an important place."  Turner's pilgrimage theory also seems to explain why Canadians Vicky Hsu and Philip Huang were at the Facebook sign with their baby and a selfie stick, about 1,000 miles from their Vancouver home.  "We use (Facebook) every day," said Hsu, 30, a banker. Huang, a 37-year-old airport shop manager, gestured toward Facebook's sprawling campus and said, as might be predicted, "It's pretty cool, eh?" They planned to drop in at Google next.  Mostly, tech tourists are not focused on a single company. They hopscotch from firm to firm.  "We just came from Oracle, then we go to HP, Google; we're going to do Tesla, Intel, eBay and Yahoo. And Apple, I forgot Apple," said Ray Santiago, of San Francisco, escorting his friend Eiji Matsumoto, from Tokyo, on a do-it-yourself tour that brought them to the Facebook sign. Matsumoto owns a Japanese company that designs websites.  "That's why I like to see the high-tech companies," said Matsumoto, 46. "Everything is huge, just huge. One company is like one city in Japan."  For the Rezendes, of Brazil, watching Googlers pedal the company's famous multi-coloured employee bikes around the campus highlighted a difference between job requirements at Google and those in Brazil. "Usually we work on just one duty and don't move from building to building," Daniel Rezende said, before he and Monica headed off to visit Apple's headquarters in Cupertino.  It's a short walk from the sculptures to Google's merchandise shop, where a branded sweatshirt costs around US$20 (RM80), a Google lollipop will set you back less than US$3 (RM12), and the most popular purchases among the 300 to 500 people who visit daily are, according to a staffer, Android figurines for US$8 (RM32) to US$15 (RM60) and Google T-shirts for US$15 (RM60).  The notoriously secretive Silicon Valley tech giants offer no public tours of their facilities but generally allow limited public access. Naturally, some visitors push the envelope.  "You need to know a staff member to get a tour," an Australian visitor to Google noted on TripAdvisor in March. As a consolation, the Australian suggested an unauthorised escapade frowned upon by company security. "Can ride a Google bike around the outside of the campus if wanted though," the visitor wrote.  Like Google, Facebook and Apple, Tesla has a branded-merchandise shop at its Palo Alto headquarters. Visitors are prohibited from exploring beyond the lobby, where the shop is located. "They come and try to take pictures of the cars," said a security guard posted in a rear parking lot. "We kick 'em out. That's why we're here."  Some tourists' expectations go unmet. "It was nice to walk between the buildings, take some pictures and see the employees enjoy their lunch break," a visitor to Google's campus posted on a Google Plus thread about Silicon Valley tourism, before griping that Google provided no bathroom access. "We were redirected to a nearby public park," the traveller sniffed.  A TripAdvisor user from London recalled a disappointing incident from a visit to Google. "We got told not to use the Google bikes as they are for employees only, which was a bit of a shame," the traveller complained.  At one of the handful of companies offering Silicon Valley tours, the trip to see the tech icons has been the most popular of its 14 Bay Area tour options for the past year.  "The selfies are the main thing," said Tours By Locals guide Caesar Cypriano, 55. "They do all their postings, and then people on the other side of the globe go, 'Wow, I wish I were there!'" — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Uber launches in congested Bangladesh capital Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Rostov stun Bayern to record first Champions League victory M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

Letter: Gallagher is the leader we need Letters to the editor 9:11 p.m. CDT August 6, 2016 Buy Photo Letters to the Editor (Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE GREEN BAY - The 8th Congressional District primary on Tuesday is approaching. My support is with Mike Gallagher. Voters look past primary and congressional elections. That’s a mistake. Our Republic is built on a representative premise. The 435 congressional representatives make up the backbone of our government — the leaders elected to represent the people. “Leaders.” There aren’t many leaders in Congress. Mike joined the Marines after college; served multiple deployments, earned the rank of captain, and led intelligence teams in Iraq. Mike’s a proven leader, and proven his selfless service and patriotism. A Princeton graduate and receiving a Ph.D. from Georgetown; at 32, Mike could move on privately and be successful. But his motivation lies to serve his country. Members of Congress are supposed to be public servants; serving out of patriotic duty for betterment of neighbors, community, state and nation. Not power or prestige. Mike’s already served his community and country honorably. He’s looking to do it again — just in a different capacity. I served multiple Iraq deployments, conducting convoy security operations in the same area Mike Gallagher led Intel teams. Human/counter intelligence is gritty — requiring embedding. An intellectual, he can also roll up his sleeves, engage, and get the job done. We need fewer lawyers in Congress, and more leaders. The Marine Corps creates leaders. Mike is one of them. A Green Bay native, Mike is a unique candidate Wisconsin is fortunate to have. On August 9th, to me the choice is clear: I’m voting for Mike Gallagher.

DRAM gives Netlist's Hybrid DIMMs a cache veneer, providing what looks like DRAM to applications but is really persistent NAND underneath, cheaper than DRAM and lots of it. HybriDIMM is the result of combining Netlist's HyperVault technology with Samsung DRAM and NAND – a Netlist project that began in November last year. The idea is to use NAND as a DRAM substitute, masking its slowness with predictive software called PreSight, that loads data into DRAM from NAND in anticipation of it being needed. The first generation HybriDIMM is configurable with 256-512GB NAND + 8‑16GB DRAM per DIMM/1866 MTS 3DPC for Broadwell CPUs, with Linux support. It has block storage mode and an application direct mode. Gen 2 HybriDIMM will add to this and be configurable to 1TB NAND + 32GB DRAM per DIMM/2400 MTS 2DPC for Purley processors. It will have both Linux and Windows support. This is broadly similar to Diablo's Memory1 technology, which currently has 128GB DDR4-format DIMMs available, with 256GB ones coming, enabling up to 4TB of "memory" in a 2-socket server. Diablo says Memory1 technology can cost as little as 10 per cent of DRAM capacity. Inspur is qualifying Memory 1 together with a tier 1 server vendor. Generic NVDIMM-P There are three broad classes of non-volatile DIMMs – that is, memory DIMMS with flash onboard – according to JEDEC task group leader Jonathan Hinkle: NVDIMM-N is a DRAM/Flash hybrid memory module that only uses the Flash to save the DRAM contents upon a triggering event such as power failure. It only uses the Flash to make the data in DRAM persistent, and only needs enough Flash to do this. NVDIMM-F is a category we created to represent all-flash DIMMs – think ULLtraDIMM – like those made by Diablo/SanDisk. NVDIMM-P is not fully defined yet and may mostly have speed like DRAM, but may be somewhat slower by including capacity from NVM or NAND Flash. Netlist says HybriDIMM is the industry's first ever Storage Class Memory technology that unifies DRAM and NAND into a resource that provides storage at near-memory speeds and memory at storage capacities, filling a price/performance gap between DRAM and flash. It is intended to help address the explosive growth of unstructured data and the increasing need to process that data in memory. According to Netlist, HybriDIMM: Unites DRAM and NAND flash on LRDIMMs. Lowers memory costs by up to 80 per cent vs traditional DRAM. With buffering technology, improves access times to near-memory speed and 1000x vs PCIe SSD. Is 100 per cent compatible with current x86 servers. Uses PreSight predictive algorithms to pre-fetch and stage required data. Enables the scaling of "memory" to storage-level capacities in terabytes. Using Diablo's calculations for a 2-socket server having 4TB of "memory" with its 256GB Memory1 DIMMS, then, roughly, Netlist 512GB HybriDIMMs should enable an 8TB 2-socket server and its gen 2 1TB HybriDIMMs open the door to a 16TB 2-socket server; think memory rockets in two sockets. HybriDIMM will be sampling later this year. With Intel Optane XPoint DIMMs due later this year, the DRAM-NAND price/performance gap is going to have two technologies and three suppliers jostling to fill it. Will predictive software algorithms enable hybrid DRAM-NAND DIMMS to perform as well as XPoint DIMMs? If they do, then XPoint could find its appeal somewhat dimmed. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register Intel's Optane XPoint DIMMs pushed back – source First media unsuitable for DIMM use and ASIC tuning needed 2 Comments Samsung points high-speed Z-SSD smack-bang at XPoint Flash Memory Summit dazzlement by Korean flashmeister 7 Comments Fancy a wee quasi-DRAM?

(Photo: David Jesse, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo Cloudy skies and required modifications to their car couldn't stop the University of Michigan from winning the 2016 American Solar Challenge race. U-M's car was the only one to finish the race under its own power. The other 23 cars had to be driven across the finish line on trailers after being unable to get enough energy stored in batteries. "There’s been very little to no sun yesterday and today, so the teams are moving pretty slowly towards the finish," said Sarah Zoellick, business director and sophomore in business, about two hours before they crossed the finish line, in a news release. ►Related: U-M solar car has to overcome challenges to defend crown "We were worried about physically getting to the finish," said Shihaab Punia, team leader and junior in computer engineering, in the same release. "Out of all the teams, we were the only ones that went (the) entire race on solar power alone." The lack of sun wasn't the only challenge the team had to overcome. The students had to overcome a seven-minute penalty on each of the eight race days. That’s because adding the wing next to the driver — something they had to do in order to meet required distances between the driver and the edge of the car — made the car slightly wider than regulation size, which led to the penalty. The eight-day, 1,900-mile race started July 30 at Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Ohio. Traversing seven states, this year’s route stopped at nine national parks and historic sites in conjunction with the 100-year anniversary celebration of U.S. National Park Service. It ended at Wind Cave National Park in North Dakota on Aug. 6. Reigning national champion, U-M has won the biennial race eight times since the team formed 26 years ago. The U-M Solar Car Team includes students from a wide variety of disciplines. Nearly 20 students will be on the race crew for the upcoming contest. Major sponsors include Altair, Ford, General Motors, IMRA, U-M’s School of Engineering, Intel and Siemens PLM Software. Contact David Jesse: 313-222-8851 or djesse@freepress.com.

The New York Times, in collaboration with the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, has a deep dive on the corporate financing of think-tank research, including examples involving defense contractors, drones and aircraft carriers: “Think tanks, which position themselves as ‘universities without students,’ have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests.” Story Continued Below “On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. … The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts.” NEW THIS MORNING — JAPAN’S ELDERLY EMPEROR SIGNALS A DESIRE TO STEP DOWN, via The Washington Post: “Japan’s popular emperor sent an unprecedented signal Monday of his desire to abdicate and hand over power to his son, sending the country into constitutionally uncharted waters. In a video address to the nation — only the second time an emperor has spoken to the people in this way — 82-year-old Akihito described how his declining health was curtailing his abilities to fulfill his duties. “‘When I consider that my fitness level is gradually declining, I am worried that it may become difficult for me to carry out my duties as the symbol of the state with my whole being as I have done until now,’ Akihito said in the address Monday. … Under the U.S.-drafted constitution imposed on Japan after World War II, the emperor was stripped of all his powers, becoming a figurehead only. He is legally constrained from saying anything political, meaning that Akihito could not declare his intention to step down because that would require the parliament to amend the Imperial Household Law.” IRAN EXECUTES NUCLEAR SCIENTIST OVER ALLEGED U.S. SPYING, our colleague Nahal Toosi has more here: “The Iranian government has executed a nuclear scientist who was believed to have cooperated with U.S. intelligence but who returned to Iran after claiming he had been abducted and tortured by the CIA. The tale of Shahram Amiri was one of the stranger sagas to emerge from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, testing her diplomatic skills in highly sensitive circumstances. “His death comes just over a year after Iran and the U.S. struck a deal aimed at reining in Iran's nuclear program, an agreement Clinton was instrumental in launching. State-controlled Iranian media on Sunday confirmed Amiri's execution, quoting an Iranian judiciary spokesman as saying that Amiri ‘provided the enemy with vital information of the country.’” — U.S. PAYMENT TO IRAN A PARTISAN WEDGE: President Barack Obama’s dismissal last week of the outrage over a cash payment sent to Iran didn’t stop the debate over the plane-delivered cash, with Republicans charging on Sunday it is encouraging future kidnappings. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), defended the payment as a “legitimate claim against the United States.” HAPPY MONDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we’re always amazed at how many random sports we find ourselves watching during the Olympics.

MORNING D TRIVIA: Eric Magnell was the first to correctly answer that Gen. George S. Patton competed in the first modern Pentathlon at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Wired has a breakdown from 2012 of Patton’s Olympic performance, where he didn't win a medal. Check back Friday for our next trivia question. WAR REPORT — ISIL CLAIMS CAPTURE OF U.S. WEAPONS IN AFGHANISTAN, via Reuters: “Militants linked to Islamic State have released photos that purport to show weapons and equipment that belonged to American soldiers and were captured by the group in eastern Afghanistan. The photos, which came to light on Saturday, show an American portable rocket launcher, radio, grenades and other gear not commonly used by Afghan troops, as well as close up views of identification cards for a U.S. Army soldier, Specialist Ryan Larson. “The U.S. military command in Kabul denied any suggestion the soldier had been captured, saying he ‘has been accounted for and remains in a duty status within his unit.’ American special operations troops have been fighting alongside Afghan forces in a renewed offensive against militants who claim allegiance to Islamic State in Nangarhar Province, which borders Pakistan.” — ARMY ANNOUNCES NEW TROOP DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ: The Army on Friday announced the deployment of 400 soldiers to Iraq as part of the 560 troops that Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced last month would help with the coming Iraqi-led operation to retake the Islamic State stronghold of Mosul. The 400 soldiers are from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, stationed at Fort Campbell, Ky. The soldiers, the Army said in a statement, will join about 1,300 members of the same unit who deployed to Iraq in the spring. — INTENSE FIGHTING IN ALEPPO AFTER REBELS BREAK SIEGE, The Wall Street Journal reports: “Fighting raged in Aleppo on Sunday between rebels and Syrian regime forces, a day after the opposition broke a weeks-long government siege on its eastern half. The rebel factions are making a bid to open a main road for food and humanitarian aid to reach some 300,000 civilians who have been besieged in opposition-held areas of Syria’s former commercial capital.” THE BIG PICTURE — RUSSIA IS WINNING PROXY WAR WITH U.S., writes The New York Times: “For the first time since Afghanistan in the 1980s, the Russian military for the past year has been in direct combat with rebel forces trained and supplied by the C.I.A. The American-supplied Afghan fighters prevailed during that Cold War conflict. But this time the outcome — thus far — has been different. … Russia’s battlefield successes in Syria have given Moscow, isolated by the West after its annexation of Crimea and other incursions into Ukraine, new leverage in decisions about the future of the Middle East.” U.S. RELEASES ITS ‘DRONE PLAYBOOK,’ in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, reports our colleague Josh Gerstein: “President Barack Obama has to personally approve the killing of a U.S. citizen targeted for a lethal drone strike outside combat areas, according to a policy Obama adopted in 2013.The president also is called upon to approve drone strikes against permanent residents of the U.S. and when ‘there is a lack of consensus’ among agency chiefs about whom to target, but in other cases he is simply ‘apprised’ of the targeting decision, the newly disclosed document shows.” — FEDS, FILMMAKER FEUD OVER BERGDAHL, also via POLITICO’s Gerstein: “The Justice Department is urging a federal judge to shut down a bid by filmmaker Mark Boal to block military prosecutors from subpoenaing unaired outtakes of 25 hours of interviews Boal conducted with alleged Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who is facing a court-martial on charges he deserted a U.S. base in Afghanistan. Boal's talks with Bergdahl became the staple of the second season of the celebrated podcast ‘Serial,’ but the bulk of the recorded conversations were never made public.” 2016 WATCH — VIRGINIA APPROPRIATOR RIGELL IS THE FIRST GOP CONGRESSMAN TO BACK GARY JOHNSON: Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia is the first Republican congressman to endorse Libertarian Gary Johnson for president over Donald Trump, POLITICO’s Rebecca Morin reports. Rigell, who is retiring from Congress at the end of his term, said in an interview with The New York Times he was backing Johnson over both Trump and Hillary Clinton. INDUSTRY INTEL — BRITAIN OPENS FORMAL PROBE INTO AIRBUS, via the WSJ: “Britain’s top corruption investigator has opened a formal probe into plane maker Airbus Group SE’s use of consultants, escalating an investigation that has been simmering for months. Airbus said the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office had opened a criminal probe into the company related to irregularities concerning third-party consultants that the British government identified back in April. The company said Sunday the probe is centered on allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil-aviation business of the plane maker, the world’s No. 2 behind Boeing Co. Those allegations are related to irregularities involving third-party consultants, the SFO and Airbus said.” SPEED READ — A bombing at a hospital in Pakistan kills at least 40 people: The Associated Press — Despite airstrikes, the Islamic State is holding on in the Libyan city of Sirte: The Washington Post — Would Hillary Clinton keep John Kerry on?: POLITICO — The new Wounded Warrior Project CEO expects an undisclosed number of layoffs: The Washington Post — China says it flew bombers and other military aircraft over the disputed areas of the South China Sea: WSJ — Thailand voters approve a military-backed constitution through at least December 2017: Reuters — Israeli and American officials are publicly arguing about the Iran nuclear agreement: Defense News — Five years after Congress approved the Budget Control Act, the predictions of disaster for the military have not materialized, but the spending caps still pose a threat: Military Times — The Navy is retiring its “blueberries” camouflage uniforms: Navy Times — U.S. fighters take Pokémon Go to the frontlines in Iraq: Stars and Stripes — Why retired Gen.

Today, their claim to fame is the iPod and iPhone, but they started with the Mac and Mac OS. Sadly, the Mac is so neglected today that even Microsoft is calling them out for the “disservice” they’re doing their customers. Microsoft’s Brian Hall, General Manager for Microsoft’s Surface line recently tweeted the following: I compete with Apple and respect them. but they ARE doing their customers a disservice at times with old tech… https://t.co/PR2pC6TsJh — Brian Hall (@IsForAt) August 5, 2016 As we’ve pointed out in the past, Apple’s Macs are aging. The original Mac Pro is still running on 2013 hardware and many devices, including the Mac Mini and certain MacBook models are still running on 2014 hardware. One might argue that MacOS doesn’t need the latest generation hardware, but regardless of the fact that this is the same argument used by Steve Jobs when he told people they were holding their phones wrong, you’re on the wrong track entirely. While the improvements in terms of pure CPU power are not that significant, vast strides have been made concerning efficiency, graphics and security since 2013 and for a mobile device, these changes are very significant. There’s a very good reason why the Retina MacBook Pro gets by with Iris Pro graphics. Bear in mind that while a 2014 CPU is fine for light use, for a professional, the performance lag is very noticeable. The neglect of Apple’s Mac Pro is even more puzzling. It’s the only device that Apple offers serious professionals and that’s the one device that has been utterly neglected since launch. With the original PowerPC-based iMacs, a delayed upgrade cycle is understandable. With the shift to x86 (Intel), the delay makes no sense. Apple does heavily customise its motherboard design, but so does HP and Lenovo and just about everyone else. It’s not that hard and it shouldn’t be that hard for a $700 billion company. Disservice sounds just about right. Tags: Apple, Apple Mac Hardware, Apple Mac line-up, Apple prices, Apple.

Today, who complains about things that bugged us a decade ago, such as heavy laptops, slow cellular Internet, the inability to send e-mails in planes It was only a matter of time before those geniuses started tackling one of the longest-running pain points in history: passwords. We’re supposed to create a long, complex, unguessable password — capital and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols, with a few Arabic letters thrown in if possible. For each site. Don’t reuse a password. Oh, and change them all every month. Sorry, security experts. Not possible. Not for an average person, not even for you. Nobody has that kind of memory. To make matters worse, passwords aren’t even especially secure. See any recent headline about stolen passwords or about some company’s servers being hacked. Time to kill the password Surely, in the 50 years since we started typing passwords, somebody must have invented a better security system. The answer: Yes and no. Apps such as 1Password and Dashlane memorise and enter long, complicated passwords for you. But most of them cost money, they don’t work on every Web account and the nontechie public don’t know they exist. There’s also two-factor authentication, which makes you type a password and a code texted to your phone to log in. It’s an unbelievable hassle. The masses will never go for it. Finally, biometric approaches can be both secure and easy because they recognise us, not memorised strings of text. Here there’s hope. Fingerprint readers on smartphones, tablets and laptops are becoming common, cheap, convenient and essentially impossible to hack on a large scale. So far, they’re primarily useful for logging us into our machines. Shouldn’t the next step be letting us log into our Web accounts Iris scanning is another biometric technology, fast enough to work well at automated border-crossing systems and secure enough for national ID programs such as India’s (it’s enrolling 1.2 billion people). At the moment, iris scanners are far too new and expensive to build into every phone and laptop — but almost every technology gets cheaper over time. Some scanners can be fooled by a photograph of your eye, but this problem, too, can be overcome (by tracking your pupil as you read something, for example). Bottom line: there’s no insurmountable problem in iris reading’s future. Same with voice authentication, using the unique pitch, accent and frequencies of your speaking voice as your key. It’s cheap enough for wide adoption — our phones and gadgets already have microphones. Worried about bad guys faking out the system with a recording of your voice That can’t happen if the phrase you’re asked to speak changes every time you log in. The only roadblocks here are background noise and laryngitis. And as with any biometric security solution, this approach only requires a backup system, like a password, just in case. Then there’s Windows Hello, a new feature of Windows 10 that lets you log in with fingerprint, iris or facial recognition, whatever your laptop is equipped to handle. The face option is especially exciting. You just sit down at the computer, and it unlocks instantly. You can’t fool it with a photograph or even a 3D model of your head, because the Intel RealSense camera it requires includes infrared and 3D sensors. Of course, very few gadgets come with that camera preinstalled. But the RealSense concept is truly the Holy Grail: secure and convenient. If the hardware ever became as ubiquitous and cheap as, say, our phones’ fingerprint readers, we could have a winner. Clearly, the password concept is broken. Equally clearly, these new technologies can provide both the security and the convenience the world demands. Nothing’s quite there yet, and we need to keep our eye on privacy concerns (who owns the databases of biometric scans, for example ). But one thing is for sure: this is one pain point that’s got everyone’s attention.
