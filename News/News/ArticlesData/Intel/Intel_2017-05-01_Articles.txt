Codina , Intel Barcelona Research Center (IBRC), Intel Labs, Intel Corp., Edifici Nexus II, planta 0-D, Jordi Girona 29, Barcelona, Spain ABSTRACT Given the increase of runtime managed code environments in desktop, server, and mobile segments, agile, flexible, and accurate performance monitoring capabilities are required in order to perform wise code transformations and optimizations. Common profiling strategies, mainly based on instrumentation and current performance monitoring units (PMUs), are not adequate and new innovative designs are necessary. In this paper, we present the desired characteristics of what we call next generation PMUs and advocate for hardware/software collaborative approaches where hardware implements the profiling hooks and mechanisms and software implements the complex heuristics. We then propose a first design in which the hardware uses a small, yet flexible table to profile specific code regions and the software decides what/when/how to profile. This first design meets all required features and we aim it as the seed for future PMUs extensions to enable novel dynamic code transformations and optimizations.

By Chris Duckett | May 2, 2017 -- 04:17 GMT (21:17 PDT) | Topic: Security Intel has announced its Active Management Technology (AMT), Standard Manageability (ISM), and Small Business Technology (SBT) firmware has been vulnerable to a pair of privilege escalation issues that could allow an attacker to remotely take control of a machine. The first, found on AMT and ISM units could allow a remote unprivileged attacker to "gain system privileges to provisioned [chips]," Intel said. The second would allow a local attacker to gain "unprivileged network or local system privileges" on chips with AMT, ISM, and SBT. Chips from Intel's 2008-released Nehalem architecture onwards are impacted by the vulnerabilities if they run manageability firmware between versions 6 and 11.6. More security news NSA stops controversial program that searches Americans' emails A VPN will not save you from government surveillance Mysterious cat-and-mouse-themed Trojan RAT is potentially dangerous, but its creators and purpose remain unclear ​Facebook: We're adding information warfare to our fight against malware, fraud "Intel highly recommends that the first step in all mitigation paths is to unprovision the Intel manageability SKU to address the network privilege escalation vulnerability," the chip giant said in its mitigation guide [PDF]. "When configured, Intel AMT and ISM automatically listen for management traffic over your computer network." Traffic received over ports 16992, 16993, 16994, 16995, 623, and 664 on a machine using AMT have the data routed directly to the management engine, bypassing the main CPU. According to CoreOS security engineer Matthew Garrett, users should ensure AMT is disabled. "Fixing this requires a system firmware update in order to provide new ME [management engine] firmware (including an updated copy of the AMT code). Many of the affected machines are no longer receiving firmware updates from their manufacturers, and so will probably never get a fix," he said. "Anyone who ever enables AMT on one of these devices will be vulnerable. "That's ignoring the fact that firmware updates are rarely flagged as security critical (they don't generally come via Windows Update), so even when updates are made available, users probably won't know about them or install them." Intel said the vulnerability does not affect its consumer chips as they are without vPro technology. The chip giant thanked Maksim Malyutin from Embedi for reporting the issue, although the team at SemiAccurate claimed they discovered it in research over five years ago.

In an advisory published May 1, Intel describes the vulnerability as an elevation of privilege type with a critical severity rating. It is found in Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM) and Intel Small Business Technology firmware versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5 and 11.6 and can allow an attacker to “gain control of the manageability features provided by these products.” Specifically, Intel says there are two ways the vulnerability can be accessed: An unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM) (CVSSv3 9.8 Critical /AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). An unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel® Small Business Technology (SBT) (CVSSv3 8.4 High /AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). SemiAccurate, which says it has been pestering Intel to fix the issue for “literally years,” claims there is literally no Intel box made in the last 9+ years that isn’t at risk although Intel specifically states that “this vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs.” Intel recommends looking over this document to determine if you have an AMT, SBA or ISM-capable system and this guide to see if your system has the impacted firmware.

PACIFIC PALISADES, CA – FEBRUARY 15: during the Pro-Am at the Genesis Open at Riviera Country Club on February 15, 2017 in Pacific Palisades, California. (Photo by Stan Badz/PGA TOUR) Intel continues to push forward with its virtual reality technology in the sports world. The tech giant today announced a partnership with the PGA Tour to live stream the action from The Players Championship this weekend — specifically, at the famous “Island Green” on hole 17. The company’s “Intel True VR,” its new VR brand that builds off the acquisition of virtual reality startup Voke last year, will power the stream, available to users with Samsung Gear VR headsets and the new PGA Tour VR Live app throughout the 4-day tournament that kicks off Thursday. There will be three cameras — on the tee; on the walkway; and near the green — to shuffle between. This is the first time the PGA Tour is putting on a live virtual reality production. It has tested VR technology for the past two years and demoed Intel’s True VR product at the Genesis Open in February. In March, Intel livestreamed the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in virtual reality via a partnership with the NCAA and Turner. The company continues its push into the sports world; it established its Intel Sports Group this past fall, right around the Voke acquisition, and has continued building products and services with wearable computing, virtual reality, connected devices, and more that have application in the sports industry. At its CES 2017 press conference in January, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich had attendees wear virtual reality headsets and guided them through a real-time demo of a live college basketball game, utilizing Voke’s technology to let people feel like they were actually inside the arena. Twitter is also part of today’s announcement, as those without a VR headset will be able to watch a 360-degree video stream from the same perspective on hole 17 via the PGA Tour’s Twitter and Periscope account. This is the first time Twitter has distributed live 360-degree video during a major sports event. Twitter previously partnered with the PGA Tour in January to live stream 70 hours of competition this season, which includes action from the first 60 to 90 minutes of PGA Tour Live’s coverage (pre-round analysis, interviews, range coverage, first two holes of each day’s PGA Tour Live “Marquee Groups”). Twitter said today that it averages nearly 500,000 unique viewers on the PGA Tour stream each day, more than 70 percent of which are under 35 years old. The company, which saw its stock rise after beating earnings expectations last week, continues to invest in live sports content despite the fact that it lost out to Amazon in April for the rights to stream Thursday Night Football NFL games next season. Amazon paid a reported $50 million to stream 10 games next season, five times as much as Twitter paid last year.

Gamers need them to make rich titles like Rise of the Tomb Raider hum, and some professionals, like video editors and 3D designers, need them to take the pain out of rendering huge multimedia files. For everyone else, a video card has been treated more like a luxury item than a necessary computer component. But AMD's $130 Radeon RX 550, a graphics card that costs a little more than the brand new games you'll render on it, is such a good value that it might make you rethink the notion that a graphics card is a splurge you should skip. Images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Currently available from major retailers, the circa-$130 AMD Radeon RX 550 is intended to upgrade an old desktop or function as the centrepiece of a new super cheap PC build. Though AMD told Gizmodo there were plans for a mobile version that should appear as an option in laptops later this year. The RX 550 comes with ports for DVI, HDMI and Display Port. If you're young, with dewy skin, zero wrinkles, and the ability to house six chilli dogs in a row, then you might not remember the time when every computer, no matter how small, needed a video card. Then in 2010 Intel introduced Iris Graphics, a GPU directly integrated into the CPU that does a bulk of your computer's work. Iris Graphics meant computer manufacturers didn't need to put a discrete graphics card in every computer, and consequently the RX 550's predecessors, the budget-friendly graphics cards of yore, basically died. The market today is dominated by powerful cards destined for demanding applications. AMD confused some people Monday when it announced a new series of graphics cards based on its year-old Polaris microarchitecture. You see, back at CES in January, AMD announced a new, faster architecture known as Vega. Generally graphics card makers quickly retire the old architecture when the new one arrives. So, with Vega cards expected around E3 in June, AMD's decision to potentially cannibalise those sales with some cheap Polaris cards seems silly. Besides the newly introduced RX 580, RX 570, and the RX 560 — cards that replace last year's RX 400 series, AMD announced the RX 550. It's a card with no equal — While it can't match the performance of any of the above GPUs, it beats every single one at price. The wicked cheap 550 carves out a space for AMD that hasn't really been feasible for any GPU maker in the last seven years. Intel Iris has been so good that GPU makers have never felt the need to compete for the hearts of budget-conscious consumers. But AMD has apparently changed its mind. Let's be totally clear: The RX 550 won't win any races, but it instantly makes games immeasurably prettier and faster than the discrete graphics built into an Intel processor. In our testing, we pitted it against the Iris Intel HD 630 that's integrated into the Kaby Lake i7-7700K. When playing Civilisation VI it ran nearly four times faster. When playing Overwatch, with graphics set to the most intense setting (Ultra), the RX 550 was three times faster than the integrated GPU, though the game wasn't actually playable at that setting on either the RX 550 or the HD 630: The RX 550 managed 17 frames per second, which is an excruciating experience to play, but the HD 630 was an even worse 5fps. With a frame rate that bad it's sort of like you're trying to play a game in stop motion. Higher is better for Overwatch. Lower is better for Civilizations VI and Blender. But when you drop the graphics settings to Low, Overwatch in 4K is downright playable with the RX 550, which managed a super smooth 70 frames per second. On the same settings, the HD 630 couldn't compete, clocking a borderline unplayable 28 fps. With a frame rate that low, the game gets extremely choppy — making it difficult to pull off the quick, skillful shots. The RX 550 even performed better when rendering 3D graphics for non game projects, though with smaller margins. The RX 550 rendered a big 3D file in Blender in 9 minutes and 40 seconds. The HD 630 took an extra five seconds. Good as it is, the RX 550's performance still pales when compared to the speeds you'd get with a "real" graphics card like the $500-ish  Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 or new $400-ish AMD Radeon RX 580. Those cards can handle games like Mass Effect Andromeda and Rise of the Tomb Raider, which cause the the RX 550 and HD 630 to choke. The RX 550 is also MUCH smaller than the RX 580. The RX 550 is especially appealing for people building a cheap PC from scratch. It's a leg up on Intel's integrated GPU, and it is also perfect to pair with AMD's excellent new Ryzen CPU. While the Ryzen processor beats Intel on speed at every price point, it notably lacks integrated graphics. If you tack on an $130 RX 550, you'd match Intel on price beat Intel in performance across the board. And with AMD's plan to go after Intel in the mobile space, this means a laptop with Ryzen and a RX 550 inside will likely be faster than a similarly spec'd Intel device. If you're the rare person with a tower PC, or you're a builder eager to create something cheap, then the RX 550 is a good choice. And if you buy it and don't like it — no big deal— it only cost $30 more than Mass Effect Andromeda. README The AMD Radeon 550 is faster than your integrated graphics. It is slower than any other video card you could get. It is also cheaper. A solid card for first time PC builders. Will pair well with AMD's new CPUs, which are cheaper and faster than Intel, but don't have a GPU built in.

The project - if it goes ahead - would involve 3,000 construction jobs and result in the addition of about 850 full-time jobs at Leixlip in Co Kildare, according to Intel. Intel applied for planning permission to Kildare County Council last November for what was effectively a revamp of planning permission it secured in 2013. The council notes that a decision on the latest application is due today, after Intel submitted additional information back in March. The latest planning application saw the group reduce the overall size of the planned chip site by 50pc, but it would still be a mammoth 85,000 sq m (915,000 sq ft). "Intel Ireland continues to enable the site for potential development," the company told the council, noting back in November that the standard manufacturing design has evolved to such an extent that a revised plan was needed. "The planning application is part of a strategic initiative by the Intel Ireland site to ensure that the designated campus is optimised and is in a competitively-placed position to compete for next generation investment within the Intel corporation when major future capital investment decisions are being considered," planners for Intel noted. "It is a prudent measure for Intel to have flexible options available to allow them to be responsive," they added. "The revised design captures improvements in knowledge and technology." The Intel site at Leixlip occupies about 146 hectares. It currently has three chip manufacturing sites at the campus, the first of which opened in 1990. It's one of the largest manufacturing sites in Ireland, and currently employs about 4,500 full-time staff, as well as a large number of contractors. Cumulative investment at the Intel site in Co Kildare has so far reached just under €12bn. The planned expansion of the site would include a new main, three-storey fabrication facility as well as other buildings. The project has been backed by locals including former Labour TD Emmet Stagg, but opposed by others. Last year, Intel announced that it was laying off 12,000 jobs around the world. Those layoffs included jobs lost at Leixlip. The company had refused to say how many of its staff in Ireland were being let go, but it was estimated that up to 400 contractors and full-time staff with the group here had been targeted under the plan. Intel made the job cuts as it sought to tackle declining global demand for desktop computers, and refocuses its business on cloud and other sectors. Intel has chip-manufacturing facilities in Ireland, the United States and Israel. They vie with each other for investment from head office. Last month, Intel announced that it was restarting a project to invest $7bn to finish a chip facility in Arizona. It originally announced the plans in 2011, but the project was put on hold. Last week, Intel reported record first quarter revenue of $14.8bn (€13.5bn), an 8pc year-on-year increase, and operating income of $3.6bn (€3.3bn), which was 40pc higher year-on-year.

The vulnerability, disclosed on Monday, affects features in Intel firmware that are designed for enterprise IT management. Enterprises using Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology and Intel Standard Manageability on their systems should patch them as soon as possible, the company says. The vulnerable firmware features can be found in some current Core processors and all the way back to Intel's first-generation Core, called Nehalem, which shipped in 2008. They're part of versions 6.0 through 11.6 of Intel's manageability firmware. No consumer PCs are affected, the company said. Nor are data-center servers running Intel Server Platform Services. Intel Active Management Technology is a feature in Core processors that lets organizations remotely track, manage and secure whole fleets of connected computers. For example, it can be used to monitor and repair retail checkout systems, digital signage and PCs at places like stores, offices and schools. Intel didn’t provide technical details of the vulnerability, but it said a hacker could use the flaw to take over the remote management functions. In an email, Intel said it learned about the vulnerability from a security researcher in March. “We are not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability,” the company said. Intel said it has prepared a patch and is working with manufacturers to roll it out to users as soon as possible. Intel’s security advisory also lays out steps users can take to find out if they’re affected. For example, PCs built with its vPro technology will have the vulnerable Intel Active Management feature. In addition, the advisory has tips for what to do if there's no firmware update available from the system manufacturer. Disabling or removing a Windows service called Local Manageability Service can mitigate the vulnerability, Intel said.

Dan Goodin - May 1, 2017 11:55 pm UTC Enlarge Intel reader comments 27 Share this story Remote management features that have shipped with Intel processors for almost a decade contain a critical flaw that gives attackers full control over the computers that run on vulnerable networks. That's according to an an advisory published Monday afternoon by Intel. Intel has released a patch for the vulnerability, which resides in the chipmaker's Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology, and Intel Standard Manageability. Business customers who buy computers running vPro processors use those services to remotely administer large fleets of computers. The bug doesn't affect chips running on consumer PCs. The chipmaker has rated the vulnerability critical and is recommending vulnerable customers install a firmware patch. In the company's Monday post, Intel officials wrote: There is an escalation of privilege vulnerability in Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel® Small Business Technology versions firmware versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 that can allow an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products. This vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs. There are two ways this vulnerability may be accessed please note that Intel® Small Business Technology is not vulnerable to the first issue. An unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM). CVSSv3 9.8 Critical /AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H An unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel® Small Business Technology (SBT). CVSSv3 8.4 High /AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H The flaw affects Intel manageability firmware versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 for Intel's Active Management Technology, Small Business Technology, and Standard Manageability platforms. Versions before 6 or after 11.6 are not impacted. Security experts spent much of Monday assessing the real-world threat posed by the bug. A post published earlier in the day claimed "every Intel platform from Nehalem to Kaby Lake [had] a remotely exploitable security hole" that had gone unfixed for years. Researchers who parsed Intel's advisory, however, said the flaw could likely be exploited over the Internet only when Intel's AMT service was enabled and provisioned inside a network. Other researchers said the bar for unprivileged network attackers to succeed was probably even higher because Windows-based software known as Local Manageability Service would have to be running. "It sounds like its only remotely exploitable if the LMS service is running on the affected system (even if AMT is enabled, LMS is the network vector)," HD Moore, who is vice president of research and development at Atredis Partners, told Ars. "Only servers running that service (vs. desktop PCs) with the port reachable are exposed to remote code execution." Moore said a query using the Shodan computer search engine detected fewer than 7,000 servers showing they had ports 16992 or 16993 open. Having those ports open is a requirement for the remote attack. That number of servers still represents a potentially substantial threat because tens of thousands of computers could be connected to some of those hosts. Enterprises that have LMS and AMT enabled in their networks should make installing the patch a priority. Those organizations that can't immediately install updates should follow these workaround instructions. Enlarge HD Moore As indicated in Intel's advisory, a second, less-serious threat is a local privilege escalation once an attacker already has low-privilege access. While not as severe as the first scenario, this threat could still make it much easier for an attacker to take control of targeted computers inside a network. Vulnerable organizations should patch as soon as practical. Developer Matthew Garrett has more information about the vulnerability here.

Ltd. could knock Intel Corp. from its familiar perch atop the chip vendor sales leaders as soon as this quarter, according to market research firm IC Insights Inc. Samsung, the industry leader in memory chip sales, is benefiting from a precipitous rise in average selling prices (ASPs) for DRAM and NAND flash. According to IC Insights, DRAM ASPs in the first quarter of this year were 45 percent greater than in the first quarter of 2016, while NAND ASPs increased 40 percent over the same period. If Intel's second quarter sales come in around the midpoint of the company's guidance, about $14.4 billion, Samsung could unseat Intel in the second quarter with a modest yet typical increase of 7.5 percent in chip sales from $13.9 billion in the first quarter, IC Insights noted. Click here for larger image Intel has been No. 1 in semiconductor sales since 1993. If memory prices hold firm through 2017, Samsung could also displace Intel as the chip sales leader for the full year, IC Insights said. Both companies are currently on pace to sell about $60 billion in semiconductors this year, the firm said. "With the memory market still cyclical, this could indeed be a one year event," said Bill McClean, IC Insights president, in an email exchange with EE Times. IC Insights (Scottsdale, Ariz.) predicts that memory chip prices will begin to cool in the second half of 2017. However, the firm is still projecting that the DRAM market will grow 39 percent this year and the NAND market will grow 25 percent. IC Insights also believes that the memory chip market may grow even faster than the firm has projected. Click here for larger image But McClean noted that memory chip vendors are dramatically increasing their capital expenditures this year to add capacity in light of the memory boom, a situation that can quickly lead to overcapacity and a rapid deflation of ASPs. Samsung spent $4.3 billion on semiconductor capex in the first quarter alone and is likely to spend more than $15 billion for the full year, a 30 percent increase over 2016. Meanwhile, rival SK Hynix plans to increase its capex by 16 percent this year, McClean said. "When they catch up in capacity, memory prices could retreat quite quickly," McClean said. —Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.

The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 375GB drive boasts sequential transfer speeds of up to 2400MB/s Read and 2000MB/s Write. Impressive, but so is the Random 4K performance numbers of 550,000 IOPS Read IOPS and 500,000 IOPS Write! The raw speeds are impressive, but you have to keep in mind that this is a datacenter-oriented part that costs $1,520 or $4.05 per GB. The good news is the Intel Optane SSD 900P doesn’t appear to be too far away. Rumor has it that the Intel Optane SSD 900P will be the  successor to the Intel SSD 750 series that  came out in early 2015. The folks over at BenchLife are hosting a slide (shown above) on this consumer focused model that has the 900P looking really good. In fact, the Intel Optane SSD 900P is actually more impressive than the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X from a raw performance perspective as it appears to be faster. We are looking at 2500MB/s Read and 2000MB/s Write sequential speeds and 550,000 IOPS Read and 500,000 IOPS Write, so the sequential read speed is 100 MB/s faster. It appears the Intel Optane SSD 900P will be available as an add-in card (AIC) or U.2 form factor, which is going to be a disappointment for those looking for an M.2 gum stick drive that would fit in a notebook. The Intel Optane SSD 900P uses up to 18 Watts of power in active power model and and 5 Watts at idle, so this is clearly not a mobile part and is clearly aimed at desktop users looking for ultimate storage performance. We have no idea what pricing or when these drives will be hitting the streets, but we are fairly certain that they won’t be priced over $4 per GB. The leaked slide shows the Intel Optane SSD 900P will be available in 280GB, 480GB, 960GB and 1500GB capacities. Hopefully we’ll learn more about this drive this quarter as rumors have been floating around since March 2017!

The networking biz is advising owners of the CM700 gateway to sit tight while it figures out how to patch a weakness that leaves the modem prone to DoS attacks. In other words, there is no workaround right now. "Netgear is aware of a security vulnerability that can potentially allow an attacker to slow or stop your network access," the advisory reads. "This vulnerability does not pose a risk for data loss or access to your network." We understand Intel Security is also looking into the matter, with a potential firmware fix on the horizon, and a CVE allocation for the flaw is forthcoming. The issue, which The Register reported on last week with proof-of-concept exploit code, is actually the result of a flaw in the Intel Puma 6 chipset Netgear uses for the CM700. Netizens have found that the hardware is prone to suffering from massively degraded performance when sent a stream of small, or zero-sized, TCP or UDP packets spread over multiple IP network ports. Every time one of these packets comes in, the chipset keeps a record of it in a look-up table. By hitting a large range of ports at once – say with three to five thousand packets a second – it is possible to fill up this table, and cripple the device's performance. This leaves the victim with slow web browsing, and huge latency spikes ruining online gaming, and so on. One engineer described to us the condition as being "trivial" to exploit once the attacker has the public IP address of the target modem. In other words, once you know the IP address of someone using a Puma 6-powered modem, you can easily blast them off the internet. There thousands upon thousands of people using modems with Intel's chipset – from Comcast Xfinity subscribers in the US to Virgin Media Super Hub 3 owners in the UK. Therefore, a number of other vendors who use Intel's Puma 6 chipset are also going to be vulnerable until a patch can be developed and deployed. The flaw is linked to some of the ongoing latency complaints surrounding Puma 6-equipped cable modems, many of which have been sold for use with expensive gigabit cable internet packages. And there is a pending class-action lawsuit against Arris – another vendor using Intel's crocked chipset. ® Tips and corrections 3 Comments MORE Intel Netgear Gigabit Modems More from The Register Flaws found in Linksys routers that could be used to create a botnet Engineers working on firmware updates 22 Comments 'Amnesia' IoT botnet feasts on year-old unpatched vulnerability New variant of 'Tsunami' is a disaster waiting to happen 11 Comments Dormant Linux kernel vulnerability finally slayed Just, er, eight years later 43 Comments WhatsApp blind-sided by booby-trapped photo vulnerability Same issue in Telegram, says researcher 14 Comments Intel touts bug bounties to hardware hackers Website and Intel Security (McAfee) products excluded from 'Wild West' payouts scheme 2 Comments FYI: You can blow Intel-powered broadband modems off the 'net with a 'trivial' packet stream All too easy to choke enemies' gateways, it seems 52 Comments Whitepapers Mobile App Security Program Management Handbook Whether you are starting from square one with a mobile app security initiative, have ad-hoc tasks you want to consolidate, or just want to improve an existing program.

Birrittella , Intel Mark Debbage , Intel Ram Huggahalli , Intel James Kunz , Intel Tom Lovett , Intel Todd Rimmer , Intel Keith D. Underwood , Intel Robert C. Zak , Intel ABSTRACT The Intel Omni-Path Architecture (Intel OPA) is designed to enable a broad class of computations requiring scalable, tightly coupled CPU, memory, and storage resources. Integration between the Intel OPA family and Intel CPUs enable improvements in system-level packaging and network efficiency. When coupled with the new open standard APIs developed by the OpenFabrics Alliance (OFA) Open Fabrics Initiative (OFI), the Intel OPA family is optimized to provide low latency, high bandwidth, and a high message rate. Intel OPA enables a multigeneration, scalable fabric through innovations including link layer reliability, extended fabric addressing, and optimizations for high-core-count CPUs. Intel OPA also provides optimizations to address datacenter needs, including link-level traffic flow optimization, to minimize jitter for high-priority packets, partitioning support, quality-of-service support, and a centralized fabric management system. Basic performance metrics from first-generation host fabric interface and switch implementations demonstrate the new fabric architecture's potential.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation's Memory Business Surges This chipmaker's bet on memory technologies is starting to show encouraging signs of a potential long-term payoff. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 1, 2017 at 1:30PM Back in 2015, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) signaled its intention to more seriously go after the market for non-volatile memory products. This, in effect, meant becoming more aggressive with its preexisting NAND flash business by building out wholly owned NAND manufacturing capacity and stepping up its investments in another non-volatile memory technology known as 3D XPoint. That increased investment, though the company obviously expects it to pay off in the long term, drove a substantial decline in the profitability of the company's Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG) business; on roughly flat revenue year over year, Intel's NSG business saw operating income drop from $239 million to a $544 million loss in 2016. Image source: Intel. Although it will be a while before these increased investments really begin to pay off for stockholders (NSG saw a $129 million operating loss last quarter, widening from $95 million in the year prior), last quarter did bring some very welcome news to investors: robust revenue growth. What growth! Last quarter, Intel's NSG reported $866 million in revenue ("an all-time record," per Intel CEO Brian Krzanich), up more than 55% from $557 million in the year prior. Note that, as I mentioned above, the operating loss widened year over year from $95 million to $129 million, but this is likely due to elevated operating expenses/factory start-up costs year over year than, say, abnormally low NAND flash pricing (since Intel mentioned a "tight supply environment" via-a-vis NAND). Moreover, Intel says that it saw "demand signals outpacing supply," so clearly business is booming for Intel's NAND business (as well as the NAND businesses of other memory makers) right now. The memory industry tends to be very cyclical in nature, routinely going through boom and bust cycles driven by both the underlying demand for memory products as well as the capacity (or lack thereof) that the industry collectively puts into place. For now, though, it's looking like Intel's bet on memory is turning out to be a smart one. Looking for profitability Right now, the memory business seems to be booming, but if Intel doesn't reach profitability here within a reasonable time frame, then it's all for naught. On the earnings call, in response to a question from analyst Timothy Arcuri, Krzanich offered some insight on when the company expects to achieve profitability in its memory business. "For next year, our standard NAND business will be profitable," Krzanich said. This is encouraging, but it's important to note that although NAND flash products make up the substantial majority of NSG's revenue today, a sizable portion of the incremental investments in both technology and capacity that Intel is making is in support of its 3D XPoint technology. With that in mind, Krzanich explained that the company's overall NSG business -- that's NAND and 3D XPoint -- gets to break even in the second half of 2018, though he provided no additional details. Foolish takeaway Right now, Intel's investment in non-volatile memory looks like it has a reasonable chance of paying off handsomely for the chipmaker. The market for NAND flash continues to grow as storage demand rises and as NAND flash-based products displace mechanical hard disks in various markets. Additionally, Intel's investments in 3D XPoint seem as though they have real potential to pay off over time, too, as both storage products and DRAM-replacement products based on the technology eventually make their way into the marketplace. So, investors now know what milestones to look for -- a breakeven NAND flash business by the second half of this year, as well as a breakeven NSG by the second half of next year. If Intel can achieve these financial goals, it'll be interesting to start thinking about the long-term profit potential of this business to the company.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Interesting September Stock Options for INTC Shutterstock photo Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the September expiration for INTC. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $34 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 86 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.5% return against the $34 commitment, or a 6.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ). Selling a put does not give an investor access to INTC’s upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Intel Corp sees its shares fall 5.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $33.14 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 86 cents from $34), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.7% annualized rate of return. Interestingly, that annualized 6.7% figure actually exceeds the 3% annualized dividend paid by Intel Corp by 3.7%, based on the current share price of $36.14. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 5.84% to reach the $34 strike price. Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Intel Corp, looking at the dividend history chart for INTC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annualized dividend yield. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the September expiration, for shareholders of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) looking to boost their income beyond the stock’s 3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $37 strike and collecting the premium based on the 95 cents bid, annualizes to an additional 7% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 10% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $37 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but INTC shares would have to advance 2.5% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 5.1% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, highlighting in green where the $34 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $37 strike in red: The chart above, and the stock’s historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Intel Corp (considering the last 251 trading day INTC historical stock prices using closing values, as well as today’s price of $36.14) to be 18%.

EVGA GTX 1080 Ti SC2 review: A ferocious graphics card with a radical cooler Video Windows Defender: What changes in Windows 10 Creators Update A Kaby Lake processor is no longer the only way to get Netflix in 4K on a PC. Nvidia recently launched a preview version of Netflix streaming in 4K for its GeForce GTX 10-series graphics cards, which use the Pascal GPU architecture. Mentioned in this article Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition  PCWorld rating $549.99MSRP $700.00View on Amazon Nvidia’s GTX 10-series cards launched nearly a year ago with the GeForce GTX 1080. One of the items we noted in PCWorld’s GTX 1080 review was that it and other Pascal GPUs would be able to play 4K Netflix content, because Pascal was certified for Microsoft’s PlayReady 3.0 DRM that Netflix requires for 4K streams on Windows PCs. But the promise of 4K Netflix for GeForce cards never materialized in the months following our review. Nvidia was then surpassed by Intel in November, when Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors became the first hardware capable of streaming 4K Netflix on a PC, using Windows 10’s Edge browser. [ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ] The requirements The hardware and software needs for Nvidia’s version of 4K Netflix are a little more complicated than Intel’s for now, though you don’t need a cutting-edge processor to get it to work. The CPU doesn’t matter since the 4K decoding is happening on the discrete graphics card. Nvidia requires a GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card or higher with at least 3GB of RAM to stream 4K Netflix videos. Nvidia Those HDCP 2.2-compatible ports are key. That effectively means you need the GTX 1050 Ti or greater since, there’s only a 2GB version of the GTX 1050—unless Nvidia just inadvertently tipped its hand for a future product release. As this is an early preview, perhaps the 3GB requirement will change, because frankly that limitation really sucks for anyone who bought the GTX 1050 as an ideal discrete graphics card for a home theater PC.  Beyond the graphics card, you need an HDCP 2.2 capable monitor or television set, and an Internet connection around 25Mbps or faster. Mentioned in this article EVGA GTX 1050 Ti SC Gaming  PCWorld rating $176.95MSRP $150.00View on Amazon The EVGA GTX 1050 Ti SC Gaming can effortlessly upgrade a prebuilt PC into a gaming rig capable of outplaying modern consoles. It's cool, power-efficient, and notably more powerful than its rivals. Read PCWorld's full review As for the software, 4K Netflix needs a Windows Insider preview version of Windows 10—presumably the more recent post-Creators Update releases. The reason being is that the required GeForce driver for 4K Netflix—381.74—is only available for Windows Insiders right now. As with Kaby Lake's 4K Netflix support, you’ll need to stream the content via Microsoft Edge or the Netflix app in the Windows Store. Other browsers will stream at lower resolutions. Nvidia is also adding two very important caveats. 4K Netflix will only work if all your active monitors support HDCP 2.2. Anyone with a multi-monitor set-up will have to deactivate monitors with HDCP 1.x when streaming. SLI fans are also going to have problems. Currently, 4K streaming doesn’t work on PCs with multiple graphics cards, meaning you’ll have to unlink your GPUs before booting up Netflix. The story behind the story: It’s not clear when Nvidia’s 4K Netflix streaming will go mainstream. AnandTech reports that the Creators Update added several new API calls for PlayReady, suggesting that the operating system may have been the hold-up in getting 4K Netflix on Pascal GPUs.  To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Myriads of motherboards based on these two chipsets have been released during these past couple of months, covering virtually all of the consumer market demand. In this review, we are having a look at two cost-effective Z270 motherboards that have been designed with gamers in mind - the MSI Z270 SLI Plus and the ASRock Z270 Killer SLI. As their names suggest, these two motherboards mainly place their marketing focus on the SLI support, and both have a retail price of under $140. We will examine their features, differences and performance in the following pages of this review. Other AnandTech Reviews for Intel’s 7th Generation CPUs and 200-Series Motherboards The Intel Core i7-7700K (91W) Review - CPU Review The Intel Core i5-7600K (91W) Review - CPU Review The Intel Core i3-7350K (60W) Review - CPU Review CPU Buyer's Guide: Q1 2017 - Guide In comparison to the older Z170 boards, the new Z270 board on the base specifications are hardly any different. The Z270 ones have four extra PCIe lanes configurable on the chipset, potentially new audio and new networking controllers, and Intel Optane Technology Support. Although four extra PCIe lanes does sound like a huge difference, it is an important upgrade for the implementation of native M.2 slots (on Z170-based motherboards, this usually meant disabling some other device/port on the motherboard). Also, note that Intel Optane drives should still function on other chipsets as drives; the Z270 only allows them to enable their “smart caching” technology. The Intel Optane Memory (SSD) Preview: 32GB of Kaby Lake Caching Individual motherboard manufacturers will be sprinkling on new features onto their Z270 products to aid the transition and provide other tangible benefits over the old platform. To read specifically about the Z170 chip/platform and the specifications therein, our deep dive into what it is can be found at this link. MSI Z270 SLI Plus Overview The MSI Z270 SLI Plus is a motherboard trying to implement as many practical features as possible while keeping the price tag below $140. It has two M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 slots, with one of them supporting M.2 devices up to 110 mm long, and a total of six SATA 6Gb/s connectors. There are no native U.2 connectors but U.2 drives can be connected to the M.2 slots by using appropriate adapters. The new Z270 chipset allows the two M.2 ports to operate PCIe devices without disabling anything on the motherboard, but the use of SATA M.2 drives will disable one SATA port for each drive. MSI also implemented the new Realtek ALC1220 audio codec, as well as the competitive Intel I219-V Gigabit LAN chipset. A TPM header is also present. The number and type of USB ports on the MSI Z270 SLI Plus can be a little confusing. The motherboard’s specifications state that the motherboard has one USB 3.1 Type C port and five USB 3.1 Type-A ports on the back panel, plus four USB 3.1 and four USB 2.0 Type-A ports available via headers. Once you read the specifications more carefully, it becomes apparent that the unnaturally high number of USB 3.1 ports is due to MSI dubbing the USB 3.0 ports as “USB 3.1 Gen 1”, while the 10Mbps ports are the “Gen 2”. They have an article posted on why they do so. So, technically, the motherboard has two USB 3.1 ports (one Type-A and one Type-C) that are being provided by the ASMedia ASM2142 controller, while the rest are USB 3.0 ports that are being provided by the Intel Z270 chipset. ASRock Z270 Killer SLI Overview Even though the retail price of the two motherboards is very similar, ASRock’s approach is significantly different than that of MSI’s. The ASRock Z270 Killer SLI is a motherboard trying to combine features with aesthetics. It features RGB lighting (chipset heatsink, plus a header for RGB LED strips) and has a painted PCB to identify with the Killer brand. It is almost identical to SLI’s offering in terms of drive support, featuring two M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 slots with one of them supporting M.2 and a total of six SATA 6Gb/s connectors. The only difference here is that both M.2 slots support devices only up to 80 mm long. Similar to the MSI, both of the main PCIe slots from the CPU come with integrated slot guards to reduce any potential bending or warping from heavy graphics cards. ASRock also went with the highly popular Intel I219-V Gigabit LAN chipset. To contrast, the audio chipset is the now aged Realtek ALC892, which is a mediocre choice for a gaming motherboard. The motherboard also has no support for USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) devices at all. The ASRock Z270 Killer SLI has one Type-C connector and five Type-A connectors, all of which are USB 3.0 (5 Gbps) compliant. Headers for two extra USB 3.0 connectors and up to five USB 2.0 connectors are available. There is also a header for Thunderbolt AIC connectors (5-pin or 10-pin), which cannot be found on the MSI Z270 SLI Plus.  Motherboard Comparison   MSI Z270 SLI Plus ASRock Z270 Killer SLIASUS Maximus VIII ExtremeASUS Maximus VIII ImpactASUS Z170-AGIGABYTE MW31-SP0 (C236)GIGABYTE Z170X-Gaming G1GIGABYTE Z170X-UD5 THMSI Z170A Gaming M7MSI Z170A SLI PLUSSupermicro C7H170-MASRock E3V5 Gaming (C232)GIGABYTE X170-Extreme ECCGIGABYTE Z170X-DesignareGIGABYTE Z170X-Ultra GamingMSI Z270 SLI PlusASRock Z170 Extreme7+ Socket LGA1151 LGA1151 MSRP at Review $133 $143 DRAM 4 x DDR4 4 x DDR4 PCIe Layout x8/x8 x8/x8 BIOS Version Tested 1.4 2.0 MCT Enabled Automatically?

Reply austinsguitar - Monday, May 01, 2017 - link people need to realize that z270 and intel are still a great buy for regular users. its not a bad investment. i just prey that 6core comes in time to consumers. Reply ddriver - Monday, May 01, 2017 - link Aside from the fact it is highly unlikely it will accept more than a single generation of processors. Reply Cygni - Monday, May 01, 2017 - link Seems pretty likely that Coffee Lake is intended to be compatible with Z270. Reply ddriver - Monday, May 01, 2017 - link That would be a new one for intel ;) If that happens, I guess "competition". For years now, intel has been artificially limiting chipset compatibility to squeeze extra chipset sales by obstructing upgrades. Reply fanofanand - Monday, May 01, 2017 - link Totally agree, more reviews of the volume pieces would benefit far more readers. I won't be buying either of these but at least now I know why. Reply Arbie - Monday, May 01, 2017 - link It's incredible that they can market something so complex, with so many precision parts, materials, and process steps - not to mention all the ICs - for a delivered price of $140! These are the benefits to us of mass production and sadly low foreign wages. Given that I'd use such a mobo heavily for hours every day, for years, I'd willingly pay more if I knew the workers got more. Reply rocky12345 - Monday, May 01, 2017 - link Nice write up Thank You. I just looked the MSI board up at Memory Express in Canada it goes for $209.99 CAD which sounds about right after exchange rate. Reply MarkieGcolor - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link I like how the asrock has a pice slot above the gpu slot. Why don't more motherboards have more space between the cpu connected slots for sli/crossfire? I'll never buy another board that doesn't have 3 slot spacing for cpu's again! Reply HollyDOL - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link Usually that top PCIe 1x slot is where my audio card gets seated. It used to be recommended due to latency, no clue whether that reason still holds though, it became quite a custom for me.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 1, 2017 at 9:15AM For quite some time, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has resigned itself to the fact that the personal computer market -- its largest market by far -- isn't going to be a growth business over the long term. Intel has fundamentally changed its strategy to one of profit maximization. That's not to say it isn't going to invest in new products, but it means being much more careful with its investments as well as shifting shared financial burdens to higher-growth segments. Image source: Intel. To see this shift in action, we need to look no further than the company's freshly announced first-quarter financial results. A major profit boost In the first quarter of 2017, Intel's Client Computing Group (which largely consists of sales of personal computer chips and related components) saw revenue rise modestly from $7.2 billion in the prior year to $7.4 billion. Operating profit, on the other hand, grew from $1.89 billion in the year-ago quarter to an astonishing $3.03 billion, good for an operating margin of about 41% and year-over-year growth of 60.3%. Of course, it should immediately raise some eyebrows when such a modest increase in revenue leads to such a dramatic surge in profitability. Let's examine the results in more detail to understand exactly what drove that substantial boost.  The many factors behind the boost Intel CFO Robert Swan explained that this operating profit expansion was driven by several factors. He said that the business "continues to execute and benefit from continued in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the client business having a decreased share of technology development and [sales, general, and administrative] allocations." The first one is straightforward -- Intel's manufacturing yields on its 14-nanometer technology weren't great out of the gate and have continued to improve over the last year. Higher manufacturing yields means that for a given silicon wafer (which has a largely fixed cost), more salable chips are produced, lowering the average cost to manufacture a chip. The "richer product mix" simply means that Intel is selling a greater proportion of higher-value chips. Those higher-value chips contribute more gross profit dollars than lower-value chips do (even if one assumed a fixed gross profit margin percentage), so selling a greater proportion of such chips relative to the year-ago quarter would naturally help to boost total profit. Finally -- and I think this is the big one -- Intel lowered the operating expenses associated with CCG by shifting that burden onto other businesses (primarily its Data Center Group, or DCG). The idea here is simple: Intel builds a lot of technology that's shared between the different business units. These shared expenses are substantial and include things like manufacturing technology development, intellectual property development, and so on. Intel must allocate the operating expenses associated with building all that shared technology somehow. In the past, Intel put the brunt of the manufacturing technology development expenses on CCG, since that group was the first to use Intel's newest chip manufacturing technologies. However, going forward, Intel plans to use its latest manufacturing technologies to build data center chips first, with other products following later. Due to that change, DCG now gets a greater share of the manufacturing technology development expenses and CCG gets a smaller share -- ultimately adding to DCG's operating expenses and reducing its margins, but reducing CCG's operating expenses and helping to boost its margins. What this means is this: Don't expect CCG's operating profit to continue to dramatically outperform its revenue growth  in the years ahead as we saw last quarter. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman On the morning of Tuesday, April 25th, the full Senate Judiciary Committee convened a hearing entitled Intellectual Property – Driver of Innovation: Making Our Lives Healthier, Safer, and more Productive. Taking place one day prior to World Intellectual Property Day, the day’s meeting focused on how intellectual property enables innovators to make meaningful impacts in the lives of consumers and the challenges of enforcing intellectual property rights. Echoes of the patent troll debate were also sounded to the likely consternation of U.S. patent owners across the globe. “As a society, we depend on innovators… to make our lives better and to solve the challenges we face,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the House judiciary committee. Grassley cited statistics published by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Intellectual Property Center (GIPC) on the 40 million American employed by IP-intensive industries. These same industries contribute $5.8 trillion to the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) and account for 74 percent of U.S. exports, according to the Global IP Center. In his opening statements, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) cited separate statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce which reported $6.6 trillion in value added to national GDP from IP-intensive industries. Despite these benefits, both Senators also spoke to problems currently facing the U.S. system of intellectual property. Coons cited the February 2017 Global IP Index published by the GIPC which reported that the U.S., despite placing first in trademark and copyright protection, was only 10th overall for its sytem of patent protections, tied with Hungary. The number of new businesses created during 2014 was at a 40-year low, another point cited by Coons as proof that the U.S. was losing its competitive edge in IP protections. Along with a weaker IP system, another concern as always is counterfeiting, which can create health and safety concerns as well as drain $4.2 trillion from the global economy by 2022. Grassley also spoke about his efforts to enable the transfer of acceleration certificates awarded under the Patents for Humanity program by reintroducing the Patents for Humanity Program Improvement Act, a bill co-sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT). The first panelist to offer remarks was Matthew Allen, acting assistant director for the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Center with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “The illegal distribution and sale of counterfeits pose a threat to health and safety,” Allen said. “Counterfeiters only care about their product looking good enough to be purchased, they only care about their bottom line.” Allen spoke to two agency initiatives being pursued by the IPR Center. One of these is Operation Engine Newity which investigates claims of counterfeit goods in the automotive, aerospace, rail and heavy industry sectors, many of which pose significant safety concerns. Another is Operation Joint Venture, an effort towards more public-private partnerships to enforce intellectual property rights and educate consumers on the impacts of counterfeits. Kay Eron, GM of health and life science at Intel Next to speak was Key Eron, general manager of health & life sciences at Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Eron noted the more than $12 billion Intel invested in research and development during 2016 in support of Intel’s commitment to IP. “We see first-hand the amazing power of high-tech innovation to improve the healthcare of all Americans,” Eron said. She spoke about computational tools applied by Intel with health industry partners which reduce the time needed for genomic sequencing from a week to a matter of hours and improve real-time data analysis during clinical drug trials. Eron spoke of Intel’s commitment to strong IP rights even as she referenced 2014 statistics pushed by Mark Lemley and others on the 42 percent of patents declared invalid when validity was challenged in the federal court system. “Long gone are the technologies which work as standalone products,” Eron said. “If one part of the chain breaks down because of a weak patent, the entire system can be brought to a standstill.” More reasonable views on the strength of IP rights were next proffered by Dr. Ashifi Gogo, CEO of Sproxil, a company offering an short message service (SMS) and data application platform for consumers designed to give them the capability to check whether an item is a counterfeit. Gogo noted that counterfeit products have been an issue going all the way back to the 2nd century BC with a documented case of one Gallic winemaker who attempted to copy the trade dress of a well-known Italian wine. Securing supply chains and educating consumers through tools like Sproxil could help to make IP theft unprofitable, Gogo testified. The voice of the manufacturing sector was brought forth that day by Dr. Conor Madigan, co-founder and president of organic light emitting diode (OLED) component manufacturer Kateeva. “We’re proof that high-tech domestic manufacturing is not only possible but can be competitively advantageous,” Madigan said, further acknowledging that IP has been instrumental to driving innovation at Kateeva. “It’s only with a huge investment in time and money that we can build a product with this kind of global impact.” Bioscience and related industries always have a large stake in patent discussions and the day’s hearing also included testimony from Dr. Neal Gutterson, VP of R&D at hybrid seed developer DuPont Pioneer. He noted that DuPont Pioneer invests $90 million each year on developing new corn seeds which exhibit improved yield and grain quality. “Fortunately, the United States allows patents on seed developments,” Gutterson said. He added that strong intellectual property rights were vital to initiatives like plant breeding and data-driven analytics for improved agricultural yield. “Sustainability will improve as a direct result of our investments in digital agriculture,” Gutterson said. One major challenge faced by the industry was the lack of a global standard leading to diverse national standards on data collection practices. In questioning, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) decided to advance the patent troll narrative and found a perfect sounding box in Eron to do so. “Patent trolls can use weak patents to extract monies,” Klobuchar said. Eron assented, noting that, while she was not an expert in IP laws, her understanding was that low-quality patents hurt Intel’s resources, diverting them from innovative R&D and towards litigation defense. “We do have a problem with patent trolls,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) would later add. “I don’t buy this idea that big guys are trying to squeeze out the small guys, a lot of times they’re looking for those smaller guys to scale up,” Tillis said, noting that app stores are filled with services being brought to the market on platforms provided by larger developers like Google and Apple. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) Some sobering thoughts on the patent troll issue were offered by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), who said that the phrase has changed the whole debate on patent protection. “Whoever came up with that phrase should get a special bonus,” Durbin said, “because they manage to mischaracterize anyone who goes to court to assert patent rights as a troll… What I came to understand was one man’s patent troll was another man’s assertion of a patent right which they fought for and worked for for years which is now being infringed upon by some giant.” He asked the panel to quantify the amount of actual trolling going on compared to the legitimate assertion of patent rights. After a long beat where no one spoke, Durbin asked the panel, “Won’t touch it, huh?” The one panelist who did finally answer the question was Madigan, who said it was “important to strike the right balance” in curbing abusive litigation without making it too difficult for smaller players to settle disputes with larger companies. Another major issue discussed at the hearing was the growing challenge of combating counterfeits in the age of e-commerce. According to Allen, counterfeits are increasingly being sent into the United States from foreign culprits through express shipping or mail sent through a foreign post office. Counterfeit goods still enter the country through containers shipped overseas, but the avenues for counterfeits have increased in the digital age. “Counterfeiting is a trade that depends on profits,” Gogo would later say. He reiterated his stance that educating consumers about the negative impacts of counterfeits would go a long way in preventing counterfeiters from successfully selling their ripoffs. Given that a great many American consumers knowingly purchase counterfeit NHL jerseys, Gogo’s stance could be viewed as overly hopeful. The day’s most interesting question came courtesy of Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA). “If each of you [on the panel] were king or queen for a day, how would you change IP laws in America?” he asked. Allen and Gogo both said that they would focus less on changing the laws as they currently were and more on educating the consumer base about counterfeits. “We believe that strong patents benefit scientific progress while weak ones hinder progress,” Eron said. She was also puzzled by the high percentage of patent cases filed at the Eastern District of Texas, stating that it was her understanding that 40 percent of patent cases are filed in that district court. “It doesn’t make sense from a business standpoint,” Eron said. “I find to be strange that many of the patent cases are filed in that court.” Madigan said that he would like to see efforts to standardize IP laws and institutions globally, noting that it was most likely that his company would face infringement issues coming from Asian markets. “Every innovation is critical to the future,” Gutterson said in his answer to Kennedy’s question. “Both IP and regulatory consistency are important to bring products to market in a timely fashion.” The Author Steve Brachmann is a writer located in Buffalo, New York.

The remark by Intel’s Eron about EDTX was irritating…but then I realized that she wasn’t a lawyer…and thus MIGHT be unaware of the BUSINESS ADVANTAGES of a patent owner filing there. angry dude May 1, 2017 9:21 am “I don’t buy this idea that big guys are trying to squeeze out the small guys, a lot of times they’re looking for those smaller guys to scale up,” Tillis said, noting that app stores are filled with services being brought to the market on platforms provided by larger developers like Google and Apple.” With DC politicians like that one America does not need enemies… App stores graciously created by apples and googles so little hapless app developers can scale up and make money for themselves :):):) we all should be grateful to apples and googles and their little paid stooges in wash dc Ternary May 1, 2017 10:28 am Durbin asked the panel, “Won’t touch it, huh?” The senator seems to be one of the few who really thinks about the effects of current opinions and procedures on patent owners, and confronts lobby interests. Because indeed, almost nobody else will touch it. Night Writer May 1, 2017 12:59 pm How much did Google contribute to their campaign? Directly and through superPACs? I think you can figure out their position based on how many Google bucks they took. IPdude May 1, 2017 3:11 pm What’s promising is that we now have some democrats taking a stand against the infringer lobby. Google will always have their shills in Congress, but I’m happy to hear the pro-patent/inventor voices getting louder. The pendulum may be moving in our favor.

(INTC) to “Hold” May 1st, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Patrick Bannon Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet Intel Co. (NASDAQ:INTC) was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “sell” rating to a “hold” rating in a report issued on Monday. According to Zacks, “Intel’s first-quarter 2017 results demonstrated a turnaround in the company’s businesses after a long time. The improving PC shipment data – as per Gartner and IDC – is positive for the company. The upcoming launch of Skylake is anticipated to benefit data center results in the second half. Moreover, the company revised up its 2017 revenue and EPS outlook based on improving average selling price (ASP). Further, anticipated improvement in cost structure and lower spending, primarily due to improving operational efficiency will aid in expansion of margins going forward. Additionally, aggressive share buyback will boost the bottom line in 2017. We note that Intel has underperformed the broader market on a year-to-date basis. Despite intensifying competition in most of the markets, we expect that these aforesaid factors will help Intel stock to rebound in the rest of 2017.” A number of other research firms have also recently commented on INTC. Sanford C. Bernstein cut Intel from a “market perform” rating to an “underperform” rating and reduced their price objective for the company from $36.00 to $30.00 in a research report on Tuesday, February 28th.

Finally, Canaccord Genuity reiterated a “buy” rating and set a $43.00 price objective on shares of Intel in a research report on Thursday, January 19th. They noted that the move was a valuation call. Five analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, fifteen have issued a hold rating and twenty-six have assigned a buy rating to the company’s stock. Intel currently has a consensus rating of “Hold” and a consensus price target of $40.27. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) opened at 36.15 on Monday.

Andrew Cunningham - May 1, 2017 11:30 am UTC reader comments 247 Share this story Hackintoshes are PCs that run macOS, which means you can do whatever you want with the design. Dan Counsell "Matte black, soft touch BitFenix Phenom case next to a Dell 3415W monitor." Mike Rundle Designer Sebastiaan de With's triple-monitor setup uses actual Apple monitors. Right now, Apple doesn't even sell its own monitors, though that will apparently change with the next-gen Mac Pro. Sebastiaan de With Some people go to the trouble of hollowing out a real Mac Pro case to enhance the illusion. RubberShoes Many Hackintosh users also happily buy and use other Apple hardware. Conath A portrait of the author's most recent Hackintosh experiment. Andrew Cunningham Apple could serve many of these users by making a reasonably flexible Mac tower. John Debs A dual-monitor Hackintosh, once again accompanied by genuine Apple hardware—many people we spoke to own a Hackintosh plus a MacBook of some stripe, possibly because laptops make awful Hackintoshes. Daniel Alm Apple is working on new desktop Macs, including a ground-up redesign of the tiny-but-controversial 2013 Mac Pro. We’re also due for some new iMacs, which Apple says will include some features that will make less-demanding pro users happy. Further ReadingImagining a new Mac Pro, the “iMac Pro,” and the future of Apple’s desktops But we don’t know when they’re coming, and the Mac Pro in particular is going to take at least a year to get here. Apple’s reassurances are nice, but it’s a small comfort to anyone who wants high-end processing power in a Mac right now. Apple hasn’t put out a new desktop since it refreshed the iMacs in October of 2015, and the older, slower components in these computers keeps Apple out of new high-end fields like VR. This is a problem for people who prefer or need macOS, since Apple’s operating system is only really designed to work on Apple’s hardware. But for the truly adventurous and desperate, there’s another place to turn: fake Macs built with standard PC components, popularly known as “Hackintoshes.” They've been around for a long time, but the state of Apple's desktop lineup is making them feel newly relevant these days. So we spoke with people who currently rely on Hackintoshes to see how the computers are being used—and what they'd like to see from Apple. A brief history of the Hackintosh Enlarge / In a silly bit of theater, then-newly minted Intel CEO Paul Otellini hands Steve Jobs a silicon wafer onstage at WWDC in 2005. Apple Back in 2005, Apple did the unthinkable: it announced that it would be abandoning IBM’s PowerPC CPUs for its Macs. Starting in 2006, all Macs would be powered by the same Intel CPUs included in regular old PCs. The Intel transition removed the single highest barrier to running Mac software on regular PCs: the hardware platform would now be much more similar than dissimilar. And amid the initial rending of garments from longtime Apple fans about the move from “exotic,” “special” PowerPC hardware to Intel hardware (it all seems very melodramatic in retrospect, frankly), there was already speculation about running Mac OS X on regular PCs. Hell, Apple’s first developer hardware for Intel Macs was just a Pentium 4 in a Power Mac case. Further ReadingPicking up the pieces: John Siracusa mourns the Power PC Once the Intel hardware actually started launching, “OSx86” projects began to crop up in earnest. Early efforts were pretty buggy and nasty; few GPUs were actually supported, it was almost never possible to apply system updates without breaking everything because you had to rely on custom OS kernels, and you had to hack around the fact that most PCs were still using BIOS firmware instead of the Mac’s newer UEFI. That has all changed now. Thanks to more modern PCs, a wider install base for Intel Macs, and dedicated enthusiast communities and forums like TonyMacx86, it’s not too hard for anyone comfortable with PC building to assemble a Hackintosh using off-the-shelf parts. Community-developed apps and tools streamline the process of creating install media and setting up drivers, and while you’re probably going to have to do a little bit of Terminal work getting everything to function perfectly, most major setup problems are easy enough to overcome for anyone who has been building and maintaining their own PCs for a while. Technically against the rules, but Apple doesn’t seem bothered At this point I should mention this article is in no way intended to be an install guide or an endorsement of Hackintoshing. Today, as has always been the case, installing macOS on non-Apple hardware is a violation of Apple’s licensing agreement. And in fact, I would even dissuade more technically inclined users from building Hackintoshes at all (for reasons we’ll get into a bit later). That said, Apple has done surprisingly little to shut down the Hackintosh community. When companies attempt to commercialize PCs running Mac software, as a long-gone company called Psystar briefly did back in 2008, Apple shuts them down swiftly and decisively. But macOS itself doesn't do more than a surface-level check for genuine Apple hardware—the underlying hardware needs to be close-ish, and special bootloaders spoof things like the model, firmware information, and serial number. These OSx86 enthusiast communities have existed for years without so much as a cease-and-desist. Contrast this with Apple’s much more stringent approach to iOS jailbreaking: the company releases new updates to disable old jailbreaks pretty quickly, at least in part because these jailbreaks rely exclusively on serious security flaws to work in the first place. This isn’t to say that Apple invites people to build Hackintoshes. It’s more likely that the Hackintosh community has such a small effect on sales of actual Macs that it wouldn’t be worth the time and effort it would take to develop and maintain new hardware checks as quickly as the Hackintosh community could work around them. Poor-to-nonexistent driver support and power management mean that laptops make terrible Hackintoshes, and laptops account for 80 percent of all Mac shipments. They just don't threaten Apple’s business all that much (though I do think catering to these users with real Macs that met their needs could be good for the company's bottom line).

Based on one of AMD’s latest Ryzen 7 1700X processors, the Pyro Ryzen DG delivers eight cores and a total of sixteen threads - double what you’ll get from a comparable Intel Core-i7 PC.It also comes with a powerful Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card, WIRED2FIRE PYRO RYZEN DG: PRICE You can buy the Wired2Fire Pyro Ryzen DG for £1675, plus a £24 delivery charge. You can also make several adjustments to the review specs by hitting the ‘customise’ button before purchase. Do check out our full list of the best gaming PCs before making your final choice, though. WIRED2FIRE PYRO RYZEN DG: DESIGN AND BUILD The first thing you’ll notice about the Wired2Fire Pyro Ryzen DG is its eye-catching black and orange NZXT H440 mid tower system case. If you can’t get past the orange, there’s a variety of other equally eye-catching options available, included a sober all-black version for the less flamboyant gamer. Key features of the NZXT H440 include a total absence of support for optical drives (remember those?), excellent cable management and a separate lower compartment for the power supply and hard drives, which keeps the main compartment extremely neat and tidy - perfect for viewing through the transparent side panel. Filling the case is an Asus ROG CrossHair VI Hero motherboard. There’s no cut-price B350 chipset to be seen here. Instead we get one of Asus’s premium models with all the bells and whistles of AMD’s advanced X370 chipset. These include extra USB 3.1 ports, improved overclocking headroom and, in this case, Aura Sync RGB LED lighting control. Perhaps more importantly, it includes multi-GPU support for both AMD CrossFireX and Nvidia SLI technologies, providing an easy upgrade path by adding a second graphics card at a later date. But for now you’ll be getting get a single Nvidia GTX 1080 which offers plenty of performance for high quality gaming at high resolutions and immersive VR experiences. Wired2Fire has selected AMD’s Ryzen 7 1700X 8-core processor for this PC, which is found here running at up to 3.7GHz. A Cooler Master Liquid 240 cooler is fitted with it’s huge 240mm radiator fixed to the top of the system case. Three 120mm fans are concealed behind the blank front panel of the case, protected by a removable dust filter, as is the power supply fan below. A 140mm exhaust fan is installed at the rear keeping the PC cool without excessive noise. The Pyro Ryzen DG combines super-fast solid state storage with the capacity of a 2TB traditional hard drive. A 250GB Samsung 960 Evo NVMe drive holds the operating system and as many games as you can fit on it, to deliver extremely fast loading times and generally snappier performance on the desktop. WIRED2FIRE PYRO RYZEN DG: PERFORMANCE While the 1700X may turn in some impressive results in synthetic benchmarks, the problem for Ryzen-based systems such as this one is that, at the moment, most games can’t take full advantage of those eight processor cores, favouring faster individual core speeds instead. If you’re into processing 3D graphics or bulk editing photos, then you will love the speed of the Wired2Fire Pyro Ryzen, which can wipe the smile off the face of any Intel Core i7-7700K user when it comes to multi-core tests like Cinebench R15 where the Ryzen chip is more than 50 prercent faster. However, this doesn’t translate into similar improvements in those all important gaming frame rates. Of course, gaming performance at decent resolutions is dominated by the graphics card, but the Wired2Fire Pyro Ryzen comes in a hair behind a similarly specced Intel-based PC in most of our benchmark tests. Thankfully, the GeForce GTX 1080 delivers excellent frame rates for your money, with 4K gaming possible at around 60fps in High and even Ultra quality settings in some cases, although tough modern games like Deus Ex Mankind Divided are still going to knock you back to 30fps for UltraHD play. If you’re gaming on a single PC monitor though, this is likely to be all the performance you’ll need up to 2560x1440 pixels. That’s not to say the Pyro Ryzen DG is slow, far from it, but don’t expect Ryzen to give you a better gaming experience than a high end quad-core Intel setup for now. The Pyro Ryzen DG also delivers extremely fast storage, in the form of a 250GB Samsung 960 EVO NVMe SSD. These Samsung drives are dominating PC storage performance right now with speeds far in excess of SATA drives. WIRED2FIRE PYRO RYZEN DG: WARRANTY Wired2Fire’s 3 year warranty looks good at first glance, but note that any faulty PCs must be returned at the customer’s expense and parts are only covered for the first two years. Wired2Fire Pyro Ryzen DG review: Specs Ryzen 7 Eight Core 1700X 3.4GHz @ 3.7GHz Cooler Master – Master Liquid 240 16GB DDR4 memory 2400MHz 250GB Samsung 960 Evo SSD and 2TB Barracuda FSP 750W PSU (Silver 80 PLUS Certified) Asus ROG CrossHair VI Hero Motherboard Windows 10 Home (64 bit) Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 8GB Onboard audio Intel I211-AT, 1 x Gigabit LAN Controller(s) REAR – 1 x 3.1 type A, 1 x type C, 8 x USB 3 + 4 x USB2 FRONT- 2 x USB 3 + 2 x USB2 Optical audio output NZXT H440 case 3 year warranty, return to base. (3 years labour + 2 years parts) Ryzen 7 Eight Core 1700X 3.4GHz @ 3.7GHz Cooler Master – Master Liquid 240 16GB DDR4 memory 2400MHz 250GB Samsung 960 Evo SSD and 2TB Barracuda FSP 750W PSU (Silver 80 PLUS Certified) Asus ROG CrossHair VI Hero Motherboard Windows 10 Home (64 bit) Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 8GB Onboard audio Intel I211-AT, 1 x Gigabit LAN Controller(s) REAR – 1 x 3.1 type A, 1 x type C, 8 x USB 3 + 4 x USB2 FRONT- 2 x USB 3 + 2 x USB2 Optical audio output NZXT H440 case 3 year warranty, return to base. (3 years labour + 2 years parts) OUR VERDICT This eye-catching PC is constructed from premium components and built to a very high standard. The 8-core Ryzen 7 1700X processor delivers excellent multi-threaded performance and, combined with a GTX 1080, turns in some very impressive gaming results, however similar or better performance can be had for less money.

Our review helps you find out whether the Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 is for you. Chillblast's Fusion Adamantium 3 is a compact gaming PC with the formidable Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K inside By Paul Monckton | 01 May 17 Specifications 4.2-4.5GHz Intel Core i7 7700K Chillblast Centurion CPU Cooler 16GB DDR4 2133MHz RAM 250GB Samsung SM961 M.2 Aerocool 600W PSU Asus Z270M-PLUS Motherboard Windows 10 Home (64-bit) Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 8GB Onboard sound Gigabit ethernet 3 x USB 3.0, 6 x USB 2.0 2 x PS/2, DP, DVI, HDMI Chillblast Kube Case - Black/ Blue 2 years collect and return warranty, 5 year labour only, lifetime phone Expert's Rating Price when reviewed £1549 Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Chillblast £1549 View Price comparision from , and manufacturers Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 review Compact in size, but big in performance, the Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 shows that you don’t need an 8-core processor to get smooth ultra-high definition gameplay. Based on the top-of-the-range Intel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake processor and a high-end Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card, this system still holds its own against the new AMD Ryzen 7 based PCs. Here’s our review of Chillblast’s Fusion Adamantium 3 gaming PC. Also see: Best desktop PCs Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 price You can buy the Fusion Adamantium 3 direct from Chillblast. When we reviewed the Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 it cost £1549.99 inc VAT. Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 design and build Chillblast’s compact and not-quite cuboid Cit Mesh Kube case sits lower and wider than a regular tower PC and has been designed to sit unobtrusively in a living room setting while delivering maximum performance but with the minimum noise and power consumption. Finished in matt black, with blue accents, the Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3’s appearance is rather understated compared to many gaming systems we’ve reviewed recently. It does contain interior lighting and a transparent viewing panels at the side, but the soft blue lighting effects are rather subtle compared to the full-colour light shows of some competing systems. Behind the mesh covering at the front of the case sits a huge 200mm fan with blue LED illumination. This is complemented by a single 120mm fan at the rear and the two work together to keep the whole system cool with minimum noise, spinning up and down automatically as necessary. The case has space for an optical drive, although none is installed and a handy built in memory card reader, which is great for fans of photography. Although there’s rather less room inside than you’d get with a mid-tower size case, the internals aren’t cramped and it’s not difficult to work on the internals of the PC when you need to. Removing the top of the case allows access to the motherboard which is mounted horizontally inside, with additional access available by removing the side panels. See all gaming PC reviews Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 processor and graphics Based on Intel’s formidable Core I7-7700K Kaby Lake CPU, the Fusion Adamantium 3 delivers single-core speeds of up to 4.5GHz, giving it a distinct edge when it comes to gaming and other applications which aren’t optimised for the large numbers of cores you’d get in a Ryzen system. This is coupled with a high-end Zotac-branded Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. Once the flagship model of the GeForce range, the GTX 1080 is powerful enough to deliver 4K gameplay and now available at a more affordable price. These core components set the system up for blistering performance, although Chillblast has decided not to push performance to the limit this time: Despite using an unlocked ‘K’ edition processor, Chillblast has chosen to exploit the power efficiency of the Kaby Lake architecture by designing a cool and quiet PC suitable for living room use, rather than aggressively overclocking the processor to get the absolute maximum performance. Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 storage Two separate drives each provide a sensible combination of super-fast and high-capacity storage. The super-fast storage comes in the form of a 256GB Samsung SM961 NVMe SSD. This is the OEM version of Samsung’s ‘Polaris’ PCI-Express SSD product line, capable of around six times the performance of the best SATA SSDs. Because 256GB isn’t enough disk space on its own, Chillblast has also included a roomy 2TB hard drive for less performance-critical storage. These core components, plus 16GB of DDR4 memory, are all installed in an Asus Prime Z270M-PLUS motherboard. This mATX form factor motherboard, is itself the source of some of the LED lighting which can be seen through the side of the case. The PCI-Express slots pulse with a warm glow, offset by the cool blue lights from the graphics card and main case fan. The motherboard supports up to two M.2 SSDs in SATA or NVMe mode and is also ready for Intel Optane memory. It comes with PS/2 mouse and keyboard sockets at the rear as well as two each of USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports and single 5Gb/s USB Type-C connector. There’s also 8-channel analogue audio and a single Gigabit LAN port. In keeping with the cool and quiet concept, the system makes use of the motherboard’s built in fan control options which tie in with Asus’s optional overclocking and management software. Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 performance As you’d expect from a PC fitted with a high-end CPU and a GeForce GTX 1080, the Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 delivers gaming performance in spades. Older games such as Thief and Alien Isolation benchmark at over well over 60fps at 4K resolution in High or sometimes even Ultra quality settings. With a more demanding title like Deus Ex Mankind Divided, you’ll be hitting 30fps in 4K Ultra mode, which is fine for playing on the living room TV and if you do want super smooth 60fps action, you’ll be able to get that by stepping down to 2560x1440 on your PC monitor. The Core i7-7700K may not be overclocked, but it still delivers a lot of performance for all your non-gaming needs. You’ll be able to achieve workstation-like performance in tasks such as photo and video editing as you can see from our high PCMark 8 scores which are excellent across the board. The CPU is helped here by the super-fast NVMe storage. If you’re still hungry for a little more speed, you can purchase the PC factory overclocked by Chillblast to 4.6GHz at no extra charge. This will however affect noise and power consumption. The only area where the CPU may lose out is in extremely parallel processing environments, where an 8-core processor, such as an AMD Ryzen 7, may pull ahead. You can see this effect in our Cinebench R15 tests, where the single-core test is excellent, but the multi-core test lags a long way behind Ryzen chips. This does not affect games however, which still currently benefit much more from high performance per core rather than multi-core power. Intel-based PCs currently achieve better performance from NVMe storage devices than AMD-based systems, too. Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 warranty The Fusion Adamantium 3 comes with Chillblast’s excellent 2-year collect and return warranty which extends to 5 years for labour only. It also comes with lifetime phone support. This is one of the better warranty offers available.

Higher performance is available at no extra charge via an optional overclocking option, but not without compromising it’s ‘cool and quiet’ design philosophy. You won’t be expanding it with dual graphics cards, in fact there’s not much room for internal upgrades at all, but it’s also very reasonably priced for a PC of this specification.

The 2-in-1 tablet has been its number one selling product in 2015 and all the way to 2016. However, in recent months, tablet sales, especially that of Microsoft has fallen dramatically. Nonetheless, there are no new updates on the upcoming Surface Pro 5 from the software giant. This is why many consumers and fans alike are wondering when the much awaited tablet will be released. When Microsoft released the current Surface Pro back in 2015, the tablet introduced the new hardware of the time. However, since it has been years after the last update, the current models are somewhat lacking in terms of performance. Surface Pro 5 and Intel Kaby Lake Right now, the consensus is that Microsoft will go for the new Intel Kaby Lake series to power its next generation pro tablets. Of course, it is just plain common sense not to use an older hardware for a new device. While this may not be a surprise at all, perhaps the next question is, “will there be anything new on the Surface Pro 5?” New upgrades Since 2016, many market watchers and pundits have been speculating on what the Surface Pro 5 will be. Apart from the supposed Kaby Lake upgrade, many have given their pieces on what the display of the tablet will be. Surface Pro 4 (via microsoftstore.com) Some argued that the next-generation Surface Pro will retain is 2K resolution. Meanwhile some market watchers suggest that Microsoft might upgrade to a 4K display. Unfortunately, at the moment, there are not a lot of merits into using a 4K display on a tablet. For one,  the human eye will not be able to distinguish the difference in pixel density. This is mainly because the display is minuscule compared to a standard living room television. However, the 4K resolution may, in some cases, improve on the dynamic range of the display. This may result in better colour reproduction and improved contrast and saturation. Another thing worth considering is, 4K displays, due to increased pixel density, will require more power to operate. This will inevitably influence the design of the device, especially on the battery. At the moment, the Surface Pro 4 already has poor battery life with its 2736×1824 display resolution. Having a bigger display resolution will be quite taxing to the tablet’s already small battery. Surface Pro 5 and Snapdragon 835 By now, many will know that Microsoft and Qualcomm are working together to produce the first Snapdragon-powered tablet. Back in 2016, the two companies actually demoed a tablet running on full Windows 10 operating system just like the Surface Pro. In the said demo, the tablet in question is running the Windows 10 OS on a Snapdragon 821 SoC. Immediately after the demo video was released, Microsoft and Qualcomm announced that they are currently working on bringing the said OS onto the Snapdragon 835. MacBook showing Thunderbolt 3 port (via apple.com) While the prospect of having a Snapdragon-powered Windows 10 tablet is nice, it would seem that this product is, first of all, a mobile computer. It should not, however, be confused with a tablet or a laptop which is already mobile. Instead, this piece of device will have its connectivity focused on mobile networks just like a mobile phone. Based on the presentation given during last year’s Windows Hardware Engineering Conference in China, the Snapdragon-powered device will have an e-SIM built in. And since the connectivity is more on mobile networks, users will be able to monitor their data usage. For now, it is still uncertain if this supposed tablet will be a Surface Pro 5. However, there is a chance that Microsoft might introduce this variant in lieu of the M Series Intel-based model. Same old design Due to lack of updates, there are speculations that the Surface Pro 5 will not include massive design changes apart from the new Kaby Lake chips. Even the Surface port, which is a proprietary hardware from Microsoft, will be retained on the new design. Many hopefuls have been asking for the Thunderbolt 3.0 port. Fortunately, the new Kaby Lake series has native support for the interface so a Thunderbolt 3.0 on a Surface Pro 5 is highly likely. Surface Pen (via microsoftstore.com) On the other hand, there are rumors that Microsoft will introduce a new stylus for the Surface Pro. Based on the latest patent rounds filed by the company, it would seem that there will be some minor updates on the stylus including a built-in rechargeable battery. The said battery will be charged wirelessly when it is attached to the side of the tablet. However, as this is still a patent, there is a very slim chance that the feature will turn up on the upcoming iteration of the tablet. Nevertheless, this will, once and for all, answer all the complaints that Surface Pro users have on the Surface Pen. Surface Pro 5 release date There are a number of rumors surrounding the supposed release of the Surface Pro 5. Some say that it might happen sometime in the next couple of months. However, there are some who speculate that the release could be around October this year. This rumor is in line with reports that the tablet will be launched together with the Windows 10 Redstone 3 update. Nevertheless, many are expecting Microsoft to pull one out of the hat during an event in New York on May 2. Unfortunately, the said event, which is called #MicrosoftEDU is focused on delivering the new Windows 10 Cloud operating system. This new OS is Microsoft’s answer to the threat given by Google’s Chrome OS. As with the price, it is highly likely that Microsoft will not introduce a pricing hike on the next generation Surface Pros. This is due to the fact that most of its buyers are non-professionals who use the tablet as a daily driver. This is why the current generation Surface Book’s sales performance is quite stale.

Related Items Microsoft Surface Studio goes on sale in Australia Kids addicted to their mobiles? How to shut them down Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ 'evolutions' unveiled Local Real Estate Subscribe Now IT'S saying something that both the computer using public and AMD both have something to be happy about right now. It's been a long time since processor maker has brought something to market that truly created some competition with the industry heavyweight, Intel. But now they have. This is important for many reasons, not least of all being the pressure it puts on Intel to stop charging so much for processors, finally. It's also important because it creates competition in terms of things like features and compatibility. AMD released its new line of Ryzen processors in March to a lot of hope from those of us who are looking to build or upgrade our computers soon. Mainly this came from seeing Intel-competitive performance at price points so far below what we were used to it has made a huge change to the market. These new processors are based on the much-awaited new Zen architecture and come with new multitasking features and self-diagnostic sensors to make overclocking easier. From its top-of-the-line offering, the 1800X to its entry-level model, the 1400, the Ryzen processors are considered almost as good as their Intel counterparts but much better in terms of value for money. The Ryzen 7 line, the 1800x, 1700x, and 1700, is aimed squarely at intel's i7 series processors, while the Ryzen 5 line is, as you may have guessed, aimed at the Intel i5 series. The Ryzen 5 series, the 1600X, 1600, 1500X, and the 1400 represents the more affordable end of the processor offering from AMD. The 1600X is configured similarly to Intel's Core i7-6800k and has 6 cores running 12 threads. More cores and more threads let heavy-duty software such as image editing, video editing, and gaming run faster and more smoothly. The 1600 also shares the 6-core, 12-thread architecture while the 1500X and 1400 have four cores with eight threads. Even four cores is a solid architecture for anyone who isn't stretching their computer to some kind of limit. All the 5-series processors come with a default clock speed and a boost speed, with the processor running faster when it's better cooled. The 1600x is obviously the fastest out of the box but all processors are unlocked so that enthusiasts can overclock the chip for higher speeds. The suspicion here is that the 1600 will wind up being a better buy than the 1600x despite being 400mhz slower purely because the latter can be overclocked to, hopefully, similar performance to its faster cousin. Like anything to do with overclocking, however, it's not something you do unless you both completely understand how to do it and aren't afraid to risk shortening the lifespan of your processor if you do it badly. The Ryzen 5 processors are for most people. The 1400 being a perfect pick for a home theatre PC. The 1500X is hard to go past for a home computer. The 1600X and 1600 for gamers and people who edit some form of media who need a reliably fast card but can't or don't need to fork out for the Ryzen 7 models. When buying or building a new computer, keep an eye out for the Ryzen chips as they may just save you a lot of money for the performance they put out. amd Read More Login to follow games and gadgets Read More Login to follow intel Read More Login to follow ryzen Read More Login to follow zen architecture Read More Login to follow Topics:  amd games and gadgets intel ryzen zen architecture 0 PRINT Just In Jillaroos to test Kiwis in a chilly Friday night UPDATED: Big bids for Splendour VIP passes auction Butcher reveals secret behind the perfect snag Prison confession: 'She had to be dealt with': court hears Astronomer explains 'strange light' over Ipswich Crash on motorway leaves three injured Top Stories Butcher reveals secret behind the perfect snag PETER Summerville reveals what it takes to make the perfect sausages News 2nd May 2017 4:00 PM Comment Astronomer explains 'strange light' over Ipswich Crash on motorway leaves three injured Vehicle flips in crash on busy motorway Judah turns all four chairs on The Voice JUDAH was so caught up in the moment, he didn't even realise.

Twitter Facebook Intel projects decline in chip prices, and AMD's Ryzen is one reason AMD's lower priced Ryzen chips are putting pressure on Intel's premium chips IDG Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 28 April, 2017 10:13 - - - - print email Comments Intel is forecasting a "slight decline" in its premium chip prices for the remainder of the year, and AMD's Ryzen chips could have played a part in that. Prices of Intel's chips in both desktops and laptops went up in the first quarter. That helped drive up the quarterly revenue for Client Computing Group -- which deals in PC chips -- to $8 billion, which was up 6 percent compared to the same quarter last year. But Intel's PC chips now face serious competition from AMD's new Ryzen chip, which was released last month. Ryzen chips offer competitive performance, and are priced significantly lower. AMD's fastest Ryzen 7 1800X chip -- targeted at gamers -- has eight cores and is priced at $499. A comparable chip like Intel's Core i7-6900K is priced at $1,089. Intel's fastest gaming chip is the Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition chip, which is priced at $1,723. During an earnings call on Thursday, Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich sidestepped a question on whether Ryzen had any role in the projected chip price declines. He said the market dynamics were a reason.Â For more than a decade, AMD's cheaper processors were considered inferior to Intel's chips on performance. PC makers dropped AMD from their product lineup, but are now partnering with the chip maker on Ryzen, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "AMD is offering a competitive part, and their price is significantly lower than Intel's," McGregor said. That is attractive to PC makers, who want to increase their margins on PCs. "There's always the upper echelon that will pay anything for a PC," McGregor said. "This is more about bringing gaming systems to lower prices." It's still early to predict the full impact of Ryzen on the pricing of Intel's chips. But it's already showing up in a couple of places, like in retail stores, where prices of Intel's boxed processors were adjusted after Ryzen's arrival, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. For now, the price pressure is playing out on the premium chips. Later in the year, AMD will release chips for laptops and mainstream desktops. Low-end PCs are even more price sensitive. "Competition is always good, and Intel is certainly feeling the pressure from AMD," McCarron said. Intel could counter Ryzen by offering a newer and faster chips at the similar price compared to processors in its current lineup. Intel will release 8th Generation Core processors later this year, and those chips will be more than 10 percent faster than existing 7th Generation Core chips, also called Kaby Lake. Ryzen isn't the only reason behind Intel's projection of a decline in chip prices. The mix of Intel's chips from low-end to premium chips has slowed down. The price needs to be adjusted so more PC users move from low-end chips like Pentium to Core i5 and i7. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Its most important contributors are the frequency and latency of off-chip accesses and the extent to which long-latency memory accesses can be overlapped with useful computation or with each other. In this paper we present two methods to better understand application and microarchitectural interactions. An epoch profile is an intuitive way to understand the relationships between three important characteristics: theon-chip cache size, the size of the reorder window of an out-of-order processor, and the frequency of processor stalls caused by long-latency,off-chip requests (epochs). By relating these three quantities one can more easily understand an application’s memory reference behavior and thus significantly reduce the design space. While epoch profiles help to provide insight into the behavior of a single application, developing an understanding of a number of applications in the presence of area and core count constraints presents additional challenges. Epoch-based microarchitectural analysis is presented as a better way to understand the trade-offs for memory-bound applications in the presence of these physical constraints. Through epoch profiling and optimization, one can significantly reduce the multidimensional design space for hardware/software optimization through the use of high-level model-driven techniques.

To satisfy the technology's security goals, the external system memory must be cryptographically protected. A new hardware unit added to the processor's memory controller--the Memory Encryption Engine (MEE)--was recently developed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and freshness of this external memory traffic, against eavesdropping and tampering. The MEE is a successful feat of real-world cryptographic engineering: it's the first time such cryptographic memory protection has been added to a widely deployed general-purpose processor.

Sparton LPC-815 and LPC-835 PCs are ready to take the heat by Wayne Manion  5:00 PM on May 1, 2017 Most computers live fairly easy lives. Sure, some of them are punished by overclocking or endure crowded conditions in data centers, but those machines are often cooled by custom water loops or have high-CFM fans constantly blowing fresh air through them. Sparton's Stealth-series PCs are designed to operate for long periods in extreme conditions that most computers and human beings would rather avoid entirely. The LPC-815 and LPC-835 are specced to function in ambient temperatures from -13° F (-25° C) all the way up to 158° F (70° C). They do their work without the benefit of fans or any other moving parts, as well. The LPC-815 is powered by an Intel Bay Trail Celeron J1900 quad-core SoC that runs at up to 2.42 GHz accompanied by 4 GB of non-upgradeable DDR3L memory. What the machine lacks in processing firepower it makes up somewhat in connectivity, with a pair of Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet ports, a smattering of USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, DisplayPort and HDMI outputs, two serial ports, and four digital I/O pins for controlling things like external relays. The machine even has an onboard watchdog timer that can issue a system reset automatically should it detect a hang. The LPC-835 is a bit bigger and packs considerably more grunt in the form of a standard Intel Core i5-5350U or an optional Core i7-5650U CPU. The stock model contains 4 GB of DDR3L memory, and there's an available 8 GB option at additional cost. The machine can drive up to three monitors with its DVI-D port and DisplayPort daisy-chaining. Two Gigabit Ethernet ports come as standard equipment, and there's an option to add four more ports. Both machines come with solid state drives from 128 GB up to 1 TB. Buyers can add wireless connectivity in the form of two external-facing SIM card slots and an optional Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth card that goes into one of the machine's two mini-PCIe slots. Both machines can be powered by PSUs providing anywhere from 9V to 48V DC for enhanced compatibility with existing equipment. The unique capabilities of these PCs do not come cheap. The LPC-815 rings in at $1500 and the more capable LPC-835 starts at $2400. Sparton says both machines are compatible with Windows 7, 8.1, and 10, as well as Ubuntu Linux.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 23:06 Panther_Modern says: The game is terribly optimized, it isn’t a question of handling a weird use case that no one cares about. For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?). Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:54 Styxie says: Nice, but can it run The Witcher 3 at 4 FPS, like my i7 4790k’s integrated graphics? This new GPU can’t get here quick enough.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post! I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly. Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware. His channel is aptly called “Low Spec Gamer” and with some choice console commands he squeezes the last drops of performance out of DOOM running on a Celeron and Intel HD Graphics: link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:49 Mister eX says: Yeah, I know him! His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job. Love these low-spec articles– I can always read hardware porn on Tom’s or Ars, but this here blurb addressed a topic that’s underserved. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 22:11 haldolium says: Do you use streaming? My laptop had the same issues, clocking down and getting too hot and also way too loud, so I tried streaming instead. With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:06 Kasjer says: Well, streaming is not a viable option while traveling. Maybe in hotel, but not during long train ride or flight. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 19:34 haldolium says: Well I don’t know about others, but for me playing core games isn’t viable most of the time in any train or plane anyways, unless you pay a tremendous amount of money for traveling in a (good) 1st class in which case you might be able to get a proper rig anyways. I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all. Keep it up. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:33 Rack says: I really can’t stand turning settings so low. I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming.

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to “qwerty” and “123456,” which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like “abcdef” or “letmein,” or even normal words like “password” or “dragon,” is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Hackers’ password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called “hashes,” of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it’s computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker’s in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a “dictionary attack.” The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as “qwertypassword”), doubled sequences (“qwertyqwerty”), and words followed by numbers (“qwerty123”). Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a “brute-force attack,” guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That’s true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That’s why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters – they’re designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password is crackable. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorizing long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way “Every Good Boy Does Fine” reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like “freQ!9tY!juNC,” which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, “freQ!,” “9tY!” and “juNC,” reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: “freak,” “ninety” and “junk.” People are better at memorizing passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don’t reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favorites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. Beyond the password Not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average internet user has 19 different passwords. It’s easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the “I forgot my password” link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So no more excuses. Let’s put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch “qwerty” for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you’re done, go ahead and have that cake, because you’ll deserve it. Megan Squire, Professor of Computing Sciences, Elon University This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Twitter Facebook AMD shares timing for Ryzen 3, mobile chips and Vega GPUs The Ryzen 3 chips for desktops will come early in the second half, while Ryzen mobile chips will come late in the year Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 02 May, 2017 09:16 - - - - print email Comments AMD's Ryzen chips are off to a strong start in desktops, and more chips are coming in the second half of this year. New chips for desktops, called Ryzen 3, will come in the earlier part of the second half, while Ryzen mobile chips -- code-named Raven Ridge -- will come out around the end-of-year holiday season. AMD CEO Lisa Su shared the release schedule during a first-quarter earnings call on Monday. She also said top PC makers will launch desktops with the already shipping Ryzen 5 and 7 chips later this quarter. The Ryzen 3 is expected to be for low-end desktops, while the Ryzen 5 and 7 chips are faster. Late last week, Acer announced its Aspire GX desktop with Ryzen chip options. In the coming months, AMD will also launch Vega GPUs for the gaming, professional workstation and data center markets. Some Vega GPUs will launch this quarter. Vega GPUs will be priced higher than Polaris, the existing GPU architecture, because of advanced technologies, Su said. The Vega GPUs will have a new memory subsystem, a faster computing engine and a "new geometry pipeline to dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency for the next generation of GPU workloads," Su said. The Ryzen launch dominated much of the earnings call. Ryzen was AMD's first big new chip design in more than a decade, and it opened to good reviews. After a string of failed chips, a strong Ryzen launch was critical for AMD. Ryzen chips first shipped in March, and the demand from home PC builders was strong. There was a temporary slowdown as motherboard shipments were constrained, but the supply went back to normal after a few weeks. Large PC makers will announce Ryzen-based desktops this quarter. AMD's goal with Ryzen is to get Intel fans to switch. It's not clear that it's succeeded yet, but competition may soon drive down Intel's prices. Intel last week said it is expecting a slight decline in its chip prices, which analysts attributed partly to Ryzen. AMD also hopes its users of its own chips, like the A-series, FX and Athlon, move up to the more expensive (and profitable) Ryzen. That transition could last well into next year, Su said. But AMD won't get rid of its legacy chips. Chips like Athlon and FX are still popular in some countries, so The move to newer architectures in some countries will be slower, Su said. Ryzen chips are competing with Intel's 7th Generation Core processors, code-named Kaby Lake, and later will go up against the 8th Generation Core processors, due later this year. On a GAAP basis, AMD reported first-quarter revenue of $984 million, up from $832 million in the same quarter last year. Quarterly net loss was $73 million, compared with a net loss of $109 million a year earlier.Â Network Professionals Survey with Computerworld Australia More from Computerworld Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature VGA res and 20 FPS - but it's fine! Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?).

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post! I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly. Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware. His channel is aptly called “Low Spec Gamer” and with some choice console commands he squeezes the last drops of performance out of DOOM running on a Celeron and Intel HD Graphics: link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:49 Mister eX says: Yeah, I know him! His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:50 Tigris says: Well from a computer game journalist one would expect to have a better laptop though, since playing games is kind of his job. I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop. Also a side note: I had “supporter” written in red on the top oif my screen below the “Howdy Tigris” this kinda seemed like a bug.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job. Love these low-spec articles– I can always read hardware porn on Tom’s or Ars, but this here blurb addressed a topic that’s underserved.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of. Those games had brutally small textures stretched over the map mesh. It’s really noticeable with a modern patched version. Also, high-five for remembering that Myth existed.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming.

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Can the mobile-chip maker navigate through the fierce headwinds without sinking? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 1, 2017 at 4:47PM Shares of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) declined nearly 20% since the beginning of the year, because of ongoing concerns about its core chipmaking and patent licensing businesses. Let's examine the bearish and bullish takes on this stock to see if it will sink or swim this year. Why Qualcomm could sink Qualcomm generates most of its revenue through its lower-margin chipmaking business, and most of its profits through its higher-margin patent licensing business. Image source: Qualcomm. The Qualcomm CDMA technologies (QCT) business, which makes Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon processors, is ceding market share to cheaper chipmakers such as MediaTek and first-party chips from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi. The QCT unit also recently lost its exclusive spot producing baseband modems for iPhones to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which won a portion of the design wins for the iPhone 7. The Qualcomm technology licensing (QTL) business, which owns a massive portfolio of 3G and 4G patents, collects royalties on every smartphone sold worldwide. That business model is being challenged by defiant OEMs and government regulators, which claim that Qualcomm's cut -- 3.5% to 5% of the entire device's price -- is too high. There are also persistent allegations that Qualcomm leveraged its dominance of wireless patents to push former chipmaking rivals such as Texas Instruments out of the application processor market. As a result, Qualcomm was fined in China and South Korea, had to negotiate new licensing terms with Chinese OEMs, was charged by the FTC for using anti-competitive tactics, lost a royalty dispute with BlackBerry, and was sued by Apple. Apple even recently stopped paying all licensing revenues to contract manufacturers of the iPhone, which forced Qualcomm to slash its third-quarter forecasts sales forecast by $500 million. That bleak warning indicates that Wall Street's current estimates for flat sales growth and 5% earnings growth this year might be far too optimistic. Why Qualcomm could swim Qualcomm's near-term headwinds look brutal, but the company remains the best in breed producer of mobile systems on chips, which bundle together application processors, GPUs, and baseband modems. Samsung's use of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 in U.S. versions of the new Galaxy S8 indicate that the chip will probably keep powering top-tier flagship devices for the foreseeable future. Qualcomm is also diversifying its QCT business away from mobile devices, with new Snapdragon chipsets for wearables, drones, connected cars, other Internet of Things gadgets, PCs, and even data centers -- which should all reduce the weight of smartphone chips on Qualcomm's top line. Image source: Qualcomm. Qualcomm claims that its Snapdragon Wear chips already power over 80% of Android Wear smartwatches worldwide. It also recently partnered with Microsoft to develop Snapdragon processors, which were fully compatible with Windows 10, and launched high-end chips for ARM-based servers. Both moves clearly target Intel's PC and data center strongholds. Qualcomm's planned acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), which was recently approved by U.S. regulators, will also make it the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world and boost its estimated revenues for 2018 by nearly 40%. This move, which complements the launch of its Snapdragon Automotive chips in 2015, will help it challenge companies like NVIDIA in the connected and driverless car markets over the next few years. As for licensing fees, Qualcomm's patent portfolio still gives it plenty of legal clout against defiant companies like Apple. Qualcomm might eventually be forced to reduce its cut -- for example, basing its cut on the price of wireless components instead of the entire device -- but fines and lawsuits won't likely kill the entire business. Lastly, Qualcomm is a cheap stock with a high dividend -- which is increasingly rare in today's frothy market. The stock trades at 18 times earnings, which is much lower than its industry average of 28; and it pays a forward dividend yield of 4.3%, which is supported by a comfortable payout ratio of 71%. Those figures should limit Qualcomm's downside potential for the foreseeable future. My verdict: Qualcomm will tread water It will be tough for Qualcomm to rally meaningfully this year, because of all the challenges it faces from rival chipmakers, irate regulators, and defiant licensees. But I also doubt that it will sink, since its expansion into adjacent markets and the NXP deal should greatly improve its long-term prospects. Instead, I believe that it will tread water, since its low valuation and high dividend should attract income investors and set a floor under the stock.    Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Intel Confirms Vulnerability In Intel AMT/ME Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 1 May 2017 at 05:04 PM EDT. 17 Comments Many of you already have expressed your displeasure over Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT) and Management Engine (ME) for various reasons in the past and now it's been disclosed that for years there has been a vulnerability in this business-oriented feature that could open your Intel systems up to attackers. Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology, and Intel Standard Manageability are subject to a hole allowing an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the management features for these products. The issue was made public today via INTEL-SA-00075. For those with AMT enabled on their systems, it can affect supported processors going back to 2008 when AMT6 debuted -- thus the vulnerability covers from Nehalem to Kabylake CPUs. More details via Intel's security statement and have begun offering updated firmware to system providers to address the issue. Intel has also published a mitigation guide. 17 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware AMD Takes Meaningful CPU Market Share From Intel For The First Time In 3 Years By Khalid Moammer 12 hours ago 364Shares Share Tweet Submit AMD has reportedly gained 2.2% CPU market share in the first quarter of 2017. This makes it the very first time the Sunnyvale, California based chip maker has made any meaningful share gains against its much larger rival Intel since Q1 2014. Which was the last quarter where the company saw any share gains that amounted to anything more than 1%. The data is courtesy of PassMark’s quarterly market share report, which is based on the thousands of submissions that go through the database in any given quarter.  It’s important to note that because PassMark’s market share data is based on benchmark submissions it counts actual systems in use, rather than systems sold. It also does not include consoles or any computer systems running operating systems other than Windows. Related AMD’s New Ryzen Chipset Drivers Boost Gaming Performance & Power Efficiency PassMark – This graph counts the baselines submitted to us during these time period and therefore is representative of CPUs in use rather than CPUs purchased. – The Quarters are by the calendar year rather than financial. (i.e. Q1 starts January 1st) – Baselines can be submitted from anywhere therefore these are global statistics. – We do receive a small number of submissions of CPU types other than AMD and Intel however the percentage is so small as to make it not worth graphing. This combined with rounding off the percentages to 2 decimal places will account for each quarter not always adding up to exactly 100%. – This chart only includes x86 processors and does not include other chip architectures these manufacturers may sell. – This chart only includes CPUs installed into PCs and does not include game consoles. – As the PerformanceTest software only runs on Windows OS and counts on user submitting their benchmarks. This chart may be non reflective of non Windows user base. AMD Likely Sold All Of Its Available Ryzen Inventory During The Intitial Launch While a 2% share gain does not seem like much it’s actually quite significant for a number of reasons. Ryzen had only been on sale for one out of the three months in Q1. And only the more expensive top-end Ryzen 7 processors were available. Ryzen CPUs were going out of stock as soon as they were put on sale on all major e-tailers in North America, Germany and the UK in March. This means that AMD was likely selling every single Ryzen chip it was making. Advertisement The initial launch was also hamstrung by a shortage of AM4 motherboards. Today many AM4 motherboards are consistently in-stock and there are more than twice as many Ryzen processors to choose from, thanks to the Ryzen 5 launch last month. At the end of the second quarter, Ryzen processors will also have been on sale throughout the entirety of the quarter, with double the SKUs and the bulk of the AM4 motherboard shortage gone. As such Q2 market share data will reflect Ryzen’s performance in the market with considerably more accuracy. AMD’s CPU Userbase Grew By 12% In Q1 Driven By Ryzen 7 Sales In March In the time period between the 1st of January 2017 and the 31st of March of the same year the AMD CPU installed base grew from 18.1%, excluding consoles, to 20.3%. This represents an accumulative growth of 12%. Related AMD Confirms Vega Launching This Quarter, Shows 8K Video Editing Demo Ryzen officially debuted in early March and the majority of share gains made by AMD in Q1 are attributable to the users that purchased and built PCs based on Ryzen during the last month of Q1. In April, the company followed up the Ryzen 7 release with the more popular, and affordable, Ryzen 5 processor lineup. The last time AMD saw similar share gains was in Q4 of 2012, which amounted to 3%. At the time the company’s newly introduced Piledriver FX CPU and APU lineups had been on the market in their entirety throughout the fourth quarter. By comparison only three Ryzen SKUs were available in Q1 of this year, only during March and only for desktops, which clearly underlines the great magnitude of the market’s appetite for Ryzen processors.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 23:06 Panther_Modern says: The game is terribly optimized, it isn’t a question of handling a weird use case that no one cares about. For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?). Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:54 Styxie says: Nice, but can it run The Witcher 3 at 4 FPS, like my i7 4790k’s integrated graphics? This new GPU can’t get here quick enough.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post! I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly. Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware.

His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job. Love these low-spec articles– I can always read hardware porn on Tom’s or Ars, but this here blurb addressed a topic that’s underserved.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 19:34 haldolium says: Well I don’t know about others, but for me playing core games isn’t viable most of the time in any train or plane anyways, unless you pay a tremendous amount of money for traveling in a (good) 1st class in which case you might be able to get a proper rig anyways. I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming.

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Mini PC invasion: These radically tiny computers fit in the palm of your hand Video Windows Defender: What changes in Windows 10 Creators Update Mother’s Day is coming up, and online retailers are gearing up for its arrival with some tech deals. Currently, the Microsoft Store is selling the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA-C4-GR for $250. This two-in-one convertible PC has a detachable keyboard, allowing you to use it as either a Windows 10 tablet or a laptop. When we looked at this 2-in-1 in December, it delivered a pretty good experience overall, with great battery life but lower-end performance. That's in part due to the 1.44GHz Intel “Cherry Trail” Atom x5-Z8350 processor, which goes easier on power consumption but is one of Intel's slower CPUs. That may not sound exciting, but it works very well for basic tasks. If all you need to do is editing documents, web surfing, and online video, you should be just fine. [ Further reading: Our best Windows 10 tricks, tips and tweaks ] This notebook comes equipped with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC onboard flash storage, 64-bit Windows 10 Home, and a 10.1-inch, 1280x800 touchscreen. For ports, you get just one USB 3.0 and a micro HDMI, but there is a micro SD card reader that supports up to 512GB if you need more storage. The Transformer Mini also supports Bluetooth 4.1, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Miracast. And it even comes with a pen to take advantage of all of Windows 10’s evolving ink features. About the only disappointing part of this sale is the color available: You're limited to just the gray version.

Officials want to end rent court disparities News Opinion Op-Eds Many of America's best and brightest are immigrants 'A Day Without Immigrants' in Baltimore "We are one world and we are borderless. ... And for those that don't know that, you do now," said Maria Gabriela Aldana Enriquez during a march in Highlandtown for "A Day Without Immigrants." (Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun video) "We are one world and we are borderless. ... And for those that don't know that, you do now," said Maria Gabriela Aldana Enriquez during a march in Highlandtown for "A Day Without Immigrants." (Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun video) Just the other day, I read a long and interesting obituary in The Sun: that of Dr. Antemio Arciaga, an outstanding physician who made house calls and "never turned away a patient who couldn't pay." Dr. Arciaga was a Filipino immigrant. And recently, on the BBC News, I saw demonstrated a unique invention: a bottle, jar or tube made with a distinctive chemical so that every bit of the contents would be used — from ketchup to toothpaste to paint. This invention, totally eliminating waste, would save millions of dollars. The inventor: an Indian immigrant who is a graduate student at MIT. Of the six Nobel Prize winners in America in 2016, all six were immigrants. Indeed, more than one-third of U.S. Nobel Prize winners in chemistry, medicine, and physics have been immigrants. Since 1960, 23 immigrants won Nobel Prizes in chemistry, 20 in medicine and 21 in physics. These are amazing statistics that should not be ignored. Clearly, immigration and public education are what make America great. Most people coming to this country cannot afford to send their children to private schools. To be sure, most immigrants come here not only to flee oppression but also for the free and quality education our public schools have long provided. Speaking from my own experience, when I taught in New York's inner city schools in the 1960s, my best students — and best behaved students — were those from South American and African countries. Free education was not something they took for granted. To them and to their families it was a privilege, sorely lacking in the countries from whence they came, and they were determined to take advantage of this opportunity. To continue to be the leader in the free world, America must move forward, rapidly, rather than look back at the manufacturing jobs of 60 years ago — jobs long replaced by robots and technology. Nor can we look back at mining jobs that pollute our atmosphere, causing health problems for young and old alike. We must educate our students and our workers in the new technologies. So far, no other country has matched us in technological advances or in medical research. I hope that won't change. Silicon Valley, responsible for billions of dollars in economic output, and a creator of thousands of jobs, is a perfect example of the successful contributions of educated immigrants. Approximately one-quarter of American tech companies have been founded entirely or in part by foreigners. And more than 52 percent of Silicon Valley start-ups between 1995 and 2005 were founded or co-founded by people born outside of the U.S. Surely, most of us have heard of Intel, Yahoo, and, of course, Google. But how many know that Andy Grove, Intel's former chairman and CEO, was born in Hungary in 1936 and immigrated to the U.S. in his 20s. Or that Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo, was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and moved to San Jose, Calif. as a child with his parents. Or that Sergey Brin, who co-founded Google, came to the U.S. from his native Russia when he was six. According to the National Science Foundation, 60 percent of doctoral degrees in engineering are awarded to foreign students here on temporary visas. Why would we want them to leave? Paul Graham, a partner in Y Combinator, a venture-capital firm that provides funding to start-ups, claims that the U.S. government's recent immigration restrictions are "the biggest constraint on the number of new start-ups that get created in the U.S." And he said that in 2009, under the Obama administration. So far, I've written about jobs at the top, for well-educated immigrants. But what about those jobs at the bottom — jobs that keep our country strong but that many native-born Americans prefer not to do? Dawn to dusk, back-breaking jobs, such as building houses, replacing roofs, landscaping, tarring roads, planting and harvesting crops and, especially here in Maryland, working on chicken farms and in the crab and oyster industries. Several weeks ago, we witnessed one of the consequences of failing to take Syrian refugees, especially children, into our country. Our administration's small military raid "to retaliate" against the Syrians for gassing innocent citizens, many of them children, barely compensates for our president's immigrant phobia. Our immigrants are not terrorists. Our mass shootings — the Connecticut school children, Columbine, the black church in South Carolina — were carried out by deranged Americans, not by immigrants. So much for the latest "foreigner fright." Realistically, looking at our economy — from top to bottom — we should heed poet Emma Lazarus' words on our Statue of Liberty: "give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." Our immigrants, yearning to breathe free, have energized our country, making it smart and rich and great.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 23:06 Panther_Modern says: The game is terribly optimized, it isn’t a question of handling a weird use case that no one cares about. For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?). Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:54 Styxie says: Nice, but can it run The Witcher 3 at 4 FPS, like my i7 4790k’s integrated graphics? This new GPU can’t get here quick enough.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post.

I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly.

His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job. Love these low-spec articles– I can always read hardware porn on Tom’s or Ars, but this here blurb addressed a topic that’s underserved.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming. (no, there is no chance of hardware damage, just crashes and a slight/minute chance of software corruption or losing unsaved work) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 15:31 poliovaccine says: As someone currently doing most of their gaming on a laptop with almost exactly the same specs as the “clearly underpowered” one in this example, I gotta say, the struggle is real. The big broad bouncer of technological limitation keeps me out of the current gen of games – if it werent for titles like Tyranny and Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor I wouldnt be playing anything newer than 2014..! Gee you guys, The Witcher 2 was pretty interesting, wonder what they’ll cook up next..?

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

(AMZN) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) Friday’s Vital Data: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Intel Corporation (INTC) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are trending broadly higher this morning, after Congress finally decided to fund the government, but only through September. Wall Street’s attention will now turn once again to a flood of corporate earnings reports and this week’s key economic data. Speaking of which, several reports are due ahead of the open this morning, including March personal income, consumer spending and core inflation figures, the March Markit manufacturing report and the March ISM construction spending report. Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.16%, S&P 500 futures have added 0.23% and Nasdaq-100 futures have gained 0.38%. On the options front, traders appeared nervous heading into the weekend, as puts accounted for the bulk of Friday’s activity — possibly hedging against a possible U.S. government shutdown. Overall, about 15.3 million calls and 16.4 million puts changed hands on Friday. On the CBOE, however, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio slipped to 0.68 and the 10-day moving average fell to a one-week low of 0.66. Despite political concerns, corporate earnings drove most of the volume for Friday’s most actively options. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which reports after the close tomorrow, and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), which will release its quarterly report on Wednesday, both topped Friday’s action as traders positioned ahead of the events. Finally Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) rounded out the top three most active options in the wake of the company’s Thursday’s afternoon report. Facebook Inc (FB) Social media giant Facebook is entering the earnings confessional this week. Wall Street currently has its sights set on a profit of $1.12 per share and revenue of $7.85 billion. The whisper number rests at $1.21 per share per EarningsWhispers.com. In addition to the top- and bottom-line figures, analysts will be scrutinizing user growth and, more importantly, ad revenue growth, which has hit some bumps in the road this year. FB stock rallied roughly 4.6% last week, putting the shares north of former resistance at $150. Options traders don’t appear too concerned about Wednesday’s report, as calls continue to dominate in the options pits. On Friday, FB saw 1.13 million contracts change hands, with calls making up 65% of the day’s take. As for 5 May options, the put/call OI ratio comes in at an optimistic reading of 0.63, indicating an above-average number of calls focused on Facebook’s quarterly report. Currently, 5 May implieds are pricing in a 4.26% move for FB stock following Wednesday’s quarterly report.

Will 'FANG' earnings help GOOGL stock drift higher, or will overbought Alphabet shares consolidate their gains By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 1, 2017, 10:16 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Tuesday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Can Earnings Send Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Soaring Back to $6.50?

(AMZN) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) Friday’s Vital Data: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Intel Corporation (INTC) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) View All Posts Last week, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) allayed fears that its ad revenue may be under fire from increased competition. Google’s parent company blew past Wall Street’s first quarter expectations with earnings that rose 28% year-over-year and revenue that jumped 22% by the same measure. What’s more, operating margins surged 27% despite a hiring rush during the quarter. Furthermore, unlike fellow “FANG” member Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which retreated sharply from its post-earnings highs, Alphabet stock held its ground following its earnings report. Follow-through buying appears to be creeping into the shares as well, with GOOGL looking to drift higher in Monday’s trading. Here, we’ll look at the sentiment and technical picture for Alphabet shares, and determine the best way (or ways) to play the stock in the coming weeks. What Could Drive GOOGL Stock Higher? If earnings go well for a few other Big Tech stocks — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) release their quarterly reports later this week — we could see a halo effect push shares higher throughout the short-term. That said, there are some technical concerns that could slow Alphabet’s roll. Click to Enlarge Shares are considerably overbought right now, with their 14-day Relative Strength Index reading hovering above 84. Additionally, GOOGL stock met with intraday resistance near $930 on Friday, and could find trouble pushing past the $930-$940 region until the stock’s overbought condition is unwound. Unfortunately for Alphabet bulls, there is little in the way of wiggle room for additional bullish sentiment to help drive the stock higher. Currently, Thomson/First Call reports that 40 of the 46 analysts following GOOGL stock rate the shares a “buy” or better, with only six holdouts. If those six didn’t budge following last week’s earnings report, chances are that they won’t be upgrading Alphabet anytime soon. There is potential for price-target increases, however, with the consensus price target of $983.65 resting a mere 6.4% above Alphabet’s Friday close. However, valuation concerns could just as well prompt hold ratings as the stock moves higher. Options traders have grown a bit cautious when it comes to the short-term outlook for GOOGL stock. Currently, the May put/call open interest ratio rests at 1.08, as puts outnumber calls among those options set to expire within the next month. Furthermore, peak call OI of 980 contracts for the series rests at the in-the-money $900 strike, with considerably less OI residing north of Alphabet’s current perch. In short, options traders aren’t looking for shares to move much higher over the short-term.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature VGA res and 20 FPS - but it's fine! Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 23:06 Panther_Modern says: The game is terribly optimized, it isn’t a question of handling a weird use case that no one cares about. For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.)

Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?).

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post.

I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly. Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware. His channel is aptly called “Low Spec Gamer” and with some choice console commands he squeezes the last drops of performance out of DOOM running on a Celeron and Intel HD Graphics: link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:49 Mister eX says: Yeah, I know him! His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop. Also a side note: I had “supporter” written in red on the top oif my screen below the “Howdy Tigris” this kinda seemed like a bug.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job. Love these low-spec articles– I can always read hardware porn on Tom’s or Ars, but this here blurb addressed a topic that’s underserved.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 04:57 Frankie The Patrician[PF] says: The graphics remind me of the Myth RTS series, which is not bad! For 90s, anyway. Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of. Those games had brutally small textures stretched over the map mesh. It’s really noticeable with a modern patched version. Also, high-five for remembering that Myth existed.

The basic gameplay was superb, both in single-player and multiplayer, and I’ve never played anything else with that specific type of pure tactical combat with no resource management at all. And the writing + art assets, both sprites and loading screens, were so much better than… honestly virtually anything I’ve played before or since.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming. (no, there is no chance of hardware damage, just crashes and a slight/minute chance of software corruption or losing unsaved work) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 15:31 poliovaccine says: As someone currently doing most of their gaming on a laptop with almost exactly the same specs as the “clearly underpowered” one in this example, I gotta say, the struggle is real. The big broad bouncer of technological limitation keeps me out of the current gen of games – if it werent for titles like Tyranny and Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor I wouldnt be playing anything newer than 2014..! Gee you guys, The Witcher 2 was pretty interesting, wonder what they’ll cook up next..? Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:18 Kaeoschassis says: On an ancient, physically broken laptop bearing a particularly terrible intel graphics setup (which has all sorts of fun quirks, for example, glitching out like crazy anytime anything tries to do v-synch ever), and yeah, I know the feeling. There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Rawpixel.com via shutterstock.com Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The first Thursday in May is World Password Day, but don’t buy a cake or send cards. Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to “qwerty” and “123456,” which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like “abcdef” or “letmein,” or even normal words like “password” or “dragon,” is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Hackers’ password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called “hashes,” of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it’s computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker’s in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a “dictionary attack.” The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as “qwertypassword”), doubled sequences (“qwertyqwerty”), and words followed by numbers (“qwerty123”). Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a “brute-force attack,” guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That’s true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That’s why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters – they’re designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password is crackable. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorizing long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way “Every Good Boy Does Fine” reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like “freQ!9tY!juNC,” which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, “freQ!,” “9tY!” and “juNC,” reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: “freak,” “ninety” and “junk.” People are better at memorizing passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don’t reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favorites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. No! Don’t do this! designer491 via shutterstock.com Beyond the password Not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average internet user has 19 different passwords. It’s easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the “I forgot my password” link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So no more excuses. Let’s put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch “qwerty” for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you’re done, go ahead and have that cake, because you’ll deserve it.

Last week we gave out a lot of processors, so it’s only fitting that today something to use those processors then. Thankfully MSI has just what we need, as the PC technology has sent over a pair of their latest gaming motherboards. Need something for an Intel Core processor? Or an AMD Ryzen? The good news is that no matter what, today MSI will have you covered. MSI Z270 GAMING M7 MSI X370 GAMING PLUS The AnandTech 20th Anniversary Celebration – MSI Giveaway MSI Z270 GAMING M7 First off we have one of MSI’s high-end Z270 chipset boards for Intel’s Core processors, the MSI Z270 GAMING M7. The GAMING M7 is a full ATX board, giving it room for 3 PCIe x16 slots, and another 3 PCIe x1 slots. Along with the traditional form factor, the board also sports a trio of M.2 slots, and even a U.2 port for external SSDs. MSI has also added several third-party controllers to the board, including an ASMedia ASM2142 for USB 3.1 (Gen 2) support, a Killer E2500 controller for GigE networking, and a Realtek ALC 1220 for audio. And as this is a high-end board, MSI hasn’t skimped on the features either. Along with their usual high-end BIOS features – including BIOS Flashback+ – MSI has also thrown in RGB lighting via their Mystic Light RGB system. MSI X370 GAMING PLUS Meanwhile on the AMD side of the aisle, we have the MSI X370 GAMING PLUS. Based on AMD’s X370 chipset for Ryzen, this is also a full ATX board, sporting 3 PCIe x16 slots (2x 3.0, and 1x 2.0), 3 PCIe x1 slots, and a single M.2 slot. In terms of third party controllers, we’re looking at an ASMedia ASM2142 for USB 3.1 (Gen 2) support, a Realtek ALC 892 for audio, and a Realtek 8111H GigE LAN controller. Unlike its Intel counterpart, this board doesn’t feature RGB lighting, though it still features MSI’s Mystic Light Sync controller for controlling other RGB solutions. And it come with MSI’s usual high-end BIOS features. Finally, as with our other giveaways, today’s giveaway is only open for 48 hours, so be sure to enter soon. However please note that for legal reasons, we’re only able to open these giveaways to residents of the United States. Good luck to everyone! And be sure to check in tomorrow for our next giveaway.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature VGA res and 20 FPS - but it's fine! Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 20:32 automatic says: That’s not game devs work, it’s work for ppl that build game engines. And considering the continuously growing amount of ‘ppl from the past’ that there is out there it may as well be worth it.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 23:06 Panther_Modern says: The game is terribly optimized, it isn’t a question of handling a weird use case that no one cares about. For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?). Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:54 Styxie says: Nice, but can it run The Witcher 3 at 4 FPS, like my i7 4790k’s integrated graphics? This new GPU can’t get here quick enough. I’ve been surviving on nothing but Battle Brothers, Crusader Kings 2 and Spelunky for three months now.

Hey it was that or something pithy about how it looks no different. So droll and on trend. Sadly my poor pc won’t run it whatever, so don’t even get to try. Boo! Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post! I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly. Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware. His channel is aptly called “Low Spec Gamer” and with some choice console commands he squeezes the last drops of performance out of DOOM running on a Celeron and Intel HD Graphics: link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:49 Mister eX says: Yeah, I know him! His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:50 Tigris says: Well from a computer game journalist one would expect to have a better laptop though, since playing games is kind of his job. I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job. Love these low-spec articles– I can always read hardware porn on Tom’s or Ars, but this here blurb addressed a topic that’s underserved.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 19:34 haldolium says: Well I don’t know about others, but for me playing core games isn’t viable most of the time in any train or plane anyways, unless you pay a tremendous amount of money for traveling in a (good) 1st class in which case you might be able to get a proper rig anyways. I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all. Keep it up. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:33 Rack says: I really can’t stand turning settings so low. I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 04:57 Frankie The Patrician[PF] says: The graphics remind me of the Myth RTS series, which is not bad! For 90s, anyway. Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of. Those games had brutally small textures stretched over the map mesh. It’s really noticeable with a modern patched version. Also, high-five for remembering that Myth existed. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 16:45 Enkidum says: I wish someone would remake Myths I and II. The basic gameplay was superb, both in single-player and multiplayer, and I’ve never played anything else with that specific type of pure tactical combat with no resource management at all. And the writing + art assets, both sprites and loading screens, were so much better than… honestly virtually anything I’ve played before or since.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 13:18 SirCanealot says: Have you tried undervolting via Intel Extreme tuner? Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming. (no, there is no chance of hardware damage, just crashes and a slight/minute chance of software corruption or losing unsaved work) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 15:31 poliovaccine says: As someone currently doing most of their gaming on a laptop with almost exactly the same specs as the “clearly underpowered” one in this example, I gotta say, the struggle is real. The big broad bouncer of technological limitation keeps me out of the current gen of games – if it werent for titles like Tyranny and Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor I wouldnt be playing anything newer than 2014..! Gee you guys, The Witcher 2 was pretty interesting, wonder what they’ll cook up next..? Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:18 Kaeoschassis says: On an ancient, physically broken laptop bearing a particularly terrible intel graphics setup (which has all sorts of fun quirks, for example, glitching out like crazy anytime anything tries to do v-synch ever), and yeah, I know the feeling. There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Robinson It's about to become one of the biggest tech rivalries of all time. We're talking bigger than AMD vs. Intel, Netflix vs. Comcast, and Apple's iOS vs. Alphabet's Android. That's because this growing showdown is taking place over the Internet of Everything (IoE). There's a lot riding on the line here. Over the next two decades, the IoE will have a business and economic impact worth between $14 trillion and $25 trillion. See, the IoE will connect trillions of sensors around the world that will be attached to everything from autos and streetlights to shipping boxes and robots to smart cities and homes. That's why General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) and Siemens AG (OTCMKTS: SIEGY) are fighting so hard to dominate this budding field. One of the two stands to profit hugely. And so do you. The Showdown The IoE will play a central role in what I call the "Convergence Economy." That's when multiple technologies "converge" to create whole new technologies, devices, and/or business opportunities. And in the IoE, we're talking about a world in which just about every physical object – including probably our own bodies – is in some way connected to the web. And that puts the cloud front and center in the battle between GE and Siemens. The reason: The IoE will create a tsunami of data that will be stored in remote data centers so it can be accessed from anywhere in the world. The American GE is surely the premier industrial firm in the world. Its consumer division has long been at the forefront of appliances, electrical equipment, and lighting. And enterprises turn to GE to solve major challenges in energy generation, security, inspection equipment, and medical devices. Now, GE wants to take every one of those businesses into the digital sphere, bringing smarts and communications to all the products it makes. In fact, GE now calls itself the "digital industrial company." Bill Ruh, GE's chief digital officer, has quickly built a team of 1,200 in Silicon Valley to ensure that the firm's Predix industrial cloud-based platform is embedded in every new product the firm designs. And not just products from GE… The firm says that Predix "works with operating assets from any vendor or vintage." The software captures and analyzes the massive reams of data that are being produced today – and the even larger amount of info that the IoE will produce. Applying Predix software to aircraft engine maintenance, for example, has reduced down time by 25%. This is now a nearly $6 billion business for GE, and the firm thinks it will be a $20 billion business by 2020. But GE will need to keep close tabs on its main global rival… The European That's Germany's Siemens. The firm's MindSphere platform performs many of the same functions as Predix. Siemens sees MindSphere as a "Platform-as-a-Service" (PaaS) that other firms can use to build IoE applications. And both of these firms know that all of this action will be taking place in the cloud. So they're joining forces with the leading global cloud-focused tech firms. For example, the Azure cloud platform from Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) is being optimized to handle the Big Data output that each MindSphere project will produce. The HANA platform from SAP SE (NYSE ADR: SAP), which we discussed last summer, is the core software that helped Siemens quickly build out MindSphere. SAP is also serving as a key sales partner. At this point, Siemens has lined up more than 100 partners, and GE is catching up quickly. So we're likely looking at the next mega-trend in cloud computing, thanks to the efforts of these firms. How You Can Win Either Way In a case like this, we're looking to profit no matter who wins this cloud-based IoE Battle Royale. And that's why I'm recommending the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (Nasdaq: SKYY). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) is composed of firms, like Microsoft and cloud leader Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), that will directly benefit from this key trend. But it also has players that will profit from the overall growth in cloud-based technology. Take a look: IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) – This firm's artificial intelligence Watson platform was purpose-built to tackle the Big Data analytics challenge posed by the IoE. The key twist is that Watson is built to learn from all that data and generate usable analysis that executives may not even have thought to ask. IBM's 2015 purchase of the Weather Co. demonstrates what we're talking about here. A growing array of global geo-sensors are providing Watson with the raw data to radically improve weather forecasts, a great breakthrough for farmers and consumers alike. SAP – As I said before, HANA is this firm's best shot at IoE leadership. The $21 billion (in sales) database software giant is well-positioned to scale up to even larger data-processing jobs, the kinds we'll see much more of as the IoE makes deeper inroads. SAP is targeting smaller firms, a savvy move. There are now roughly 600,000 online firms operating in the United States, which is a much deeper client pool than the Fortune 1000 that SAP has long focused on. SAP sees the IoE as a Trojan horse into cloud computing. The firm expects to grow its cloud-based subscription services from around 22 billion euros in 2016 to around 27 billion by 2020. VMWare Inc. (NYSE: VMW) – This firm is backing its way into the IoE, building on its massive presence in cloud-based data storage management. And it's using a purpose-built IoE platform called Liota to get there. It's a secure open-source software development kit (SDK) that applies standard software protocols to enable Big Data levels of analytics and security. For example, Liota underpins the growing set of data being generated by the early class of connected cars. Open-source software, like Liota, is one of the best ways to ensure that all connected cars in the future can profit from the growing body of on-the-road data that is generated. Akamai Corp. (Nasdaq: AKAM) – Don't overlook Akamai, which operates a massive global network of data centers. These centers provide direct connections between the servers of today's leading tech and telecom firms, which will enable the seamless hand off of IoE data as this market grows. Akamai's software and servers have already proven their worth against malicious IoE software code aimed to disrupt major networks. Built for the Long Haul As you can see, the cloud and the IoE were meant for each other. One could not be possible without the other, and each will be a prime driver of the other's growth. The First Trust Cloud Computing ETF has already begun to reflect just how exciting and massive this opportunity will be. It's been a strong performer, up 54% since the market bottomed out Feb. 11, 2016. That's 75% better than the S&P 500's performance during that stretch. But don't just focus on recent gains. This will be a great growth play you'll want to own for years to come if you intend to get on the road to wealth – paved by tech. Or if you intend to use tech investments to pay for your children's education… or fund a dream vacation. That's because the IoE and cloud-computing trends are just getting going – and will be vastly larger markets a decade from now. Editor's Note: One of the fastest-growing tech investment segments is… cannabis? Yes, you read that right. A high-tech approach to cultivating this ancient plant – that's already legal to use in more than half of 50 states – is generating a multibillion-dollar investment opportunity for early investors.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.)

Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?).

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post!

Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly.

His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming.

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however.

Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.)

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post.

Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming.

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming.

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.)

Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware. His channel is aptly called “Low Spec Gamer” and with some choice console commands he squeezes the last drops of performance out of DOOM running on a Celeron and Intel HD Graphics: link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:49 Mister eX says: Yeah, I know him! His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:50 Tigris says: Well from a computer game journalist one would expect to have a better laptop though, since playing games is kind of his job. I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop. Also a side note: I had “supporter” written in red on the top oif my screen below the “Howdy Tigris” this kinda seemed like a bug.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job. Love these low-spec articles– I can always read hardware porn on Tom’s or Ars, but this here blurb addressed a topic that’s underserved. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 22:11 haldolium says: Do you use streaming? My laptop had the same issues, clocking down and getting too hot and also way too loud, so I tried streaming instead. With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 19:34 haldolium says: Well I don’t know about others, but for me playing core games isn’t viable most of the time in any train or plane anyways, unless you pay a tremendous amount of money for traveling in a (good) 1st class in which case you might be able to get a proper rig anyways. I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all. Keep it up. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:33 Rack says: I really can’t stand turning settings so low. I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 04:57 Frankie The Patrician[PF] says: The graphics remind me of the Myth RTS series, which is not bad! For 90s, anyway. Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of. Those games had brutally small textures stretched over the map mesh. It’s really noticeable with a modern patched version. Also, high-five for remembering that Myth existed. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 16:45 Enkidum says: I wish someone would remake Myths I and II. The basic gameplay was superb, both in single-player and multiplayer, and I’ve never played anything else with that specific type of pure tactical combat with no resource management at all. And the writing + art assets, both sprites and loading screens, were so much better than… honestly virtually anything I’ve played before or since.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming. (no, there is no chance of hardware damage, just crashes and a slight/minute chance of software corruption or losing unsaved work) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 15:31 poliovaccine says: As someone currently doing most of their gaming on a laptop with almost exactly the same specs as the “clearly underpowered” one in this example, I gotta say, the struggle is real. The big broad bouncer of technological limitation keeps me out of the current gen of games – if it werent for titles like Tyranny and Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor I wouldnt be playing anything newer than 2014..! Gee you guys, The Witcher 2 was pretty interesting, wonder what they’ll cook up next..? Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:18 Kaeoschassis says: On an ancient, physically broken laptop bearing a particularly terrible intel graphics setup (which has all sorts of fun quirks, for example, glitching out like crazy anytime anything tries to do v-synch ever), and yeah, I know the feeling. There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

April 30, 2017 April 30, 2017 Some members of Gambia’s intelligence community are increasingly concern about the mediocre approach taken by the Barrow administration to politicize intelligence collection, and gathering for national security purposes, the Freedom Newspaper can reveal. The appointment of Assistant Superintendent of police (ASP) Muhammed Kanteh, a Nephew of Foreign Minister Ousainou Darboe, to head the State House Intelligence Division, has been faulted in some quarters within the intelligence community. Mr. Kanteh, used to work at the police License Office, and has no intelligence background, sources said. Mr. Barrow is now occupying the former office of Gambia’s co president General Saul Badjie at the State House. He has some “Intel agents” working under him. Mr. Kinteh, has been referred to as one of the most powerful security officials in the Gambia today—given his family relationship with opposition leader and Foreign Minister Ousainou Darboe. “These people are playing with the lives of Gambians. How can they entrust the State House Intel gathering and national security to an intelligence novice in the person of ASP Kanteh. Kanteh used to work at the police Licensing office. He has no intelligence training or background. He has been offered the job because he is Ousainou Darboe’s  Nephew.  This is absurd to say the least. This administration is politicizing intelligence,” said our source. Mr. Kanteh is said to be a gentleman of the highest order, but source intimated that he should have been assigned somewhere outside intelligence collection and processing. Mr. Kanteh is a lawyer by profession.  “Kanteh should have turned down the job offer. This is not his domain of expertise. There are more competent people, who can man that job. What the Barrow government is doing in essence is to compromise their own safety and that of Gambians. Kanteh is not intelligence material. He is clueless when it comes to intelligence. Appointments are not given based on merit in Barrow’s government. You have Turo Jawaneh, there commanding the State Guards. He is aging. Turo is a virtual spent force.  He has outlived his productivity as an officer,” said another security source. It has come to our attention that the likes of Commissioner Abdoulie Sanyang, are worshipping ASP Kanteh, so that Barrow can consider him for the position Inspector General of police. “Abdoulie Sanyang is working very hard to undermine IGP Sonko. Do not be surprised if you hear that he has been appointed IGP. He is always on the phone with Kanteh. IGP Sonko himself is aware of the situation. He is just waiting for his marching orders. The very day Sanyang was reinstated, he started feeling the evil machinations staged to have him replaced by his sworn enemy in the person of Abdoulie Sanyang,” our source said. ASP Kanteh could not be reached for comment.

Noctua confirms LGA 2066 will host Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X by Zak Killian  10:09 AM on April 27, 2017 We've heard rumors from pretty reliable sources, but Noctua just gave us our first official confirmation that Intel's next high-end desktop platform will use the LGA 2066 socket. In a press release about heatsink support for the new socket, Noctua says that most of its current coolers support "the new LGA 2066 socket of Intel's 'Basin Falls' X299 platform for Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs out of the box," and that it will provide updated mounting hardware for older heatsinks at no additional charge. This isn't exactly a surprise to anyone who's been keeping an eye out for rumors, but it's nice to have an official source. It's also great to see Noctua keeping up its strong post-sale support. Noctua even says the heatsink mounting mechanism on LGA 2066 is "identical" to that of LGA 2011. Going by that statement, even other companies' LGA 2011-compatible heatsinks are likely to fit LGA 2066, and the socket dimensions are likely very similar, too. If you need updated mounting hardware, just contact Noctua with your proof of purchase. Tags: Cooling Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

You can see that the uptick is pretty large considering the slowly dwindling numbers from 2006, where AMD didn't really have anything worthwhile for consumers to buy in the CPU business.   Everything changed with Ryzen, and while a 2% increase isn't much - the new Ryzen 7 processors sold like hotcakes - selling out as soon as they hit. Keep in mind that AMD was also bottlenecked by AM4 motherboard availability, but we should begin to see all of this disappear as the weeks and months fly past - so the Q2 2017 numbers for AMD should be even more interesting.

The San Jose, California-based company has posted results that topped estimates every quarter since completing the $15.8 billion purchase of the memory chipmaker last May and its stock has jumped 31 percent this year. Contrast that with the single-day 17 percent drop in shares of rival Seagate Technology Inc. after it reporting earnings that still mostly depend on older, less desirable spinning magnetic-disk-based hard drives. The company reported a 65 percent increase in sales in the first quarter on surging demand for flash memory, a more modern type of storage technology for phones and computers that came with the SanDisk deal. But the SanDisk business has a joint venture with Toshiba’s chip division, which is for sale as the company seeks to cover losses from its failed attempt to expand into the nuclear power industry. Western Digital has held discussions with Innovation Network Corp. of Japan and Development Bank of Japan Inc. about options for a bid. It’s pursuing exclusive talks with Toshiba and has argued that a sale to a third party is in breach of their joint-venture agreement — a claim that his Japanese partners refute. The company’s legal rights and the Japanese government’s desire to stop control of the crucial technology passing to another country will help achieve a positive result for his company, said Mark Long, Western Digital’s chief financial officer. The enemy of a good conclusion to the sale process is time. “A lot of this, in the initial phases, is going to be overshadowed by the desperation of Toshiba to deal with their crisis as it has grown from a problem to an all-consuming disaster,” Long said. “We are deeply troubled by the tension between the depth of Toshiba’s desperation and their willingness to do things that we didn’t think they would do in other situations.” Flash memory is enjoying a bumper year. Intel Corp., which disappointed investors with its data center unit’s performance, hit record total sales levels helped by a 55 percent surge in revenue at its flash memory business. Micron Technology Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. have all reported strong demand for the chips that are replacing magnetic disks. Toshiba’s unit has garnered a lot of interest, with bids as high as $28 billion reportedly from Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Western Digital’s position is that “each of the rumored bidders is problematic,” said Long. The company has talked to all of the prospective buyers to look for a solution. And in some cases they’ve reached out first themselves. Consider the following: Hon Hai’s reported bid for the division values it about the same as the market capitalization of rivals Micron and SK Hynix. Yet those companies have more than twice the memory-chip revenue of the Toshiba unit. “This is a head scratcher,” said Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Mizuho Securities. “We think at two times sales it’s worth about $14 billion.” Sales at Micron and SK Hynix are projected to surge more than 50 percent this year as demand for the mobile-device storage chips continues to expand and chipmakers stay disciplined in their additions of new supply. That doesn’t change the volatile nature of the business, where producers have frequently caused supply gluts and crashed pricing. SK Hynix — also a bidder for Toshiba — and Micron have each reported two annual losses since 2010. “I wouldn’t say we’re at the peak but the supply-demand trends can’t get much better than they are,” said Tristan Gerra, an analyst at Robert W. Baird. The timing is “good for Toshiba because we think they can sell at close to the peak. There’s a lot of interest in the technology, particularly in China.” The challenge for anyone scooping up Toshiba’s chip business is making enough money to pay the high purchase price while finding enough funds to upgrade plants that cost billions of dollars to equip. Western Digital now faces the uncertainty of who might take Toshiba’s majority stake in their joint venture, whether they’ll continue to invest at the required levels, and even if the new owner will compete against it. Buying Toshiba’s unit at the prices being proposed would put a heavy burden on Western Digital’s finances. The company said last week it had cash and cash equivalents of $5.8 billion and “liquidity available” totaling $6.8 billion. “It’s really complicated,” said Weston Twigg, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. “There was always a risk. When you buy half a venture, you don’t know how reliable the other side of the venture is. We just found out that Toshiba wasn’t reliable.” Photos Click to enlarge Keywords Toshiba Corp., earnings, SanDisk, Western Digital Corp.

Its creator, John McAfee, has now announced that the 'John McAfee Privacy Phone' - which has been claimed to be world's most hack-proof phone - will be coming out later this year from his MGT security firm. If you are wondering how the 'John McAfee Privacy Phone' will provide you additional security over general smartphones, it will feature hardware switches at the back that will allow users to disconnect the battery, the antennas for Wi-Fi, the camera, Bluetooth and geolocation, and even the microphone, John McAfee told Newsweek. The security features will come with their worth as the smartphone will be made available with a hefty price tag of $1,100 (roughly Rs. 70,700). It will run a version of Android. On its announcement blog post earlier this year, MGT said, "The base phone will be procured as an OEM model using the Android operating system, and then modified using the skills of MGT's cybersecurity team." "It also will not allow the phone to connect to a Stingray or any other IMSI catcher device. In addition, it contains a Web search anonymiser," John McAfee was quoted as saying in the Newsweek report. Notably, McAfee did clarify that even though it will be most hack-proof phone in the world, it will still not be completely hack-proof. "It is Version 1... It is not hack proof but it does give the user enormous power over his or her privacy and it is light years ahead of the BlackPhone or any other phone claiming to be secure. "Version 2 will be available in the summer of 2018. It will be as hack proof as humanly possible," McAfee was reported as saying. While the specifications for the smartphone will be released just a week ahead of its official launch, the device has already drawn criticism. While hardware switches can bring convenience in isolating the device from networks, anybody with physical access to the product will be able to get access to this functionality, as pointed out in a report by The Verge. John McAfee has not detailed the software aspects of the security provided with the phone and how it plans to protect it against the Stingray spying tool. We will have to see if the phone will be able to deliver its security promises and as it is enterprise-focussed device, it might be a risky proposition if it does not turn out to be as secure as claimed by John McAfee.

On a non-GAAP(1) basis, operating loss was $6 million, net loss was $38 million, and loss per share was $0.04.   GAAP Financial Results       Q1-17   Q4-16   Q1-16 Revenue   $984M   $1.11B   $832M Operating loss   $(29)M   $(3)M   $(68)M Net loss   $(73)M   $(51)M   $(109)M Loss per share   $(0.08)   $(0.06)   $(0.14)     Non-GAAP Financial Results(1)       Q1-17   Q4-16   Q1-16 Revenue   $984M   $1.11B   $832M Operating income (loss)   $(6)M   $26M   $(55)M Net loss   $(38)M   $(8)M   $(96)M Loss per share   $(0.04)   $(0.01)   $(0.12)               „We achieved 18 percent year-over-year revenue growth driven by strong demand for our high performance Ryzen CPUs as well as graphics processors,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. „We are positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities across the business in the year ahead as we bring innovation, performance, and choice to an expanding set of markets.” Q1 2017 Results Revenue of $984 million was up 18 percent year-over-year, driven by higher revenue in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business segments. Revenue was down 11 percent sequentially, due primarily to seasonality in both segments. However, Computing and Graphics segment revenue decline was better than seasonal due to the initial sales from high performance Ryzen™ desktop processors. On a GAAP basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially due to a higher percentage of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment, as well as a richer product mix within that segment. Operating loss of $29 million compared to operating losses of $68 million a year ago and $3 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $73 million compared to net losses of $109 million a year ago and $51 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.08 compared to a loss per share of $0.14 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.06 in the prior quarter. On a non-GAAP(1) basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially. Operating loss of $6 million compared to an operating loss of $55 million a year ago and operating income of $26 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $38 million compared to net losses of $96 million a year ago and $8 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.04 compared to a loss per share of $0.12 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.01 in the prior quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $943 million at the end of the quarter, down $321 million from the end of the prior quarter primarily due to the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments, and increased inventory. Quarterly Financial Segment Summary Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $593 million, up 29 percent year-over-year and down 1 percent sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher desktop and graphics processor sales. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mobile and graphics processor sales largely offset by initial revenue from high performance Ryzen desktop processors. Operating loss was $15 million, compared to operating losses of $70 million in Q1 2016 and $21 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue. The sequential improvement was driven primarily by lower operating expenses. Client average selling price (ASP) increased year-over-year and sequentially driven by desktop processor ASP. GPU ASP increased year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to higher desktop GPU ASP. Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $391 million, up 5 percent year-over-year driven primarily by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Sequentially, revenue decreased 23 percent primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $9 million, compared to an operating income of $16 million in Q1 2016 and an operating income of $47 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher server related R&D investments, partially offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain. The sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. All Other operating loss was $23 million compared with operating losses of $14 million in Q1 2016 and $29 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year and sequential differences in operating loss were related to stock-based compensation charges.

Cautionary Statement This document contains forward-looking statements concerning Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) including AMD’s ability to achieve future revenue growth and margin expansion; its ability to bring innovation, performance and choice to an expanding set of markets; the features, functionality, timing, availability and expected benefits of AMD’s new products and technologies; and AMD’s expected second quarter 2017 revenue, which are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by words such as „would,” „may,” „expects,” „believes,” „plans,” „intends,” „projects” and other terms with similar meaning. Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this document are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this document and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Such statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond AMD’s control, that could cause actual results and other future events to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD’s ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, from GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMD’s manufacturing requirements, its business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD’s business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD’s products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMD’s business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; AMD’s receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMD’s business and operating results; the markets in which AMD’s products are sold are highly competitive; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD’s notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect its ability to operate its business; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD’s products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD’s products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for AMD’s products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMD’s ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporation’s support for its products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on AMD’s products, its ability to sell its products could be materially adversely affected; AMD’s reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects it to certain risks; AMD’s inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder its business; AMD’s issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of its existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 may dilute the ownership interest of its existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; in the event of a change of control, AMD may not be able to repurchase its outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and its Secured Revolving Line of Credit, which would result in a default under the indentures and its Secured Revolving Line of Credit; the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect its business in the future; acquisitions, divestitures and/or joint ventures could disrupt its business, harm its financial condition and operating results or dilute, or adversely affect the price of, its common stock; AMD’s business is dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt its business, processes and internal controls; data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise AMD’s intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to its business and reputation; AMD’s operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns; if essential equipment, materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture its products, AMD could be materially adversely affected; if AMD’s products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, it could be materially adversely affected; costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on AMD; if AMD fails to maintain the efficiency of its supply chain as it responds to changes in customer demand for its products, its business could be materially adversely affected; AMD outsources to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of its product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services; the completion and impact of the 2015 Restructuring Plan, its transformation initiatives and any future restructuring actions could adversely affect AMD; AMD may incur future impairments of goodwill; AMD’s stock price is subject to volatility; AMD’s worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for AMD’s products; unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect AMD; AMD’s inability to effectively control the sales of its products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on it; if AMD cannot adequately protect its technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, it may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses; AMD is a party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause it to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit it from selling its products; AMD’s business is subject to potential tax liabilities; and AMD is subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities. Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in AMD’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to AMD’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

These non-GAAP financial measures reflect certain adjustments as presented in the tables in this earnings press release. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP free cash flow as supplemental measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting operating income (loss) for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and restructuring and other special charges, net. The Company calculates and communicates Adjusted EBITDA because the Company’s management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of operating income (loss) or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows.     ** The Company also presents non-GAAP free cash flow as a supplemental measure of its performance. Non-GAAP free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates non-GAAP free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because the Company’s management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of non-GAAP free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view non-GAAP free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

You thought wrong. The PGA Tour will offer live virtual-reality coverage of the 17th holes during all four rounds of The Players May 11-14. The live VR can be viewed on Samsung Gear VR headsets through the PGA Tour VR Live app on the Oculus store. Those headsets, typically sold at retail for less than $100, pair with Samsung phones to create the VR experience. Fans who don’t have the headset can use Twitter or Periscope to access the 360-degree video on their smartphones. The coverage will be available during the tournament at @PGATOUR. Three VR cameras will be placed on the 17th hole – one on the tee, another on the walkway from the tee box to the green and a third camera mounted on the water next to the island green. The Tour is using Intel True VR technology to produce the coverage. “The PGA Tour has experimented with virtual-reality content for nearly two years,” said Rick Anderson, the Tour’s chief media officer. “We tested Intel’s True VR technology on a live basis at the Genesis Open in February, and were very pleased with the quality. We decided that executing a live VR experience on one of the most dramatic holes in golf was something that our fans would love, and the fact that we are partnering with Twitter to deliver 360 video will offer tremendous scale.” According to the Tour, The Players will mark the first time that Twitter has distributed live 360 video during a major sports event. Twitter has been streaming PGA Tour Live’s early-round coverage this season. The Tour reported that the Twitter distribution averaged almost a half million unique viewers each day, and that more than 70 percent are under 35 years old.

If you don't, Netflix will load up to 1080p and that's it.     But, things are changing - slowly, and in not such a good way with NVIDIA preparing Netflix 4K support in the near future. In order for the Netflix 4K content support, you'll need:   NVIDIA Driver version exclusively provided via Microsoft Windows Insider Program (currently 381.74). NVIDIA Pascal based GPU, GeForce GTX 1050 or greater with minimum 3GB memory HDCP 2.2 capable monitor(s). Please see the additional section below if you are using multiple monitors and/or multiple GPUs. Microsoft Edge browser or Netflix app from the Windows Store 25Mbps (or faster) internet connection.   NVIDIA seems to be providing very access to Netflix 4K content, as there are some large caveats right now: you need a GTX 10 series card with over 3GB of RAM, and now you can use the Netflix app from the Windows Store (instead of requiring Edge only), and you won't be able to use SLI at all.   It's not just SLI users that get the elbow, but multi-monitor users on a single GPU or multi-GPU system where the GPUs will need to not be linked together (SLI), for 4K content to flow. Secondly, all of the active monitors need to be HDCP 2.2 compliant, and if they're not (or even one of them isn't) then the Netflix quality will be locked to 1080p.   This shift is showing NVIDIA is committed to 4K content, and has officially shown AMD up with their new Radeon RX 500 series which can't run Netflix content in 4K... for now. Let's hope Vega gets some built-in Netflix 4K love. NEWS SOURCES:Vrzone.com Recommended for You AMD: Vega GPU is 'on track to launch in Q2' AMD launches dual-GPU Radeon Pro Duo with 32GB of...

Rather than relying on the licensed spectrum purchased for today’s LTE service, MulteFire operates entirely in the unlicensed 5 gigahertz band. And to set it up, users would simply need to install MulteFire access points, similar to Wi-Fi access points, at any facility served by optical fiber or wireless backhaul. Once installed, MulteFire would provide greater capacity, range, and coverage than Wi-Fi, because it’s based on advanced LTE standards. But by operating in unlicensed spectrum, MulteFire could conserve resources for companies struggling to meet customers’ data demands. Depending on how MulteFire is used, it could let cellular companies offload traffic to unlicensed spectrum, or allow factory owners to set up private MulteFire networks to serve equipment, robots, and Internet-0f-Things devices. The technology is being developed by the MulteFire Alliance founded by Nokia, Qualcomm, Ericsson, and Intel. Marcus Weldon, president of Nokia Bell Labs and chief technology officer of Nokia, laid out his vision for MulteFire during a meeting at Nokia Bell Labs in New Jersey last week. As Weldon sees it, managers of industrial facilities will be the primary customers for MulteFire and will want to use it to connect millions of devices for oil and gas drilling, power transmission, and manufacturing. “No consumers are saying, ‘Damnit, give me MulteFire!’” he says. “Or at least, I haven’t found one yet. But some industries are.” Already, carriers can combine unlicensed spectrum with their own licensed spectrum to create larger bandwidths for users. Advanced LTE technology known as LAA (Licensed Assisted Access) allows carriers to do this for the downlink (transmissions from base stations to devices), and the more recent eLAA (Enhanced Licensed Assisted Access) allows them to also do it for the uplink (transmissions from devices to base stations). A third technology, called Multi-Path Transmission Control Protocol, is similar to both LAA and eLAA in that it also combines licensed and unlicensed spectrum to deliver higher data rates on cell networks. But all of these modes still rely on licensed spectrum as the “anchor” to which carriers then add capacity from unlicensed spectrum. In effect, MulteFire extends these advanced LTE capabilities to operate independently in unlicensed spectrum. In fact, the first MulteFire specification, released earlier this year, builds directly on 3GPP Releases 13 and 14, which describe LAA and eLAA.   With MulteFire, a device could operate at 5 GHz without anchoring to any licensed spectrum, thereby freeing up licensed resources for other mobile customers. The technology dodges other Wi-Fi users (who may also broadcast at 5 GHz) by employing the same “listen-before-talk” protocol used in Wi-Fi today. To set up MulteFire at a facility, the owner would simply install MulteFire access points, similar to Wi-Fi access points, around the premises. Just like for Wi-Fi, these access points would require some type of backhaul—either fiber or millimeter wave fixed wireless. On the network side, carriers could choose to set up their own MulteFire access points at specific loations (just as they operate their own base station equipment today) or agree to share many access points installed by an independent third party (this model has become an increasingly popular way to deploy expensive infrastructure). If MulteFire catches on, cellular carriers could automaticaly offload consumers to it once they are within range an access point, just as carriers offload traffic today to Wi-Fi. That’s certainly a compelling pitch to carriers struggling to meet customer’s data demands on their LTE networks. But Weldon and others ultimately believe the technology’s higher purpose will be for industrial uses. They think managers at facilities and companies will want to set up their own MulteFire networks (similar to Wi-Fi networks) to connect robots and Internet-of-Things devices. Nanda Menon of Athonet, in Bolzano-Vicentino, Italy, said his company hears many requests from enterprise clients who want a private LTE networks to serve the increasing numbers of devices they’re bringing online worldwide. But creating such a network requires the clients to negotiate contracts for licensed spectrum at many different frequencies with carriers around the world. Deploying these private networks on a common 5 GHz band, which remains unlicensed everywhere in the world, would be much easier. Last year, Qualcomm demonstrated the first MulteFire transmission, and showed that the technology could peacefully co-exist with Wi-Fi on the same band, while increasing network throughput beyond what Wi-Fi alone could deliver. Another test by Nokia and the Saudi Telecom Company showed that MulteFire delivered 50 percent better range and up to two times better coverage than Wi-Fi. Next, the MulteFire Alliance plans to develop a certification program that will eventually indicate which devices incorporate MulteFire. First, though, the group will have to persuade smartphone makers and other device manufacturers to add support for MulteFire into the chipsets of their products.  Learn More LTE Internet of Things smartphones MulteFire 5 GHz wireless Wi-Fi IoT unlicensed spectrum cellular telecommunications Internet Comments Comment Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> Comments powered by Disqus Advertisement Tech Talk IEEE Spectrum’s general technology blog, featuring news, analysis, and opinions about engineering, consumer electronics, and technology and society, from the editorial staff and freelance contributors.

Netflix and Nvidia team up for 4K streaming by Wayne Manion  10:00 AM on May 1, 2017 Devices as inexpensive as a $70 Xiaomi's Mi Box can stream 4K video from Netflix when connected to a compatible TV. To date, the only way to replicate such a feat with a PC was to use the integrated graphics on an Intel seventh-generation Core processor. That meant that HTPC users with Kaby Lake CPUs that wanted a bit of gaming performance were left choosing between 4K streaming, the ability to play games, or fiddling with cables. Thankfully, an upcoming Nvidia driver will allow for Netflix 4K streaming on Pascal graphics cards with at least 3 GB of RAM. Driver version 381.74 will be initially distributed only to Windows Insider Program users through Windows Update. No other GeForce drivers will allow for Netflix 4K streaming. The feature will only work in conjunction with HDCP 2.2-compatible monitors, too. Multi-monitor systems are supported, though all attached displays must support HDCP 2.2. Also, Netflix 4K streaming so far only works in Microsoft's Edge browser and the Netflix app distributed through the Windows Store. Configurations with multiple graphics cards are also supported, but only when SLI is disabled. The half-dozen users with SLI'd Pascal cards in an HTPC setup will surely be bummed out. The VRAM requirement means that the desktop GeForce GTX 1050 and the rumored GT 1030 will be left out of the party, as will cards based on Nvidia's older Maxwell and Kepler architectures. For anyone keeping track, in practice, that means that only users with GeForce GTX 1050 Ti cards or above need to apply. Personally, I am crossing my fingers that AMD will counter this move with updated Radeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition drivers that offer the same feature. The combination of 4K streaming from the most popular paid video streaming service and AMD's power-saving framerate limiter would truly allow systems to "Netflix and Chill."

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 2 May 2017 | MYT 9:55 AM What to expect from Microsoft's May 2 event Microsoft could present a Surface 4, a low-cost device that could also be the first device to run Windows 10 Cloud OS. — AFP Relaxnews Microsoft is holding an education-focused conference in the US city of New York (#MicrosoftEDU) on 9.30am Eastern Time (9.30pm Malaysian time) May 2. The event could see the firm reveal new hardware and software solutions aimed specifically at students.  In terms of hardware, the tech world is still waiting for Microsoft to present its new generation tablet, the Surface Pro 5. The Redmond-based firm could use its education-themed event to do that – so long as the device has something specific to offer students. In any case, rumours are heating up on specialist websites, suggesting that the tablet could feature the latest-generation Intel processors (Kaby Lake), boosting performance and battery life. However, Microsoft is unlikely to unveil the eagerly awaited new range of Surface Phone smartphones or a Surface Book 2 PC at the May 2 event. Above all, Microsoft could present a Surface 4 – a low-cost device tailored to users on tight budgets. This new tablet could also be the first device to run Windows 10 Cloud, a pared-down and partially cloud-based version of Microsoft's famous operating system. The concept is similar to Chrome OS, used in Google's low-cost Chromebook PCs popular with students. The Cloud OS aims to provide a lightweight operating system for the least powerful computers on the market. As the name suggests, the system is focused on cloud computing, which is useful for PCs that don't have much storage space. Users can, for example, use Microsoft programs already available in the cloud, such as MS Office, rather than installing them directly on their computer. Microsoft has more than the May 2 event in store this spring, as the Microsoft Build developers' conference opens a few days later, running May 10 to 12 in Seattle.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 1, 2017 4:16 PM PT Credit: AMD More like this AMD's Ryzen launches March 2, outperforming Intel's Core i7 at a fraction of... AMD teases Ryzen 5, Zen 2 plans as it begins shipping its first Ryzen 7 chips AMD confirms its Ryzen CPU will launch in early March, followed by the Vega GPU Video Windows Defender: What changes in Windows 10 Creators Update AMD’s Ryzen chips are off to a strong start in desktops, and more chips are coming in the second half of this year. New chips for desktops, called Ryzen 3, will come in the earlier part of the second half, while Ryzen mobile chips—code-named Raven Ridge—will come out around the end-of-year holiday season. AMD CEO Lisa Su shared the release schedule during a first-quarter earnings call on Monday. She also said top PC makers will launch desktops with the already shipping Ryzen 5 and 7 chips later this quarter. The Ryzen 3 is expected to be for low-end desktops, while the Ryzen 5 and 7 chips are faster. Late last week, Acer announced its Aspire GX desktop with Ryzen chip options. In the coming months, AMD will also launch Vega GPUs for the gaming, professional workstation and data center markets. Some Vega GPUs will launch this quarter. Vega GPUs will be priced higher than Polaris, the existing GPU architecture, because of advanced technologies, Su said. The Vega GPUs will have a new memory subsystem, a faster computing engine and a “new geometry pipeline to dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency for the next generation of GPU workloads,” Su said. The Ryzen launch dominated much of the earnings call. Ryzen was AMD’s first big new chip design in more than a decade, and it opened to good reviews. After a string of failed chips, a strong Ryzen launch was critical for AMD. Ryzen chips first shipped in March, and the demand from home PC builders was strong. There was a temporary slowdown as motherboard shipments were constrained, but the supply went back to normal after a few weeks. Large PC makers will announce Ryzen-based desktops this quarter. AMD’s goal with Ryzen is to get Intel fans to switch. It’s not clear that it’s succeeded yet, but competition may soon drive down Intel’s prices. Intel last week said it is expecting a slight decline in its chip prices, which analysts attributed partly to Ryzen. AMD also hopes its users of its own chips, like the A-series, FX and Athlon, move up to the more expensive (and profitable) Ryzen. That transition could last well into next year, Su said. But AMD won’t get rid of its legacy chips. Chips like Athlon and FX are still popular in some countries, so The move to newer architectures in some countries will be slower, Su said. Ryzen chips are competing with Intel’s 7th Generation Core processors, code-named Kaby Lake, and later will go up against the 8th Generation Core processors, due later this year. On a GAAP basis, AMD reported first-quarter revenue of $984 million, up from $832 million in the same quarter last year. Quarterly net loss was $73 million, compared with a net loss of $109 million a year earlier.  To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

[Courtesy GRC] Cooling, Featured How Practical is Dunking Servers in Mineral Oil Exactly? by Scott Fulton III  on May 1, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet We’ve covered oil immersion cooling technology from Green Revolution Cooling (GRC) here on Data Center Knowledge since the turn of the decade.  It’s an astonishingly simple concept that somehow still leaves one reaching for a towel:  If you submerge your heat-producing racks in a substance that absorbs heat twelve hundred times better than air, then circulate that substance with a radically ordinary pump, you prolong the active life of your servers while protecting them from damage and erosion. Still. . . e-e-ew.  Mineral oil? “For safety, we keep paper towels nearby to wipe up any drips,” explained Alex McManis, an applications engineer with GRC, in an e-mail exchange with us.  “There are various products commonly used in industrial environments to place on the floor for absorbing oil and preventing slipping.” Neither Grease Nor Lightning All these years later, it’s still the kind of novel proposition you’d expect would generate plenty of anchor-banter at the tail end of local TV newscasts:  You take a 42U server rack, with the servers attached, you tip it sideways, and you submerge it in what cannot avoid looking like a convenience store ice cream freezer.  (The green LEDs and the GRC logo help, but only somewhat.)  In that containment unit, the racks are completely submerged in a non-flammable, dielectric mineral oil bath that GRC calls ElectroSafe. There, the oil absorbs the heat from the fully operative servers, and pumps it out through a completely passive dry cooling tower.  Because the oil does not need to be cooled down as much as air to be effective, it can be warmer than the ambient air temperature (GRC suggests as high as 100° F / 38° C) and still fulfill its main task of absorbing heat. Still, states GRC’s McManis, there’s no measurable degradation in the oil’s heat absorption capacity over time. “The oil operates far below a temperature where degradation happens like in an engine,” he told us.  “We’ve tested the oil yearly and see zero changes; as far as we can tell, it lasts forever.  Forever is a long time, so we say a lifetime of 15 years.  The oil is continuously filtered, so the racks can be placed in rooms without air filtration, such as warehouses.” The oil has the added benefit, McManis stated, of serving as a rust and corrosion preventative.  According to him, Intel detected no degradation to the working ability of components that it tested. In a mid-April company blog post, Barcelona-based Port d’Informació Cientifica (PIC) claimed that over the last 18-month period since its installation the GRC system was able to reduce its total requirements by 50 percent.  PIC is the infrastructure provider for many of Europe’s scientific services, including Switzerland’s CERN, which operates the Large Hadron Collider.  PIC went on to report no failures in the cooling or server systems, and exclaimed all this was achieved without any use of water whatsoever. As part of regular annual maintenance, McManis stated, PIC’s filters had to be replaced once, in a process that takes only a few minutes. Water, Water Nowhere Not all GRC installations are waterless; in cases where the system is installed in existing data centers, the company clearly states, it can use pre-existing water-based heat exchangers.  But recently, that’s changed. “Our containerized data centers have evolved via co-designing with the U.S. Air Force,” wrote McManis.  “Besides testing component by component for reliability, we’ve switched to a water-free design using dry coolers.  There’s no intermediate water loop, so part count is reduced and water treatment is no longer needed.  The pumps and heat exchangers are underneath the walkway, freeing up space for more racks and electrical equipment, such as a flywheel.” The elimination of water as a factor in data center equipment cooling may not be as obvious a breakthrough for a CIO or for DevOps personnel as for, say, a licensed HVAC technician.  Last July, we reported on a Berkeley National Lab study revealing that, while the generation of 1 kilowatt-hour of energy requires 7.6 liters of water on average, the average US data center consumes 1.8 liters of water in the cooling process for every 7.6 liters consumed.  That means a data center uses one-quarter as much water again to cool down from the use of any given unit of electrical power, as it did to generate that power in the first place. A recent Schneider Electric white paper [PDF] demonstrated why the drive to increase server density is so critically important.  The amount of cubic feet per minute required to keep a system cool for every kilowatt consumed (CFM/kW) is reduced steadily as server density increases — to the extent that it may cost half as much to cool an ordinary 6 kW rack as it does a 3 kW rack. The question of managing airflow and water consumption has become so critical that Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been experimenting with how it can optimize the distribution of software workloads among its servers.  A 2012 HP Labs project, in conjunction with Cal Tech, showed how climate data and capacity planning forecasts, along with cooling coefficients derived from their chilled water systems, integrated with their servers’ workload management software, could measurably reduce power consumption and the costs associated with it. The HPE/Cal Tech team portrayed the goal of their research as seeking a “practical” approach, taking care to put the word in quotation marks.  One goal, the team wrote, is “to provide an integrated workload management system for data centers that takes advantage of the efficiency gains possible by shifting demand in a way that exploits time variations in electricity price, the availability of renewable energy, and the efficiency of cooling.”  Practicality, as this team perceives it, means accepting the existing boundaries, inarguable limitations, and everyday facts of data center architecture, and working within those boundaries. Among these inviolable facts of everyday life in the everyday data center is airflow. Typically, the refrigeration of air depends upon the refrigeration of water.  The GRC system literally flushes air out of the equation entirely.  In so doing, it can eliminate water as a factor in managing airflow, since there’s no airflow to be managed.  In the GRC company blog post, a representative of PIC’s IT team said it’s running its oil-submerged servers at nearly 50 kW per rack, without incident. That’s an astonishing figure. Usually, according to Schneider’s report, “As densities per rack increase from 15 kW and beyond, there are design complexities injected into the data center project that often outweigh the potential savings.”  The GRC system may not be a design complexity, though it certainly turns the whole design question on its side.  However, PIC is claiming the savings are measurable and worthwhile. The Slickest Solution Out There We wondered whether GRC can leverage the oil’s acute heat absorption capability as an indicator of relative server stress. “We have enough sensors to measure the heat load going into the racks,” McManis responded.  “Current meters on the [power distribution units] are going to be more precise, but the heat capacity calculation is sufficient to check efficiency of pumps and heat exchangers.  We calculate if they are maintaining their rated capacity without requiring a 100 percent capacity test.  For example, we can remotely see percent efficiency loss of a heat exchanger to monitor scaling from less than perfect water treatment.  Without this monitoring, an inefficiency might not be found until the system couldn’t perform as requested.” From a cost standpoint, the sacrifices a data center operator makes in practicality when implementing an oil immersion system such as GRC’s may seem within the margin of tolerability.  Our videos of GRC CarnoJet from 2013 made it look like system operators could get away with wearing tight gloves, perhaps hairnets, and keeping those paper towel rolls handy. Let’s face it:  It can’t be easy to get a grip on an oily server.  Since those videos were produced, McManis told us, there have indeed been refinements to this process. “The easiest way to remove a server is using an overhead lift with a specially made lifting hook that attaches to the server ears,” he wrote.  “The server is then laid down on service rails which drain the server back into the tank while it’s being serviced.  The server can be dripping while parts are being replaced.” Over the past few years, he said, GRC has made “ergonomic improvements, such as lowering the racks, auto-draining service platforms, and using an integrated overhead hoist for lifting the servers.” When parts are being replaced and sent back to their manufacturers, is there a way to ship them out without the recipients ending up with saggy boxes?  “Drip dry is clean enough for RMA,” McManis responded.  “An aerosolized electronics cleaner is the fastest for small items.  Using an electronics cleaning solution in an ultrasonic cleaner will restore to clean as new.” It may not be the most aesthetically pleasing solution to the data center cooling problem ever devised.  But GRC’s oil immersion method is far from the most nose-wrinkling system put forth to the public: in 2011, an HP Sustainable Data Center engineer suggested data centers be built next to dairy farms, where 10,000 or more cows each could produce what’s called biogas. So GRC can happily declare, “We’re not biogas.”  Yet with electricity costs worldwide continuing to rise and the scarcity of water becoming a reality for everyone, we may soon be in the position where we replace our water consumption models with projections for rolls of paper towels.

Previous Article Uptime: Cloud Gives Many Enterprise Data Centers New Lease on Life Next Article How Do You Define Cloud Computing? (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images) Internet of Things, Networking, Storage The Great Data Center Headache – the Internet of Things by Drew Robb  on May 1, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet If data center managers thought virtualization and cloud computing were challenging in terms of big shifts in architecture, they better get ready for the next big thing. The Internet of Things is likely to give you far more headaches in terms of volume of data to store, devices to connect with and systems to integrate. Long-term data center managers have certainly borne witness to immense change in recent decades. From mainframes to minicomputers and client/server, then virtualization and cloud computing. The pattern seems to be as follows: at first, their entire mode of operation is challenged and altered. After a few hectic years, life calms down, only for yet another wave of innovation to sweep the world of the data center off its axis. And, here we go again with the Internet of Things (IoT). The general idea is that sensors and microchips are placed anywhere and is subjected to advanced analytics to give business a competitive edge, and provide the data center with greater capabilities in terms of infrastructure management and security. “The Internet of Things means everything will have an IP address,” said Jim Davis, former executive vice president and chief marketing officer at analytics provider SAS, now with Informatica. According to Vin Sharma, director of machine learning solutions in the Data Center group at Intel, the future could well include more distributed data centers, perhaps a network made up of huge centralized hubs as well as much smaller, more localized data centers, or even a completely different infrastructure model. More than likely, some data centers will fade from memory as their value proposition is eroded by cloud-based operations. Others will have to transform themselves in order to survive. IoT Implications While the interest and buzz around IoT has grown steadily in recent years, the promise continues to move closer to reality. According to  International Data Corp (IDC), a transformation is underway that will see the worldwide market for IoT solutions grow to $7.1 trillion in 2020. The best way to comprehend IoT is to look at it in the context of PCs, servers and phones the data center currently has to manage. IDC numbers showed that just 1.5 billion smartphones, tablets, desktops and laptops were sold in 2013 that could connect people to the internet. That figure is expected to reach an alarming 32 billion by 2020. The vast majority of these devices operate without human interaction. In a data center, for example, we see that the many high-end servers and storage devices automatically gather sensor data and report it to the manufacturer. The manufacturer can then, for example, remotely adjust the settings for better performance or send a technician out to replace a failing component before it crashes. General Electric (GE) is very much on the forefront of the IoT race. Its product portfolio encompasses a vast number of items of industrial and consumer devices that will form the backbone of the Internet of things. But the company understands that it can’t preach the benefits without itself becoming an example of its virtues. As a result, Rachel Trombetta, software director at GE Digital, expects many data center functions to disappear into the cloud. But she acknowledged that some of its manufacturing activities would have to remain out of the cloud and continue to be run from more traditional data centers. “The case for public clouds is not yet compelling enough for us to get rid of our own data centers,” said Trombetta. “We still need better security and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).” More likely, GE will adopt a hybrid model where it creates two clouds—one for itself as an enterprise and one for customer data. Certain functions will be trusted to the public cloud while others will be hosted in GE’s own private cloud—underpinned by company owned and operated data centers. “Every business within GE is currently looking at all its apps to discover which ones we actually need, and which ones can be moved to the cloud,” said Trombetta. “We will probably see hybrid data centers operations with far more IaaS and cloud applications taking over data center workloads where it makes sense.” Staring into the crystal ball, Trombetta envisions a world where instead of just spinning up virtual servers on demand, the company will be able to spin up whole manufacturing execution systems and data centers on demand for internal business units as well as customers. “Why take six months to build your own data center if you can have someone else get one online at the push of a button at a fraction of the cost,” asked Trombetta. Storage Headache Much has been made about the number of devices that will make up the Internet of Things. But that only tells half the tale. It’s the volume of generated data that is probably the scariest part for the data center. Here are some examples: oil rigs generate 8 TB of data per day. The average flight wirelessly transmits half a TB of data per engine and an additional 200 TB is downloaded after landing. The self-driving Google car produces 1 GB per second. “Big data is the fuel of the connected vehicle,” said Andreas Mai, Director of Smart Connected Vehicles, Cisco. “It is analytics which gives you the true value.” Already, Google has been driving autonomous networked vehicles around the U.S. for some time. When you scale it up to every vehicle, the traffic jams would shift from the roadways to the airwaves. It is unrealistic to expect satellite, cellular or cloud-based networks to be able to cope. The volume will not only swamp existing data centers, it is beyond the ability of any currently conceived technology to be able to store that information. So where is it going to go? “It isn’t possible for cars to receive external impulses from traffic lights, mapping programs and other vehicles if it all has to go via the cloud,” said Mai. “So the IoT will require a lot more compute power on the edge of the network.” Mai said it will take additional networking from what he termed “the fog.” These are local networking nodes that supplement cloud and land-line systems, perhaps only operating in the vicinity of one junction. The good news is that only certain data has lasting value. Most of will likely be of very temporary interest and will have little long-term value. “A lot of the data being generated by IoT will be short lived” said Greg Schulz, an analyst with StorageIO Group. “It will have to be analyzed, summarized and then tossed aside after a period of time.” So there is hope that beleaguered data center managers won’t be called upon to find enough storage capacity to house it all.

All four companies, along with Mississauga, Ont.-based workforce management (WFM) and human capital management (HCM) software developer Kronos Inc., were recently declared among 2017’s 10 best enterprises to work for in Canada by the Canadian arm of the Great Place To Work Institute. In fact, around 17 tech or tech-adjacent companies were on the company’s full list of Canada’s top 50 “large and multinational” workplaces, including four of Canada’s leading banks – Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), TD Bank Group, BMO Financial Group, and Scotiabank – AOL Canada, advisory firm EY, and Canadian business information giant Thomson Reuters. Despite their employee-friendly reputations (and top five positions on Business Insider’s competing list), the Canadian subsidiaries of American tech giants Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. did not make the cut, although it’s worth noting that businesses must register with Great Place to Work in order to be considered, and there is no indication that either company – or such BI luminaries as Apple Corp., Salesforce.com, Intel Corp., eBay Inc., or Cisco Systems Inc. – has done so. According to a supplement in April 27’s Globe and Mail, the 50 winners were chosen because they are “leaders in building high-trust, high-performance cultures that enhance business results, quality of work life and employee engagement.” More specifically, each of the top 50 submitted a report listing the “Perks and Programs” that helped set it apart, which was then posted on Great Place to Work’s website. Intuit, for example, extolled the virtues of its employee networking groups, which include a women’s network, “next generation” network, mosaic network for employees of African descent, and “the Green Team,” which focuses on the environment. The company, which has 343 employees in Canada, also provides biometric screenings on-site to help employees monitor their health, and runs a fitness reimbursement program worth up to $650 per year. Also in the top 10 was a bank – ATB Financial. It emphasized “Workplace 2.0,” with an evaluation strategy based on “performance not presence,” and its company’s focus on “cultivating the right environment for people to manage all aspects of their life, including work.” Autodesk’s Applause Program encourages employees to nominate their colleagues for an award or submit an electronic thank you card through an internal online award system, while Microsoft emphasized its employee-only online store that allows company team members to purchase Microsoft products at a discount – and the requisite tech giant refreshments that include hot drinks from Starbucks, Tim Hortons, and Starbucks subsidiary Tazo Tea.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Brands Take Stands: 13 Major Corporations Urge Support for Paris Agreement – The Minute SOURCE: 3BL Media, LLC DESCRIPTION: In the most recent example of brands taking stands, 13 major corporations have written to President Trump urging him to keep the US signed on to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The letter, organized by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, was signed by BP, DuPont, General Mills, Google, Intel, Microsoft, National Grid, Novartis Corporation, PG&E, Schneider Electric, Shell, Unilever and Walmart. Their reasoning is pretty clear: the bottom line. They argue that continued US participation “expands markets for innovative clean technologies, generating jobs and economic growth,” and note that U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in this area. Lack of U.S. participation, say the companies, could put “access to these growing markets at risk.’’ These companies have a combined market capitalization of nearly $2.5 trillion. If money talks, this latest example of the growing trend to take a stand on behalf of progressive business strategy practically shouts. I’m John Howell for 3BL Media.

Blog :  Cloud Growth Slows, Slightly Article :  IT Business Edge 2016 Editorial Calendar Aparna Systems Employs NVMe to Drive Hyperconvergence Mike Vizard |   IT Unmasked   |   Posted 01 May, 2017          |         |     Share At the NFV World Congress 2017 conference today, Aparna Systems unveiled two systems that take advantage of NVMe to pack 10,000 cores into a single 4u rack. Aparna Systems CEO Sam Mathan says the rise of NVMe presents a unique opportunity to rethink system design in a way that achieves all the benefits of hyperconvergence using an open modular approach that enables the latest generation of Intel processors to be packaged in a cartridge that is about the size of 3.5-in drive. Those cartridges then share access to 20 Gbps of bandwidth per server to achieve an aggregate uplink capacity of 640 Gbps. The Aparna systems come in two basic forms. The Oserv8 and Oserv16 servers within the Orca µServers line come with eight and 16 cores, respectively. There’s also an Orca µCloud system family that consists of a 4060 model that can be configured with up to 60 µServers and a 4015 model that can be configured with up 15 µServers. “It’s a totally open high-density appliance,” says Mathan. Mathan says that what most IT organizations don’t appreciate yet about NMVe is that there’s now enough bandwidth to simultaneously provide compute, storage and networking processing capabilities without requiring them to be handled by entirely separate subsystems. As processing requirements change, Mathan says, IT organizations will be able to dynamically allocate resources on demand across compute, storage and networking. That in turn will drive server utilization rates exponentially higher, says Mathan. In fact, Mathan says that what passes for virtualization and hyperconvergence will soon appear antiquated by comparison. As systems that employ NVMe start to appear, the level of compute, storage and networking density that can be achieved inside a data center will soon exponentially increase. Those increased levels of density have implications for everything from the amount of energy consumed in a data center to the number of virtual machines and container-based microservices that can be supported in any given environment. Of course, it may still take a while for IT organizations to finance major forklift upgrades across the data center. But as IT organizations begin to make the transition to NVMe, many of them will discover just how utterly changed the data center is about to become.

On a non-GAAP(1) basis, operating loss was $6 million, net loss was $38 million, and loss per share was $0.04. GAAP Financial Results Q1-17 Q4-16 Q1-16 Revenue $984M $1.11B $832M Operating loss $(29)M $(3)M $(68)M Net loss $(73)M $(51)M $(109)M Loss per share $(0.08) $(0.06) $(0.14) Non-GAAP Financial Results(1) Q1-17 Q4-16 Q1-16 Revenue $984M $1.11B $832M Operating income (loss) $(6)M $26M $(55)M Net loss $(38)M $(8)M $(96)M Loss per share $(0.04) $(0.01) $(0.12) “We achieved 18 percent year-over-year revenue growth driven by strong demand for our high performance Ryzen CPUs as well as graphics processors,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. “We are positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities across the business in the year ahead as we bring innovation, performance, and choice to an expanding set of markets.” Q1 2017 Results Revenue of $984 million was up 18 percent year-over-year, driven by higher revenue in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business segments. Revenue was down 11 percent sequentially, due primarily to seasonality in both segments. However, Computing and Graphics segment revenue decline was better than seasonal due to the initial sales from high performance Ryzen™ desktop processors. On a GAAP basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially due to a higher percentage of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment, as well as a richer product mix within that segment. Operating loss of $29 million compared to operating losses of $68 million a year ago and $3 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $73 million compared to net losses of $109 million a year ago and $51 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.08 compared to a loss per share of $0.14 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.06 in the prior quarter. On a non-GAAP(1) basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially. Operating loss of $6 million compared to an operating loss of $55 million a year ago and operating income of $26 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $38 million compared to net losses of $96 million a year ago and $8 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.04 compared to a loss per share of $0.12 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.01 in the prior quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $943 million at the end of the quarter, down $321 million from the end of the prior quarter primarily due to the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments, and increased inventory. Quarterly Financial Segment Summary Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $593 million, up 29 percent year-over-year and down 1 percent sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher desktop and graphics processor sales. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mobile and graphics processor sales largely offset by initial revenue from high performance Ryzen desktop processors. Operating loss was $15 million, compared to operating losses of $70 million in Q1 2016 and $21 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue. The sequential improvement was driven primarily by lower operating expenses. Client average selling price (ASP) increased year-over-year and sequentially driven by desktop processor ASP. GPU ASP increased year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to higher desktop GPU ASP. Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $391 million, up 5 percent year-over-year driven primarily by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Sequentially, revenue decreased 23 percent primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $9 million, compared to an operating income of $16 million in Q1 2016 and an operating income of $47 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher server related R&D investments, partially offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain. The sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. All Other operating loss was $23 million compared with operating losses of $14 million in Q1 2016 and $29 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year and sequential differences in operating loss were related to stock-based compensation charges. Q1 2017 Highlights AMD launched its first high-performance x86 Ryzen desktop processor based on the entirely new “Zen” core microarchitecture, bringing leadership multi-core performance to PC gamers, creators, and hardware enthusiasts worldwide. AMD Ryzen 7: These 8-core, 16-thread processors bring innovation and choice back to the enthusiast PC market and include the world’s highest performing, and lowest powered 8-core desktop PC processors.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting operating income (loss) for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and restructuring and other special charges, net. The Company calculates and communicates Adjusted EBITDA because the Company’s management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of operating income (loss) or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. ** The Company also presents non-GAAP free cash flow as a supplemental measure of its performance. Non-GAAP free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates non-GAAP free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because the Company’s management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of non-GAAP free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view non-GAAP free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman AMD Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results SUNNYVALE, CA–(Marketwired – May 1, 2017) – AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced revenue for the first quarter of 2017 of $984 million, operating loss of $29 million, and net loss of $73 million, or $0.08 per share. On a non-GAAP(1) basis, operating loss was $6 million, net loss was $38 million, and loss per share was $0.04.   GAAP Financial Results       Q1-17   Q4-16   Q1-16 Revenue   $984M   $1.11B   $832M Operating loss   $(29)M   $(3)M   $(68)M Net loss   $(73)M   $(51)M   $(109)M Loss per share   $(0.08)   $(0.06)   $(0.14)     Non-GAAP Financial Results(1)       Q1-17   Q4-16   Q1-16 Revenue   $984M   $1.11B   $832M Operating income (loss)   $(6)M   $26M   $(55)M Net loss   $(38)M   $(8)M   $(96)M Loss per share   $(0.04)   $(0.01)   $(0.12)               „We achieved 18 percent year-over-year revenue growth driven by strong demand for our high performance Ryzen CPUs as well as graphics processors,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. „We are positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities across the business in the year ahead as we bring innovation, performance, and choice to an expanding set of markets.” Q1 2017 Results Revenue of $984 million was up 18 percent year-over-year, driven by higher revenue in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business segments. Revenue was down 11 percent sequentially, due primarily to seasonality in both segments. However, Computing and Graphics segment revenue decline was better than seasonal due to the initial sales from high performance Ryzen™ desktop processors. On a GAAP basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially due to a higher percentage of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment, as well as a richer product mix within that segment. Operating loss of $29 million compared to operating losses of $68 million a year ago and $3 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $73 million compared to net losses of $109 million a year ago and $51 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.08 compared to a loss per share of $0.14 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.06 in the prior quarter. On a non-GAAP(1) basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially. Operating loss of $6 million compared to an operating loss of $55 million a year ago and operating income of $26 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $38 million compared to net losses of $96 million a year ago and $8 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.04 compared to a loss per share of $0.12 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.01 in the prior quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $943 million at the end of the quarter, down $321 million from the end of the prior quarter primarily due to the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments, and increased inventory. Quarterly Financial Segment Summary Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $593 million, up 29 percent year-over-year and down 1 percent sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher desktop and graphics processor sales. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mobile and graphics processor sales largely offset by initial revenue from high performance Ryzen desktop processors. Operating loss was $15 million, compared to operating losses of $70 million in Q1 2016 and $21 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue. The sequential improvement was driven primarily by lower operating expenses. Client average selling price (ASP) increased year-over-year and sequentially driven by desktop processor ASP. GPU ASP increased year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to higher desktop GPU ASP. Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $391 million, up 5 percent year-over-year driven primarily by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Sequentially, revenue decreased 23 percent primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $9 million, compared to an operating income of $16 million in Q1 2016 and an operating income of $47 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher server related R&D investments, partially offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain. The sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. All Other operating loss was $23 million compared with operating losses of $14 million in Q1 2016 and $29 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year and sequential differences in operating loss were related to stock-based compensation charges. Q1 2017 Highlights AMD launched its first high-performance x86 Ryzen desktop processor based on the entirely new „Zen” core microarchitecture, bringing leadership multi-core performance to PC gamers, creators, and hardware enthusiasts worldwide.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting operating income (loss) for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and restructuring and other special charges, net. The Company calculates and communicates Adjusted EBITDA because the Company’s management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of operating income (loss) or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows.     ** The Company also presents non-GAAP free cash flow as a supplemental measure of its performance. Non-GAAP free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates non-GAAP free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because the Company’s management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of non-GAAP free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view non-GAAP free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

On a non-GAAP(1) basis, operating loss was $6 million, net loss was $38 million, and loss per share was $0.04.   GAAP Financial Results       Q1-17   Q4-16   Q1-16 Revenue   $984M   $1.11B   $832M Operating loss   $(29)M   $(3)M   $(68)M Net loss   $(73)M   $(51)M   $(109)M Loss per share   $(0.08)   $(0.06)   $(0.14)     Non-GAAP Financial Results(1)       Q1-17   Q4-16   Q1-16 Revenue   $984M   $1.11B   $832M Operating income (loss)   $(6)M   $26M   $(55)M Net loss   $(38)M   $(8)M   $(96)M Loss per share   $(0.04)   $(0.01)   $(0.12)               "We achieved 18 percent year-over-year revenue growth driven by strong demand for our high performance Ryzen CPUs as well as graphics processors," said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. "We are positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities across the business in the year ahead as we bring innovation, performance, and choice to an expanding set of markets." Q1 2017 Results Revenue of $984 million was up 18 percent year-over-year, driven by higher revenue in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business segments. Revenue was down 11 percent sequentially, due primarily to seasonality in both segments. However, Computing and Graphics segment revenue decline was better than seasonal due to the initial sales from high performance Ryzen™ desktop processors. On a GAAP basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially due to a higher percentage of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment, as well as a richer product mix within that segment. Operating loss of $29 million compared to operating losses of $68 million a year ago and $3 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $73 million compared to net losses of $109 million a year ago and $51 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.08 compared to a loss per share of $0.14 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.06 in the prior quarter. On a non-GAAP(1) basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially. Operating loss of $6 million compared to an operating loss of $55 million a year ago and operating income of $26 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $38 million compared to net losses of $96 million a year ago and $8 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.04 compared to a loss per share of $0.12 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.01 in the prior quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $943 million at the end of the quarter, down $321 million from the end of the prior quarter primarily due to the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments, and increased inventory. Quarterly Financial Segment Summary Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $593 million, up 29 percent year-over-year and down 1 percent sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher desktop and graphics processor sales. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mobile and graphics processor sales largely offset by initial revenue from high performance Ryzen desktop processors. Operating loss was $15 million, compared to operating losses of $70 million in Q1 2016 and $21 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue. The sequential improvement was driven primarily by lower operating expenses. Client average selling price (ASP) increased year-over-year and sequentially driven by desktop processor ASP. GPU ASP increased year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to higher desktop GPU ASP. Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $391 million, up 5 percent year-over-year driven primarily by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Sequentially, revenue decreased 23 percent primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $9 million, compared to an operating income of $16 million in Q1 2016 and an operating income of $47 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher server related R&D investments, partially offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain. The sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. All Other operating loss was $23 million compared with operating losses of $14 million in Q1 2016 and $29 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year and sequential differences in operating loss were related to stock-based compensation charges. Q1 2017 Highlights AMD launched its first high-performance x86 Ryzen desktop processor based on the entirely new "Zen" core microarchitecture, bringing leadership multi-core performance to PC gamers, creators, and hardware enthusiasts worldwide. AMD Ryzen 7: These 8-core, 16-thread processors bring innovation and choice back to the enthusiast PC market and include the world's highest performing, and lowest powered 8-core desktop PC processors.

Cautionary Statement This document contains forward-looking statements concerning Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) including AMD's ability to achieve future revenue growth and margin expansion; its ability to bring innovation, performance and choice to an expanding set of markets; the features, functionality, timing, availability and expected benefits of AMD's new products and technologies; and AMD's expected second quarter 2017 revenue, which are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by words such as "would," "may," "expects," "believes," "plans," "intends," "projects" and other terms with similar meaning. Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this document are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this document and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Such statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond AMD's control, that could cause actual results and other future events to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, from GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMD's manufacturing requirements, its business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD's business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD's products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMD's business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; AMD's receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMD's business and operating results; the markets in which AMD's products are sold are highly competitive; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD's notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect its ability to operate its business; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD's products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD's products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for AMD's products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMD's ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporation's support for its products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on AMD's products, its ability to sell its products could be materially adversely affected; AMD's reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects it to certain risks; AMD's inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder its business; AMD's issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of its existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 may dilute the ownership interest of its existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; in the event of a change of control, AMD may not be able to repurchase its outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and its Secured Revolving Line of Credit, which would result in a default under the indentures and its Secured Revolving Line of Credit; the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect its business in the future; acquisitions, divestitures and/or joint ventures could disrupt its business, harm its financial condition and operating results or dilute, or adversely affect the price of, its common stock; AMD's business is dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt its business, processes and internal controls; data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise AMD's intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to its business and reputation; AMD's operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns; if essential equipment, materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture its products, AMD could be materially adversely affected; if AMD's products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, it could be materially adversely affected; costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on AMD; if AMD fails to maintain the efficiency of its supply chain as it responds to changes in customer demand for its products, its business could be materially adversely affected; AMD outsources to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of its product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services; the completion and impact of the 2015 Restructuring Plan, its transformation initiatives and any future restructuring actions could adversely affect AMD; AMD may incur future impairments of goodwill; AMD's stock price is subject to volatility; AMD's worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for AMD's products; unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect AMD; AMD's inability to effectively control the sales of its products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on it; if AMD cannot adequately protect its technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, it may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses; AMD is a party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause it to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit it from selling its products; AMD's business is subject to potential tax liabilities; and AMD is subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities. Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in AMD's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to AMD's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting operating income (loss) for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and restructuring and other special charges, net. The Company calculates and communicates Adjusted EBITDA because the Company's management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of operating income (loss) or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows.     ** The Company also presents non-GAAP free cash flow as a supplemental measure of its performance. Non-GAAP free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates non-GAAP free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because the Company's management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company's calculation of non-GAAP free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view non-GAAP free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.   Contact Information Media Contact Drew Prairie 512-602-4425 drew.prairie@amd.com Investor Contact Laura Graves 408-749-5467 laura.graves@amd.com Print Friendly Share News Room   View Related News About this company Advanced Micro Devices From this industry Computers and Software Electronics and Semiconductors From this sub-industry Peripherals Networking Hardware Optical Components Micro-electronics and Nanotechnology Semiconductors Electronic Components See all RSS Newsfeeds   Highlighted Links AMD Investor Relations   About Marketwired   Marketwired News   Community Builders Privacy Site Map Accessibility Products   Marketwired Resonate   Marketwired Influencers   News Distribution   IR/PR Newsroom (Impress)   Media Database (Mediahub) Resources   Brochures   Case Studies   E-Books / Tip Sheets   Webinars / Videos Newsroom   All News   Headlines Only   Advanced Search   RSS Newsfeeds   Hot Off the Wire   Personal Beat   CASL Compliance Connect With Us Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Google+ MARKETWIRED IS NOW PART OF NASDAQ Copyright ©2016 Nasdaq, Inc.

On a non-GAAP(1) basis, operating loss was $6 million, net loss was $38 million, and loss per share was $0.04.   GAAP Financial Results       Q1-17   Q4-16   Q1-16 Revenue   $984M   $1.11B   $832M Operating loss   $(29)M   $(3)M   $(68)M Net loss   $(73)M   $(51)M   $(109)M Loss per share   $(0.08)   $(0.06)   $(0.14)     Non-GAAP Financial Results(1)       Q1-17   Q4-16   Q1-16 Revenue   $984M   $1.11B   $832M Operating income (loss)   $(6)M   $26M   $(55)M Net loss   $(38)M   $(8)M   $(96)M Loss per share   $(0.04)   $(0.01)   $(0.12)               "We achieved 18 percent year-over-year revenue growth driven by strong demand for our high performance Ryzen CPUs as well as graphics processors," said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. "We are positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities across the business in the year ahead as we bring innovation, performance, and choice to an expanding set of markets." Q1 2017 Results Revenue of $984 million was up 18 percent year-over-year, driven by higher revenue in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business segments. Revenue was down 11 percent sequentially, due primarily to seasonality in both segments. However, Computing and Graphics segment revenue decline was better than seasonal due to the initial sales from high performance Ryzen™ desktop processors. On a GAAP basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially due to a higher percentage of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment, as well as a richer product mix within that segment. Operating loss of $29 million compared to operating losses of $68 million a year ago and $3 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $73 million compared to net losses of $109 million a year ago and $51 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.08 compared to a loss per share of $0.14 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.06 in the prior quarter. On a non-GAAP(1) basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially. Operating loss of $6 million compared to an operating loss of $55 million a year ago and operating income of $26 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $38 million compared to net losses of $96 million a year ago and $8 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.04 compared to a loss per share of $0.12 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.01 in the prior quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $943 million at the end of the quarter, down $321 million from the end of the prior quarter primarily due to the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments, and increased inventory. Quarterly Financial Segment Summary Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $593 million, up 29 percent year-over-year and down 1 percent sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher desktop and graphics processor sales. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mobile and graphics processor sales largely offset by initial revenue from high performance Ryzen desktop processors. Operating loss was $15 million, compared to operating losses of $70 million in Q1 2016 and $21 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue. The sequential improvement was driven primarily by lower operating expenses. Client average selling price (ASP) increased year-over-year and sequentially driven by desktop processor ASP. GPU ASP increased year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to higher desktop GPU ASP. Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $391 million, up 5 percent year-over-year driven primarily by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Sequentially, revenue decreased 23 percent primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $9 million, compared to an operating income of $16 million in Q1 2016 and an operating income of $47 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher server related R&D investments, partially offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain. The sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. All Other operating loss was $23 million compared with operating losses of $14 million in Q1 2016 and $29 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year and sequential differences in operating loss were related to stock-based compensation charges. Q1 2017 Highlights AMD launched its first high-performance x86 Ryzen desktop processor based on the entirely new "Zen" core microarchitecture, bringing leadership multi-core performance to PC gamers, creators, and hardware enthusiasts worldwide. AMD Ryzen 7: These 8-core, 16-thread processors bring innovation and choice back to the enthusiast PC market and include the world's highest performing, and lowest powered 8-core desktop PC processors. AMD Ryzen 5: Mainstream processors designed to bring innovation to the high-volume, sub-$300 CPU market with a disruptive price-to-performance ratio for gamers and creators. AMD shared new details about its upcoming server and high-end graphics solutions: Launching in Q2 2017, AMD's high-performance x86 server CPU, codenamed "Naples", exceeds today's top competitive offering on critical parameters, with 45 percent more cores, 60 percent more input / output capacity (I/O), and 122 percent more memory bandwidth.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting operating income (loss) for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and restructuring and other special charges, net. The Company calculates and communicates Adjusted EBITDA because the Company's management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of operating income (loss) or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows.     ** The Company also presents non-GAAP free cash flow as a supplemental measure of its performance. Non-GAAP free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates non-GAAP free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because the Company's management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company's calculation of non-GAAP free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view non-GAAP free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.   Contact Information Media Contact Drew Prairie 512-602-4425 drew.prairie@amd.com Investor Contact Laura Graves 408-749-5467 laura.graves@amd.com Print Friendly Share News Room   View Related News About this company Advanced Micro Devices From this industry Computers and Software Electronics and Semiconductors From this sub-industry Peripherals Networking Hardware Optical Components Micro-electronics and Nanotechnology Semiconductors Electronic Components See all RSS Newsfeeds   Highlighted Links AMD Investor Relations   About Marketwired   Marketwired News   Community Builders Privacy Site Map Accessibility Products   Marketwired Resonate   Marketwired Influencers   News Distribution   IR/PR Newsroom (Impress)   Media Database (Mediahub) Resources   Brochures   Case Studies   E-Books / Tip Sheets   Webinars / Videos Newsroom   All News   Headlines Only   Advanced Search   RSS Newsfeeds   Hot Off the Wire   Personal Beat   CASL Compliance Connect With Us Facebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Google+ MARKETWIRED IS NOW PART OF NASDAQ Copyright ©2016 Nasdaq, Inc.

It is still an open problem to effectively leverage the advantages of both CPUs and GPUs on integrated architectures. In this work, we port 42 programs in Rodinia, Parboil, and Polybench benchmark suites and analyze the co-running behaviors of these programs on both AMD and Intel integrated architectures. We find that co-running performance is not always better than running the program only with CPUs or GPUs. Among these programs, only eight programs can benefit from the co-running, while 24 programs only using GPUs and seven programs only using CPUs achieve the best performance. The remaining three programs show little performance preference for different devices. Through extensive workload characterization analysis, we find that architecture differences between CPUs and GPUs and limited shared memory bandwidth are two main factors affecting current co-running performance. Since not all the programs can benefit from integrated architectures, we build an automatic decision-tree-based model to help application developers predict the co-running performance for a given CPU-only or GPU-only program. Results show that our model correctly predicts 14 programs out of 15 for evaluated programs. For a co-run friendly program, we further propose a profiling-based method to predict the optimal workload partition ratio between CPUs and GPUs. Results show that our model can achieve 87.7 percent of the optimal performance relative to the best partition. The co-running programs acquired with our method outperform the original CPU-only and GPU-only programs by 34.5 and 20.9 percent respectively.

Ireland’s massive tax advantage, which has resulted in 140,000 Irish jobs from American companies located there, could be at an end. President Trump’s new policy, outlined by Treasury Secretary Steve Munchin, would reduce the US corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 percent, just two and a half percent more than Ireland’s 12.5 percent, the lowest in Europe, which has driven American investment to Ireland. According to leading Irish Times business columnist Cliff Taylor Ireland will soon feel the impact. He wrote: “It will remove the current incentive for US companies to establish subsidiaries overseas which results in a reduction in their overall corporate tax bill. “Tax experts believe that this could mean fewer US companies setting up foreign bases in lower tax locations in future – and thus a slowing in the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) to countries such as Ireland.” While existing companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook are hardly likely to leave Ireland, which has become their European headquarters, new companies may be harder to attract given the near equality in the tax base if the Trump initiative passes, which many experts believe it will. 4 Google's HQ in Dublin city. Ireland's Industrial Development Agency, the IDA, has been incredibly successful in attracting major American multinationals such as Coca Cola, Intel, Facebook, Google, Apple and Pfizer (Viagra) and others on the back of the attractive tax deal. Without that tax incentive, however, it would be a much tougher sell, especially with a president very intent on keeping American jobs in America. It is far too early to speculate what the ultimate outcome will be if the new tax rate comes to pass, but Irish government sources must surely be worried. Without its multinational base secure the just recovering Irish economy could quickly be in difficulties again. 4 Apple HQ, in Cork. However, Ireland continues to have excellent advantages: the only English-speaking country in the EU after Brexit, the educated workforce and the country is seen as an attractive, pro-business destination. However, there is no denying the tax issue is a serious one. As Cliff Taylor stated, “If US companies can, in future, pay 15 percent tax at home, then the push for them to move abroad will lessen.” In addition, Trump is set to offer a once-off tax holiday on funds kept abroad by US companies allowing them to be repatriated in America at a 10 percent rate. That too will impact Ireland where much of those funds are kept in Irish financial institutions as the European headquarters of the companies concerned. 4 A map illustrating the companies in Dublin's Silicon Docks (Via Silcon Roadmap) The Irish government however is adopting a wait and see attitude and not jumping to any hasty conclusions. A spokesman for the Department of Finance said the details of the full changes would determine their impact on Ireland. "The exact implications of US tax reform for Ireland, and the rest of the world, will depend on the exact nature of any changes which are ultimately agreed," the spokesman said. "Ireland’s membership of the EU is, and will remain, a key factor in attracting FDI from the US and elsewhere.  Global business, from the US or elsewhere, will always want to have operations in the EU, and Ireland will remain very competitive and attractive as an EU location to invest in and do business from." American Chamber of Commerce CEO Mark Redmond stated, "We can’t speculate on what might happen in the future, but Ireland has always competed very successfully on the world stage for US FDI. "While it is very important not to be complacent, and we must constantly look for ways in which to improve our competitiveness, we expect that the Irish Government and the IDA will remain committed and successful in the pursuit of new business."

Digital Trends Home > Android Army > Samsung Z4 news and rumors Samsung Z4 news and rumors The Galaxy Z4 will be the first device to ship with Tizen 3.0 By Kyle Wiggers — May 1, 2017 7:16 AM Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Samsung's Z4 is the first to run Tizen 3.0, the latest version of Samsung's proprietary operating system. Here's everything we know. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 may be the high-end smartphone to beat, but it isn’t exactly affordable. Luckily, the Seoul, South Korea-based smartphone maker is offering more than a few affordable alternatives to its flagship phone, and one — the Samsung Z4 — runs the latest version of the company’s homegrown Tizen operating system. Here’s everything we know about the Samsung Z4. Software If rumors are to be believed, the Samsung Z4 will be the first phone to run Tizen 3.0. Tizen, for the uninitiated, is Samsung’s open-source alternative to Android. It powers tens of million of the company’s smart TVs and Samsung Gear smartwatches. The bulk of Tizen 3.0’s new features focus on performance. According early developer notes, the update packs Khornos’ Vulkan graphics API, which minimizes overhead and reduces CPU load, and the speedy open-source web runtime Crosswalk. There’s support for 64-bit Intel and ARM CPUs, too, which Samsung says should boost CPU-intensive apps like video editors and games. That’s not all that’s new in Tizen 3.0. It supports multiple users on a single device, and voice commands via S Voice. And new recognition APIs support facial detection and image recognition. Samsung’s also improved Tizen’s security features. Tizen 3.0 introduces a “new security model” that simplifies “policy management,” and an “anti-virus framework” and “privacy guard” that aim to ensure rogue applications don’t gain access to personal information. That’s encouraging news in light of an April report that painted an unflattering picture of the operating system’s flaws. According to Motherboard, Tizen contains as many as 40 unknown bugs, or zero-days, that could allow a cyber criminal to hack devices without needing to physically access them. One vulnerability involving TizenStore, Tizen’s app store, could let a hacker pack malicious code in a software update. In response to the report, Samsung said it was working on addressing the exploits. And based on what we’ve seen of Tizen 3.0, that certainly seems to be the case. Specs The Samsung Z4 won’t blow anyone away with its specifications. But for a budget phone bound for developing markets, they’re par for the course. The Z4 reportedly packs a 5-inch HD (1,280 x 720 pixels) Super AMOLED screen powered by a quad-core 1.3 GHz processor and 1GB of RAM. There’s 8GB of onboard storage inside (expandable via MicroSD slot), and accouterments like Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, a 3.5mm audio jack, GPS, and a MicroUSB 2.0 slot. An 8 MP rear camera and 5 MP front camera handle picture-taking duties, and a 2,050mAh battery supplies a full day of power. Release date and price Samsung has yet to announce pricing or availability for the Z4, but it likely won’t be expensive. The Samsung Z3, its predecessor, retails for the equivalent of $87 (5,590 rupees). And likely won’t come to the U.S., either. Samsung currently sells Tizen smartphones in India, Russia, China, and other select markets. Still, there’s a chance the Z4 will be different. We’ll keep our eyes peeled.

Caffe2 is backed by Facebook and features a wide array of partnerships to make it as flexible and scalable as possible. But is that enough to make Caffe2 a winner? By George Anadiotis for Big on Data | May 1, 2017 -- 15:13 GMT (08:13 PDT) | Topic: Innovation There is more to AI than machine learning, and there is more to machine learning than deep learning. Image: Nvidia Although artificial intelligence (AI) is more than machine learning (ML), and ML is more than deep learning (DL), DL is an important part of AI that has seen lots of progress and hype as of late. Winning the hearts and minds of developers and creating an ecosystem around frameworks will be very important for this space going forward. must read Digital transformation: Making it work in the real world It takes more than shiny new technologies to remake business processes. Here are a few ideas on how to make digital transformation projects work in your organisation. Read More Taking a look at the history of Android can provide some insights, and it looks like Google is the first to learn from its own success there. Open-sourcing TensorFlow in late 2015 caused a commotion, and some go as far as to say that Google has already won the DL framework race with TensorFlow. It may be a bit early for such claims though, and the people behind Caffe2 beg to differ. AI's not a competition -- but who's winning? So, what does winning even mean here? What are the criteria for defining a winning DL framework? If it's mindshare we're talking about, then yes, it looks like TensorFlow is winning. Although there's no "official" data as of yet, analyzing sources such as StackOverflow and Github seems to point towards a landslide victory for TensorFlow. If Stackoverflow posts are any indication, TensorFlow is clearly leading the race for deep learning framework adoption. Image: Delip Rao But perhaps the real question would be "why are people using TensorFlow" -- what are the criteria for choosing a DL framework? And, by extension, how does Caffe2 compare, and why would someone pick this over TensorFlow or other options such as Torch (in which Facebook is also heavily involved in), H2O.ai, DeepLearning4J, or Microsoft's CNTK? Yangqing Jia, research scientist in Facebook's Applied Machine Learning group and Caffe2 project lead, says: "Caffe2 is deployed at Facebook to help developers and researchers train large machine learning models and deliver AI-powered experiences in various mobile apps, like style transfer. One great feature of Caffe2 is its flexibility to perform a number of deep learning tasks, so it's easy to customize for specific workloads. We've run Caffe2 on our Big Basin GPU servers and Yosemite CPU servers, both of which are available through the Open Compute Project. We encourage people to use Caffe2 because of its high performance and first-class support for large-scale distributed training, mobile deployment, new hardware support (in addition to CPU and CUDA), and flexibility for future applications such as quantized computation." So the emphasis is on performance and flexibility. While performance may seem more straightforward (spoiler alert: it's not), what about flexibility? Jia goes as far as to hint Caffe2 will be quantum-computing ready. This claim may be difficult to assess today, but hardware support and programming language support are fairly tangible aspects of flexibility. Facebook previously embraced criticism towards Caffe and pointed towards Torch, but the release of Caffe2 may signify a change in course. Facebook worked closely with Nvidia, Qualcomm, Intel, Amazon, and Microsoft to optimize Caffe2 for both cloud and mobile environments. But as many examples have aptly demonstrated, technical merit alone does not always ensure market domination. Winning hearts and minds The role of developers is paramount in creating ecosystems, so winning their hearts and minds is essential for winning the battle for DL framework domination. Ease of use and comprehensive documentation and training are key parts of this, and Google has been trying to address this for TensorFlow -- although not always successfully. Facebook gets this, and that's the reason it's providing internal DL courses. Its employees also get this, and that's the reason these courses are oversubscribed. But internal courses are not enough obviously, so Caffe2 and the partnership with Nvidia is another way for Facebook to address this. Nvidia runs the Deep Learning Institute (DLI), through which it helps developers learn to use frameworks to design, train, and deploy neural network-powered machine learning for a variety of intelligent applications and services. Starting at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference on May 8-11, Nvidia is adding Caffe2 training to the DLI curriculum. Members of the DLI team will be on hand to help developers get their hands dirty with Caffe2 through a self-paced lab. At the GPU Technology Conference in March last year Nvidia shared this graph showing the rapid growth in organizations engaged in deep learning. Image: Nvidia No hype, just fact: Artificial intelligence in simple business terms AI has become one of the great, meaningless buzzwords of our time. In this video, the Chief Data Scientist of Dun and Bradstreet explains AI in clear business terms. Read More Will Ramey, Nvidia director of developer programs, comments: "When we first started offering DL training, most of the interest came from universities and academic researchers. Now we're seeing a significant surge in both interest and adoption of DL in companies, across a wide range of application domains. Last year alone DLI trained more than 10,000 developers, data scientists, and researchers worldwide through online labs and instructor-led workshops. What we've learned is that the best way for developers to get started with DL is through hands-on experience. That's why our DLI training includes interactive projects the help you learn by actually applying DL to solve challenging problems in healthcare, autonomous driving, robotics, and other industries. We give developers the skills and experience they need using the latest deep learning frameworks and powerful GPU-accelerated workstations in the cloud, so you can learn how to create deep learning applications without having to purchase or setup a new development system." Deep Learning at scale everywhere The need to purchase new development systems is a common concern with DL. In Nvidia's announcement of Caffe2 there was particular emphasis on AI applications for edge devices. At the same time however, it seems like the focus of Caffe2 is on GPUs running on servers like Big Basin, so nowhere near the edge or the capabilities of edge devices. Nvidia emphasizes Caffe2 performance on GPUs, as far as training is concerned. But performance overall is hard to measure and compare. Image: Nvidia When asked to clarify this somewhat confusing verbiage, and to explain whether there is something about Caffe2 that makes it particularly suitable for developing AI apps for edge devices, Ramey replied as follows: "Caffe2 was designed to support the deep learning AI workflow from end-to-end. Its modular, lightweight framework can take full advantage of large scale GPU servers as well as run efficiently on lower powered embedded edge devices. Caffe2 uses the Nvidia Deep Learning SDK libraries, which are performance-optimized for all Nvidia GPU platforms ranging from Facebook's high-performance Big Basin servers and the Nvidia DGX-1 supercomputer, to energy efficient low-powered embedded devices such as the Nvidia Jetson TX2 which powers smart cameras, robots, drones, and more." Intel from its side highlights something different in its Caffe2 announcement: "Most deep learning workloads consist of both training and inference. Training usually requires many hours or days to complete. Inference usually requires milliseconds or seconds and is often a step of a larger process. While the computing intensity of inference is much lower than that of training, inference is often done on a much larger dataset. Therefore, the total computing resources spent on inference are likely to dwarf those spent on training. The overwhelming majority of all inference workloads run on Intel Xeon CPUs." The takeaway is that measuring DL performance is complicated. There is the training and the inference part, and then there are different scenarios and hardware that each of these may be running on. Caffe2 has gone to some lengths to get its bases covered in all of those, but although it highlights its improvement over its previous versions, measuring performance against the competition is rather hard. "All frameworks are more or less at a similar scalability factor,"says Jia. "We're pretty confident that Caffe2 is probably a little bit better than the rest." So the jury is not out on what the most scalable DL framework out there is. Scalability is a key feature, but it may not be the deciding factor on who wins the DL framework battle. Google seems to have a head start with TensorFlow. Still, this is too important, and it's too early for others to just roll over.

The Asus ROG GR8 II, which I’ve been putting through its paces in the last week, is one such example. The GR8 II is designed for those who want a compact gaming system for a desk or living room, but would rather something more powerful than an Xbox One or PlayStation 4. This system is similar in size to current-generation consoles, however its use of high-end Intel Kaby Lake processors and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics leads to a much faster experience. This extra performance does come at a price: a GR8 II plus controller will set you back at least $1,000, whereas you can currently purchase a PlayStation 4 Pro for just $400. Asus does claim the GR8 II is “VR-ready” for premium headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, though again, this is a much more expensive setup than Sony’s PlayStation VR. Let’s talk about size to begin with. The GR8 II occupies 7.4 litres of space, with four litres of internal space. This makes it slightly larger than the PlayStation 4 Pro (5.3 litres), and larger again compared to the Xbox One S (4.3 litres). The GR8 II’s angular design means its physical body doesn’t quite occupy a full 7.4 litres, but it’s still notably larger than current console offerings. Make no mistake: the GR8 II has a decidedly ‘gamer style’ design, which appeals only to a certain crowd. Most other mini PCs and game consoles go for a more understated design that coheres better with other living room devices, but Asus has decided that crazy angles and weird patterns are best for their offering. Unless you have a ton of sci-fi style equipment or just like this gamer aesthetic, there’s a good chance the GR8 II will look out of place wherever you position it. To my eyes, the GR8 II is remarkably ugly. It’s no different to most of Asus’ other ROG gear: confusing lines, aggressive angles and cluttered design elements. The grey color scheme with dark copper highlights is perhaps the best aspect to this design, though it doesn’t redeem an otherwise unattractive chassis. Also, Asus couldn’t resist making part of this chassis illuminated via RGB LEDs. There are some lines and grooves along the front panel that light up to whatever color you desire. Obviously RGB lighting is all the rage these days, but I don’t think it works well with the design of the GR8 II. The lights look like a tacky addition simply to add “RGB lighting!” to the system’s feature page, and can often clash with the copper center strip. The GR8 II has a decent set of I/O, although understandably less than a traditional desktop with a full-size motherboard. There’s two USB 3.0-A ports on the front plus two 3.5mm audio jacks. On the back is a further two USB 3.0-A ports, a USB 3.1-A port, a USB 3.1-C port (no Thunderbolt 3), an Ethernet port, an optical S/PDIF port and a 3.5mm audio jack. For display connectivity you get a DisplayPort and two HDMI ports attached to the graphics unit. The GR8 II doesn’t have an internal power supply, so Asus has included an external 230W adapter. It’s still a portable unit if you want to carry it around for a LAN party, at just 4kg, however keep in mind that you’ll need to bring the large and weighty power brick as well. It’s also worth mentioning the GR8 II is designed to stand upright, with rubber stands on the bottom. Of course you can place it on its side if you like, but the angular design makes the unit look pretty strange in this orientation. The GR8 II is not particularly upgradable. Neither the CPU or GPU can be replaced by the user, despite a large section of the internal chassis being devoted to a custom GPU module. In fact to even access these two components, you’ll need to remove pretty much everything from the chassis, as Asus has made it deliberately difficult to access the front side of the motherboard. There are some user-replaceable components on the side of the motherboard you can actually access. There’s a single DIMM slot, with the other DIMM presumably located on the inaccessible side of the motherboard. It should be easy to upgrade the system to 16GB of RAM from 8GB as a result, though 32GB will require a full disassembly. For storage, there’s a single M.2 2280 slot, equipped with an SSD out of the box. The GR8 II also supports a 2.5-inch storage drive, but you’ll only get the required connector bracket if you purchase a model that’s preconfigured with a HDD inside. My review unit didn’t come with a HDD, so the bracket was missing. Preventing some users from adding in a HDD later seems like a pretty buyer hostile decision, though it’s clear Asus doesn’t really want you to upgrade this unit. Even accessing the back side of the motherboard isn’t fun.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Cor blimey, love a duck, and stone the crows: Activision have announced that the next Call of Duty game will be Call of Duty: WWII [official site]. Their official announcement says about as much as the leak which gave this away four weeks ago. Another supposed leak has sprung with unconfirmed babbling about unsurprising things like D-Day and a co-op mode. But what’s most important is that ↑ teaser artwork up there. What’s going on with the man we shall assume is named Robert Gunnington? Activision’s page has that picture of Robert along with a countdown to a “worldwide reveal livestream” at 6pm on Wednesday, April 26th. CoD fansite Charlie Intel has some snaps of what’s supposedly leaked Australian marketing materials pegging the game for a November 3rd release. The gubbins gabs about visiting Normandy D-Day and jaunting across iconic battles, as well as a co-op mode with “a new and original story”. That co-op is called a “next-level standalone game experience” (next-level!) but the description’s vague enough that it could describe just about anything. None of that is confirmed, though none would be surprising. No, for cold hard facts we’re only got Robert Gunnington. And… Pip noticed a hint of something reflected in his pupils: Go a bit closer and we see shapes which might be a couple fellas and their dog staring at a road sign. Let’s go closer: Or a crucifixion? Probably not. We’ll need heavy-duty technology for this. I turned to the Deep Dream Generator and uncovered startling truths reflected in that pupil: Do you see? Taxis, orangutans, dimetrodons, and laboratory equipment. We’ll find out on Wednesday how that all fits into World War 2.

At some point very soon Ubisoft is going to figure out that since all their games are essentially the same now (open world icon hunts) they can set them in the same universe – meaning it’s all ‘creeds from here on out. Far Cryed, Wildlanded, Watch Dog-peed, Steepeed, Just Danc-eed, For Honoureed, The Crew-eed. Just imagine, you get all A+ ranks in Just Dance (I have not actually played the game, so insert appropriate ranking method) and the post credit scene has you waking from the asbergo machine, getting a high-five from your mildly attractive assassin handler for stopping the Templar plan of controlling the world through pop media. Bring up the real-life downfall of MTV for some pseusdo-reality tie-in and setup the sequel where Michael Jackson is an alien, elder, or whatever they are.

The upward momentum on Wall Street comes after lawmakers reached an agreement over the weekend on a long-term spending bill. Stocks turned in a relatively lackluster performance during trading on Friday before ending the session modestly lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq reached a new record intraday high in early trading but pulled back into negative territory. The Nasdaq ended the day just below the unchanged line, edging down 1.33 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 6,047.61. The Dow dipped 40.82 points or 0.2 percent to 20,940.51, and the S&P 500 slipped 4.57 points or 0.2 percent to 2,384.20. Despite the lower close on the day, the major averages moved notably higher for the week. The Nasdaq surged up by 2.3 percent, while the Dow and the S&P 500 jumped by 1.9 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. The modest weakness on Wall Street came after President Donald Trump warned of a major conflict with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. "There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely," Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. Trump said he wants to resolve the standoff with North Korea peacefully but argued a diplomatic solution is "very difficult." On the U.S. economic front, the Commerce Department released a report showing that economic growth slowed by more than anticipated in the first three months of 2017. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased by 0.7 percent in the first quarter after jumping by 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 1.2 percent. The weaker than expected increase in GDP in the first quarter represents the worst performance since a 1.2 percent decline in the first quarter of 2014. Among individual stocks, shares of Intel (INTC) moved notably lower after the semiconductor giant reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates but on weaker than expected revenues. Wearable camera maker GoPro (GPRO) also came under pressure after reporting a narrower than expected first quarter loss but disappointing shipments. Meanwhile, shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) showed a strong upward move after the parent of Google reported better than expected first quarter earnings and revenues. Semiconductor stocks saw considerable weakness on the day after trending higher in recent sessions. After ending Thursday's trading at its best closing level in over sixteen years, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell by 1.7 percent. Cavium (CAVM), Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), and Microsemi (MSCC) turned in some of the semiconductor sector's worst performances. Significant weakness was also visible among housing stocks, as reflected by the 1.5 percent loss posted by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index. The drop by the index came after it ended Thursday's trading at its best closing level in eleven years. Banking, transportation, and commercial real estate stocks also saw notable weakness, while substantial strength was visible in the gold and electronic storage sectors. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are sliding $0.34 to $48.99 a barrel after climbing $0.36 to $49.33 a barrel last Friday. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is trading at $1,266, down $2.30 from the previous session's close of $1,268.30. On Friday, gold rose $2.40. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 111.63 yen compared to the 111.49 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Friday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0917 compared to last Friday's $1.095. Asia Asian stocks ended mostly higher in thin holiday trading on Monday as many markets across Asia and Europe remained shut for May Day. Stocks struggled for traction earlier in the day as North Korea threatened to sink a U.S. nuclear submarine deployed in South Korean waters and weaker-than-expected U.S. GDP data and lower Treasury yields weakened the dollar. Investors also shrugged off an official survey, which showed that growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed faster than expected in April amid recent sharp falls in iron ore and steel prices. Markets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, India and Indonesia were closed for public holidays. Japanese shares hit a six-week high as the dollar gained ground in late trading ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting ending Wednesday and the all-important U.S. jobs report slated for release on Friday. The Nikkei 225 Index rose 113.78 points or 0.59 percent to 19,310.52, its highest level since March 2nd, ahead of the Golden Week holidays. The broader Topix index closed 0.52 percent higher at 1,539.77, led by technology stocks such as Tokyo Electron and Murata Manufacturing on upbeat earnings. Australian shares rose notably after U.S congressional negotiators reached a tentative deal on a spending package to keep the federal government funded through the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30, helping avert a shutdown of government this week. Data showing an expansion in Australia's manufacturing sector also bolstered investor sentiment. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 32.40 points or 0.55 percent to 5,956.50, extending gains for a seventh consecutive session and marking the longest winning streak since July. The broader All Ordinaries Index finished 28.80 points or 0.48 percent higher at 5,976.40. The big four banks ended on a mixed note ahead of bank earnings slated for release this week and the Federal budget due on May 9. Mining and Energy stocks closed broadly lower, with Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals Group and Santos falling around 1 percent each. Origin Energy ended on a flat note after the company sold its Darling Downs Solar Farm to pipelines owner APA Group in a A$220 million deal. Shares of APA Group rallied 2.6 percent. Retailer Wesfarmers advanced 1.4 percent and Woolworths added 0.6 percent. Europe The European markets were closed on the day for the May Day holiday. U.S. Economic Reports Personal income in the U.S. rose slightly less than expected in the month of March, according to a report released by the Commerce Department. The report said personal income rose by 0.2 percent in March after climbing by a downwardly revised 0.3 percent in February. Economists had expected income to climb by 0.3 percent compared to the 0.4 percent increase originally reported for the previous month. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said personal spending was unchanged for the second consecutive month. Spending had been expected to rise by 0.2 percent. At 10 am ET, the Institute for Supply Management is scheduled to release its report on manufacturing activity in the month of April. The ISM's purchasing managers index is expected to dip to 56.5 in April from 57.2 in March, with a positive reading indicating growth in the manufacturing sector. The Commerce Department is also due to release its report on construction spending in the month of March at 10 am ET. Construction spending is expected to climb by 0.4 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Hollywood's 10 Highest Paid Film Stars Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Twitter Partners With Bloomberg For Streaming News Expert Predicts PlayStation 5 In 2018 Fox, Blackstone Reportedly Teaming For Tribune Bid Six Dead In Crane Collapse At Samsung Shipyard Loews Q1 Profit Surges The World's Richest Bachelors And Bachelorettes Uber's Self-Driving Head Out Amid Waymo Lawsuit Southwest Ending Practice Of Overbooking Electrolux Stock Up On Higher Q1 Results GM Q1 Results Climb, Top Estimates; Backs FY17 Adj.

Recent News NVIDIA Adding Netflix 4K Support to GeForce GTX 10 Series Cards G.SKILL RIPJAWS KM560 MX Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Announced Protect Your New Headphones In Four Easy Steps Wireless@SG Showcases Automatic Login Capabilities at Tech Saturday Asus Maximus IX Apex Motherboard Review Tuesday, May 2, 2017 Latest News Smartphones Gaming Reviews Virtual Reality Prosumer Reviews for 22 million Enthusiasts Forums SGCafe Search for: Home > News > NVIDIA Adding Netflix 4K Support to GeForce GTX 10 Series Cards NewsNvidia NVIDIA Adding Netflix 4K Support to GeForce GTX 10 Series Cards Babu Mohan May 1, 2017094 Late last year, Netflix finally introduced the option of streaming content in 4K resolution on the PC. However, it was restricted to PCs powered by the 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake CPU, mainly due to the processor family supporting 10-bit HEVC hardware decoding as well as stringent DRM requirements from content creators. Now however, more PCs will be able to access Netflix in 4K thanks to NVIDIA adding support for it. To enable Netflix 4K playback, the following requirements will need to be met: NVIDIA Driver version exclusively provided via Microsoft Windows Insider Program (currently 381.74). NVIDIA Pascal based GPU, GeForce GTX 1050 or greater with minimum 3GB memory HDCP 2.2 capable monitor(s). Please see the additional section below if you are using multiple monitors and/or multiple GPUs. Microsoft Edge browser or Netflix app from the Windows Store 25Mbps (or faster) internet connection. Single or multi GPU multi monitor configuration In case of a multi monitor configuration on a single GPU or multiple GPUs where GPUs are not linked together in SLI/LDA mode, 4K UHD streaming will happen only if all the active monitors are HDCP2.2 capable. If any of the active monitors is not HDCP2.2 capable, the quality will be downgraded to FHD. Below is a sample table for the case of 2 monitors: Another thing to note is that 4K UHD streaming is not supported for SLI/LDA configurations. You will be able to stream Netflix in UHD streaming only when the GPUs are not linked together in SLI/LDA mode. With the addition of 4K Netflix support on GeForce GTX 10 series cards, NVIDIA has definitely made its latest lineup more desirable to multimedia enthusiasts than AMD’s Radeon RX 500 series.

The biggest threat is to the Israeli high-tech sector where the lure of a super-low 15 percent tax rate that Trump proposed last Wednesday could prove irresistible to many startups, said Sharon Schulman, a managing partner in the tax practice at Ernst & Young Israel. “At a rate of 15 percent, we would definitely see a return of the phenomenon of ‘Israeli’ technology companies whose major market is the United States incorporating when they are first formed as American companies — something that without a doubt is a clear risk to the Israeli economy in the long run,” he said. Yaniv Erlich, who heads the tax department at the Tel Aviv law firm Gross, Kleinhendler, Hodak, Halevy, Greenberg & Company, said for existing companies – tech and non-tech – enjoying the benefits of Trump’s proposed taxes would involve sacrifices because it would mean moving management and control of the company to the United States, including relocating the CEO. Many Israeli startups, in fact, do that but the trend would grow and expand to companies that have no other reason to relocate to the U.S. except for the tax advantages. Moreover, Israeli startup entrepreneurs are likely to face pressure from their American investors to relocate. Executives of Intel, Mobileye and BMW examine a BMWi vehicle. Deals like Intel's recent acquisition of Mobileye may become far less attractive under Trump's new tax breaks.

Close “American investors have an interest in the company being American and that the entrepreneur behind it be nearby,” said Monte Silver, an attorney with Eitan, Mehulal & Sadot in Herzliya. “Now it will be easier for them to insist on it.” The Trump tax cut, if it happens, could also deter U.S. companies from buying Israeli tech companies, like Intel’s $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye last month. One of the reasons the White House wants to lower taxes is to coax U.S. companies to repatriate some $2.6 trillion in profits they’ve kept overseas to avoid paying the steep U.S. tax rate, which is today 35 percent — and, adding in state and other taxes, can run as high as 40 percent. In a lot of cases, U.S. multinationals have used those trapped profits to buy Israeli startups, which enables them to use the money productively without it ever returning to the U.S. “If the [Trump] reform is approved it will mean fewer financial resources outside the U.S. That in turn will mean less interest is buying Israeli companies and greater interest in buying American companies,” explained Eldar Ben-Ruby, an attorney at Meitar Liquornik Geva Leshem Tal in Ramat Gan. The Trump plan, of which only the barest outlines have been released, would turn the U.S. corporate tax rate from among the highest in countries belonging to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to among the lowest. Although the tax cut is controversial — not the least because it comes hand in hand with other changes that have been widely faulted for benefitting the wealthiest — the president says the corporate tax cut will encourage companies to invest in the U.S. and create more jobs. With those same considerations in mind, Kahlon has also been working on a plan to reduce Israel’s corporate tax rate for high-tech companies, including foreign multinationals. The baseline Israeli rate has been going down, with the latest reduction from 25 to 24 percent this year and 23 percent in 2018. The Law for Encouraging Capital Investment entitles high-tech companies to pay reduced tax rates of 16 percent if they are based in the center of the country and only 9 percent if they are in the periphery. Low Israeli corporate rates have encouraged Israeli companies with operations in the U.S. to book as much income as possible in Israel rather than the U.S. but Trump threatens to change that calculation. “Now, Israeli companies will need to examine their entire tax strategy and Israel will have to think about its tax law as well,” warned Amir Chenchinski, a tax expert at Ernst & Young Israel. In an effort to lure more high-tech companies to Israel and keep those already here, Kahlon is aiming to lower Israel’s rate for tech companies to between 6 and 12 percent, with the lowest rate for big companies developing intellectual property in Israel and registering it here. But, E&Y’s Schulman said Trump now creates a dilemma for the finance minister. “Trump’s tax reforms put Israel in a trap,” he said. “On the one hand, he [Kahlon] can’t leave the corporate tax rate at 24 percent if the U.S. rate is going down to 15 percent. Also, rates for tech companies will have to go below 12 percent is he is going to preserve Israel’s competitiveness. On the other hand, that creates a risk of debt repayments and bigger budget deficits.” Efrat Neuman Haaretz Contributor Efrat Neuman Send me email alerts for new articles by Efrat Neuman Send Close Email * Please enter your email Efrat Neuman For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

Supplier TI Computers www.ticomputers.com.au Price $2195 AUD > Pricing info Specs AMD Ryzen 7 1700X @3.75GHz • Asus Geforce GTX 1070 • Asus Prime B350-Plus • Cooler Master Hyper 212 Turbo cooler • 16GB 2400MHz DDR4 Kingston HyperX RAM • 256GB Intel 600P SSD • 2TB Seagate HDD • Cooler Master MasterBox5 case • Fractal Design Integra M 650W PSU • 22x Asus DVDRW burner Tweet Email this Print this Feedback For when gaming and work are equal priorities. This PC comes from TI Computers and like its system from last month, also comes pre-overclocked out of the box. The system is housed in a Cooler Master MasterBox5 chassis which has plenty of room inside for everything, even a 240mm radiator up front if desired. Two thirds of the front grill lifts off easily for cleaning as it acts as a filter for the included 120mm fan. The front IO panel has everything you’d expect including dual USB 3.0 ports. Up top it has a large vent suitable for up to a 140mm fan. Underneath there’s the removable dust filter for the PSU, and around the back the 120mm exhaust fan accompanies 2x USB 2.0 ports, 4x USB 3.0 ports, 2x USB 3.1 gen2 ports, a PS/2 port, DVI-D, VGA, HDMI (for future Ryzen APU support) and three audio jacks all on the motherboard. With the graphics card providing a further 2x Display Ports, 2x HDMI ports and another DVI-D port. Looking inside the see-through side panel while it’s on you won’t see any RGB LEDs here, however the fans attached to the heatsink do have red LEDs at each corner providing some illumination. The 2TB hard drive sits in a cage at the lower front of the case, an optical drive up top and a modular 650W PSU in the lower rear. All the cabling is well-routed behind the motherboard tray with no excess cabling visible - very well put together. The speedy Intel 600P series 256GB NVME SSD drive is slotted in between the HSF and the stock clocked GTX 1070. Looking closer, the HSF is in a push-pull configuration with the exhaust aimed straight up out the top 170mm vent. With the 120mm fan exhausting out the rear you could almost argue there’s three fans cooling this CPU. Speaking of which, this Ryzen 7 1700X’s base clock is normally 3.4GHz with a boost clock of 3.8GHz. This system came pre-overclocked at 3.75GHz @ 1.35v, slower than the CPU’s own boost speed. This got us wondering, what if we ran a test with the CPU at stock clocks, where boost and even XFR can kick in by themselves, and compare it to TI Computers’ OC at a fixed 3.75GHz. When running PCMark8’s Home Conventional test with AMD defaults we saw core frequencies spike to 3.9GHz (thanks XFR!) so we’re confident that the default clocks would win out. Scoring 4201 we then retested with TI Computers overclock. Despite the lower max speed the pre-made overclock won out scoring 4367. Obviously the CPU is downclocking more often than it is boosting, so the shop OC -  despite initial appearances - is better than stock. Attempting to tune the overclock further ourselves, we managed to only raise it a little higher stably to 3.95GHz @ 1.4125v. For fun, we even disabled six of the eight cores and managed to go all the way to 4.25GHz with a silly 1.55v. With the CPU reporting near 110°C at just 3.95GHz (which is likely 90°C -- see this issue’s Chip News section) with all cores enabled and anything higher causing an immediate crash we suspect the HSF cooler is inadequate for what this chip is actually capable of. For those who like to tinker, an all-in-one liquid cooler would’ve been preferred. Benchmark results for 3DMark were quite good. Time Spy (DX12) gave us 6219 and Cloud Gate (DX11) reported 38894. When we tried them again with the CPU at our custom 3.95GHz speed and with the GPU at maximum overclock (which allowed it to go above 2GHz core speeds) Time Spy gave us 6413, Cloud Gate 40394 and PCMark8 4391, just a 4% increase. It appears TI Computers has wrung just about all it sensibly can from this system which is good to see. Putting this into perspective, the 7700K system we reviewed last month (which is basically the same in every way expect CPU) came pre-overclocked at a massive 4.8GHz, giving Time Spy, Cloud Gate and PCMark8 scores of 6169, 37068 and 4825 respectively. With PCMark8 favouring single threaded performance this Ryzen system falls behind, but in the 3DMark tests - where a bit of multi-threading is included - Ryzen pulls ahead. And we didn’t even get around to testing things that would properly stress an eight core CPU. And that’s the rub. This system doesn’t and never will have the fastest CPU for single or lightly threaded programs and games, but as soon as you want to throw some multi-threaded tasks like Twitch streaming, video editing or file compression at it, this system suddenly becomes a no brainer. Your workload simply needs to be able to make good use of it. A great PC for people who both work and game on the same system.

Reuters/Brian Snyder It’s high time for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to be released. The predecessor, Surface Pro 4 was introduced in October 2015. Surface sales have been down for some time. Microsoft has blamed lower Surface Pro sales for this. Thus, it is evident that the company desperately needs a Surface Pro. Microsoft has revealed a 26 percent drop in Surface revenue for the quarter ending March 31. There could be various reasons for the drop. The company’s new Surface Book with Surface Studio and Performance Base, and its latest devices in its family of computers are very expensive and cost a couple of thousand dollars. The devices have been designed primarily for hardcore professionals and those who are willing to spend a lot for a computer. They are definitely not for the everyday user. Fans and consumers were very eager to lay their hands on the Surface Pro hybrid, as they found it really appealing. However, price became an issue and many couldn’t afford it. Microsoft has blamed slower Surface sales on lower than expected Surface Pro unit volume. Moreover, the last update was in October 2015. Those who are interested in it are now choosing products from rival companies such as Samsung, Dell and HP. These companies are selling lighter and thinner tablets with more upgraded hardware. Intel’s seventh generation processor is yet to find a place in any of the Surface Pro devices. On the other hand, most top manufacturers are already using the chip. The Redmond tech giant needs to update the Surface Pro with the latest generation Intel chipset, writes CNBC. The company is hosting an event on May 2, where it will talk hardware. However, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 has not been mentioned, and may even give the event a miss. Meanwhile, the company is sure to unveil the Windows 10 Cloud platform and a cheaper Surface variant to rival Google’s Chromebooks. Experts believe, Microsoft should have unveiled the Surface Pro 5 too, so as to win back consumers’ attention on the line. But one thing is also clear; Microsoft is looking to increase the adoption of its cloud services via the use of low-cost hardware. The new Surface CloudBook that the company is about to unveil has also garnered quite a lot of attention. It will be interesting to see how this new device fares against the Google Chromebooks. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Surface Pro 5 and other such devices.

Tonight’s Madam Secretary Recap begins now – Refresh Page often to get the most current updates! The president meets with his council and they make a plan on how to deal with Georgie and the arms dealing. They will attempt peaceful ways but will take him out if they have to. Elizabeth and Jay meet and review the Intel they have on Georgia. Jay heads to France to gather more information on the arms dealer. Henry offers his theory to the CIA and they focus their resources in Jerusalem. Jay is kidnapped in France. Elizabeth and Nadine prepare for a speech and Jay calls to let her know he has been taken by Dido. She has until the end of the business day to unfreeze his accounts if he wants to see Jay again. Elizabeth meets with her team to come up with a plan and then goes to meet with the president. The United States will not negotiate with terrorists. Henry asks Jason’s math teacher about the $127 calculator he needs. She says he must have read the notice wrong. It only costs $27. Elizabeth asks around about Dito and finds out her can’t be trusted. Elizabeth’s team refuses to leave the white house. They all want to do whatever they can to help Jay. Henry calls Elizabeth and they discuss the calculator. Jason is lying to get $100 from them. Elizabeth encourages Henry to get the goods on Jason. She asks Henry if the Jay situation is her fault. She has to get him home safe. Henry confronts Jason about the calculator and he admits there is a boy in his class who is a prince and is trying to romance his girlfriend. He wanted to use the money to impress her. Nadine offers Jay’s wife Abby comfort and promises they will get Jay home safely. The military surrounded the house where Jay is being held but Elizabeth asks for my time before they go in. She doesn’t think he is the arms dealer. The president gives her 48 hours. Dito calls Elizabeth and the president gives her permission to offer him his freedom and they will return his money if he releases Jay. They have no evidence he is involved in arms dealing. Dito releases Jay unharmed. Henry encourages Jason to reach out to his girlfriend. The team starts over in trying to figure out who is behind the arms dealing. Abby and Jay reunite and she is so happy that he is OK. Someone breaks into Dito’s hotel and opens fire. He is killed but the US had nothing to do with it. Elizabeth meets with Darryl and tells him her team has been tracking stolen American arms and have found that Paul Crane is somehow involved. He was interviewed and told them he has been working with Darryl. He is arrested. All the pieces come together and the story makes sense. The arms dealing case is solved. However, Henry and the CIA realize they are correct and the terrorists are heading to Jerusalem. Jason and his girlfriend make up.

Then we will be working on interoperability and standards between ledgers. It reminds me of the old discussions of standards. ‘Sure, we got standards. Which one do you want?’” The original blockchain was created to track the movement of bitcoin, a digital currency, without the need to trust a centralized third party. The basic concept – a set of shared data that multiple connected parties agree on as valid – has been enthusiastically embraced by the financial services industry. Many bankers and technologists say it will help them handle things like securities trades, payments and contracts in a faster, simpler, more efficient and cheaper way than they do today. But agreement as to exactly what that distributed ledger should look like does not yet exist. Need to know A diagram of Quorum, the smart contract platform JPMorgan is building. According to the white paper, the design aims to "prevent all except those party to the transaction from seeing sensitive data." Github Several models have attracted adherents: the IBM-led Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project, which is building a blockchain built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric, has 122 members, including Wells Fargo, BBVA, JPMorgan Chase, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and American Express. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which is building a blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, has more than 30 financial services and technology members including JPMorgan Chase and Intel. R3, which is creating a “blockchain-inspired” distributed ledger called Corda, has 84 members, including Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street, and UBS. JPMorgan’s departure from R3 follows on the heels of defections last year by Goldman Sachs, Banco Santander, Morgan Stanley and National Australian Bank. The banks’ reasons for leaving varied. While still a member of the Hyperledger and Ethereum consortia, JPMorgan is also going it alone with a distributed ledger it’s building in-house called Quorum. Quorum is based on the Go Ethereum client, a software program that supports the Ethereum network. In a white paper, the bank outlines how its blockchain will handle data and contract privacy and consensus mechanisms (the process by which different computers agree on the order and legitimacy of transactions on the network). The bank’s decision to use Ethereum was at odds with R3’s decision not to use that system. “Ethereum was a platform we looked at and decided was not fit for purpose,” said Charley Cooper, managing director of R3. Objections among the membership included issues around privacy controls, scalability, immutability of transactions, and consensus mechanisms for validating transactions, Cooper said. R3 originally hoped to use an existing blockchain model like Ethereum, he explained. “When we first launched the company, we were in an ‘adapt or build’ mentality,” Cooper said. “Our thinking was, it would be easier if there was solution fit for purpose, if something out there was close we could adapt it to our needs, but meanwhile we’re going to build something in parallel, a platform fit for purpose for financial services. Ethereum was not deemed by R3’s experts and our members to be appropriate for the financial services industry.” By press time, JPMorgan had not responded to a request for an interview. Other banks have left R3 because they balked at the money it wanted them to pay to help fund the development of Corda, industry sources said. Last May, the group reportedly sought to raise $200 million from members (it later was said to cut the target to $150 million). “That was not the direction expected when these firms were already paying substantial amounts just to be a member of the consortia,” Skinner said. (Dues are in the six figures, according to market sources and published reports.) “It was this, in my view, that caused some of the founders to question where R3 were going.” Yet R3 is still in a strong position, he noted, with many banks still involved in Corda.

PTM dynamically tracks transactional updates to cache lines to ensure the ACI (atomicity, consistency and isolation) properties during cache flushes and leverages an undo log in NVM to ensure PTM can always consistently recover transactional data structures from a machine crash. This paper describes the PTM design based on Intel’s restricted transactional memory.

Earlier this month, Apple was granted a permit to test a self-driving car all around California. A few weeks after that, a supposed Apple self-driving test vehicle was spotted by local pedestrians. Now, new reports suggest that Samsung is also jumping onto the self-driving bandwagon, so to speak. According to The Korea Herald, the government of South Korea has granted Samsung the permit to test its self-driving car on public roads. This is the first time that Samsung has been reported with regards to autonomous vehicles. The report also mentioned that Samsung will be focusing much of its efforts on the development of sensors for self-driving cars. Furthermore, the company will also dig deeper into machine learning or artificial intelligence. It aims to produce sensors and computer modules that feature deep-learning. These systems will also be used on rough terrains and more challenging road conditions. Uber’s self-driving car (via businessinsider.com) Apart from these information, nothing much is said about the supposed self-driving car from Samsung. Also, it is uncertain if the said technology will make its way into the mass market especially outside of South Korea. For now, all that can be said is that Samsung, much like Apple, is diversifying its portfolio by investing in self-driving cars. Perhaps, the company has seen the financial benefits of specializing in systems pertaining to vehicle autonomy. Unfortunately, the report did not mention any timeframe as to when Samsung is planning on doing the actual tests. Nevertheless, this will be a new avenue for Samsung to explore and become a main player of. To date, South Korea’s Land Ministry has issued a total of 20 permits for tests of self-driving cars in the country. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 2 May 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Mini PCs: why waste space on a full-size desktop? Mini PCs like Acer's Revo Build are getting ever closer in processing power to their larger counterparts. — dpa It doesn't always have to be a large tower to get the job done: Mini PCs little bigger than a juice pack can easily replace full-sized desktop computers for anyone looking to save space. These compact PCs, also known as nettops, are available even in office variants with Intel's latest Core-i desktop processors, the so-called Kaby Lake generation. However, these computers operate with reduced clock speed to maintain the balance between performance, waste heat and noise. As a result, these devices are best when dealing just with office tasks, technology magazine c't said in a test of the devices. Those who run them with full-load tasks are likely to experience a loud fan as the cooling system reaches its limits. Buyers should pay attention to the quality of the built-in flash memory, which are typically far faster than traditional hard drives. In the c't test, however, models with a slow write rate only reached the level of conventional hard disks. —  dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested Why it could pay to use your phone as a credit card Smart home assistants need assistance to catch on Dating portals often aren’t as cheap as they seem Samsung Gear VR: Virtually controlled fun VR headsets can hurt your eyes if they have the wrong pupil distance CIMB, Maybank offer zero interest housing loans for low income staff Others Also Read Putting their best foot forward Detained senator says 'old man' Duterte has 'EQ of a six-year-old' Liverpool's Coutinho hopeful of quick return after leg injury advertisement Latest News Google gets Australian tax office demand to pay more, says to fight it UK lawmakers criticise social media over response to extremist content Tencent steps up AI push with research lab in Seattle Tesla must complete brake fix to regain top safety rating US spy agency abandons controversial surveillance technique Most Viewed in Tech Italian police say Amazon has evaded €130mil of taxes US spy agency abandons controversial surveillance technique What to expect from Microsoft's May 2 event Nintendo revamps 3DS with new 2DS XL Airbnb, San Francisco settle lawsuit over short-term rental law Trump signs executive order to modernise US government info tech Anonymous app Yik Yak shuts down What to watch out for when buying a USB stick Tesla must complete brake fix to regain top safety rating Why it could pay to use your phone as a credit card Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is up more than 250% over the past 12 months, so the market clearly has been expecting big things from the chipmaker — the kind of success that it hasn’t created in years. They should. While AMD stock still has a valuation problem, even a quick look at its recently unveiled products make it clear that this isn’t the Advanced Micro of yesteryear. Source: Shutterstock On the other hand, at some point in time, the technology giant has to start turning its new inventions into fiscal results. But it hasn’t — at least it didn’t during its Q1 earnings release out Monday night. Although a couple of its newly designed technologies — the Vega GPU and the Naples server CPU — haven’t yet gotten a chance to contribute to the top and bottom line, its new Ryzen CPU hit the market during its recently-completed first quarter. While AMD should be showing signs of new life by now, it’s not. Monday’s Q1 numbers, which included a deeper-than-expected loss, stifled the rally in AMD stock in a fairly decisive fashion. The earnings miss sent shares more than 7% lower. Advanced Micro Devices Q1 Earnings For the quarter ending in March, Advanced Micro Devices reported a loss of 8 cents per share on sales of $984 million. That compares to a loss of 12 cents per share and revenue of $832 million for the same quarter of 2016. Analysts were expecting a loss of 4 cents per share of AMD stock and a top line of $984.4 million, so that’s a miss on both fronts. Operating expenses were about the same. President and CEO Dr. Lisa Su commented: “We achieved 18 percent year-over-year revenue growth driven by strong demand for our high performance Ryzen CPUs as well as graphics processors. We are positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities across the business in the year ahead as we bring innovation, performance, and choice to an expanding set of markets.” It was, for most intents and purposes, a disappointing quarter for a company. In its defense, it’s tough to handicap simply because turnaround stories are generally uneven. On the flipside, the earnings game is one of expectations, and falling short of them can be brutal. The company didn’t offer details about Ryzen sales during the quarter, but the Computing and Graphics’ segment’s sales were up 28% to $593 million last quarter. The new central processing unit from Advanced Micro Devices was largely intended as a means of winning back some of the CPU market share lost to rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Though the hardware was met with mixed reviews and the company has confirmed that the CPU is causing some PCs to lock up, that’s largely a reflection of a PC industry that wasn’t quite ready for such a big, and somewhat unexpected, from AMD. The initial stumbles can be fixed through software patches and updates. Still, the snafus look bad to casual and corporate users that don’t realize a CPU isn’t exactly a plug-n-play device. Looking Ahead for AMD Stock Prior to the Q1 report, analysts were looking for the company to turn $1.12 billion worth of revenue into a loss of a penny per share for the quarter currently underway. Although still a loss, that loss would still mark an improvement on the loss of 5 cents per share of AMD stock booked in the comparable quarter a year earlier. That top line would also be 9.3% stronger than the Q2-2016 top line of $1.03 billion. For the full year, analysts were expecting Advanced Micro Devices to swing from a loss of 14 cents per share to a profit of 8 cents per share, with sales to ramp up from $4.27 billion to $4.74 billion.

(NASDAQ: AMD) is scheduled to release its most recent quarterly results after the markets close on Monday. Over the past quarter the stock has seen a steady rise, with shares up nearly 20% from the beginning of the year. However, even before this, shares made a meteoric rise since 2015, rising roughly 1,000% in this time. Despite the gains that this stock has made, analysts can’t seem to make their minds up on where shares are going to run from here. Looking ahead to the earnings report, the best we can expect are consensus estimates that call for a net loss of $0.04 per share and $984.38 million in revenue. The first quarter of last year reportedly had a net loss of $0.12 per share and $832 million in revenue. As we said before, some analysts think this stock can run even higher, while others say that it has run enough. 24/7 Wall St. has taken a look at the bullish and bearish cases for the stock ahead of the earnings report. In a recent report, Goldman Sachs called for investors to sell the stock and take profits. Essentially, Goldman Sachs issued a Sell rating with an $11 price target earlier in April. The view is that AMD’s stock gains already reflect the improvements that may happen in its business and the high expectations for 2018. Also cited was an execution risk in issuing products and managing their costs. Despite a sharp improvement in AMD’s competitive and financial position, the firm noted that AMD’s enterprise value to sales was more than 200% over a five-year median. Another warning from Goldman Sachs in this Sell rating is that AMD’s stock should underperform the market after its May analyst day presentation is behind it. However, just as recently as March, other firms were setting street-high price targets for AMD. Canaccord Genuity issued a Buy rating for the stock with a $16.50 price target, up from $14.00. What drove the upgraded price target is that Canaccord Genuity had hosted a series of focused investor meetings with AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su over the previous three weeks. Canaccord Genuity sees AMD reemerging as a competitive second source to Intel across relevant x86 CPU markets from enterprise and gaming desktops, media-focused notebooks and certain server market segments. The firm also sees a gradual GPU unit share recovery in low market tiers and being able to deliver a multigenerational road map with customer backing and foundry partners. A total addressable market of $50-plus billion with modest growth assumptions and low market share levels may also be in the cards. Shares of AMD were trading up 1.6% at $13.51 on Monday, with a consensus analyst price target of $12.20 and a 52-week trading range of $3.45 to $13.56.

It now supports Khronos’ new graphics API Vulkan, which should provide a boost to mobile gaming; and the open-source web runtime Crosswalk, which should make for a smoother internet-browsing experience. Version 3.0 also adds support for 64-bit Intel and ARM CPUs; multiple users on a single device (take that iOS); and voice control via S Voice. Of course, not all of these features will be available on the Z4, but the handset will be the first to feel at least some of these benefits (Vulkan being the big one). I want one of these Z phones, but they are pretty much impossible to come by.

Revenue in AMD's business, which manufactures chips for the server industry and also gaming consoles, rose 5% to $391 million. However, that missed analysts' average estimate of $442.1 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. The miss overshadowed robust performance in the company's computing and graphics business, driven by demand for its latest Ryzen processors and its graphics chips. AMD also forecast second-quarter revenue to rise about 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. Analysts on average were expecting revenue to rise about 9% to $1.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Sunnyvale, California-based company's new Ryzen processors, aimed at the personal computer market, have helped rekindle its rivalry with Intel, which has long dominated the industry. AMD's graphics processors, used in gaming consoles including Playstation 4 and Xbox One, have also gained a foothold in the low- to mid-range market for PC chips that are used to power video games. Rival Nvidia has long controlled the high-end of the market. AMD's net loss narrowed to $73 million, or 8 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 1, from $109 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. For more about AMD, watch: Revenue rose 18.3% to $984 million. Excluding items, the company lost 4 cents per share. The results were in-line with analysts' estimates. AMD's shares (amd), which joined the broader S&P 500 index in March, had risen more than 20% this year through Monday's close, outperforming the 12% gain in the Philadelphia semiconductor index. The stock had risen more than four-fold last year. Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad AMD's revenue rises 18.3 pct, but margin forecast disappoints By Reuters Published: 16:56 EDT, 1 May 2017 | Updated: 19:36 EDT, 1 May 2017 e-mail May 1 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc reported an 18.3 percent jump in quarterly revenue, largely in line with analysts' estimates, but the chipmaker's second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. The company's shares, which had gained more than 20 percent this year, were down 10.2 percent at $12.23 in after-market trading on Monday. AMD said it expected adjusted gross margins to be about 33 percent in the current quarter, compared with 34 percent in the first quarter. "Semiconductor companies, and, particularly, one that's trying to turn around and become profitable, trades on gross margin and I think there's concern," Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. "I think that's the hang up - that these new products should be ramping production and they're not as profitable as the Street was expecting." AMD launched a few of its Ryzen range of desktop processors in the first quarter and plans to unveil its Naples chips targeting the server market in the second quarter. The Ryzen chips helped boost the company's revenue in the first quarter ended April 1. "All of the feedback that we've gotten so far from both our customers and from end-users has been very strong," Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said during an earnings call, responding to a question on the launch. However, total revenue was weighed down by its business that mainly supplies graphics cards used in gaming consoles such as the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4. Revenue in the business rose 5 percent to $391 million, but came in below analysts' average estimate of $442.1 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. AMD also forecast low double-digit percentage revenue growth for the full year. Revenue rose to $984 million in the first quarter, from $832 million a year earlier. AMD's net loss narrowed to $73 million, or 8 cents per share, from $109 million, or 14 cents per share. Excluding items, the company lost 4 cents per share, in line with analysts' average estimate. AMD's shares, which joined the broader S&amp;P 500 index in March, had risen more than four-fold last year.

Google and other household names encouraged the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enact the rules in 2015. But now with the regulations on the chopping block, those companies believe the change will have little effect on their bottom line and are trying not to get dragged in. They could face pressure, though, from consumer groups and net neutrality advocates, who see them as crucial allies to saving the rules. ADVERTISEMENT Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is moving to roll back the rules, which allowed his agency to regulate internet service providers like public utilities and forced broadband companies to treat all web traffic equally. His plan would hand oversight over to the Federal Trade Commission and allow companies to voluntarily promise to uphold net neutrality principles. Democrats, consumer groups and many groups representing internet companies quickly blasted his plan and are vowing to mobilize the public to save the rules. But many Silicon Valley giants, including Facebook and Twitter, which once backed the rules, are now publicly silent. Officials at several major tech companies said net neutrality isn't a priority anymore. Many of the companies that were once forceful advocates of the rules no longer think they will be harmed under repeal. Facebook, Google and Microsoft boast market valuations in the hundreds of billions, giving them new power relative to broadband providers. Consumer groups and smaller internet companies worry that if net neutrality goes, broadband providers could offer faster internet speeds to companies that pay up and slow down those do not. Such an environment could favor established companies with deep pockets, making it easier for Google and Facebook to reach customers over upstarts. Facebook is already pushing for so-called zero-rating, or data-free plans, for its app. Those plans let customers access certain apps or sites without counting against their data plans. The plans are expected to multiply if net neutrality goes. Critics worry free data plans help larger players who can cut deals with broadband providers to favor their apps and make it harder for rival content providers to break through. For many, Netflix, which now has a market cap of $67 billion, highlights the quiet shift on net neutrality among big internet companies. It was once a vocal advocate for the rules. In 2014, Netflix vowed to mobilize its customers against broadband providers after a court struck down an earlier version of the FCC's rules. “Were this draconian scenario to unfold with some [internet service provider]," Netflix wrote in a shareholder letter to investors, "we would vigorously protest and encourage our members to demand the open internet they are paying their ISP to deliver." That same year, the company tore into an FCC net neutrality plan that would have allowed broadband providers to create fast lanes for companies willing to pay more money to guarantee faster speeds to their content. "No rules would be better than rules legalizing discrimination on the internet," Netflix wrote in a comment on the rules. Today, while Netflix still officially backs net neutrality, it doesn't think repeal will hurt its business. "Weakening of US net neutrality laws, should that occur, is unlikely to materially affect our domestic margins or service quality because we are now popular enough with consumers to keep our relationships with ISPs stable," Netflix wrote in a letter to shareholders earlier in the year. Google in 2014 also spoke strongly in favor of net neutrality. “No Internet access provider should block or degrade Internet traffic, nor should they sell ‘fast lanes’ that prioritize some Internet services over others,” the company said at the time. This year, Google has been mostly silent on the issue publicly. A trade group, the Internet Association, has been more active than many of its members, such as are Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and Google. The association has met privately with Pai and also publicly urged him to keep the rules. The companies are quietly watching and cautiously trying to influence the debate, though. Lobbying disclosure reports from the first fiscal quarter of 2017 revealed that Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft have all spent money to lobby on net neutrality. Executives from Facebook, Cisco, Oracle and Intel, among others, have also spoken with Pai on net neutrality. One tech expert said it is still early in the fight, and many companies may be biding their time. “[The FCC] just made the announcement,” said Doug Brake, policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank. “As a legal and policy matter it’s all pretty delicate," he added. "To be able to choose their words carefully and navigate the PR process is not easy, so why not wait?” But the repeal push is moving quickly. If Pai’s proposal is approved for consideration at the FCC’s open meeting in May, the agency will begin seeking public comments on rolling back net neutrality. Four million people filed comments in support when the FCC began the process of enacting the rules. And net neutrality's defenders are vowing a similar all-out public blitz. Advocacy groups publicly say they are hopeful major internet companies will eventually speak out to help save the rules. But privately they admit fears that tech won’t step up to bat as in the past. A senior staffer at one advocacy group said they are divided over whether to even try pressuring tech firms to help save net neutrality. “Whether or not to pursue the companies is a question currently being hotly debated by pro net neutrality activists. The problem is that the big tech companies are fickle champions,” the staffer said. “Sure, Google or Facebook may not have made it big without net neutrality, but now they are big.” Some say they should target smaller web companies, those they believe would be most likely hurt if net neutrality is scrapped. “This is not about Netflix vs. Comcast," said the staffer.   View the discussion thread.

Rahmani , University of Turku Pasi Liljeberg , University of Turku ABSTRACT The Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging with the pace of technology evolution, connecting people and things through the Internet. IoT devices enable large-scale data collection and sharing for a wide range of applications. However, it is challenging to securely manage interconnected IoT devices because the collected data could contain sensitive personal information. The authors believe that attribute-based encryption (ABE) could be an effective cryptographic tool for secure management of IoT devices. However, little research has addressed ABE's actual feasibility in the IoT thus far. This article investigates such feasibility considering well-known IoT platforms--specifically, Intel Galileo Gen 2, Intel Edison, Raspberry Pi 1 Model B, and Raspberry Pi Zero. A thorough evaluation confirms that adopting ABE in the IoT is indeed feasible.

In spite of this limitation, we present a new algorithm and its shared-memory parallelization that achieves good performance and scalability in computing maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs. Our algorithm searches for augmenting paths via specialized breadth-first searches (BFS) from multiple source vertices, hence creating more parallelism than single source algorithms. Algorithms that employ multiple-source searches cannot discard a search tree once no augmenting path is discovered from the tree, unlike algorithms that rely on single-source searches. We describe a novel tree-grafting method that eliminates most of the redundant edge traversals resulting from this property of multiple-source searches. We also employ the recent direction-optimizing BFS algorithm as a subroutine to discover augmenting paths faster. Our algorithm compares favorably with the current best algorithms in terms of the number of edges traversed, the average augmenting path length, and the number of iterations. We provide a proof of correctness for our algorithm. Our NUMA-aware implementation is scalable to 80 threads of an Intel multiprocessor and to 240 threads on an Intel Knights Corner coprocessor. On average, our parallel algorithm runs an order of magnitude faster than the fastest algorithms available. The performance improvement is more significant on graphs with small matching number.

Such variability makes experimental results prone to misinterpretations or misguided claims. To deal with such variability, statistical inference methods are usually used to summarize the experimental results with certain confidence levels by running the experiments or measurements a large number of times. However, such statistical results are often too vague or too simplistic. They are not sufficient to help users understand the causes of such variability, and allow more in-depth analysis on the results or reproduce the results for validation during design space exploration. To allow better analyzability and reproducibility, we propose a framework to tackle such variability, called VarCatcher. The key to VarCatcher is to characterize a parallel execution using Parallel Characteristics Vector (PCV). A clustering-based approach is then used to group runs with similar execution characteristics that can later be used to analyze results in-depth, to customize different evaluation strategies, reproduce the result for variability, to determine the impact of features, or to assist performance diagnosis. We have built a prototype of VarCatcher that includes a user-level toolset for runtime monitoring and measurements using the Intel Processor Trace feature on commodity Intel processors as well as an architecture extension with very low runtime overheads (around 3 and 0.01 percent accordingly). Several case studies confirm that VarCatcher enables several appealing features such as in-depth result analysis, customized evaluation strategies, and reproducibility.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Leaked 3DMark score hints at AMD RX Vega… Leaked 3DMark score hints at AMD RX Vega performance, and it rivals the GTX 1070 By Jon Martindale — May 1, 2017 4:09 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you AMD's Vega graphics cards could well offer solid competition for Nvidia's top end, though maybe not at the bleeding edge. AMD’s long-expected, high-end graphics card solution, Vega, may turn out to be pretty capable, though not as powerful as Nvidia’s top-tier offerings. A new leak of 3Dmark results which seem to come from an RX Vega card, suggests it could be roughly as powerful as a GTX 1070. It’s been a long time since AMD truly rivaled Nvidia at the top end of the graphics card power spectrum, often preferring to offer competition at the midrange and entry-level. However, rumors over the past six months suggested that Vega could well do more than that and though these leaked results don’t make it a world beater, offering real competition for the GTX 1070 would still be quite a feat. The 3Dmark result pairs a “Generic VGA” card with an AMD Ryzen 7 1800X. That card, however, has the Vega device ID (687F:C1), which is what tipped off Guru3D to its true identity. The card achieved an overall score of 5,950 and a graphics score of 5,721 in the TimeSpy demo. That’s comparable to the GTX 1070 test results Guru3D achieved in its own internal testing. If the card is indeed an AMD Vega graphics processor (GPU), it’s not necessarily the world beater some expected. However, it comes with 8GB of (most likely) HBM2 memory and a clock speed of just 1,200MHz, which suggests there could be a lot more headroom. It could be that this isn’t a top-of-the-line Vega graphics card and AMD could have something else up its sleeve for the top end too. The driver used in this test are beta, too, so post-release drivers with optimizations could also yield higher scores. At the very least though, third party options with more impressive cooling and an aggressive overclock should make a card like this a viable contender for GTX 1080 performance. It’s also fair to assume that an Intel CPU could lead to an improvement in overall performance, though that wouldn’t do much to the graphics test score. Much of this is speculation for now. It could turn out that GTX 1070-level performance is the best we can hope for Vega, or this could be a test card that doesn’t perform as well as the final product. In either case, the market at the GTX 1080 and beyond level is very small, and not something that offers much financial incentive to AMD, even though the moral victory of having the most powerful cards in the world can do a lot for a manufacturer’s image.

The gain was attributed to strong replacement demand for commercial laptops and Apple Inc’s MacBooks, MIC researcher Jessica Hsu (許桂芬) said. Global laptop sales are expected to reach 154 million units this year as the pace of a decline in demand slows, Hsu said. Companies have launched new models with improved biometric security features, such as infrared camera-enabled facial recognition, encryption for payment services such as PayPal and longer battery lives, Hsu said. Laptop designs are also trending toward thinner display bezels, and more portable and lightweight designs are aimed at attracting upgrade purchases, Hsu said, adding that this year’s gaming laptop models also have new processors and displays. Companies will take lower-priced models off the market as rising DRAM prices and a shortage of solid-state drives adds to production costs, Hsu said, adding that a shortage of display panels has been mitigated by rising production capacity in China. A rise in sales of higher-margin business and gaming laptops is expected to slow the pace of falling average retail prices of laptops this year, Hsu said. The institute gave a dim outlook for motherboards, saying that a new generation of processors would not catalyze demand. Motherboard shipments in the first quarter fell 6.7 percent sequentially to 26 million units, MIC data showed. While the launch of new central processing units is no longer a major sales driver, AMD Inc’s Ryzen has seen a warmer market reception since its debut at the beginning of the year than Intel Corp’s Kraby Lake, the institute said. However, AMD’s smaller market share would bring limited gains to global motherboard shipments this year, it said. The institute said that as the global market for motherboards contracts, companies have voiced a willingness to refrain from capturing market share on lower pricing and instead focus on higher-margin segments, such as gaming, as well as branching out to other businesses. As the market continues to contract, motherboard makers seeking to transition to higher-margin product lines would face balancing market share and maintaining profitability challenging, while second-tier companies are likely to see diminished bargaining power with their suppliers, the institute said.

GNU Linux-Libre 4.11 Kernel Released Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 1 May 2017 at 12:22 PM EDT. 7 Comments Freshly derived from the Linux 4.11 kernel release less than 24 hours ago, GNU Linux-libre 4.11 is available with additional "deblogging" to make the kernel more free software friendly. A lot more work was needed this cycle to free or remove drivers otherwise relying upon proprietary microcode. A larger than usual number of new drivers required deblobbing: Cavium Crypto accelerator, Rockchip gpu, Netronome NFP 4000/6000 ethernet and Silead touchscreen drivers. In order to catch future blobs, I've added .out and .nffw to the list of extensions regarded as suspected blobs, which brought about a few false positives that had to be checked and recognized as such. Besides some movement in the source tree that required adjustments to the Qualcomm peripheral blob loader, and some blob names in the Chips&Media Coda media codecs that now have a directory component, deblobbing maintenance was required in the following usual suspects: AMD and Intel gpu, Atheros ath10k and wil6210 WiFi, Intel iwlwifi, and Intel Skylake audio drivers. This release also required recognizing a lot of new false positives, especially in new or format-changed firmware-loading documentation. More details on GNU Linux-libre 4.11 via the project's site hosted at FSFLA.org. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Apple's Pre-Earnings Rally Accelerates Dow Under Pressure Despite Apple Boost; Tesla, Netflix At Record Highs (Investor's Business Daily) Related INTC 20 Biggest Mid-Day Losers For Friday A Quick Take On Big Tech's Q1 Results Stock Futures Up: Can These 2 Tech Leaders Restart Chips? (Investor's Business Daily) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s not-so-quiet dispute with QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) has created an uncertain outlook for Qualcomm, and even Wall Street's top analysts aren't sure when or if the conflict will be resolved. UBS UBS's Stephen Chin maintains a Neutral rating on Qualcomm's stock with an unchanged $58 price target Friday. The analyst is not sure how or when the conflict will be resolved, but in the meantime, Qualcomm cautioned it will recognize zero license sales for Apple's contract manufacturers in the June-ending quarter. Chin noted, not even two weeks ago, Qualcomm expected to collect at least some royalties from Apple. The analyst added, Qualcomm won't see $500 million in quarterly sales from Apple, $420 million of which is attributed to the iPhone and $80 million from cellular-equipped iPads. However, sales of Qualcomm's modem chip to Apple are expected to continue as normal, and the analyst has doubts an alternative supplier such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) even has enough capacity to meet the expected iPhone demand for the bottom half of 2017. BMO Capital Markets BMO Capital Markets' Tim Long maintains a Market Perform rating and $54 price target on Qualcomm's stock last week following the "surprising" developments given a long-term relationship between the company and Apple. According to Long, Qualcomm's announcement of zero revenue from Apple-related royalties justifies an earnings per share revision. The analyst moved his 2017 earnings per share estimate from $4.75 to $4.14 per share while 2018's was moved lower from $4.75 per share to $3.23 per share. Long emphasized Qualcomm's stock is expected to be stuck in a tight range so long as the conflict with Apple continues. Outside of the conflict, the analyst sees multiple negative catalysts for the legacy business and management is "too optimistic" about the overall industry growth.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Install Facebook Lite and Messenger Lite on Android in Any Country By Michael Crider on May 1st, 2017 The standard Facebook app for Android—how can I put this delicately?—sucks. Not only is it probably draining more battery from your phone than most of your other apps, Facebook has gutted the messenger functionality from it in order to push a separate app and platform. There are alternatives to the official app, but most of them can’t also send user-to-user messages. Luckily, there’s an official solution that’s both efficient and effective: the Facebook Lite app. What Is Facebook Lite? Facebook created the Lite version of its Android app specifically for developing countries and other places where robust mobile Internet isn’t always available. It’s designed to offer access to all the basic functions of the site, including person-to-person messages, while using the smallest amount of bandwidth possible. The app is also designed to target low-cost phones themselves. To this end, it’s much smaller and less complex than the full Facebook app: while the standard Facebook application from the Play Store is 162MB for the application alone (without cached images and such) and Facebook’s Messenger app is another 104MB, the latest version of Facebook Lite is only 4.5MB. Messenger Lite is pretty much the same thing as Facebook Lite…but for Messenger. Stop me if I’m going too fast here. It’s a lightweight version of the app that has fewer features, but uses less storage and bandwidth. The odd thing is, the instant messenger functionality of Messenger is available inside the Facebook Lite app, making Messenger Lite somewhat superfluous. Messenger Lite can handle images and stickers that Facebook Lite can’t, so if those are important to you, it can be useful. Unfortunately, Facebook Lite and Messenger Lite aren’t officially available on the Play Store in some of Facebook’s biggest markets, like the United States. Facebook would really prefer those users go to its full app (with its lucrative advertisements) rather than the one designed for more limited areas, and use the separate Messenger app too. Luckily, it’s simple to download a version of the app and install it manually.   Step One: Allow Third-Party Apps Before installing an Android app from outside the Play Store, you’ll need to enable the installation process in the Settings menu. (If you’ve already done this, proceed to step two.) Note that this process might be slightly different on different devices, but you should be able to find the “Unknown sources” option on just about any Android device by following similar instructions to these. Open the main Settings menu, then tap “Security.” Tap the option labelled “Unknown Sources.” Tap “OK” on the warning that pops up. Now you’re ready to download the APK. If keeping the unknown sources option open bothers you, you can disable it again when you’re finished—Facebook Lite will still work after it’s installed. Step Two: Download the Facebook Lite APK Open your phone’s web browser and head to this link. Messenger Lite is at this link–just follow the instructions for Facebook Lite below in the same manner. APK Mirror is a repository of verified Android APK files—everything on the site is checked for authenticity and safety. Select the latest version of Facebook Lite from the list beneath the description. Select the “arm” version if you have a standard Android phone, or “noarch” if your phone uses an Intel chip. If you’re not sure, select “arm.” Now scroll down and tap the “download” button, then tap “OK” as the browser warns you about the APK file. Step Three: Install the APK Swipe down from the notification bar. You should see the APK file you just downloaded. Tap it to begin the process. In the next screen, tap “Install.” That’s it, you’re ready to go. Open the app from your home screen—it’s labelled “Lite” in the app drawer and has a white icon rather than Facebook’s normal blue. Log in with your account and you’ll see your standard timeline. The interface is pretty straightforward: the icons at the top go directly to the Timeline, Contacts, Messages (this is the internal messenger you’re looking for), notifications, and Search pages. The icon with three horizontal bars is the main menu, wherein you’ll find links to less-used parts of the app and the Settings menu. If everything looks good, feel free to uninstall the larger Facebook app and Messenger. But be aware, since you’ve downloaded Facebook Lite or Messenger Lite as a non-Play Store app, it won’t be updated automatically. You may want to check APK Mirror periodically for an updated version.

(AMD) Stock Won’t Pop Another 300% AMD stock might be good for a speculative run here and there, but it's no good for buy-and-holders expecting another quadrupler By Will Ashworth, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 1, 2017, 7:41 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Forget Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock: Buy These Stocks Instead The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(AMD) Stock Won’t Pop Another 300% Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Shareholders Need to Move On View All Posts A lot of water has gone under the bridge since I last wrote about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in mid-March. Investment pundits long and short AMD stock have covered the reignited CPU wars at a furious pace, with articles seemingly appearing by the minute. Source: Shutterstock Most of the chatter about AMD’s Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 processors is positive; the same holds true for AMD stock, which has ridden a momentum train over the last year that has seen it jump 295.1% through April 27 from its 52-week low of $3.45. Now, though, the chatter is about to move toward earnings — and that could be the beginning of the next directional move. Don’t Fight the Trend Hey, I believe in this stock as much as the next guy, but for Advanced Micro Devices to deliver another 300% increase, it’s going to need a lot of good news surrounding its two recently introduced processors when it reports Q1 2017 earnings today, May 1, after the markets close. The analyst consensus is a 4-cent loss on $982.6 million in revenue. Out of 26 analysts covering AMD stock, just three have a sell or sell-equivalent rating on it. Interestingly, despite a consensus among analysts to overweight the stock, the median 12-month target price is $12 — 10% below its April 27 closing price of $13.30. As I said in my last piece about AMD stock, investing is a game of probabilities. The odds of it moving from $13.30 to the mid-$50s in the next 52 weeks is a Herculean task. I’m not saying a couple of good earnings reports won’t help bump it up to within spitting distance of $20, but for AMD to make it to the half-century mark, it has to do two things: (1) Prove Ryzen 5 is a game-changer, and (2) demonstrate that it can make money from Ryzen 5. Is Ryzen 5 a Game-Changer? InvestorPlace contributor Chris Lau recently discussed how the Ryzen 5 processor is attractively priced for the mainstream PC market, which should enable it to better compete with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), the industry leader. Unfortunately, since the Ryzen 5 launched in April, AMD won’t have any sales data to share May 1 other than a general overview of how the product’s been received in the marketplace. However, its Ryzen 7 launch was in early March, so investors should get some sales data on that product which is essentially the same thing as the Ryzen 5 with eight cores instead of four or six. The problem for AMD is that even if the Ryzen 5 is the greatest thing since sliced bread, the PC market is shrinking, and that has Intel speeding up delivery of CPU products currently in the planning stage to ensure it doesn’t lose market share to AMD. So, even with all the positive reviews on the Ryzen 5, AMD has its work cut out for it taking market share from mighty Intel. That said, it has Intel looking over its shoulder for the first time in a long time. Make Money From a speculation standpoint, Advanced Micro isn’t a bad play. If its Q1 2017 earnings are better than expected — its whisper number is a 3-cent loss, so a penny better than analyst expectations — you can be sure that shares will jump on the news.

Secretary Delfin Lorenzana dismisses ISIS' claim of responsibility for the Quiapo blast. File photo by Noel Celis/AFP MANILA, Philippines – Like the police, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana also dismissed claims made by international terrorist group Islamic State (ISIS), which said it was behind the blast in the country's capital Friday, April 28. (READ: PNP says no evidence ISIS behind Quiapo blast) "The ISIS can claim all they want but that was not their handiwork," Lorenzana said in a text message on Sunday, April 30. ISIS claimed the bombing through its Amaq News Agency, according to the SITE intelligence group. #ISIS Claims Bombing in #Manila #Philippines Through its ‘Amaq News Agency https://t.co/NLRrlb15Kf — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) April 29, 2017 An improvised explosive device (IED) exploded in a commercial area in Quiapo, Manila on Friday, wounding at least 14 people. On the same day, regional leaders were arriving in Manila for the 30th ASEAN Summit, which was hosted by the Philippines. Lorenzana echoed police assessment that the attack was prompted by a local scuffle. "According to our intel and police in Quiapo, this was the result of a grudge. One teenager was mauled by 3 brothers. The parent complained to the police who summoned the 3, but they were a no-show," the defense chief said. "The father became mad and [swore], 'Pasasabugin ko kayo (I will blow you up).' Shortly after, a grenade exploded in the vicinity." – Carmela Fonbuena / Rappler.com Filed under:Delfin Lorenzana•ISIS•Islamic State•Manila•Mindanao•President Duterte•Quiapo•Rodrigo Duterte•gang war•terrorism•Philippines HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Its popularity in no time brought the two smartphone OS giants Apple and Google into the competition. While on one hand, Apple’s HealthKit is playing the Health Guru, on the other side it’s Google Fit. Each of them is claiming to deliver best in segment services. However, which of these is the best for you will indeed call for a close analysis. Before we move ahead to find which one’s better, let’s study them individually: Google Fit It originally entered as software designed to help hardware makers and fitness app developers to log and display health-related data with the least possible coding. However, right before the start of 2015 it left the labs of developers and became a dedicated consumer-focused offering. Since then Google Fit has evolved itself as a fully developed mobile app, which not only tracks your steps but also assists during gym sessions. HealthKit This also works in the same way as Google Fit. It accumulates all the data linked with your health and uses it further to give better health related suggestions. So, what’s the difference between Google Fit & Healthkit? Here are some key differences between the two: 1. Design Google Fit: It avails a user-friendly and simple design to the users. However, the glitch here is that the user will have to swipe the screen every time he/she wishes to access new information. To overcome this, the team ensured that user gets detailed information about his/her activities. Apart from this, users are also allowed to enter information manually. The interactive part here is the animated snippets, which come as a reward for users upon achieving a goal. HealthKit: The details are similar to the ones offered in Google Fit. However, there’s one inclusion which makes Apple stand a bit taller. We are talking about the feature with which users are allowed to compare their attained metrics on a single screen. With this, the users can have a better experience as they can access more information with much ease. 2. Security Google Fit: The data stored in the application can be shared with third party applications. However, before doing this the app requires user’s permission. HealthKit: The information stored in the application can be shared only by user’s permission, which makes Apple take a similar stand as Google. However, as an addition, the mobile applications which are built using HealthKit have the data stored in an encrypted format. 3. Types of data Google Fit: As shared officially, it covers the type of activity and time consumed, wheel speed, calories burned, distance covered, pedaling rate, weight, height, power generated in a workout, elevation, heart rate, and steps taken. The major point which comes out here is that Google Fit enables the applications to create their own customized data types. HealthKit: HealthKit in this point takes a lap ahead by adding blood alcohol level, glucose, diet, sleep analysis and more in its list. However, it doesn’t allow the app developers to customize data types according to their wish. By any means, they’ll have to stick with the official list. 4. Partners Google Fit: Adorned with an impressive list of partnerswhich includes Asus, Adidas, HTC, Fatsecret, Intel, Basis, LG, and more. HealthKit: Apple takes a step ahead by having health-focused partners also on the list. This includes EPIC software and Mayo Clinic. To name others, we have Fitbit, Withings, Runkeeper, and Nike on the list. Saying that HealthKit is ahead of Google Fit or vice-versa won’t be right. This solely depends on your choice. No doubts that both the platforms are in a way providing a better landscape to developers and users via better healthcare mobility solutions. The decision to choose one solely depends on your client base, app development budget, and the services/features you wish to avail. The healthcare and fitness app industry is growing rapidly. We can expect big changes in the coming time. Keeping this in mind, this is the right time to join the market and get a healthcare and fitness app developed before it's too late. Remember, the earlier you join the race, more are your chances to stay ahead. All you need is a well-planned and executed health mobile application. Learn how divergent branches can appear in your repository and how to better understand why they are called “branches".  Brought to you in partnership with Wakanda.  Like This Article?

Digg! Yahoo! Buzz Diigo google newsvine reddit technorati Yahoo! Myspace “I live hard and I party pretty hard too,” The Santa Barbara Independent’s senior editor Matt Kettmann tells me as we sit down for dinner at the Bacara’s Angel Oak restaurant. “As you get older you need to reassess both actions,” he elaborates, “which is what I’m doing during this sabbatical.” He is still working — writing an article a week for this paper among other projects — but Kettmann is currently taking a well-deserved six months off from his longtime editing role at The Independent. Personally and professionally, I can’t think of a more influential and important person in Santa Barbara than Matt Kettmann. He is a true renaissance man: he’s been a news writer, a pop culture editor, a wine connoisseur and wine writer, a mentor, a reality checker, and a best friend to me and to many others in town. He’s a master at balancing his business and private worlds, a task that must take a toll on his psyche. Concerning his recent sabbatical, he explains, “It’s good, but it’s really busy.” He’s had projects he’s been working on for at least five years, including a book on the Chumash revolt of 1824, all while continuing as a contributing editor for Wine Enthusiast. For that magazine, he works 20 to 30 hours a week writing 150 to 200 wine reviews a month and covering the viticulture of California’s Central Coast and South Coast. By Paul Wellman Matt Kettmann at his home On the personal side, he’s going to work on the landscaping of his lovely Goleta home. He has a seven-year-old son, Mason, and a daughter, Madeline, who will be five soon and is starting kindergarten this fall, and he wants to spend quality time with them. He’s been working on taking this break for the past two years. “I was working 60 to 70 hours a week,” he said. “A slow week for me was 50 hours.” This week, he’s on a barrel-making tour in France, and is heading to Banff in June, Seattle for the annual Wine Enthusiast conference in July, and Washington D.C. with Mason in August. “Mateo” – as I love to call him – has written about wine and travel for the New York Times, and about many subjects as a news stringer for Time Magazine, including the Michael Jackson trial in Santa Maria, for which he served as Time’s main correspondent. A fifth generation Californian out of San Jose, he came to UCSB in 1995 to study anthropology with a minor in professional writing. He tells me, “We were guinea pigs in that minor and one of the best things about the program was that they forced me to get an internship.” He started as an intern for the Independent in 1999. In his interview with Indy editor Audrey Berman, he asked her, “Do interns get to write?” to which, he reports, her answer was an emphatic, “No.” But then, on his first day, he was told the travel editor needed some research on a story about the new trend of buying airplane tickets on the internet, and he wrote a grammatically correct email with his research. He got his first byline on his second day as an intern. “I never aspired to be a journalist,” he says, but he was a voracious reader of media growing up. “My dad always knew what was going on,” he explains. “I got the notion of being at the cutting edge of information from him.” Plus he was a good and fast writer, which he attributes to his Jesuit education. After graduation from UCSB, he went to Europe for the summer. “I knew I wanted to stay in Santa Barbara; my main motivation was to stay in town,” he recalls. It happened that a proofreader was leaving The Independent; he took the proofreading test and passed. Proofreading paid by the hour, but writing paid by the word. Thus was he motivated to write. In May 2000, he went full time into news reporting. “I caught the bug about writing news under Nick Welsh and Cathy Murillo’s mentoring,” he tells me. It was a window into how the whole world works – and “Mateo” had a front row seat. During that time, he started to travel in a way that moved his career forward. The first trip was to Belize to write a story on the archeologist Dr. Anabel Ford. Other reporting trips to Bolivia, Costa Rica, Uganda, and India ensued. In 2004, a journey to the war-torn unrecognized Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan launched him as a wine writer. He went there for a month with a photographer and the intention to report stories about the geopolitics of the situation. The story he found was about a millennia old winemaking tradition that had been disrupted by war. “I cold-pitched the story to Wine Spectator and they kept asking for more,” he says. “Wine freelance writing is a good market.” By Paul Wellman Matt Kettmann He summarizes his keys to success this way: “I’ve been able to be both global and local in my writing, and I love getting those ego-stroking bylines.” Despite the fact he’s traveled all over the world, he still finds Santa Barbara an exciting place to live for its smalltown feel and big city sophistication. In 2006, Independent founder and editor-in-chief Marianne Partridge asked him to develop the paper’s digital presence through this website, independent.com, and he’s managed it ever since. As if that were not enough, he also co-founded the nonprofit music festival New Noise in 2009 and serves as secretary of the board for the nonprofit music education organization Notes for Notes, which builds and operates recording studios for kids to use for free from Santa Barbara to Brooklyn. He was also on the steering committee that started the revitalizing Downtown Santa Barbara program know as 1st Thursdays and, not surprisingly, advocated for wine and food to be included as part of that monthly affair. Matt Kettmann is a dear and wonderful man who I admire deeply. It’s hard to imagine he’s only turning 40 on September 6, for he is wise beyond his years. “You may be kneading the pasta for a long time – but the deadline is sausage making time,” he shares with me as a parting mantra. “Mateo” answers the Proust Questionnaire. What do you like most about your job? As a journalist, no day is ever the same, and the work can put you on the frontlines of everything, from concerts at the SB Bowl to inside the kitchen of the world’s top chefs to the actual frontlines of warzones. Our job is telling interesting stories about people, places, and issues that matter, to keep the public informed so that they can make better decisions about their lives, whether it’s which wine to try or how to vote. I can’t imagine a more engaging career. What is your idea of perfect happiness? Lazy weekend mornings with our whole family in the same big bed, with the sound of waves crashing outside and something fun planned for later that day. What is your greatest fear? Family and friends dying. Who do you most admire and why? My mom. In an era when women weren’t supposed to climb corporate ladders, she started as one of the first receptionists at Intel in Silicon Valley and wound up near the top of the corporation, managing HR, mergers & acquisitions, meritocracy, and other departments. Then when my dad died rather suddenly a few years ago at 63 years old, she didn’t retreat into sadness. She became the best grandma in the world and continues to travel around the globe, enjoy life, and enliven all around her. And thanks to a love of yoga and pilates, she should be doing that for a couple more decades! What is your greatest extravagance? Travel, expensive meals, and occasional purchases of Old World wine, although all three usually count as work, so I get to write them off on my taxes! What is your current state of mind? Overwhelmed but optimistic. I have a lot of goals planned for this six-month break from the paper (from writing to housework), and time is running fast, but I still have a few months left. What is the quality you most like in people? Honest, open-minded curiosity about everything in life. What is the quality you most dislike in people? Know-it-all-ness. I actually know everything, and they clearly don’t. What do you most value in friends? I’m lucky enough to continue to be best friends with guys I knew as far back as first grade, with plenty of good draft picks (including some gals) through elementary school, high school, college, and post-college. All of them can pick up our usually hilarious, often deep, always knowledgeable conversations like they never stopped, and that’s what it’s all about. What is your most marked characteristic? Probably being gregarious. Though I was somewhat shy all the way through high school, I became a social animal somewhere along the way. Blame Isla Vista. So even if I don’t feel so hot inside for whatever reason (behind crushing deadlines, hungover after long weekend, often both, etc.), I manage to perk up and blab away. Which words or phrases do you most overuse? Aside from a roster of very versatile four-letter words that I still have trouble not saying around my kids, I tend to overuse “sweet,” “cool,” “dude,” “man,” “awesome,” and all of that other stereotypical space-filling slang that you might expect from a fifth generation Californian. Which talent would you most like to have? Ability to play music and speak multiple languages. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? I wish I was more naturally inclined to exercise. Then I could lose 20 pounds and become a male model. What do you consider your greatest achievement? Ask me in about 15 years I’ll probably say my kids. But for now, working my ass off as a journalist to afford to stay in Santa Barbara all of these years. Where would you most like to live? I’ve traveled all around the world, and nowhere is there a place exactly like Santa Barbara: a stunningly beautiful small-town community but full of bigger city offerings, and close to my extended family. More specifically, on a cul de sac with cool neighbors somewhere between Santa Barbara and Goleta, with a garage full of wine, a beautiful and supportive wife, two smart and spunky kids, their elementary school within walking distance, and two towering redwoods as well as avocado and fruit trees in my backyard. Aka, my current home. What is your most treasured possession? Memories. I’ve edited about 200 of these Questionnaires, and that is the correct answer. When you lose someone close, like I lost my dad, that’s all you’ve really got left. Who makes you laugh the most? My close friends give my kids a run for their money. What is your motto? I once coined the phrase “patience is the key to pleasure,” but then I had kids and lost all my patience. So I’ll go with, “Just make it happen.” Life’s too short to dwell on all the reasons why you can’t do something. And this is more of a credo than a motto, but I’ve come to realize that you are going to remember that one day you skipped work to take your son on a hike rather than all those days you sat diligently at your desk. So get your job done and do it well, but remember to play hooky too — that counts for bonus points in the game of life. Which historical figure do you most identify with? I’d like to say Hunter S. Thompson, who inspired me and many another to pursue a career in journalism. But he probably did more drugs than me, wasn’t very reliable, and left a lot of pain in his wake, so we don’t really match up. Similar things could be said for Hemingway and Kerouac, who both inspired me to be a writer. That leaves John Steinbeck and Jack London (who both wrote passionately about our home state) and Ryszard Kapuściński, the utterly curious globe-trotting Polish correspondent who turned his journalism into literature. I’d like to do that one day. On what occasion do you lie? Rarely, but sometimes it is strategically necessary to avoid embarrassing others, losing a bet, or tricking the kids.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: What to expect from Microsoft’s May 2nd event 2 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ May 1, 2017 at 13:33 GMT17 hours ago Microsoft’s Education-focused event is happening tomorrow in New York City. Microsoft has a much bigger event next week as well, where the company will reveal the next big step for Windows 10 and a lot more. So what exactly is Microsoft going to announce at the event tomorrow? Well, there’s quite a lot of things — most of which focus on one thing: Microsoft’s education audience. Redmond is introducing a new version of Windows 10, and a new type of Windows devices to take on Google’s Chromebooks. Windows 10 Cloud / Windows 10 S Microsoft will unveil a new version of Windows 10 tomorrow. Microsoft is yet to officially talk about the new version of Windows 10, which might be called “Windows 10 Cloud” or “Windows 10 S”. The new version of Windows 10 is essentially the backbone of the hardware Microsoft will be introducing at the event tomorrow. That’s because Windows 10 Cloud is a lightweight version of Windows 10 that offers increased security, and only lets users download apps from the Windows Store. With Windows 10 S, Microsoft is clearly planning to take on Google’s Chromebooks. Devices powered by Windows 10 S will be quite affordable, and Microsoft will be targeting them towards its education audience. Windows 10 S is still Windows 10 as we know it, minus the fact that you can’t install apps outside of the Windows Store. You will still be able to download some of the Win32 apps that are available on the Windows Store, including the likes of Evernote, Slack, and even the full-fledged Office apps. This is also a security feature for Windows 10 — as users can only download apps from the Windows Store, their Windows 10 device can no longer be affected by malware. The best thing about Windows 10 S is the fact that users will be able to upgrade it to the regular version of Windows 10 at a price, which is really great because some users may still want to download the classic Win32 apps online and get access to all of the advanced features in Windows 10. We took a detailed look at Windows 10 Cloud recently, and you can find that here. CloudBook Along with Windows 10 Cloud, Microsoft will introduce new hardware that comes with it. The new hardware is going to be called CloudBook, and Microsoft will likely also introduce its own CloudBook — possibly under the Surface brand. It is highly likely Microsoft will show off some other CloudBook devices from its OEM partners such as Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus as well. As the CloudBook devices are supposed to be Chromebook competitors, they will be affordable — which means you won’t get the fastest CPUs or the best display. Instead, these devices will focus on the price while providing a seamless experience. According to a recent leak, the recommended minimum specs for a CloudBook includes a quad-core Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM, 32 GB of storage, a better larger than 40WHr so that it’s capable of providing an all-day battery life for most students. If Microsoft does introduce its own CloudBook device, it will likely include a slightly more powerful set of specs, which means it will be a bit more expensive — and if it is indeed part of the company’s Surface line of devices, that will be completely fine because of the brand. There’s a lot we don’t know about CloudBook, and that, of course, includes the price which is really crucial for Microsoft. CloudBooks need to be cheaper than most Chromebooks, or at least come at the same price range — and if that’s not the case, I doubt Microsoft’s plans will succeed. Office on Windows Store Another big part of Windows 10 Cloud and CloudBook is Office. Microsoft’s Office suite is probably the most important applications for its education audience. But as Windows 10 Cloud is only able to downloads app from the Windows Store, that’s a major problem for Microsoft. Sure, the company already has the Office Mobile apps on the Windows Store but they aren’t quite full-featured. As we previously reported, Microsoft is also expected to bring the full-fledged Office desktop apps to the Windows Store tomorrow. The company is bringing the classic Office desktop apps to the Windows Store using its Desktop App Bridge which essentially allows developers to bring their classic Win32 apps to the Windows Store. By bringing the classic Office apps to the Windows Store, Microsoft is removing the biggest hurdle for Windows 10 Cloud and CloudBooks. Along with being able to download and install the classic Office apps from the Windows Store, Windows 10 users will also be able to buy Office 365 subscriptions directly from the Windows Store. And that’s pretty neat. CONCLUSION The May 2nd event is quite substantial for Microsoft. Chromebooks are posing quite a lot of threat to Microsoft, and even Apple. Microsoft knows it needs to compete with Google before it’s too late, and the May 2nd event could possibly be the start of something new for Microsoft. Even though there are quite a lot of cheap Windows 10 tablets that are trying to compete with Chromebooks, CloudBooks might be even cheaper as Windows 10 Cloud will likely be available at a lower price than Windows 10 Home or Pro to OEMs. That’ll cut the cost of production for OEMs, which means they will be able to sell their Windows 10 devices at a lower price. Will it work out for Microsoft? Who knows. The company’s Windows RT was quite similar to Windows 10 Cloud, but Windows 10 Cloud is still a lot different from Windows RT. When Microsoft launches Windows 10 devices powered by ARM processors, Windows 10 Cloud might turn out to be immensely useful, but that’s something we’ll get to see in the future. But for now, the May 2nd event should be very interesting and give us some more details on Microsoft’s plans for killing the Chromebook. Catch MSPU’s live coverage As per usual, we will be covering the May 2nd event live, which starts at 9:30AM Eastern Time (that’s 13:30 GMT). We are actually attending the event in New York City tomorrow, so we’ll also be publishing a lot of hands-on pictures, videos, and all the other good stuff.

He earned 59 Four-Pinocchio ratings during his campaign as president. Since then, he’s earned 16 more Four-Pinocchio ratings. But those numbers obscure the fact that the pace and volume of the president’s misstatements means we cannot possibly keep up. The president’s speeches and interviews are so chock full of false and misleading claims that The Fact Checker often must resort to roundups that offer a brief summary of the facts that the president has gotten wrong. We also cataloged the president’s many flip-flops, since those earn Upside-Down Pinocchios if a politician shifts position on an issue without acknowledging he or she did so. So here are the numbers for the president’s first 100 days: 488: The number of false or misleading claims made by the president. That’s an average of 4.9 claims a day. 10: Number of days without a single false claim. (On six of those days, the president golfed at a Trump property.) 4: Number of days with 20 or more false claims. (Feb. 16, Feb. 28, March 20 and April 21.) He made 19 false claims on April 29, his 100th day, though we did not include his interview with “Face the Nation,” since that aired April 30. While the president is known to make outrageous claims on Twitter — and that was certainly a major source of his falsehoods — he made most of his false statements in unscripted remarks before reporters. (Interviews were another major source of false claims.) That’s because the president would rely on talking points or assertions that he had made in the past — and continued to make, even though they had been fact-checked as wrong. This makes Trump somewhat unique among politicians. Many will drop a false claim after it has been deemed false. But Trump just repeats the same claim over and over. In particular, the president repeatedly took credit for events or business decisions that happened before he took the oath of office — or had even been elected. He gave himself credit for the January jobs report — 216,000 jobs — even though the data were collected the week of Jan. 12, before he became president. (In other words, the gain in jobs took place from Dec. 12 to Jan. 12.) Among other deals, Trump took credit for $1 billion investment by Fiat Chrysler, which the company said was due to talks with unions in 2015, $1 billion General Motors investment (also in the works for some time), 10,000 jobs added by Walmart (announced in October), 10,000 jobs created by Intel (announced originally in 2011), 1 million planned jobs by Chinese e-company Alibaba (a plan outlined in 2015), and a $25 billion investment by Charter Communications (in the works since 2015). Trump also touted a big investment by Japanese company SoftBank — which announced its investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory. On at least 15 occasions, Trump boasted that he had personally negotiated a cut between $600 million and $725 million off an order for Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. But Lockheed had already planned the cost reductions, saying in December that the next batch of 90 planes would cost six to seven percent less per plane than the previous order. (This was well before any meeting that Trump had with the company’s chief executive.) The Air Force’s budget had already accounted for the cut in price — and the price is expected to keep dropping. Another Trump favorite was claiming — seven times — that the United States had spent $6 trillion on wars in “the Middle East.” He usually utters this figure to note the money would have been better spent in the United States. But Trump is lumping together the wars in Iraq (in the Middle East) and Afghanistan (in South Asia), which together cost about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. He is also adding in estimates of future spending, such as interest on the debt and veterans’ care for the next three decades. Trump has also repeatedly asserted (17 times) that the Affordable Care Act was failing or on the edge of disaster or in serious trouble. But the Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges, despite well-documented issues, is not imploding and is expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Trump, as he did during the campaign, also cherry-picked numbers about premium increases to make the increases sound worse than reality. Trump repeatedly also blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement — “the worst trade deal ever made by any country” — for resulting in the loss of one-third of U.S. manufacturing jobs. He also claimed that the entry of China into the World Trade Organization led to the closure of as many as 70,000 factories. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2017 concluded the “net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP.” Meanwhile, manufacturing jobs in the United States have been adversely affected by many factors, especially changing consumer tastes and technology. Drawing a connection between China’s entry in the WTO and factory losses is a stretch, especially because the Great Recession played a big role in factory closings. Judging from Trump’s repeated false claims, one would think that he is not a regular reader. But on March 21, Trump remarked that the news media was too judgmental about his statements. “If it’s off by 100th of a percent, it’s like I end up getting Pinocchios,” he said. That’s a start. Hope springs eternal.   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Police identify man who died in Old Town meth lab explosion Two die in 3-vehicle crash on Route 1 in Warren Two people die in Knox County head-on crash LePage sues attorney general for not representing his legal positions Boy, 5, injured when Jeep rolls down driveway, across road in Gorham LePage’s 4-Point Plan for Maine In my ﬁrst 100 days, I kept my promise to the American people Trump’s first 100 days are good for him but bad for Americans LePage’s cuts to superintendents would leave Maine schools without needed leadership The spirit of Buck v.

The San Jose, California-based company has posted results that topped estimates every quarter since completing the $15.8 billion purchase of the memory chipmaker last May and its stock has jumped 31 percent this year. Contrast that with the single-day 17 percent drop in shares of rival Seagate Technology Inc. after it reported earnings that still mostly depend on older, less desirable spinning magnetic-disk-based hard drives. The company reported a 65 percent increase in sales in the first quarter on surging demand for flash memory, a more modern type of storage technology for phones and computers that came with the SanDisk deal. But the SanDisk business has a joint venture with Toshiba’s chip division, which is for sale as the Japanese company seeks to cover losses from its failed attempt to expand into the nuclear power industry. Western Digital has held discussions with Innovation Network Corp. of Japan and Development Bank of Japan Inc. about options for a bid. It’s pursuing exclusive talks with Toshiba and has argued that a sale to a third party is in breach of their joint-venture agreement -- a claim that his Japanese partners refute. The company’s legal rights and the Japanese government’s desire to stop control of the crucial technology passing to another country will help achieve a positive result for his company, said Mark Long, Western Digital’s chief financial officer. The enemy of a good conclusion to the sale process is time. “A lot of this, in the initial phases, is going to be overshadowed by the desperation of Toshiba to deal with their crisis as it has grown from a problem to an all-consuming disaster,” Long said. “We are deeply troubled by the tension between the depth of Toshiba’s desperation and their willingness to do things that we didn’t think they would do in other situations.” Strong Demand Flash memory is enjoying a bumper year. Intel Corp., which disappointed investors with its data center unit’s performance, hit record total sales levels helped by a 55 percent surge in revenue at its flash memory business. Micron Technology Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. have all reported strong demand for the chips that are replacing magnetic disks. Toshiba’s unit has garnered a lot of interest, with bids as high as $28 billion reportedly from Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Western Digital’s position is that “each of the rumored bidders is problematic,” said Long. The company has talked to all of the prospective buyers to look for a solution. And in some cases they’ve reached out first themselves. Consider the following: Hon Hai’s reported bid for the division values it about the same as the market capitalization of rivals Micron and SK Hynix. Yet those companies have more than twice the memory-chip revenue of the Toshiba unit. “This is a head scratcher,” said Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Mizuho Securities. “We think at two times sales it’s worth about $14 billion.” Sales at Micron and SK Hynix are projected to surge more than 50 percent this year as demand for the mobile-device storage chips continues to expand and chipmakers stay disciplined in their additions of new supply. That doesn’t change the volatile nature of the business, where producers have frequently caused supply gluts and crashed pricing. SK Hynix -- also a bidder for Toshiba -- and Micron have each reported two annual losses since 2010. “I wouldn’t say we’re at the peak but the supply-demand trends can’t get much better than they are,” said Tristan Gerra, an analyst at Robert W. Baird. The timing is “good for Toshiba because we think they can sell at close to the peak. There’s a lot of interest in the technology, particularly in China.” The challenge for anyone scooping up Toshiba’s chip business is making enough money to pay the high purchase price while finding enough funds to upgrade plants that cost billions of dollars to equip. Future Partner Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Western Digital now faces the uncertainty of who might take Toshiba’s majority stake in their joint venture, whether they’ll continue to invest at the required levels, and even if the new owner will compete against it. Buying Toshiba’s unit at the prices being proposed would put a heavy burden on Western Digital’s finances. The company said last week it had cash and cash equivalents of $5.8 billion and “liquidity available” totaling $6.8 billion. “It’s really complicated,” said Weston Twigg, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. “There was always a risk. When you buy half a venture, you don’t know how reliable the other side of the venture is. We just found out that Toshiba wasn’t reliable.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

We already know that Activision's latest shooter will contain single player, multiplayer and cooperative game modes but, beyond the initial story trailer reveal, little else is known about what can be expected from each game mode. To start the ball rolling of what Call of Duty: WWII's co-op mode could entail, Activision has updated the official Call of Duty: WWII website with some cryptic new information. Read More Call of Duty trailer reveals the gritty, explosive brutality of the Second World War (Photo: Activision) Using a screen grab of the image of a zombified Nazi soldier that Activision showed during the reveal event is, in fact, the gateway to a treasure trove of information about the co-op campaign. If you can crack it, that is. Reddit and Charlie Intel picked up on the secret after one user brightened the image and spotted a strange key on the inside rim of the soldier's helmet. Visiting a special page on the Call of Duty WWII website grants you access to a typewriter where, upon entering the special code, unlocks a dossier to browse through. Read More Do we need a Netflix for video games? Xbox chief calls for new subscription-based gaming model (Photo: Activision) So far the clues given away is the message "A new Horror Rises", a folder with signatures, letters and numbers on the side of it too; a worn image of a Holy Roman Emperor and King of Burgundy and Germany, Frederick Barbarossa; and an image of Raphae's Portrait of a Young Man – the same painting that went missing after Nazi troops stole precious artworks. What this points to is anyone's guess. People have deduced a whole host of crazy ideas but nothing has worked. You can give it a go yourself on the Call of Duty WWII website, but expect more details to slowly trickle out as more people crack the clues. Or, you know, just wait until E3 2017 instead.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Glenn Kessler and Michelle Ye Hee Lee By Glenn Kessler and Michelle Ye Hee Lee May 1 at 3:00 AM Follow @GlennKesslerWP Follow @myhlee The first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency have been chaotic and unpredictable. Reporters who covered it recount the events that dominated the news. (Alice Li,Jayne Orenstein,Julio Negron/The Washington Post) President Trump is the most fact-challenged politician that The Fact Checker has ever encountered. He earned 59 Four-Pinocchio ratings during his campaign as president. Since then, he’s earned 16 more Four-Pinocchio ratings. But those numbers obscure the fact that the pace and volume of the president’s misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up. The president’s speeches and interviews are so chock full of false and misleading claims that The Fact Checker often must resort to roundups that offer a brief summary of the facts that the president has gotten wrong. As part of our coverage of the president’s first 100 days, The Fact Checker team (along with Leslie Shapiro and Kaeti Hinck of the Post graphics department) produced an interactive graphic that displayed a running list of every false or misleading statement made by the president. We also catalogued the president’s many flip-flops, since those earn Upside-Down Pinocchios if a politician shifts position on an issue without acknowledging he or she did so. So here are the numbers for the president’s first 100 days. 488: The number of false or misleading claims made by the president. That’s an average of 4.9 claims a day. 10: Number of days without a single false claim. (On six of those days, the president golfed at a Trump property.) 4: Number of days with 20 or more false claims. (Feb. 16, Feb. 28, March 20 and April 21.) He made 19 false claims on April 29, his 100th day, though we did not include his interview with “Face the Nation,” since that aired April 30. While the president is known to make outrageous claims on Twitter — and that was certainly a major source of his falsehoods — he made most of his false statements in unscripted remarks before reporters. (Interviews were another major source of false claims.) That’s because the president would rely on talking points or assertions that he had made in the past — and continued to make, even though they had been fact-checked as wrong. This makes Trump somewhat unique among politicians. Many will drop a false claim after it has been deemed false. But Trump just repeats the same claim over and over. [The many ways to measure the first 100 days of President Trump] In particular, the president repeatedly took credit for events or business decisions that happened before he took the oath of office — or had even been elected. He gave himself credit for the January jobs report — 216,000 jobs — even though the data was collected the week of Jan. 12, before he became president. (In other words, the gain in jobs took place from Dec. 12 to Jan. 12.) Among other deals, Trump took credit for $1 billion investment by Fiat Chrysler (which the company said was due to talks with unions in 2015), $1 billion General Motors investment (also in the works for some time), 10,000 jobs added by Walmart (announced in October), 10,000 jobs created by Intel (announced originally in 2011), 1 million planned jobs by Chinese e-company Alibaba (a plan outlined in 2015), and a $25 billion investment by Charter Communications (in the works since 2015). Trump also touted a big investment by Japanese company SoftBank — which announced its investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory. On at least 15 occasions, Trump boasted that he had personally negotiated a cut between $600 million and $725 million off an order for Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. But Lockheed had already planned the cost reductions, saying in December that the next batch of 90 planes would cost six to seven percent less per plane than the previous order. (This was well before any meeting that Trump had with the company’s chief executive.) The Air Force’s budget had already accounted for the cut in price — and the price is expected to keep dropping. Another Trump favorite was claiming — seven times — that the United States had spent $6 trillion on wars in “the Middle East.” He usually utters this figure to note the money would have been better spent in the United States. But Trump is lumping together the wars in Iraq (in the Middle East) and Afghanistan (in South Asia), which together cost about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. He is also adding in estimates of future spending, such as interest on the debt and veterans’ care for the next three decades. Trump has also repeatedly asserted (17 times) that the Affordable Care Act was failing or on the edge of disaster or in serious trouble. But the Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges, despite well-documented issues, is not imploding and is expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Trump, as he did during the campaign, also cherry-picked numbers about premium increases to make the increases sound worse than reality. Trump repeatedly also blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)—“the worst trade deal ever made by any country”– for resulting in the loss of one-third of U.S. manufacturing jobs. He also claimed that the entry of China into the World Trade Organization led to the closure of as many as 70,000 factories. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2017 concluded the “net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP.” Meanwhile, manufacturing jobs in the United States have been adversely affected by many factors, especially changing consumer tastes and technology. Drawing a connection between China’s entry in the WTO and factory losses is a stretch, especially because the Great Recession played a big role in factory closings. Judging from Trump’s repeated false claims, one would think that he is not a regular reader. But on March 21, Trump remarked that the news media was too judgmental about his statements. “If it’s off by 100th of a percent, it’s like I end up getting Pinocchios,” he said. That’s a start. Hope springs eternal.       (About our rating scale)   Send us facts to check by filling out this form Keep tabs on Trump’s promises with our Trump Promise Tracker Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter politics fact-checker Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

Son believes the singularity will be coming soon in which the intelligence of robots overtakes that of people, triggering runaway technological growth. / Yonhap By Park Hyong-ki Sean LeeHumanity's future with robots is often portrayed and projected as the apocalyptic end of humankind. In science fiction movies and novels such as "The Matrix" and "Robopocalypse," super-intelligent computers or artificial intelligence (AI) become rulers of the earth, and humans become enslaved by them. Even in reality, many scholars and experts predict some sort of doomsday amid the rise of the machine. Forecasts include the loss of human jobs and people's expertise in certain areas such as finance and middle management soon becoming irrelevant. Calls to adopt measures or rules such as scientist Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics or robot taxes are growing to safeguard the future of the human race. However, optimists say robots will further enhance human lives. Robotic technology can help the development of medicines that can ease pain and even cheat death, or help people become superhuman. Whatever the future of humankind holds with robots, SoftBank Group Chairman Masayoshi Son believes the age of robots is at hand. Like the internet and other innovative technologies before it, AI can also improve lives, which is in line with SoftBank's vision ― bringing happiness to people through innovation in information, communication and technology (ICT). Sean Lee, a partner and managing director of SoftBank Ventures Korea, said AI is keeping Chairman Son up at nights, imagining and drawing the future in his head about the age of the "singularity" ― the pivotal point when the intelligence of robots will exceed that of humans. The chairman, known as Son Jeong-ui here, believes it will begin in 2018, and by 2041, one processor will be able to exceed the intelligence of all humankind. "SoftBank is looking mainly at two things for the future ― AI and the internet of things (IoT). We all know AI led the chairman to postpone his retirement," Lee said in a recent interview at his office in Gangnam, southern Seoul. "The acquisitions of ARM Holdings, a chip design company, and a telecom company, Sprint, are all part of Son's preparations for the singularity." SoftBank Ventures Korea, a venture capital fund of the Japan-based telecommunication group, is also seeking investment opportunities in the startup world, aligned with Son's vision, Lee said. Eyeing AI, media When the internet was introduced in the market and became mainstream, SoftBank Ventures sought out startups that had the potential to win by both using and benefiting from the technology. Then, it invested in Nexon, which became the country's biggest online gaming firm. With the introduction of smartphones and mobile technology, the venture capital fund also used the same strategy as before and invested in startups such as SundayToz and Devsisters. The former is known for its successful puzzle game "Anipang," and the latter created the hit game "Cookie Run." "We are seeking startups that can use the potential of AI and come out as a winner. There are some things traditional players can do, and there are some areas within AI where startups can excel. We are trying to find those startups," Lee said. Last year, SoftBank Ventures Korea and Naver, the country's largest search engine, set up a fund to invest in startups in AI and media in the United States. "The U.S. currently has the world's most aggressive AI developers. It is kind of scary to see how fast AI is growing there. Naver sees itself as a small company in AI when compared to U.S. tech companies," he said. He added that the two are also interested in new media in the U.S. for investment. "Along with AI, we are looking to invest in media startups like Snapchat and Line. In the new age, we can no longer see one technology alone. We should see its potential to converge with other technology. AI can be converged with media, and vice versa," Lee said. In Korea, SoftBank Ventures has separate funds that not only seek to invest in AI startups but also those in other ICT areas. Unlike other in-house corporate venture funds such as those of Samsung Electronics, Intel and Qualcomm, SoftBank makes investments with partners including the National Pension Service, KB Insurance and Nexon, which provided capital to SoftBank's venture capital funds. "But lately, we have become more worried about the future because IoT will make national borders meaningless. Can Korean startups survive the competition in a borderless world? We need to begin seeing this world differently," Lee said. New world AI, IoT and other innovative technologies will further connect the world and make borders obsolete. The days are gone when Korean companies felt safe and gained an edge here without having to worry about competing with foreign players. "But things are different. Look at Google, YouTube, Facebook. Google is No.1 everywhere except in four countries ― Korea, Japan, China and Russia. In Japan, Google is rapidly catching up with Yahoo," Lee said. "Startups and entrepreneurs have to think differently and create services that can appeal globally through risk-taking and innovation. Otherwise, their future looks dim with a lot less chance of becoming a unicorn." In Korea, startups that had the potential to become a unicorn, or a company valued at billions of dollars, consisted of team members in their mid-30s. Those who had some experience in managing people and decision-making had a higher chance of running a successful startup here. Lee said startups need tenacity to change fast in accordance with consumers' needs everywhere in the world, not just in their homeland. "The risk-taking culture has to change as well. I think the Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis in 2008 made young Koreans take less risks and seek more stability after seeing their parents lose their businesses and suffer," Lee said. On the other hand, the U.S. and China refocused their energy away from financial places like Wall Street to innovation hubs such as Silicon Valley, further encouraging innovation through risk-taking even after failures. "This culture creates a lot of differences because at the end, it will create more success," Lee said. "SoftBank Ventures Korea has invested in more than 200 startups since it was established here in 2000. Most of them failed. But one successful startup has always made up for the other nine failed startups we invested in. It has never seen success without investment, even including failed ones," he said. hyongki@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter Why China 'urgently' recruiting Korean-Chinese interpreters for town near North Korea Five killed, 20 injured in crane collapse at Samsung shipyard North Korea missile explosion deliberate, experts say Australian graffiti artist arrested for defacing subway car [INTERVIEW] Norwegian artist promotes peace in Korea US to renegotiate THAAD deal with S.

It's a big release for storage, shared memory, CPU speed boosts and touchy-feely types 1 May 2017 at 03:50, Simon Sharwood Linus Torvalds has given the world version 4.11 of the Linux kernel. “So after that extra week with an rc8, things were pretty calm,” Torvalds posted to the Linux Kernel Mailing List, adding “I'm much happier releasing a final 4.11 now. So what do we get this time around? Among other things, Linux is now better at hot-swapping solid state disks and can now do journaling on RAID 4/5/6 volumes. While we're talking storage, there's also support for the OPAL self-encrypting disk drive standard. The kernel has also gained support for the Shared Memory Communications over RDMA (SMC-R) (SMC-R) spec, an IBM invention that allows virtual machines to share memory and therefore speeds up communications between the machines, helps with load balancing and doesn't hurt when clustering Linux boxen. Enterprise users and gamers will both be happy that the kernel adds improved support for Intel's Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, technology that lets a CPU figure out which of its cores is fastest and then increase its clock speed in response to a critical workload's needs. Among the more interesting smaller changes, the kernel's Infiniband implementation has plenty of added nuances, Wacom tablets are now supported and the Realtek ALC299/ALC1220 codecs get overdue support, meaning some Kaby Lake motherboards can now make noise when running Linux. Kernel Newbies has a comprehensive list of new features and tweaks. The release of version 4.11 of course means that the merge window is open for the next version of the Linux Kernel. As ever, would-be-contributors have a little over a week to offer their ideas and code before Linus Torvalds sets the next version of Linux down the assembly line. ® Tips and corrections 17 Comments MORE Linux Linus Torvalds More from The Register You're taking the p...

Spicer discussed former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Trump's tax overhaul plan and other topics. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) WASHINGTON (AP) — Investigations intensified into President Donald Trump's ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn, on Thursday as the Pentagon watchdog joined lawmakers in probing payments he accepted from foreign sources including a Russian state-sponsored TV network. At the same time, documents released by the top Democrat on a House oversight committee showed Flynn was warned by authorities after he retired from the military in 2014 not to take foreign government-sourced money without "advance approval" from the Pentagon. Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general and Defense Intelligence Agency chief, later accepted tens of thousands of dollars for his work on behalf of foreign interests, including RT, the state-supported Russian television network, and a Turkish-owned company linked to Turkey's government. The Pentagon's acting inspector general's office confirmed Thursday he has launched an inquiry into whether those payments qualify as coming from foreign governments and whether Flynn properly informed military authorities about them. The White House defended its hiring of Flynn and attempted to shift blame for any problems with his vetting onto the Obama administration, which handled the reissuance of his security clearance in January 2016. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who released the documents, said during a news conference that Flynn had been clearly informed he needed to get permission to receive foreign payments and there's no evidence he did so. "The Pentagon's warning to General Flynn was bold, italicized and could not have been clearer," Cummings said. In a key 2014 document, Flynn was told by a Defense Intelligence Agency official that the U.S. Constitution's emoluments provision prohibits any monetary payments or gifts "from a foreign government unless congressional consent is first obtained." The Oct. 8, 2014, letter — which was sent to Flynn at his request — explained that such "advance approval" would need to come "from the relevant service secretary." Earlier this week, Cummings and Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House committee, said that they had found no evidence Flynn asked the Army for permission to receive foreign payments or informed the military he had accepted them. Army spokeswoman Cynthia O. Smith said the Army had no records that Flynn requested that permission. One episode in question involves a trip he took to Moscow in 2015 for RT's anniversary celebration. He was paid at least $33,750 to attend the gala at which he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "General Flynn's attorney says he discussed his trip to Moscow with DIA, but we have no evidence, not a shred, that he disclosed his payments," Cummings said Thursday. In a statement, Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner said the Defense Department "was fully aware of the trip," citing his previous statements that his client briefed DIA officials before and after the RT trip. Kelner also pointed to a letter, released in redacted form by Cummings, that notes that Flynn provided a thumb drive to the agency containing documents detailing the RT event, including that Leading Authorities, a speakers bureau that handled Flynn's paid speeches, was handling the event for him. Kelner's statement did not address other payments Flynn received from foreign sources. Flynn has previously disclosed he got between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his personal stake in $530,000 that his company, Flynn Intel Group, received for consulting work last year for a Turkish businessman. Last month Flynn's firm filed as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for its consulting work and acknowledged the work may have benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn's client, Inovo BV, is owned by a businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In comments to the AP, Utah Republican Chaffetz, chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said that Flynn "had an obligation to seek approval to take money from a foreign government. We found no evidence that he did that." Chaffetz's office released a letter he sent on Thursday to the Army, asking the service's acting secretary to make a final determination as to whether Flynn violated federal law by accepting the payments, and if so, to start the process of recovering that money. Chaffetz also asked the Army to say why it hasn't yet made a determination as to the legality of Flynn's payments from RT given that they have been widely reported for at least two years. He also wants the Army to disclose any other investigations it's launched since 2010 into similar legal violations. The committee's inquiry is one of several congressional investigations into Flynn's contacts with foreign officials. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to inform senior administration officials about his contacts with Russian officials — contacts that are being examined as part of the wider inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Thursday, 18 House Democrats on the oversight committee signed a letter calling on Chaffetz to do more to pressure the White House to release documents regarding Flynn. "There is obviously a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow," the Democrats wrote in the letter. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer rebuffed criticism from Cummings that the White House was covering up. Asked about Trump administration vetting, Spicer appeared to shift blame onto the Obama administration, which had fired Flynn as head of the DIA. "Why would you re-run a background check on someone who is the head of the Department of Defense Intelligence Agency that had and did maintain a high-level security clearance?" Spicer asked. He noted that Flynn's security clearance was renewed during the Obama administration "with all of the information that's being discussed that occurred in 2015." The White House recently told the committee that documents the lawmakers sought would not be turned over because they contained classified information or were not relevant to the committee's investigation. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

His latest event was London Business School Africa Business Summit where he spoke on Saturday, 22 April, 2017 about entrepreneurship, and creating opportunities and solutions that meet Africa’s most pressing needs. The summit attracted speakers including Bob Collymore – CEO of Safaricom, the largest telecom operator and mobile money bank in Kenya; Dr. Oba Otudeko – Chairman of Honeywell Group; Segun Agbaje – CEO of Guaranty Trust Bank Plc.; and Jay Ireland – President & CEO of GE Africa. Before this, Williams had spoken at the Said Business School, Oxford on 11 April; Harvard University, Boston on 1 April; and delivered Keynote Addresses at the Face Africa Wash Gala, New York on 25 March and Columbia University, New York on 1 April. “Critical tensions are best,” he said at Harvard. “They present the best opportunities. Ideas born to solve problems have higher chances to succeed. And that’s the model we’ve always adopted for all our work. So when we came up with The Future Awards Africa, it was at a time when Nigeria’s youth mirrored a discontent across the continent that led to loss of hope and identity. The awards created a massive pop culture platform that revived the hope of Africa’s citizens and built an inspiring new narrative of young leaders. “There are too many problems in countries in Africa for anyone to be waiting for someone to describe the opportunities that exist at home. The country you are in was built by people who reached into their soul, responded to the call of necessity and invented the future.” His tour continues this week. He is a guest at Yale University’s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs on Wednesday, 26 April where he will be speaking about nation-building and Africa’s electoral future. “A political communications company that has worked on 3 ground breaking presidential campaigns as a communications strategist including President Buhari’s 2015 campaign in Nigeria and President Akufo-Addo in Ghana, which successfully defeated heavily favoured incumbent presidents,” the Institute notes. “Adebola is behind numerous African presidents’ successful election campaigns. He is revolutionizing campaigning in Africa and he will share a wealth of knowledge with us over what promises to be an informative and entertaining evening. Eddie Mandhry, who leads Yale’s Africa Initiative, will moderate the discussion. Students will have an opportunity to engage with Adebola throughout and learn from his vast experience.” Williams will end this phase of his tour with a panel at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business’ Emerging Markets Summit on 29 April, 2017.
