They pointed a beam of X-rays at a piece of an Intel processor and were able to reconstruct the chip’s warren of transistors and wiring in three dimensions. In the future, the team says, this imaging technique could be extended to create high-resolution, large-scale images of the interiors of chips.  The technique is a significant departure from the way the chip industry currently looks inside finished chips, in order to reverse engineer them or check that their own intellectual property hasn’t been misused. Today, reverse engineering outfits progressively remove layers of a processor and take electron microscope images of one small patch of the chip at a time. But “all it takes is a few more years of this kind of work, and you'll pop in your chip and out comes the schematic,” says Anthony Levi of the University of Southern California. “Total transparency in chip manufacturing is on the horizon. This is going to force a rethink of what computing is”, he says, and what it means for a company to add value in the computing industry. Even if this approach isn’t widely adopted to tear down competitors’ chips, it could find a use in other applications. One of those is verifying that a chip only has the features it is intended to have, and that a “hardware Trojan”—added circuitry that could be used for malicious purposes—hasn’t been introduced.  The work, which was published this week in the journal Nature, was conducted at the Paul Scherrer Institute’s Swiss Light Source. The facility is a synchrotron; it accelerates electrons around a ring at close to the speed of light in order to generate beams of X-rays. To produce a 3D rendering of the Intel chip—an Intel G3260 processor—the team shined an X-ray beam through a portion of the chip. The various circuit components—its copper wires and silicon transistors, for example—scatter the light in different ways and cause constructive and destructive interference. Through a technique called X-ray ptychography, the researchers could point the beam at their sample from a number of different angles and use the resulting diffraction patterns to reconstruct chip’s internal structure. They began their experiments with a chip they knew the structure of—an ASIC developed at the institute to read out data from a light detector. The team found an excellent match between the chip design and their measurements, and they were able to identify and study the features of a particular circuit inside the chip in fine detail. Image: Mirko Holler A reconstruction of a set-reset latch in the ASIC chip that the team imaged Then they moved on to image circuitry inside the Intel processor, about which they had limited information. The ASIC was produced using 110-nanometer chip manufacturing technology, more than a decade from being cutting edge. But the Intel chip was just a couple of generations behind the state of the art: It was produced using the company’s 22-nm process. (Intel then jumped to 14nm and 10nm is now in the works.) The resolution for this technique in any one direction is 14.6 nm, which rended individual transistor components fairly blurry. The resolution can be improved, but it may be a race to stay close to the smallest features in the chip industry: per Moore’s Law, chip dimensions have gotten smaller since 22nm and continue to do so. This is not the first time that researchers have attempted to use X-rays to image the interior of integrated circuits, says team member Gabriel Aeppli. But “the resolution is better than it’s been in the past. The scale is also larger,” he says. “It’s a huge chunk of the chip compared to what you could do with any other technique.” In this proof-of-concept, the team was using an experimental set-up that was optimized for cylindrical samples, and they had to carve a 10-micrometer-wide pillar out of the chip in order for the imaging process to work. But in the future, the group aims to move toward a different geometry that will allow them to image circuitry without having to damage the chip. Image: Mirko Holler A view of a 10-micrometer-wide pillar carved from the Intel G3260 processor, prior to its extraction. The team expects that changes to the experimental geometry will allow them to image circuitry without cutting into chips. The imaging itself was no small feat. The sample has to remain stable, and interferometers must be used to continuously measure its position. It took about 24 hours to perform the X-ray measurements and the data processing took about as long, says team leader Mirko Holler. But additional computers should easily speed the processing, he says. And improvements to X-ray sources as well as other parts of the experimental apparatus could improve the imaging speed by a factor of 1000. “I don’t see any other probe that could image a full processor without slicing it up,” says Jerry Hastings, a professor at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif. “You need something that simultaneously gives you the resolution and the penetrating power. And that’s where X-rays are unique.” “What they’ve done is a proof of concept and it’s quite impressive at that level”, says Dick James, an emeritus fellow at TechInsights, which strips chips down to the transistor level to examine how the devices are built and wired together.  James says there are practical limitations to the amount of circuitry that can be analyzed using those traditional tear-down techniques, which, depending on the packaging, can start with a bath in boiling sulphuric acid. But he notes a lot can be gleaned by piecing together small electron microscope pictures of the chip: “You can get most of the cell library by looking at smaller areas.”  And even with a perfect image of an entire chip, there will be some things you can’t know about how the chip was made. “So many steps are sacrificial,” James says. “Unless there’s some sort of residue or fingerprint left by a process, you can’t actually see what’s been done. You just have to infer it from the structures that are left behind.” Although X-ray ptychography does promise bigger, high-resolution views, it faces several obstacles, James says. For one, chip feature sizes at the cutting edge could prove a challenge for its resolution. “The industry is getting ahead of this technique already,” he says. Another impediment is the need for a synchrotron source. These aren’t likely to find their way into chipmaking fabs, although there are a number of such facilities around the world and it is possible to rent time on them. Because of these limitations, James says, the best application for this imaging technique could be on chips that are made with older manufacturing processes, and thus have larger features. This is the case for a number of chips used in military and space applications. “If you can look at the whole chip, then you can compare the chip with the original design,” James says, and “do a direct comparison [to] see if there are any obvious faults or any extra circuitry that’s been put in.” Learn More Intel X-ray imaging X-ray ptychography chip inspection integrated circuits intellectual property ptychography reverse-engineering tomography trade secrets Comments Comment Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> Comments powered by Disqus Advertisement Nanoclast IEEE Spectrum’s nanotechnology blog, featuring news and analysis about the development, applications, and future of science and technology at the nanoscale.

Of the Intel, Toshiba, and Samsung NVMe solid-state drives he has tested so far, he comes out recommending Samsung SSDs for performance, value, and safety. Matthew Dillon commented, "The Intel 600P is a piece of junk (never buy one), and while the Toshiba did very well in performance tests it also got rather hot, topping out at 81C, and didn't flag the over-heat or auto-throttle insofar as I can tell. The Intel actually did auto-throttle. Neither Samsung over-temp'd. The 960 EVO stayed very cool, in fact." You can read his thoughts on different NVMe SSDs under DragonFlyBSD via this mailing list post that's backed up by a lot of additional technical results. He seems to have much better luck than I did with the Samsung 960 EVO, which ended up dieing after a few days of use last year, but haven't been able to RMA yet since the Samsung SSD RMA web form was broken at last check... 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

After launching an opening salvo of models equipped with the latest chipsets from Intel, MSI has now released another motherboard for gamers looking to overclock a high-performance Core processor: the Z270 MPower Gaming Titanium. The board's Titanium branding doesn't just refer to the the silver metallic PCB, heatsinks, and covers. A board-wide backplate and three steel-reinforced PCIe x16 slots all help to ensure that heavy CPU coolers and graphics cards don't bend the PCB. The four memory slots have similar physical protection and come with fully-isolated memory circuits, earning the MPower Titanium a rating for memory up to DDR4-4000. MSI claims that it's even tested stable speeds beyond that mark, too. There's also SLI and Crossfire support on tap for those with a need for extra pixel-pushing power. The board has a total of three M.2 slots and a U.2 connector, all supporting NVMe SSDs and Intel's Optane Memory. One of them comes with a heat shield that latches down on top of an SSD and might help reduce thermal throttling. MSI also makes a play to appeal to audiophiles. There are dual Realtek ALC1220 audio codecs, each with its own amplifier—one for the rear-panel ports and another one for the front panel connectors. MSI claims that its electrically-isolated audio PCB traces help improve sound quality. Since setting up USB ports for a virtual-reality setup apparently takes some planning, MSI includes a USB 3.0 port on the back panel that it says has been optimized for VR. The company claims that a chip aboard the MPower Titanium ensures that this USB port has a clean and strong signal. The board offers plenty of USB ports all told: two USB 2.0 connectors, three USB 3.0 ports, one USB 3.1 Type-A connectors, and two USB 3.1 Type-C ports. Network connectivity comes by way of a Killer E2500 Gigabit Ethernet adapter. Other niceties include an external clock generator for BLCK tuning, voltage measurement points, onboard diagnostic LEDs and buttons, of course, RGB LED lighting. MSI says the Z270 MPower Titanium should be available right away, but we haven't spotted one for sale at online retailers yet. However, B&H Photo Video will let interested buyers preorder one for $330. Tags: Motherboards Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

So I should spend my hard earned money on inferior hardware in order to support some fanboi’s favourite multinational corporation in its failing attempts to earn more than another? We’d all like to see real competition driving CPU innovation but wishful thinking and ‘supporting’ a so called little guy like a football team will just prolong stagnation.

Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

I played every single game I tried without problems. Of course the performance wasn’t exactly desirable after, I don’t know, 2013. But they worked flawlessly, both as CPU/GPU and as a great space heater. Damn, those things get hot. They worked, though.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules). Right click the process in the details tab in task manager -> Set affinity Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 13:43 MajorLag says: There’s a few things about this that seem strange to me. Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 17:33 MajorLag says: Yeah, that makes sense given their reputation as “basically a mediocre PC”. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 14:03 carewolf says: More a netbook CPU than a normal laptop CPU. But with 8 cores it is more like 4-8 netbook CPUs. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 15:16 pistachio says: Competition is always good but I am just too satisfied an Intel customer to switch to AMD. The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 18:51 waltC says: Just as was true for the original Athlon, it will take a bit of time for game developers to optimize for Ryzen and for the proper Ryzen compilers to make the developer circuit. In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

Twitter Facebook Intel claims storage speed record with first large-capacity Optane SSD The Optane DC P4800X SSD has 375GB of storage and is priced at $1,520 Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 20 March, 2017 03:00 - - - - print email Comments Intel's first Optane storage modules came out in early January, but were only 32GB. Larger Optane drives with up to 1.5TB of storage capacity are on their way, and we now have a better understanding of how they're going to perform. The first large-capacity Optane SSD drive is the DC P4800X, which has 375GB of storage and started shipping on Sunday. The $1,520 SSD is targeted at servers. (Intel didn't provide regional availability information.) Intel says an enterprise Optane SSD with 750GB will ship in the second quarter, and that a 1.5TB SSD will ship in the second half of this year. These SSDs will fit as add-in cards in the PCI-Express/NVMe and U.2 slots. That means they could work in some workstations and servers based on AMD's 32-core Naples processors. Optane will also ship in the form of DRAM modules next year. Intel did not share information on when it would ship consumer SSDs.Â  Optane has been hyped as a new class of superfast memory and storage that could replace today's SSDs and DRAM. Intel has claimed Optane is up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. The technology underpinning Optane is 3D Xpoint, a form of memory that stores data based on the resistance of cells. Intel developed 3D Xpoint with Micron, which later this year will release an Optane competitor called QuantX, aimed at enterprise SSDs. For the first time, Intel has shared internal benchmarks on the large-capacity Optane drives compared to conventional flash SSDs. TheÂ Optane SSD DC P4800X was pitted against the three-year old SSD DC P3700 flash SSD, which is considered one of Intel's fastest data-center SSDs in terms of random reads and writes. The benchmarks indicate that the new Optane drive, in most real-world uses, won't reach the levels of performance that Intel has been hyping up to now. On top of that, the benchmarks were conducted in complex environments that made the numbers hard to interpret. In a nutshell, Intel said that if you run sequential tasks, it would be better to use conventional SSDs. Optane lights up when running random reads and writes, which are common in servers and high-end PCs. Optane's random writes reach up to 10 times faster compared to conventional SSDs, but only when utilization is being pushed to extremes, while reads are around three times faster. In a standard 4K data block, with 70 percent read and 30 percent write, the P4800X was five to eight times faster than the older P3700. The responsiveness of the drive increased with the data load. Aside from the unusual benchmarking presentation by Intel, Optane has promise, and it could be the storage technology of the future. However, flash-based SSDs are well-established and Optane won't unseat them overnight, according to analysts. Optane is more expensive and still being developed, and joins the ranks of other technologies like MRAM (magnetoresistive RAM) and RRAM (resistive RAM) trying to unseat flash. Intel took a long time to develop large-capacity Optane SSDs, and there is some concern about the drive's durability. The P4800X has a five-year warranty, but it remains to be seen how long the drive will last. Optane SSDs will speed up data movement among servers in data centers, said James Myers, director for NVM Solutions Architecture at Intel's Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. Storage is a big bottleneck, and the Optane SSDs will reduce latency. That will improve the productivity of servers, and will help in applications like analytics, which deal with large data sets. Optane could be used for for caching or long-term or short-term storage. Optane SSDs could also be used to expand memory capacity in servers by mimicking DRAM with the help of a hypervisor, Myers said. To make this happen, Intel will sell software called Memory Drive for Optane drives. This feature will only work on servers with Intel's upcoming Xeon chips based on the Skylake architecture, and won't work with AMD chips. Applications that will benefit from Optane include MySQL and Memcached, which are popular with cloud providers. Data movement in servers run by companies like Facebook and Google is fast to ensure instant responses to social media or search requests. Intel's Myers also saw the storage fitting into hyperconverged environments, in which Optane is closer to the CPU, or in an array. Optane isn't a particularly good fit for typical networked storage arrays like EMC's EqualLogic, which are extremely popular, but Myers is pinning hopes on companies moving to hyperconverged infrastructures. Intel estimated that two servers with P4800X drives could provide 10 times more MySQL transactions than with P3700 SSDs. It would also result in a 91 percent reduction in cost per transaction. But there's a heavy cost involved in changing the data-center infrastructure to fit the superfast Optane drives. In the long run, the Optane drives may be beneficial in speeding up database, cloud and machine-learning applications, but switching over to a hyperconverged environment could call for wholesale changes in server hardware, virtualization environment, and organization of storage in data centers. Also, Optane SSDs don't play well in in-memory applications like SAP HANA. In theory, the Memory Drive feature could be used so the Optane SSDs mimic DRAM, which can ultimately be used by in-memory applications. Intel is in talks with major in-memory application providers to build usage of Optane SSDs, Myers said. Companies are increasingly backing Optane, Myers said. Facebook has been trying out Optane for more than a year, but hasn't reported results. IBM has incorporated Optane storage in its Bluemix cloud service, but hasn't talked about benchmarks. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is going to offer Optane SSDs as a media option in 3PAR arrays. The current latency for all-flash arrays is about 400 microseconds to 1 millisecond, and with 3D Xpoint/Optane it will come down to 200 microseconds, said HPE's Eduardo Duarte, 3Par product manager, in a video at the Discover trade show in London in December. Optane compatibility will also be validated for VMware's vSAN virtualized storage environments. Alibaba also has committed to using Optane in its database and machine-learning infrastructure, Myers said. Intel is also talking with Microsoft to validate Optane for Windows Server storage environments. In addition, a range of companies including Lenovo, Nutanix and Dell Technologies have confirmed that they will come out with hardware based on Optane. Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Exclusive  ⋮  Hardware  ⋮  Leak Intel’s Skylake-EP Xeon E5 2699 v5 Monster Flagship With 32 Cores / 64 Threads Gets Performance Leaked By Usman Pirzada 11 hours ago 31Shares Share Tweet Submit A Geekbench performance test of a monster chip from Intel has leaked out (thanks for the tip, Shaun Fosmark). While the exact nomenclature of the chip is not known, it appears to be a Skylake-EP Xeon part that was sent to the Google Compute Engine team for initial prototyping. This is consistent with the news we have been hearing about Google Compute Engine now offering extended core counts to clients of their service. Intel’s massive Skylake Purley flagship, the Xeon E5 2699 v5, spotted in Geekbench database The chip manages to score an outstanding 49,647 points for all-core score and 3526 points on the single core score. Usually these Xeon chips don’t fare as well in the single core department but this particular CPU is something special and for good measure as well (as you will read later in the article). This score is probably one of the highest all-core scores (if not the highest) on Geekbench for a single socket, single package CPU and showcase very impressive performance numbers. Before we go on any further here are the screenshots of the benchmark score itself: Related Intel’s ‘Skylake Purley’ Family of Microprocessors Will Boast upto 28 Cores and 56 Threads – Next Generation Xeon Platform Landing in 2016 The leak only states that the tested CPU houses 32 cores (eliminating a 2S benchmark) which makes it one of the hugest dies we have seen from Intel. What is so mysterious about this particular chip is that the documentation of the Skylake Purley platform we have states that it maxes out at 28 cores/56 threads. This leak however, aims to challenge that statement since the Family 6 Model 63 designation puts it solidly in the Xeon family and the only place where such a processor could fit in is the Xeon E5-2699 flagship. Since this is a Skylake part it will have the “V5” suffix as well, for a full branding of Xeon E5 2699 v5. That said, even though the documentation maxes out at 28 cores/56 threads, we have previously spotted the processor on a Chinese forum and it is very much real. This processor has a base clock of 2.10 GHz and it has a pretty PCB since it’s designed for the latest LGA 3647 socket. The more interesting thing about this processor is its core count which shatters everything that Intel has done before. Advertisement In fact, one of the reasons Intel has increased the flagship core count is because AMD will be rolling out its Naples chip very soon and it will be boasting 32 cores under one CPU package as well. Since 2S and 4S designs usually have additional complications involved, a maximum number of cores under one CPU package is always desirable. Intel announced general availability of Skylake-EP chips in mid 2017 and we expect a launch around Computex 2017. Intel has made several HPC focused optimizations in Skylake-EP chips, some of which include Advanced Vector Instructions-512 to boost floating point calculations and encryption algorithms. Related Massive Intel Xeon E5 and Xeon E7 Leak – Skylake Purley to be the Biggest Advancement Since Nehalem Some more details of the Skylake Purley platform The Skylake Purley platform will be divided between three major categories 2S, 4S and 8S/8S+. This includes the family range from Xeon E5 to Xeon E7. The expected nomenclature should assume the ‘v5’ suffix thanks to the Skylake microarchitecture present in the processors and include the lineups of Xeon E5 2600 v5, Xeon E5 4600 v5, Xeon E7 4800 v5 and Xeon E7 8800 v5. The E5 family includes the dual socket and quad socket designs (2S and 4S) whileas the E7 family includes the 8 socket design structure with the C602 chipset and a scalable memory buffer. One of the biggest advancements that Skylake will have is the Intel Omnipath Architecture integration which will be called Storm Lake (Generation 1). The PCH will be codenamed Lewisburg while as it will also ship with updated Ethernet controllers. Another very important point to note is that the platform will be scalable up to 8 Sockets – which is frankly an absolutely insane amount for CPUs working in tandem in any given configuration. Specific SKUs have not been disclosed at this time. Since we already have in our possession the complete slide deck of this platform, I have taken the liberty to post the important bits here: Skylake EX Purley will be spread out amongst the entire scalable segment – unlike the previous iterations. The TDP will be configurable from 45W to 165W and will require Socket P. Another interesting point to note is the fact that not only will Purley update the number of PCIe slots to 48 but they will finally be configurable in x4, x8 and x16 divisions ( a major update). Previous reports had hinted on Intel working on some secret project that will prove Skylake to be quite a big architectural jump and not simply another Harwell. While we haven’t seen any evidence of this revolutionary change on the mainstream side – Skylake Purley does appear to be the aforementioned jump, incarnate. According to Intel’s own slides, Skylake Purley is poised to be the biggest update since the age old Nehalem platform. Along with the improved performance per watt that comes with every article iteration, Skylake EX Purley will actually ship with 6 Channels of DDR4 as opposed to 4. It will also include the AVX 512 instruction set and will boast the 100G OmniPath interconnect. Skylake Purley will also have Cannonlake graphics support not to mention FPGA integration (another important upgrade). The new platform also comes with an updated socket. The socket has been upgraded to feature 3647 pins that gives it the LGA 3647 name. The socket is surrounded by 12 DDR4 DIMM slots. This is due to support for next-generation hexa-channel memory and Intel’s Optane DIMMs for faster latency solutions. Overall, Purley will be expanding Intel’s server platform with a range of new features.

AMD’s new line-up of chipsets are positioned as high-performance chips for PCs Subscribe to our newsletter. Abhijit Ahaskar One of highlights of the new chipsets is the AI-powered Sense MI technology, which allows the chips to customise its performance based on how the user interacts with apps or games. After playing second fiddle to Intel in the PC segment for many years, AMD has decided to enter the high-end gaming segment with the new Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 series of processors. AMD’s chips are usually found in budget laptops while Intel dominates the high-end PC segment. Ryzen 7 series chips are now available for PC makers as well, which means we can see laptops and desktops based on them in the next couple of months. Ryzen 7 1800x is the most powerful of the lot with a base clock speed of 3.6GHz and boost clock speed of 4.0GHz. It is priced at $499 (around Rs32,716). The Ryzen 7 1700X and Ryzen 7 1700 have lower clock speeds and are priced at $399 (around Rs26,160) and $349 (around Rs22,887), respectively. There is no update on the Ryzen 3 series yet, but the Ryzen 5 series processor will be available in the market from next month. According to some reports, Microsoft will no longer support the older version of Windows such as Windows 7 and 8 on new Intel and AMD processor, including the Ryzen family chipsets. Users can still run older versions of Windows, but they will not receive any security or other updates from Microsoft. What the new line-up offers At the top of the Ryzen hierarchy sits the Ryzen 7 series which includes Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X and 1700 chips. All three are octa-core chips and are based on AMD’s new 14nm Zen architecture which is more energy efficient than the 28nm based Bulldozer architecture used in earlier AMD chips. The new chipsets also support simultaneous multi-threading (equivalent to Intel’s Hyper threading technology) which means each core can run more than one thread at a time. The cache system has also been redesigned to allow faster access to data. For users looking for more affordable options, AMD has Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 line-up of processors. The Ryzen 5 series includes four different models. The Ryzen 5 1600X and Ryzen 5 1600 are the superior hexa-core chips sets with boost clock speed of up to 4.0GHz. The Ryzen 5 1500 and Ryzen 5 1400 are the quad-core variants with boost clock speed of up to 3.4GHz. Artificial intelligence One of highlights of the new chipsets is the AI-powered Sense MI technology, which allows the chips to customise its performance based on how the user interacts with apps or games. It uses neural networks and software algorithms which can predict how apps and games will run based on earlier runs and monitor user and app requirements to optimise clock speeds. Lower power needs Due to the smaller architecture and improved cooling system, the Ryzen chipsets have also got a lower TDP (thermal design power), which stands for maximum power consumption. The Ryzen 7 1800X and Ryzen 7 1700x have a TDP of 95W. Ryzen 7 1700 has a TDP of 65W. What it means for users For years, AMD has been providing a more cost-effective alternative to Intel’s chips for laptops and desktop PCs. But none of its earlier products were powerful enough to compete with Intel’s top-of-the-line chipsets. The Ryzen line-up changes that, and brings in some much-needed competition. What users will have to brace up for is that AMD chips will cost more than some of Intel‘s 7th gen chipsets. For example, the Ryzen 7 1800x costs $499, while Intel’s 7th gen i7 processor costs $350 (approximately Rs22,947). This means, the new AMD-powered PCs will cost as much as the high-end Intel 7th Gen based PCs.

The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is an enterprise PCIe 3 x4 NVMe SSD that Intel promises will be the the most responsive data center SSD with lower latency than all of the fastest NAND flash based competitors. After months of touting 3D XPoint memory primarily with rough order of magnitude claims about its performance, endurance and cost relative to DRAM and NAND flash, and after some unexplained delays, Intel is finally providing some concrete specifications and pricing for a complete SSD that is shipping today. The information is more limited than we're accustomed to for their NAND flash SSDs, and Intel still isn't confirming anything about the materials or exact operating principle of the 3D XPoint memory cell. Current computer system architectures are based around the use of DRAM as working memory and NAND flash for fast storage. 3D XPoint memory falls between the two technologies on most important metrics, so Optane SSDs bring a new dimension of complication to a server architect's task. For most enterprise use cases, the most enticing feature of Optane SSDs over NAND SSDs is the former's higher performance, especially reduced latencies. Aside from the gains from switching to the NVMe protocol, the latency offered by NAND flash based SSDs has been mostly stagnant or even regressed with the disappearance of SLC NAND from the market, even as throughput and capacity have grown with every generation. The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is rated for a typical read or write latency under 10µs, compared to tens of microseconds for the best NAND flash based SSDs, and about 4µs minimum imposed by PCIe and NVMe transaction overhead. More impressive is how little latency degrades under less than ideal conditions. Queue depth 1 random reads are rated to remain below 30µs even while the drive is simultaneously accepting 2GB/s of sustained random writes (about 500k IOPS). Intel even specifies Quality of Service (QoS) standards for latency at the 99.999th percentile, with even QD16 random writes staying almost entirely below 200µs. A consequence of the low latency is that the P4800X can deliver full throughput at lower queue depths: the P4800X is rated to deliver maximum IOPS at QD16 while flash-based SSDs are specified for queue depths of at least 32. Unlike flash memory, the read and write performance of 3D XPoint memory is roughly equal, and this is reflected in Intel's specifications for the P4800X. Conspicuously missing from the performance specifications are sequential throughput. The P4800X can already use more than half of the available PCIe bandwidth with a completely random I/O workload. Rather than reassure us that the P4800X can do even better with larger transfer sizes, Intel suggests that being overly concerned with the sequential transfer speeds is a sign that you should be shopping for their 3D NAND SSDs instead. They'll offer plenty of throughput for a far lower price. Intel's 3D XPoint memory is being manufactured as a 128Gb (16GB) die, slightly behind the trend for NAND flash capacities. As a result, the Optane SSD DC P4800X will start with a 375GB model and later this year be followed by 750GB and 1.5TB models. The top-performing enterprise SSDs currently tend to be multi-TB drives. Intel has shared very few details about the new controller they've developed for the P4800X, but they have disclosed that the 375GB model uses seven channels with four dies per channel, for a total of 28 chips and a raw capacity of 448GB. Fourteen packages of 3D XPoint memory are visible on the back side of the drive in the photographs Intel has released, suggesting that fourteen more packages are hiding under the heatsink and that the 375GB add-in card model is using single-die packages. The controller implements a high-performance all-hardware read path that does not involve the drive's firmware, and while the exact stride of memory accesses is not known, a single 4k read will be spread across all seven channels. 3D XPoint memory can be read or written with byte granularity and modifications can be written in place, so it is free from the worst internal fragmentation and write amplification challenges that are caused by the large page sizes and huge erase block sizes of NAND flash. This means that further overprovisioning beyond the drive's native amount will have minimal impact on performance and that the performance of a full drive should not suffer severely the way flash based SSDs do. However, some amount of spare area is still required for error correction and other metadata and for a pool of spare blocks to replace failed or defective blocks. The write endurance of 3D XPoint memory is not infinite so wear leveling is still required, but it is a much simpler process that requires much less spare area. The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X has a write endurance rating of 30 Drive Writes Per Day, and Intel is hopeful that future products can offer even higher ratings once 3D XPoint memory has more broadly proven its reliability. Today's limited release 375GB models have a three year warranty for a total write endurance rating of 12.3 PB, and once the product line is expanded to broad availability of the full range of capacities in the second half of this year the warranty period will be five years. Intel is offering the 375GB P4800X in PCIe add-in card form factor with a MSRP of $1520 starting today with a limited early-ship program. In Q2 a 375GB U.2 model will ship, as well as a 750GB add-in card. In the second half of the year the rest of the capacity and form factor options will be available, but prices and exact release dates for those models have not been announced. At just over $4/GB the P4800X seems to fall much closer to DRAM than NAND in price, though to be fair the enterprise SSDs it will compete against are all well over $1/GB and the largest DDR4 DIMMs are around $10/GB.

The Memory Drive Technology software is a custom virtual memory system implemented as a minimal hypervisor. The guest operating system or general-purpose hypervisor is presented with the illusion that a portion of the 3D XPoint memory on the Optane SSD is directly addressable, producing an apparent memory capacity that far exceeds the capacity of the system's installed DRAM. Under the hood and almost entirely transparent to the guest OS, Intel Memory Drive Technology monitors memory access patterns to cache actively used data in DRAM and prefetch from Optane SSDs. At a high level, this is merely duplicating the paging mechanisms all operating systems already provide. However, Intel claims that the heuristics used by Memory Drive Technology can far outperform those currently used by operating systems to manage swap space residing on storage that is far slower than Optane SSDs. On some workloads Intel Memory Drive Technology can offer performance approaching that of an all-DRAM memory pool of equal capacity, though this will depend highly on the specific application workload. Intel Memory Drive Technology has a substantial capacity overhead: a 375GB Optane SSD can provide up to 320GB of virtual memory. Multiple Optane SSDs can be used to provide virtual memory up to ten times the system's DRAM capacity, though Intel recommends Optane to DRAM ratios between 3:1 and 8:1. When multiple CPUs or Optane SSDs are in use, the Memory Drive Technology software will take into account non-uniform memory access (NUMA) effects and attempt to optimize data placement to put data in the DRAM or Optane SSD that is closest to the core using it. By default, the Memory Drive Technology software will present to the guest OS a NUMA topology equivalent to the underlying DRAM configuration plus a pool of memory that is not local to any of the processors, with capacity equal to the virtual memory provided by the Optane SSDs. However, this is implemented purely for the sake of allowing NUMA-aware software to adapt its usage patterns; regardless of the NUMA configuration seen by the guest software, the Memory Drive Technology software will not be statically allocating specific address ranges to DRAM or Optane storage. The approach taken by the Memory Drive Technology software allows operating systems and applications to function without modification and without requiring Optane-specific optimizations, but it also means there is no way for applications that are NUMA-aware or use system calls like madvise to communicate directly with the real memory allocator. The full licensing cost structure for Intel Memory Drive Technology is not clear, but the MSRP for a 375GB P4800X bundled with Memory Drive Technology is $1951 compared to $1520 for the SSD alone. The Memory Drive Technology hypervisor must be booted from a USB device or an IDE-compatible storage controller, and the guest operating system cannot be booted in UEFI mode. Intel Xeon E5-x6xx v2 or later and E7- x8xx v2 or later processors are supported. Future 3D XPoint-based Optane products on Intel's roadmap include Optane Memory cache drives for the client/consumer segment, due in Q2 of this year. They will also be followed by larger Optane SSDs for the client market. DIMMs featuring 3D XPoint memory are planned for 2018.

A huge downgrade from their initial presentation Reply Billy Tallis - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link I think the problem is mainly that Intel didn't do enough to emphasize the difference between the performance of the memory cell itself versus the performance achievable from an entire drive with a controller and with protocol overhead. The PCIe bus doesn't really allow for a 1000x improvement in latency over existing NVMe SSDs. We'll have to wait for the 3D XPoint DIMMs before we can conclusively declare that they've missed that performance goal. It does look like the endurance is falling well short of their projections, but the density has pretty much hit the target. Reply eSyr - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link > PCIe bus doesn't really allow for a 1000x improvement in latency over existing NVMe SSDs Bullshit. PCIe 3.0 has a round-trip latency less than 300 ns and sustained bandwidth more than 11 GB/s for 64-bit reads and more than 15 GB/s for 4K reads, it's more than sustained bandwidth of single DDR4 channel. Reply IntelUser2000 - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link Yes, the hardware latency might be low, but it's the software part that slows it down. Even Intel's own presentations show this. https://www.google.ca/search?q=3d+xpoint&clien... Besides, if there truly was no difference between having it on a DIMM format and PCI Express, why not simplify things and put DDR4 on PCI Express as well? Reply ddriver - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link PCIE is really serial bulk transfer, whereas RAM is... well, Random Access. Plus the additional interface overhead, rather than having the MC directly connected to the CPU it will have to go through the PCIE protocol too. Plus eating up from the CPUs IO bandwidth to the point of starving the rest of the system. It will likely be faster in DIMM mode, not but that much because it avoids the bottleneck of PCIE per se, but because of the increased parallelism and the direct connection to the CPU via the MC. Reply Bullwinkle J Moose - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link All I want is long term storage Give me a 20TB external X-Point backup drive with a write protect switch and enough onboard RAM to handle temporary writes while in READ ONLY mode ....and I want it for less than $200 Otherwise, just give me a PCIe 4.0 X 16 X-Point Drive for gaming with 30GB/sec load speeds for the same price Using this for persistent RAM makes no sense to me persistent malware will be there forever Latencies should improve "somewhat" over Flash based SSD's for gaming (regardless of interface) but I'm looking for better load times and LONG TERM storage! AT A MUCHHHHH LOWER PRICE! Reply kawmic - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link I'm with you man! Way too expensive. Reply Samus - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link Serial memory interfaces have come and gone (Rambus) but HBM is serial. The bus is just ultra wide to make up for it. However, latency is definitely slower and that needs to be compensated for by the memory controller (currently, GPU's) I think Intel's approach here won't be limited by PCIe. Not in the least. Current Xpoint is turning out to be pretty low performance from what we were all (I think) speculating. It turns out it's benefits are durability (30 DWPD!) and low latency due to a simplified indirection table to read/write architecture that writes to cells not pages. This is very cool, but is simply out of the realm of most platforms. Even PCIe SSD's are overkill for most applications because unless you are hosting a database, or manipulating large files (large random IO) a SATA3 SSD already performs well enough to host an OS and applications. After all the entire Windows 10 OS can be transferred over SATA3 in 6 seconds, and you only need to read about 1GB into memory to complete a boot to login. Most large game maps are 2-3GB total (textures to load into VRAM) and they can only be done 3-5 seconds faster by the fastest mainstream NVMe drive over the fastest mainstream SATA3 drive (1800MB/sec vs 560MB/sec) That's the most reasonable scenario a desktop user is going to notice a large enough difference to justify the cost of NVMe. This will change in the future as programs get larger but the cost to NVMe still isn't justifyable for the majority of applications. Reply TelstarTOS - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link "pretty low performance" has to be seen yet. If the numbers at QD1 and QD2 are about half those announced at QD16 it will be awesome in a real world scenario. Reply beginner99 - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link Exactly. Especially also for a client PC. First time in a long time one will actually be able to see a difference between SSDs. But yeah, obviously not worth the price yet. The real deal for consumers as far as we know will be 32-64 GB cache drives. But looks like that software needs some serious work for this to happens as UEFI for sure is a must on consumer devices.

Of course, big promises begot high expectations, and despite a hunger for more information, we've heard relatively little about how 3D Xpoint will perform in the intervening time. That all changes today. 3D Xpoint will power Intel's first Optane device, the SSD DC P4800X, and that device demonstrates the wide-ranging potential of Optane to change how we think about the balance between memory and storage in a system. Optane from the ground up The SSD DC P4800X launching today packs 375GB of 3D Xpoint storage on a PCIe add-in card form factor. Intel is keeping the physical details of its Xpoint media under wraps, but we do know some of the basics of the stuff now. The first Xpoint dies are being fabricated on a 20-nanometer process and can hold 128 Gbits each. Intel says that because the Xpoint medium itself relies on low-resistance and low-capacitance interconnects in the back end of the device, it can switch a thousand times faster than NAND. Consequently, Xpoint delivers much lower access times and much higher performance. 3D Xpoint also offers much finer access granularity than NAND. Instead of working on pages with many kilobytes of data as NAND does, Intel says the structure of the Xpoint device allows for bit-level access. Practically, that means Xpoint can work with words of data, so it's a natural fit for delivering cache lines like DRAM does. Even though it's not as fast as DRAM, Xpoint can be manufactured with 10 times the density of that memory, giving it NAND-class capacity. Intel also says that chip-for-chip, Xpoint is a thousand times more durable compared to 3D NAND. Of course, Xpoint is non-volatile like NAND, as well. Xpoint is just one piece of the puzzle for Optane products, however. Intel has developed a custom controller to take advantage of the unique properties of the Xpoint material. For the DC P4800X, the controller talks over PCI Express using the NVMe protocol. Like an SSD controller, Optane products use multiple channels with multiple dies per channel to exploit parallelism for greater performance. However, Optane's controller ASIC handles both data and commands exclusively in hardware to deliver the full performance of Xpoint media (at least the performance possible on the PCI Express 3.0 bus). The Optane controller can also spread a 4KB read operation over all of its dies, which Intel contrasts with the single-die read handling of NAND. Thanks to Xpoint's fine-grained access characteristics, Optane devices can also write in place on the underlying medium, unlike NAND's read-modify-write cycle at the block level. In turn, Xpoint should match its higher performance with high endurance. With a drive as fast as the P4800X, Intel believes that up to 30 drive writes per day is going to be adequate endurance for the types of applications it believes will benefit from Xpoint's performance. With a rated maximum of 12.3 petabytes written, that means the 375GB DC P4800X drive could endure 30 DWPD for three years of constant use by our calculations. It's worth noting that the projected endurance figures in the graphs above come from the 750GB P4800X, not the 375GB drive. Larger drives should enjoy a greater total petabytes written figure if Xpoint endurance scaling is similar to that of NAND. The best-case NAND endurance figure, on the other hand, comes from Intel's DC P3700 800GB and its 14.6 PBW figure, good for 10 DWPD. The 375GB P4800X uses a seven-channel controller with four dies of 3D Xpoint per channel for 28 dies total. Although Xpoint devices don't require overprovisioning like NAND SSDs, the P4800X still reserves some extra space for ECC, firmware, and reallocation of bad regions of its total storage pool.

Larger Optane drives with up to 1.5TB of storage capacity are on their way, and we now have a better understanding of how they're going to perform. The first large-capacity Optane SSD drive is the DC P4800X, which has 375GB of storage and started shipping on Sunday. The $1,520 SSD is targeted at servers. (Intel didn't provide regional availability information.) Intel says an enterprise Optane SSD with 750GB will ship in the second quarter, and that a 1.5TB SSD will ship in the second half of this year. These SSDs will fit as add-in cards in the PCI-Express/NVMe and U.2 slots. That means they could work in some workstations and servers based on AMD's 32-core Naples processors. Optane will also ship in the form of DRAM modules next year. Intel did not share information on when it would ship consumer SSDs.Â  Optane has been hyped as a new class of superfast memory and storage that could replace today's SSDs and DRAM. Intel has claimed Optane is up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. The technology underpinning Optane is 3D Xpoint, a form of memory that stores data based on the resistance of cells. Intel developed 3D Xpoint with Micron, which later this year will release an Optane competitor called QuantX, aimed at enterprise SSDs. For the first time, Intel has shared internal benchmarks on the large-capacity Optane drives compared to conventional flash SSDs. TheÂ Optane SSD DC P4800X was pitted against the three-year old SSD DC P3700 flash SSD, which is considered one of Intel's fastest data-center SSDs in terms of random reads and writes. The benchmarks indicate that the new Optane drive, in most real-world uses, won't reach the levels of performance that Intel has been hyping up to now. On top of that, the benchmarks were conducted in complex environments that made the numbers hard to interpret. In a nutshell, Intel said that if you run sequential tasks, it would be better to use conventional SSDs. Optane lights up when running random reads and writes, which are common in servers and high-end PCs. Optane's random writes reach up to 10 times faster compared to conventional SSDs, but only when utilization is being pushed to extremes, while reads are around three times faster. In a standard 4K data block, with 70 percent read and 30 percent write, the P4800X was five to eight times faster than the older P3700. The responsiveness of the drive increased with the data load. Aside from the unusual benchmarking presentation by Intel, Optane has promise, and it could be the storage technology of the future. However, flash-based SSDs are well-established and Optane won't unseat them overnight, according to analysts. Optane is more expensive and still being developed, and joins the ranks of other technologies like MRAM (magnetoresistive RAM) and RRAM (resistive RAM) trying to unseat flash. Intel took a long time to develop large-capacity Optane SSDs, and there is some concern about the drive's durability. The P4800X has a five-year warranty, but it remains to be seen how long the drive will last. Optane SSDs will speed up data movement among servers in data centers, said James Myers, director for NVM Solutions Architecture at Intel's Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. Storage is a big bottleneck, and the Optane SSDs will reduce latency. That will improve the productivity of servers, and will help in applications like analytics, which deal with large data sets. Optane could be used for for caching or long-term or short-term storage. Optane SSDs could also be used to expand memory capacity in servers by mimicking DRAM with the help of a hypervisor, Myers said. To make this happen, Intel will sell software called Memory Drive for Optane drives. This feature will only work on servers with Intel's upcoming Xeon chips based on the Skylake architecture, and won't work with AMD chips. Applications that will benefit from Optane include MySQL and Memcached, which are popular with cloud providers. Data movement in servers run by companies like Facebook and Google is fast to ensure instant responses to social media or search requests. Intel's Myers also saw the storage fitting into hyperconverged environments, in which Optane is closer to the CPU, or in an array. Optane isn't a particularly good fit for typical networked storage arrays like EMC's EqualLogic, which are extremely popular, but Myers is pinning hopes on companies moving to hyperconverged infrastructures. Intel estimated that two servers with P4800X drives could provide 10 times more MySQL transactions than with P3700 SSDs. It would also result in a 91 percent reduction in cost per transaction. But there's a heavy cost involved in changing the data-center infrastructure to fit the superfast Optane drives. In the long run, the Optane drives may be beneficial in speeding up database, cloud and machine-learning applications, but switching over to a hyperconverged environment could call for wholesale changes in server hardware, virtualization environment, and organization of storage in data centers. Also, Optane SSDs don't play well in in-memory applications like SAP HANA. In theory, the Memory Drive feature could be used so the Optane SSDs mimic DRAM, which can ultimately be used by in-memory applications. Intel is in talks with major in-memory application providers to build usage of Optane SSDs, Myers said. Companies are increasingly backing Optane, Myers said. Facebook has been trying out Optane for more than a year, but hasn't reported results. IBM has incorporated Optane storage in its Bluemix cloud service, but hasn't talked about benchmarks. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is going to offer Optane SSDs as a media option in 3PAR arrays. The current latency for all-flash arrays is about 400 microseconds to 1 millisecond, and with 3D Xpoint/Optane it will come down to 200 microseconds, said HPE's Eduardo Duarte, 3Par product manager, in a video at the Discover trade show in London in December. Optane compatibility will also be validated for VMware's vSAN virtualized storage environments. Alibaba also has committed to using Optane in its database and machine-learning infrastructure, Myers said. Intel is also talking with Microsoft to validate Optane for Windows Server storage environments. In addition, a range of companies including Lenovo, Nutanix and Dell Technologies have confirmed that they will come out with hardware based on Optane. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Intel's Myers also saw the storage fitting into hyperconverged environments, in which Optane is closer to the CPU, or in an array. Optane isn't a particularly good fit for typical networked storage arrays like EMC's EqualLogic, which are extremely popular, but Myers is pinning hopes on companies moving to hyperconverged infrastructures. Intel estimated that two servers with P4800X drives could provide 10 times more MySQL transactions than with P3700 SSDs. It would also result in a 91 percent reduction in cost per transaction. But there's a heavy cost involved in changing the data-center infrastructure to fit the superfast Optane drives. In the long run, the Optane drives may be beneficial in speeding up database, cloud and machine-learning applications, but switching over to a hyperconverged environment could call for wholesale changes in server hardware, virtualization environment, and organization of storage in data centers. Also, Optane SSDs don't play well in in-memory applications like SAP HANA. In theory, the Memory Drive feature could be used so the Optane SSDs mimic DRAM, which can ultimately be used by in-memory applications. Intel is in talks with major in-memory application providers to build usage of Optane SSDs, Myers said. Companies are increasingly backing Optane, Myers said. Facebook has been trying out Optane for more than a year, but hasn't reported results. IBM has incorporated Optane storage in its Bluemix cloud service, but hasn't talked about benchmarks. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is going to offer Optane SSDs as a media option in 3PAR arrays. The current latency for all-flash arrays is about 400 microseconds to 1 millisecond, and with 3D Xpoint/Optane it will come down to 200 microseconds, said HPE's Eduardo Duarte, 3Par product manager, in a video at the Discover trade show in London in December. Optane compatibility will also be validated for VMware's vSAN virtualized storage environments. Alibaba also has committed to using Optane in its database and machine-learning infrastructure, Myers said. Intel is also talking with Microsoft to validate Optane for Windows Server storage environments. In addition, a range of companies including Lenovo, Nutanix and Dell Technologies have confirmed that they will come out with hardware based on Optane. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X will be offered in both PCIe add-in-board and U.2 form factors, but for our article today we’ll be showing just the PCIe version. Intel is very conservative when it comes to making bold claims, but they are calling this the ‘World’s Most Responsive Data Center SSD.’ The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is a low-latency drive with responsiveness all the time thanks to high-performance at low-queue depths. Intel believes that this drive will fit the bill when it comes to fast storage and caching as well as extending memory for larger data sets to be used in the workplace. Let’s take a quick look at some of the key specifications of the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X. FEATURE SPECIFICATION Capacity 375GB Form Factor Add-in-Card (AIC); Half-height, Half-length, Low-profile Interface PCIe 3.0 x4, NVMe Latency (typical) R/W <10μs  Quality of Service (QoS): 99.999%  4kB5 Random Queue Depth 1, R/W: <60/100 μs 4kB Random Queue Depth 16, R/W: <150/200 μs  Throughput  IOPS Random 4kB R/W: Up to 550/500k IOPS Random 4kB 70/30 Mixed R/W: Up to 500k  Endurance  30 Drive Writes per day (JESD219 workload) 12.3 Petabytes Written (PBW) The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 375GB drive looks like a beast with 4kB Random speeds of up to 550,000 IOPS read and 500,000 IOPS write! The endurance on this drive is 30 drive writes per day or 12.3 Petabyts Written! Intel Optane drives using 3D Xpoint don’t need to be over-provisioned like NAND-based drives nor does any defragmentation need to be done. Intel does keep a very small amount of spare space available Intel is specifying this drive a little different as they are now focusing on low Queue Depth performance and that is where this 3D XPoint drive really separates itself from traditional NAND SSDs in the enterprise market. Intel explained that most low depth matters and highlighted that most desktop PCs (client market) use queue depths of 1-4 on a regular basis and not much more than that. The data center is actually quite similar to this as most servers are running 2-6 VM’s on a server. Inside each of those VM’s are you have 1-2 threads and maybe Intel Hyper-Threading running and you’ll find out that most of the time you are at a QD of 16 or less for most all workloads. And, that is if all those workloads are accessing the storage at the same time and that is pretty rare. Intel noted that they are seeing most data center drives are being accessed between a QD of 4-8 and as SSDs or storage media in general gets faster, those queues get shorter as the workloads can’t keep up with the drives. This is pushing the queue depths down and in mixed workloads and low queue depths the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X brings 5-8x more performance at those low queue depths. In the chart above Intel compared the new Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X with 3D Xpoint memory versus the Intel SSD DC P3700 with NAND on a 4K 70/30 mixed RW performance test at a QD of 1-16 and found that as a QD of 1 the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X was 8x faster and then at a QD of 16 it was 5x faster, so while the maximum performance ratings of the drive aren’t insane, the numbers where Intel says it matter are dramatically different. When it comes to Quality of Service (QoS) the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X has 60x better than the Intel SSD DC P3700. To get this measurement Intel ran a 4K 70/30 mixed workload and during that workload Intel is measured the read latency. This is important as the applications waiting for data as they need that data to move forward. The y-access on this chart ranges from 0-3,00 us, so the top mark is just 3 milliseconds. Intel had to zoom into this level of analysis in order to even see the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X read latency results at the bottom of the chart. The slowest transactions on the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X are equivalent to the fastest transactions on the Intel SSD DC P3700, which is pretty crazy if you think about that for a second. Intel is looking at a new concept of testing data center drives and the result of this is shown in the chart above. The scenario is a multi-tenet environment where there is a VM that is running a database and that database is being read from and you want it to be responsive. The problem is that other tenets are also accessing the same database and that impacts your responsiveness due to what they are wanting to d.  The right hand xis is an offending random right workload (top stair step line) that steps up in time over the benchmark test. Intel then measures the latency of response of the reads. You got from latencies  in the 175us to 800us range on the Intel SSD DC P3700 (blue line) and you can see the average read latency go up as the workload ramps up.  The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X (orange line) is 20us or less!  Intel stopped the test at 750 MB/s because the Intel SSD DC P3700 couldn’t handle any more than that, but the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X can maintain this performance up to 2GB/s if the chart continued that far. When it comes to endurance, the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is rated for 30 drive writes per day and that is a conservative number. This number works out to offering 2.8x more Total Bytes Written (TBW) when compared to the Intel SSD DC P3700. Intel picked 2.8x as they were using a Intel SSD DC P3700 800GB and the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 750GB, so there is a little difference in the capacity of the drives and that impacts the specification. Where does Intel see Intel Optane SSD’s being used? Intel sees customers using this drive in a couple different ways: fast storage and cache or as extended memory. The fast storage and cache applications and in the data center that is where SSDs are being used today.  You can drop this in and it can be cache or fast storage tier, where you put your database files, it is just another storage device that you can drop in and just start using. You can also use it to extend memory and that is gets a little more complicated with both the DDR and PCIe bus, but it can be done. Intel showed an example where they had two MySQL servers configured and the database was too large to fit entirely inside the RAM. They then ran  Sysbench 0.5 with a 70/30 RW split and found that that Intel SSD DC P3700 could only handle 1,395 transactions per second where the new Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X could handle to 16,480 transactions per second. That number is impressive since the only difference between the systems was the SSD and Intel shows that as a cost savings per transaction as you can see in the chart above. The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 375GB PCIe model is the only capacity that Intel is talking about today (besides the 750GB model they used in the endurance chart) and that drive will be priced at $1,520 or $4.05 per GB with limited availability today and broad availability in the second half of 2017. Intel will also be offering a 750GB version of the drive in Q2 2017 and then a 1.5TB drive in the second half of 2017. The U.2 version should start coming to market in the second quarter of this year with the 375GB model leading the way. That price is nearly 3x the cost of the Intel SSD DC P3700 400GB Drive at $799.99 shipped, but you can see there are huge performance gains to be had. Now that Intel Optane SSDs have been released for data centers it is only going to be a short period of time until we see this technology come to the client side!   Check out LegitReviews' Polls on LockerDome on LockerDome Tweets by @LegitReviews Explore Editorial Events Interviews News Forum Folding Shop Content Bluetooth Cooling Editorial Events Interviews Memory Misc Mobile Mods and Ends Motherboards News PC Cases Power Supply Press Releases Processors Reviews Storage Video Cards About Contact Us Disclaimer About Us Follow Us         Copyright © 2002-2017 LegitReviews.com - All Rights Reserved.

By: Jon Coulter | Editorials in IT/Datacenter | Posted: 1 day, 16 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Introducing Intel's Optane with the Intel DC P4800X Enterprise/Datacenter SSD   Filling the gap     Today's current storage technologies leave a technology gap in data storage tiers. DRAM is far too expensive to scale, and while NAND has the capacity and cost structure to scale, it lacks sufficient performance to function in the memory space. To address the gap, a storage solution that behaves like system memory is needed. Intel's DC P4800X Datacenter SSD is designed to fill this gap, and it is the first SSD based on 3D XPoint memory technology to hit the market. Starting today, NAND flash is relegated to a lower performance storage media.     A new non-volatile storage media     For ten years, Intel has been working on 3D XPoint technology. While Intel has declined to reveal the specific material that makes 3D XPoint what it is, we speculate that it is a form of phase-change material or "PCM." Whatever the material actually is we do not know for sure at this point, but we do know that on a cellular level that 3D XPoint is 1000x faster and 1000x more enduring than NAND flash memory. If there were a way to integrate 3D XPoint onto the CPU, we could actually see this level performance. In the real-world, actual performance is limited by bus performance.     Optane - Intel's 3D XPoint     Intel calls their 3D XPoint technology "Optane." Optane consists of 3D XPoint memory, Intel memory and storage controllers, Intel interconnect IP and Intel software. 3D XPoint memory is a joint venture between Intel and Micron (IMFT). The actual IP outside of the memory itself is separate proprietary technology.       The Intel DC P4800X Datacenter SSD     Intel's DC P4800X is the first actual product based on 3D XPoint technology to hit the market. The DC P4800X is the first product to combine the attributes of memory and storage. The DC P4800X features a 7-channel Intel ASIC controller. Performance is best with an even die to channel loading. For the 375GB drive, there are four 128Gbit media die per channel or 28 die total. Spare capacity beyond the user capacity is minimal. It is used for ECC, firmware, and ensuring reliability meets the high standards customers expect of an Intel datacenter-class SSD.   3D XPoint memory media is a write-in-place media; there is no defragmentation needed, and therefore no performance can be gained in an Intel Optane SSD by increasing spare capacity. Additionally, capacity does not factor into a performance advantage like it typically does with NAND-based SSDs. A 375GB Optane SSD performs the same as a 1.5TB Optane SSD.     The Intel DC P4800X utilizes the NVMe software stack over a PCIe Gen3 x 4 interface. The DC P4800X can reach as much as 525,000 IOPS at a queue depth of 11. Contrast this with current flash-based NVMe SSDs that reach maximum performance at queue depths of 256, and it is easy to why the DC P4800X is the world's most responsive datacenter SSD. The DC P4800X running a 70/30 mixed random workload will deliver QoS that is up to 77x better than NAND flash-based NVMe SSDs.     The DC P4800X is designed to deliver 5-8x faster performance at low queue depth workloads than current NAND flash-based SSDs. Low queue depth random performance is by far the most important performance metric because whether it be enterprise or consumer type workloads, queue depths almost never exceed four queues.     Efficiency = Cost   Efficiency is intertwined with QoS (Quality of Service).     With Intel Optane SSDs improved QoS scales transactions, resulting in up to 10x more transactions per second at same service. This translates in up to 91% lower cost per transaction. This perfectly illustrates why you cannot afford not to have Optane in your datacenter.     Using Optane SSDs to Increase System Memory Pool   Bundle Optane SSDs with Intel Memory Drive Technology.     Intel's Memory Drive Technology enables datacenters to deliver more affordable memory pools by displacing a portion of DRAM or significantly grow the size of memory pools. When bundled with the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X, Intel Memory Drive Technology transparently integrates the drive into the memory subsystem and makes the SSD appear like DRAM to the OS and applications. Due to the low latency and ultra-high endurance of the DC P4800X Series, it is optimal for use by Memory Drive Technology.     Together, the DRAM and the SSD emulate a single volatile memory pool. The software intelligently determines where data should be located in the pool to maximize performance, enabling servers to deliver performance across many workloads - even when DRAM is only supplying one-third to one-tenth of the memory pool capacity.     It turns out that Optane is everything it was cracked up to be. The Naysayers have turned out to be wrong. Intel sees Optane as creating a "New Normal." The new normal will be performance, endurance, and density that far exceeds the current normal offered by NAND flash-based storage.   Optane presents new opportunities and possibilities. Some new companies have been in waiting in "Stealth Mode" for Optane to become a reality. Without what Optane has to offer, their goals were not even feasible. As for us, we are excited to how the "New Normal" will evolve in both the consumer and enterprise space. Shopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.

The TL;DR version is that the “Optane SSD DC P4800X” will ship by year-end, starting with a 375GB product that has amazing computed random read IOPS numbers, and can work as memory or as storage. Intel says the SSD is built with 3D Xpoint media, plus its own memory, controllers, interconnect IP and Intel software; we get it; wall-to-wall chipzilla tech makes the sucker go faster for longer, etc. It claims the P4800X has "an industry leading combination of low latency, high endurance, QoS and high throughput." IT has breakthrough performance, predictably fast service, is responsive under load and has "ultra endurance." Intel is pleased with the P4800X's latency under load, saying it's much better than its previous DC P3700 SSD, with a chart to prove it; Click chart for larger version. The "ultra" endurance claim rests upon the P4800X having a 30 drive writes per day (DWPD) rating compared to a 0.5 to 10 DWPD rating for NAND SSDs. It says the P4800X has up to 2.8x more total bytes written at similar capacity to a DC P3700 SSD with its 17 DWPD for 5 years. Performance Chipzilla says the P4800x has excellent performance at low queue depth. Here's the specs: Intel claims the P4800X is 5-8x at low queue depths and this is relevant because the majority of applications generate low queue depth workloads, rather than just relying on raw IOPS. It therefore says the P4800X is "Ideal for critical applications with aggressive latency requirements." Annoyingly Intel is not providing direct performance numbers, instead relying on multiples of DC P3700 SSD performance. This is a 2D 20nm MLC (2bits/cell) NAND drive launched in June 2014. P3700 capacity points are 400GB, 800GB, 1.6TB and 2TB. Its sequential read/write IO latency is 20/20 microsecs. We’ve built a table comparing the two drives, using Intel-sourced numbers for the P3700 and then calculating the P4800X numbers using the Intel briefing multiples in the slide below. Intel slide comparing P3700 and P4800X SSD performance. All table numbers are “up to.” P3700 quality of service data can be found here and we’ve used the 400GB capacity write number. We were unable to find P3700 responsiveness under pressure numbers. Performance Category Parameter DC P3700 DC P4800X Comparative Multiple Derived P4800X Value Low Queue Depth 70/30 Mixed 150,000 8x 1,200,000 Random Read 460,000 10x 4,600,000 Random Write 175,000 3x 525,000 Quality of Service Read/Writes 99% 0.12/0.9 ms 60x 0.002/0.015 ms Reads/Writes 99.99% 4/0.5 ms 77x 0.052/0.0065 ms Responsiveness under Load 200MB/sec write pressure 12.5x ? 400MB/sec write pressure 25x ? 600MB/sec write pressure 35x ? Random Read IOPS The significant number for us here is the random read IOPS. Previously, and according to a leaked Optane P4800X datasheet, the random read IOPS were up to 550,000. Our computed value of 4,600,000 is so far away from 550,000 as to leave us incredulous. And yet Intel's Optane deck is Intel's Optane deck and Intel's DC P3700 random read IOPS number is indeed Intel's DC P3700 random read IOPS. Intel DC P3700 performance numbers. Click image for larger view. Perhaps computing a number from two "up to" numbers is taking us some way away from the real world? An expert technology exec who has been close to 3D Xpoint commented; As for Intel's claims, they are plausible. 3D Xpoint is certainly fast enough media. The question is, can their controller/firmware provide such a figure? The world's best NAND devices are around 1 million 4K random reads, at high queue depth loads. NVMe allows 64K queues each of 64K depth, and to the extent Intel has leveraged that capability, 4.6 million is certainly not out of the question. How does it compare to competing NVMe SSDs? Samsung's PM1725a NVMe SSD (48-layer 3D TLC NAND) does up to 1,050,00 random read IOPS. The next fastest we could find is Seagate's Nytro XP7200 which does 940,000. The 4.6 million number is amazing. We have asked Intel to verify it and a spokesperson said; The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is spec’d at queue depths at or below 16, which is where the figures come from on that slide. The P3700 specs are at much higher queue depths. At a QD of 16, Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is 10x better than the DC P3700. So the P4800X's random read IOPS number is less than 4,600,000 but we don't know by how much. Grrr. Moving on The 70/30 mixed IOPS value for the P3700 comes from an Intel webpage and applies to the 400GB P3700. With regard to the QoS the improvement of 60x at 90 per cent and 77x at 99.99 per cent means the difference between the two percentage levels is reduced, which is a good thing. The 3D Xpoint DC P4800X SSD Intel suggests the P4800X is used as fast storage and cache or to to bulk out DRAM, with its PCIE 3D NAND SSDS providing a tier of storage below Xpoint. Future Intel Xpoint DIMMs will also increase the memory pool in a server. The company also claims that the DC P4800X integrates transparently into memory subsystems, thanks to “Intel Memory Drive Technology” that loads after the BIOS but before the OS. That software makes it possible to create a single pool of memory comprising DRAM and the P4800X SSD to emulate a single volatile memory pool. This will work on any OS, but does need a Xeon CPU to make the magic happen. Optane SSDs can provide DRAM-like performance, it says, in select applications, such as ones with matrix multiplication with optimised data locality. Chipzilla's keen to point out Optane will be cheaper than DRAM, too. Listed OEMS for the DC P3800X include Dell EMC and HPE, both of which plans to use it as a tier of cache, plus Lenovo, Nutanix and Supermicro. As for how the P4800X' performance compares to Intel's original 3D XPoint performance claims - such as being 1,000 times faster than flash with up to 1,000 times flash's endurance and 10 times denser than conventional memory - we're bored with the whole farrago and don't intend to go there. For now Intel is only shipping the DC P4800x to special friend. Broader availability will start in the second half of this year; a 6-month window. The detailed availability info is; AIC 375GB - Initial Mar 19, broad 2H 750GB - Q2 1.5TB - 2H U.2 375GB - Q2 750GB - 2H 1.5TB - 2H We're also told that Optane will eventually make it onto DIMMs, but there's no timeframe for that happening. ® Tips and corrections 21 Comments More from The Register MacBook killer?

Peter Bright - Mar 19, 2017 4:00 pm UTC A 3D XPoint wafer. Intel reader comments 167 Share this story Intel announced today the first Optane-branded product using its new 3D XPoint memory: the catchily named Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X. It's a 375GB SSD on a PCIe card. Initial limited availability starts today, for $1520, with broad availability in the second half of the year. In the second quarter, a 750GB PCIe model, and a 375GB model in the U.2 form factor will be released, and in the second half of the year, a 1.5TB PCIe card, and 750GB and 1.5TB U.2 stick, are planned. 3D XPoint is a new kind of persistent solid state memory devised by Intel and Micron. Details on how the memory actually works remain scarce—it's generally believed to use some kind of change in resistance to record data—but its performance characteristics and technical capabilities make it appealing for a wide range of applications. When it was first announced in 2015, Intel claimed it would be 1,000 times faster than NAND flash, 10 times denser than DRAM, and 1,000 times better endurance than NAND, though without saying "faster at what" or "what kind of NAND" or anything like that. With the shipping product, these comparisons are now clearer, as one of Intel's slides make clear: 3D XPoint has about one thousandth the latency of NAND flash (or about ten times the latency of DRAM), and tens times the density of DRAM. The raw specs for the P4800X leaked in February. To summarize: it's a datacenter-oriented part, built for applications with high read/write loads, looking for low latency. The sequential transfer rates of 2400MB/s read, 2000MB/s write, are good, but some of the fastest NAND flash can pull slightly ahead. Where the P4800X excels is its ability to sustain high I/O loads, courtesy of those low latencies. Enlarge Intel SSD manufacturers often quote huge numbers of I/O operations per second (IOPS), but there's always a footnote: the figures are typically generated with queue depths of 32, which is to say, the drive is bombarded with read or write requests (depending on what is being measured) so that there are always 32 outstanding operations. With these deep queues, NAND flash SSDs can achieve 3-400,000 IOPS. The P4800X can do 550,000 read IOPS and 500,000 write IOPS, but critically, Intel says it achieves this even at low queue depths. The spec sheet figure has a queue depth of 16, and the company says that a queue depth of about 8 tends to be about the limit seen in the real world. Moreover, Intel says that the latency of each I/O operation remains low even under heavy load. 99.999 percent of operations have a read or write latency below 60 or 100 microseconds (respectively) with a queue depth of 1, rising to 150 or 200 microseconds with a queue depth of 16. Under a comparable load, Intel's own P3700 NAND SSD can only serve 99 percent of operations with a latency below about 2,800 microseconds. Likewise, under sustained write workloads, the P4800X retains its low latency for reads, whereas the read latency of the P3700 NAND steadily deteriorates as the write bandwidth increases. This already makes the Optane drive interesting for applications like caching, but Intel is aiming at more than just that. 3D XPoint is byte addressable; that is to say, each individual byte can be overwritten. This sets it apart from NAND flash. NAND is typically arranged in pages of 512, 2048, or 4096 bytes. Pages are arranged into blocks, typically of 16, 128, 256, or 512 kilobytes. Reading and writing takes place at page granularity, but each page can only be written once. To write it again, it must first be erased, and erasure takes place not at page granularity, but at block granularity. Spinning hard disks can perform reads and writes at the granularity of a sector, typically either 512 bytes (or 512 bytes plus some extra bookkeeping space), or 4096 bytes (or 4096 plus some extra). With 3D XPoint, the reads and writes can occur on individual bytes. Enlarge Intel Unlike flash, which physically wears out due to the stress placed by erases, 3D XPoint writes are non-destructive. This gives the drives much greater endurance than NAND of a comparable density, with Intel saying that Optane SSDs can safely be written 30 times per day, compared to a typical 0.5-10 whole drive writes per day. The low latency and high endurance make Optane a good fit for applications like caching and database servers. But taking further advantage of these two properties, Intel has developed a new way of using Optane. The P4800X can be used as a regular PCIe attached SSD, but Intel has developed something it calls "Memory Drive Technology" that allows the P4800X, when used in conjunction with an appropriate chipset and processor (which means you'll have to use a Xeon processor), can be used as if it were RAM. Optane's latency and bandwidth are both worse than that of DRAM, but the density is higher, and the price substantially lower. Enlarge Intel Memory Drive Technology uses a middleware layer that boots before, and is transparent to, the operating system, and it combines regular DRAM with the SSD to make a single large pool of volatile memory. For most workloads, this will be slightly slower than if the same amount of DRAM were being used, but the cost should be substantially lower, and the power consumption modestly improved. Intel even claims that some workloads will go faster; although Optane "memory" is slower than regular RAM, the middleware layer that manages the memory can move data around so that it is closer to the processor that is using it, which can assist when using NUMA configurations. The biggest benefit may be from substantially increasing the amount of physical memory in a server: 2 socket Xeon systems can hold up to 3TB of RAM, but 24TB of Optane, and 4 socket systems support up to 12TB RAM, but 48TB Optane. This could be a huge boost for applications that need truly enormous quantities of memory. If using the PCIe bus to attach storage and then use it as memory seems a bit awkward, next year Intel plans to release Optane DIMMS. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. Dell's powerful 15-inch Precision 5520 now has the latest Intel Xeon processor and NVIDIA Quadro graphics. This bulldozer of a PC with a 4K display may be your best bet if you're a graphics professional. Here's why. At first glance, you may confuse the new Dell Precision 5520 with the more common XPS 15 (9560). That's because in many ways they are the same, but with some key differences, because the Precision 5520 is aimed at enterprise and professional users rather than consumers. Those differences come down to two areas — the CPU and GPU — but there are some other fundamental differences as well. Much of this review will seem similar to my XPS 15 (9560) review, in which I rated it as one of the top and most powerful non-gamer laptops around. Here I'll focus on the Xeon processor, Quadro graphics and a few other hardware differences. XPS 15 versus Precision 5520. Which is which? About this review The Precision 5520 was supplied by Dell for this review. It features a 4K IGZO display, 32GB of RAM, Intel Xeon processor, NVIDIA Quadro graphics and 512GB of Class 50 solid-state drive (SSD). The starting price for the Precision 5520 is $1,399. The unit we evaluated in this review retails for $2,867. See at Dell Hardware choices and differences Like many professional laptops, Dell offers a full gamut of hardware options for the Precision 5520 that often mirrors those of the XPS 15 line. Dell lets you choose between the UltraSharp matte Full HD (1920 x 1080) Infinity Edge display or the UltraSharp IGZO 4K (3840 x 2160) Glossy touchscreen found in the XPS 15. The Precision 5520 looks exactly like an XPS 15 (9560). For the processor, Dell lets you configure the Precision 5520 with an Intel Core i5-7300HQ (2.5GHz and 3.5GHz Turbo), slightly faster Core i5-7440HQ (2.8GHz and 3.8GHz Turbo), or the Intel Core i7-7820HQ (2.9GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo). None of those are consumer processors, because they bring support for Intel vPro and Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX-NI) technology. Both technologies are important to different groups, namely enterprise, programmers and other professionals. They have no practical consumer application. Dell Precision 5520 specifications Category Dell Precision 5520 Processor Intel Core i5-7300HQ (2.5GHz and 3.5GHz Turbo) Intel Core i5-7440HQ (2.8GHz and 3.8GHz Turbo) Intel Core i7-7820HQ (2.9GH and 3.9GHz Turbo) Intel Xeon E3-1505M v6 (3.0GHz and 4.0GHz Turbo) Internal storage Up to 1TB SSD SATA, Class 40, Class 50 PCIe at various sizes RAM 8GB ,16GB, or 32GB DDR4 2400 MHz 2 DIMMs Display 1080p matte, non-touch 4K glossy, full touch Graphics Intel HD Discrete graphics NVIDIA Quadro M1200 4GB GDDR5 Ports HDMI 1.4 two USB 3.0 with PowerShare Headset jack SD card reader (SD, SDHC, SDXC) Kensington Lock slot USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 Wireless Dell 8820 | Intel 8265 Out-of-band systems management Yes (Intel vPro) Battery 56WHr or 97WHr Weight 3.93 lbs (1.78 kg) to 4.56 lbs (2.06 kg) Colors Silver Besides the big Core processors, all of which are the last generation "Skylake" variants, there is the big kahuna with the Xeon E3-1505M v6. Introduced this year, this Intel Xeon is a quad-core processor with support for ECC memory, 8MB of cache (up from the usual 6MB in a consumer Core i7), and a slightly higher base clock rate of 3.00 GHz with Turbo up to 4.00 GHz. These specs make it one of the fastest mobile processors around, besting the Core i7-7700HQ found in the XPS 15 (9560) by 200MHz. That CPU will cost you an extra $392 compared to the base Core i5-7300HQ. For graphics, you can opt for the native Intel HD type found with the Core processors or add a dedicated GPU for an extra $70. That discrete GPU option comes in the form of the new NVIDIA Quadro M1200 with 4GB of GDDR5 memory and contrasts with the XPS 15 (9560), which has the powerful NVIDIA GTX 1050. On benchmarks, the GTX 1050 beats out the Quadro, but the latter is not meant for gaming or consumer applications. Instead, Quadro graphics are optimized for things such as 2D computer-aided design (CAD) programs (Autodesk or Solidworks), OpenCL work (as opposed to DirectX, and not to be confused with OpenGL), and they're considered a "professional solution." In other words, if you need a Quadro card, you'll likely know it due to your job requirements. Other perks with the Precision 5520 are more storage solutions, including the top-tier SSD, right now the Samsung SM961, which is equivalent to the consumer Samsung 960 PRO. That SSD has ludicrous read times of 3,200 MB/s and writes up to 1,800 MB/s, which again are ideal speeds for those working with large CAD outputs and professional workloads that require a lot of writing to disk. Finally, instead of a consumer-focused Killer AC-1535 wireless card, the Precision 5520 can get the similar Intel AC-8265 wireless card with Bluetooth 4.2. Design and build quality The XPS 15 and Precision 5520 have the same chassis designs, down to the black carbon fiber interior with soft touch paint and machined metal for the outside shell. At this point, Dell's design choices here are almost "classic" for the Precision and XPS line, because they've been used for some time. That's a good choice, as the Precision 5520 is solid feeling, especially because it's a 15.6-inch laptop packed into the frame of a 14-inch PC. Combined with the heavier 4K touch display, the Precision 5520 grips well and should hold up for a few years of being tossed into a bag every day. Choice of color is limited to the standard silver without any options for "rose gold," unlike the XPS 13 (9360). No option for Windows Hello One deviation from the XPS 15 (9560) is the lack of a $25 optional Synaptics fingerprint reader for instant log-ins using Windows Hello. It's an odd oversight due to the inclusion of features like vPro, and it may be coming in a later release. Keyboard and Precision trackpad are solid performers The Precision 5520's keyboard uses plastic keys with 1.3mm of travel, which is a bit on the shallow side. This shallow travel results in a faster "bottoming-out" experience compared to keyboards that offer 1.5mm or more of travel. It's not bad, but it takes a little time to get used to if you're coming from a desktop keyboard. Still, it's a good keyboard with no fatal flaws. The keys are backlit and turn on automatically based on the surrounding environment. The backlight brightens the letters and surrounds the keys. There are also two levels of brightness that users can select using the Function key. The keys are black, and the backlight is white, so the contrast is good. Where the Precision 5520's keyboard is unremarkable, the trackpad is a much better story. It is Precision, relying on Microsoft's drivers and settings for performance versus Synaptics, which I only tolerate these days. That also means more robust support through Microsoft, especially with the forthcoming Windows 10 Creators Update due in April, which adds even more gestures and customization for Precision Touchpads. A 4K IGZO display to love Like the XPS 15, the Precision 5520 comes in two variants, one with a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) Matte, non-touch display and the other with the more popular 4K (3840 x 2160) IGZO IPS touch screen. Neither panel has changed from last year's Precision or XPS models, and both rank at the top of my favorite laptop displays. Both display types are also nearly bezel-less, what Dell calls "Infinity Edge" in its marketing. The Full HD version results in a lighter laptop — 4.32 lbs (1.96 kg) versus 4.56 lbs (2.06 kg) — which is not a huge difference but it is noticeable. Also, the Full HD version will net about an extra three hours of battery life over the 4K option. Not every consumer needs a full 4K panel on a 15-inch laptop, but it makes sense with the Precision 5520 due to it being aimed at graphics professionals who need the higher resolution and more accurate colors. In calibration tests, the 4K panel measured 99 percent sRGB, and the extra presets through Dell Premier Color, such as Cinema (DCI-P3), Photo (Adobe RGB), HD Video (Rec. 709), and Vibrant (Full), are invaluable tools for video editors. The Full HD matte display reached an excellent 97 percent sRGB rating. Both displays are outstanding, but they offer unique experiences. The non-touch matte is better for reading and writing due to the anti-glare design. It goes without saying that neither has a fantastic webcam experience due to the odd placement of the camera below the display. The camera works well enough, but the angle is not flattering. That's a small price to pay for the super-thin bezels on the top and sides. Benchmarks and performance The strength of the maxed-out Precision 5520 comes down to that Xeon processor, which can ramp up to 4GHz via turbo. It's a powerful CPU edging out the consumer-orientated Core i7-7700HQ due to the extra 200MHz. Taking a closer look at Geekbench 4.0, which is very CPU dependent, you can see how the Precision 5520 takes the lead compared to other high-end PCs. Geekbench 4.0 benchmarks (higher is better) Device Single Core Multi Core Precision 5520 4,799 15,055 XPS 15 (9560) 4,503 13,587 Surface Studio 4,200 13,323 Razer Blade 14 3,774 12,638 Razer Blade Pro 3,660 12,325 XPS 13 (9360) 4,120 7,829 Spectre x360 15 4,098 8,022 Surface Book Performance Base 3,948 7,415 Things shift a bit with Futuremark, mostly because of the NVIDIA Quadro GPU. As mentioned earlier, that GPU is optimized for CAD, rendering and other professional environments that are not reliant on DirectX 12. Launched in January 2017, the Quadro M1200 Mobile is a very new professional solution GPU for workstations. The GPU operates at 1093MHz with memory running at 1253MHz, and it draws just 45W. The M1200 Mobile features 640 shading units, 40 texture mapping units and 32 ROPs, and it ships with 4GB of GDDR5 memory. The Quadro M1200 Mobile also supports DirectX 12, which is a significant change from previous versions.

That's not a fair comparison, of course, but it's still instructive for those curious about the differences in architecture and performance of the M1200 Mobile. Obviously, for consumers who have more interest in gaming, the XPS 15's new NVIDIA GTX 1050 is a better solution. Turning to storage and Precision 5520 does quite well. The results here are dependent on purchasing the PCIe 512GB SSD Class 50 (an extra $479), which evidently means the Samsung SM961, one of the fastest SSDs on the market today. That SSD is the OEM version of the prosumer Samsung 960 PRO. Choosing a cheaper Class 40 or SATA will bring slower read and write times. CrystalDiskMark (higher is better) Device Read Write Precision 5520 (SM961) 2,491 MB/s 1,602 MB/s Razer Blade Pro (RAID-0) 2,571 MB/s 2,467 MB/s Dell XPS 15 (9560) 2,207 MB/s 1,628 MB/s Razer Blade (960 EVO) 2,079 MB/s 1,809 MB/s Surface Book 1,018 MB/s 967 MB/s The Razer Blade Pro is the outlier because it actually uses two Samsung PM961s (960 EVOs) in a RAID zero setup, which is quite extreme and unusual. While an expensive choice, it's great that Dell lets you pick and choose the storage solution for the Precision 5520, unlike in the XPS 15 line where PCIe SSD can mean everything from a modest Toshiba to a powerful Samsung PM961 (960 EVO). Overall, the performance of the Precision 5520 is as expected for a mobile workstation. Of course, a lot of that depends on how you configure the device during the ordering process. Maxing out to the Xeon processor, along with 32GB of RAM and Class 50 SSD will yield the highest overall performance, but the total cost will be just shy of $3,000. For Wi-Fi, the Precision 5520 can either come with a Dell 1820 or Intel 8265 depending on user choice. My advice: Get the Intel Dual-Band Wireless-AC 8265. The 8265 is the fourth generation of Intel 802.11ac, and it offers support for newer features such as MU-MIMO, 802.11r, 802.11k, and 802.11v. Plus, Intel has the best Wi-Fi drivers in the business, and they have fewer problems. Considering it costs nothing extra for the Intel card, there's no downside. If you prefer a Killer Wireless card you can swap it out yourself for about $35. Finally, like the XPS 15 (9560), the Precision 5520 is easy to upgrade for more RAM, SSD, and Wi-Fi down the road. There are two DIMM slots for RAM, so you can easily order 16GB and replace the two sticks with 32GB (two 16GB sticks) at 2,400MHz should you need it. The SSD is also simple to replace if you need more (or faster) storage. Precision 5520 battery longevity Despite packing a Xeon processor at 3GHz, the Precision 5520 with 4K display gets around seven hours of battery life at 50 percent brightness and while doing moderate, non-GPU intensive Windows tasks. That's with the larger 97WHr battery. (There's a smaller, cheaper 56WHr option, as well.) While not that's not a massive number considering the speed of the CPU, the Quadro graphics, 4K display, and 32GB of RAM, it is impressive for a mobile workstation. If you push the Quadro GPU to full throttle for extending time while doing CAD, it will likely cut in half that battery result. Stepping down to a slightly slower Core i7 or Core i5 will likely yield more battery longevity, but not nearly as much as switching to the Full HD matte display. Going to the lower resolution screen should add two to three hours of life. That's a tough choice to make, so consider the pros and cons of each. Smart software: Dell Command and Precision Optimizer Dell's included software (McAfee notwithstanding) is all excellent. Besides Dell Premier Color, which lets you toggle color profiles, adjust white balance, and contrast for the IGZO 4K display, Dell also includes Dell Command and its Precision Optimizer. Dell Command and Precision Optimizer are great included apps. Dell Command checks for system updates and can pull down new drivers or updates for the other Dell software. It's simple to use and has an excellent design. The Dell Precision Optimizer app is more impressive. It allows users to see the utilization of their CPU, GPU, storage activity and memory, along with detailed system information. There are also Independent Software Vendor (ISV) presets that tune the Precision 5520 with popular professional apps, including AutoCAD, 3dsmax, Fluent and Illustrator. The system can also do an analysis of the hardware using data collection and workload usage for custom profile optimizations. It's all clever software, and I wish Dell would include something like Dell Command in its XPS lineup. (Consumers can technically go and download it themselves, but it needs to be configured.) Dell Precision 5520: A powerful mobile workstation worth buying The Precision 5520 is very much like the Dell XPS 15 (9560), with only a few key differences in the internal hardware. Those changes don't benefit consumers, but for mobile professionals, architects, video editors and others who need a Quadro GPU for work, the Precision 5520 is a perfect solution for their needs. Delivering the same excellent build quality, Infinity Edge 4K display, and ample hardware selection, there's not much to ding the Precision 5520 for in everyday use. It is curious that a fingerprint reader is not an option, which would seem apropos for this category. But perhaps Dell will add that down the road. See my review of the Dell XPS 15 (9560) Dell should still solve the oddly-placed webcam issue. and like the XPS line. Precision could maybe use some sprucing up in the design department. Still, these are minor complaints. There's nothing wrong with the looks of the Precision 5520 and considering it's for professional developers and architects, the conservative design is more appropriate. Performance and battery are the top for this class, and there are few choices in the category that look as good while lasting most of the day untethered from a power cord. If you need things like Intel vPro and Quadro graphics for work, the Precision 5520 has you covered. You'll look good using it too. See at Dell Pros: Excellent SSD, GPU, RAM and CPU options. Perfect professional-class mobile workstation. High-quality machined aluminum and carbon fiber build. Best display in its class (matte FHD and glossy 4K). Outstanding battery life, especially in Full HD. Large Precision touchpad. Cons: Web camera is still oddly placed. Can be expensive.

Israel is gaining a name as the builder of car brains. — Picture by Jeff Swensen/The New York TimesJERUSALEM, March 19 — Intel’s US$15-billion (RM66.5 billion) purchase of Israeli firm Mobileye could help fuel the country’s rise in the driverless car industry — not as a builder of vehicles, but as the brains behind them. Monday’s deal, the largest ever in Israel’s tech sector, could help boost trade despite the fact no commercial cars are assembled in the country. The self-styled “startup nation” has no real tradition of auto manufacturing: an ignoble previous stint in the 1960s and 70s produced the fibreglass Sussita car, parts of which, according to legend, were edible for camels. But the rise of new technology including driverless cars has opened space for the tech-savvy country to excel. In 2013, Google paid more than US$1 billion for Waze, an Israeli crowd-sourced app that plots the quickest journeys in real time, followed by Monday’s US$15 billion Mobileye deal. The company makes advanced driver assistance and accident avoidance systems for car manufacturers, and has already collaborated with Intel and BMW on self-driving car technology. It was founded in 1999 but Yossi Vardi — considered one of the fathers of Israel’s high-tech startup scene — said the automobile industry’s growth in Israel really began in 2007 when General Motors established a research and development centre. “It surprised everybody that a company like General Motors would go to Israel to source innovation and technology.” In the last three years, Vardi said, Honda, Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo and others have followed suit. Most Israeli companies in the field don’t involve production, but ways to make driving more efficient. Among them are Otonomo, which provides in-depth data on car usage; Argus, one of the market leaders in protecting cars from cyber hacking; and VocalZoom, dubbed “Siri for cars.” Elan Zivotofsky, general partner at the OurCrowd equity platform that invests in a number of companies working on autonomous cars, compared it to smartphones, laptops and other sectors where Israeli technology is heavily used but the final products are still made elsewhere. “Israel is not going to be in the business of building cars,” he said. “Israel is in the business of building some of the most important core elements that will enable autonomous driving.” ‘Doors will open’ Vardi said the country’s military experience, with some of the world’s most advanced monitoring, laser-guiding and other technologies, place it in a good position. “When you drive a car, you cannot stop the car and wait 15 minutes for the computer to process. It has to be immediate,” Vardi said. “This kind of talent you find in the military — in airplanes etc.” The impact of Mobileye could be significant, said Yaniv Feldman, editor-in-chief of the Israeli Geektime tech blog. There are dozens of companies in the sector and Feldman reckons Israel is already one of the leading players in autonomous driving behind the United States and China. In 2016, around US$70 million was invested in automotive tech in Israel, he said, but that will increase by “somewhere between 25 to 40 per cent.” “We will probably start seeing much more activity in the space and investor interest rising,” he told AFP. None of the other companies were as advanced as Mobileye, though, he added. Aquarius Engines, an Israeli firm that claims to have developed a radically improved combustion engine, is currently seeking US$10 million in a second round of funding. Chairman Gal Fridman said they had already noticed a change. “Since Mobileye happened, our phone is ringing all the time,” he told AFP. “Until now, when I came and told (car companies) I was an Israeli developing an engine, it was a bit odd as the country has no history of automobiles,” he said. “Now, after Waze and Mobileye, we have more credibility, I think, and doors will open easier.” — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Hacked websites on the rise, Google confirms Singapore beats Silicon Valley for start-up talents, survey finds Adobe, Microsoft team up to share sales and marketing data Meet Bixby, Samsung’s new artificial intelligence assistant Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Cristiano Ronaldo wins Portuguese player of the year award Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Banksy’s West Bank hotel to receive first guests Russia summoned Israeli ambassador over Syria strikes Israel carries out air strikes on Syria Israel brands Palestinian fund ‘terrorist’ organisation UN report: Israel imposes apartheid regime on Palestinians Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Is NVIDIA Corporation Running Out of Steam or Taking a Breather? NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the hottest stocks in 2016, surging 220% throughout the year and crushing the NASDAQ’s 20% gain. But that rally abruptly petered out in 2017, and the stock has declined 3% year-to-date. Does that weak start indicate that NVIDIA could be running out of steam? Or is the stock merely taking a breather before fresh catalysts propel it to new highs? Let’s take a closer look at the bearish and bullish cases to find out. NVIDIA’s DRIVE PX 2 powered Roborace vehicle. Image source: NVIDIA. Why NVIDIA might be running out of steam A common bearish argument against NVIDIA is that the stock simply got ahead of itself. NVIDIA’s current P/E of 40 marks a multi-year high and doesn’t compare favorably to analyst expectations for 10% non-GAAP earnings growth this year. That’s a significant slowdown from its  83% growth in fiscal 2017. NVIDIA’s revenue is only expected to rise 16% this year, compared to 38% growth in 2017. Several factors are causing this slowdown. First, the expiration of NVIDIA’s graphics cross-licensing deal with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) this month will reduce its  revenues by $66 million per quarter. While that impact might seem small relative to the $2.2 billion in revenues it generated last quarter, it was „free” revenue which went directly to NVIDIA’s bottom line and accounted for 9% of its non-GAAP net income. NVIDIA also faces fresh competition in its high-growth gaming GPU and automotive CPU markets this year. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) will launch its next-gen Vega GPUs within  the next three months, which could put a lot of pressure on NVIDIA’s current-gen Pascal-based GeForce cards. NVIDIA’s high-end GTX 1080 Ti GPU. Image source: NVIDIA. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Intel  are both aggressively scaling up their automotive chip businesses. Qualcomm will likely close its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors , making it the largest automotive chipmaker in the world. Intel recently announced that it will acquire Mobileye , which  supplies 90% of the world’s top automakers with collision detection systems. Both Qualcomm and Intel believe that these purchases will bolster their presence in connected and driverless cars — which could threaten NVIDIA’s early lead with Tegra processors. Intel has also taken notice of NVIDIA’s progress in data centers, where it’s been pairing its Tesla GPUs with non-Intel CPUs for machine-learning purposes. To strike back, Intel recently launched its new „Knights Landing” Xeon Phi processor, which reportedly outperformed the Tesla GPUs in  several scientific benchmarks. Why NVIDIA might be taking a breather NVIDIA faces more challenges this year than it did before, but the company has kept its core businesses healthy with a steady stream of fresh partnerships. In the driverless car market, NVIDIA partnered with Baidu to develop a driverless platform last  August, partnered with Bosch to create a next-gen driving supercomputer called  Xavier in early 2017, and unveiled a proof-of-concept autonomous truck with Paccar  in March. In the data center market, NVIDIA launched a new hyperscale GPU accelerator blueprint with Microsoft  in March, which is aimed at strengthening its cloud-based AI computing capabilities. NVIDIA also pushed back against AMD in the console market by supplying Nintendo (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) with the Tegra X1 SoC for its new Switch console. Initial demand for  the Switch seems strong, which indicates that the console could become a new pillar of growth for the Tegra line alongside connected cars. The Nintendo Switch. Image source: Nintendo. As for gaming GPUs, NVIDIA plans to counter AMD’s Vega with  its next-gen Volta GPUs. The Volta probably won’t arrive until early 2018, but hardcore gamers might skip the Vega in favor of this next-gen chipset. All these factors indicate that its core growth businesses of gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and Tegra CPUs should all continue growing for the foreseeable future. The verdict: NVIDIA is just taking a breather NVIDIA faces a lot more headwinds than it did before, but it’s still making solid progress across the gaming, AI, and connected car markets. Its P/E of 40 admittedly looks high, but investors should also note that the stock also trades at  37 times 2018 earnings, 31 times 2019 earnings, and 24 times 2020 earnings — so that multiple will eventually cool off to more reasonable levels. Investors shouldn’t expect NVIDIA to repeat its massive gains from last year, but they also shouldn’t believe the stock will fall off a cliff. I believe that the stock will trade sideways over the next few quarters, until the company proves that new challenges from AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm won’t throttle its long-term growth.

View Latest Posts >>> Vault 7 Leak Exposes a Secret War against We The People By Preston James, Ph.D on March 19, 2017 The Vault 7 leaks have merely disclosed the tip of the Secret Shadow Government iceberg. It quickly becomes obvious that there is also Secret Space War program and secret Deep Underground Military Base program that the CIA runs interference for. by  Preston James Note: This is a long article, and involves information you were never supposed to find out about. Over the years, hundreds have been murdered who bucked this evil system, and thousands of good Americans from all walks of life and positions (low and high) have been harassed into silence. Thankfully all secrecy is ending bit by bit thanks to the Internet, the New Gutenberg Press. The CIA and the Secret Shadow Government are desperate to stop these disclosures and doing everything they can, but such efforts are now doomed. This article is dedicated to all the innocent blood and ruined lives of all the many thousands of the CIA’s victims, including many children ritually abused and sacrificed for control, power and money.  To save time, you can read the bold print and the conclusion to get a pretty good summary of the article. Thanks to the Vault 7 leaks the curtain has been pulled back and the CIA’s massive crime spree against We The People has now been exposed. And it’s just the tip of the iceberg. This disclosure of CIA RICO crimes is just 1% of what will be coming in future months about the CIA’s dirty secret crimes against We The People and the existence of a massive secret war against We The People by a Secret American “invisible” Government, best referred to as the Secret Shadow Government (SSG). Yes, not only do the Vault 7 disclosures disclose massive illegal CIA spying against the American people, but they also suggest that a major war is being waged against We The People by a Secret Shadow Government (SSG) most of the American masses never heard of, something never mentioned in the Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM). The original reason that the CIA was created was because of the cold war with the Soviet Union and China, at least this is what was claimed to the American public. We now know for certain that the large subterranean Intel monster best referred to as the Secret Shadow Government (SSG) was spawned from and by the CIA’s excessive secrecy and tendency to commit an endless series of serious crimes, all rationalized under the misused concept of “protecting national security”. Here is the secret process by which this all occurred. Paperclip scientists in America – US Sponsorship was not limited to German physicists and engineers At the end of WW2, the USG decided to import the Nazi spy system. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was the clandestine arm of the US Military during WW2 and realized that they were ill equipped to spy on the Soviet Union effectively. So at the end of WW2 efforts were made by the US Army to convince President Truman and his top advisers that it was essential to import the Nazi’s ready made Intel system which they believed had fully penetrated the Soviet Union. But the immediate impetus to create the CIA by passing the National Security Act of 1947 was the UFO crash with 5 alien ET bodies and one live ET survivor from another nearby crash sent the Army Air Corps into shock. Roswell depiction This Roswell incident sent major shock-waves through the highest echelons of the US Military High Command, the president and several of the top Senators who were briefed. That very night that the Roswell incident was exposed in an article published in the newswires that a flying saucer had crashed and been recovered at Roswell, absolute secrecy was locked down and a phony weather balloon cover story was quickly substituted under threat of court martial. Years later when witnesses began to adequately debunk this, another second fake cover story was presented that it was the crash test of a Project Mogul test dummy. That too has now been fully debunked. When the National Security Act of 1947 was passed, President Truman in essence unknowingly signed away US sovereignty by allowing the creation of a Secret Shadow Government (SSG). Years later he realized this mistake and was sorry, or at least that is what he claimed. From that point on from the moment it was created by the national Security Act, the CIA morphed into the secret control arm of the Fourth Reich, a reconstituted three-piece suit Third Reich that had formed an symbiotic alliance with US Intel over Alien ET technologies gained from recovered crashed UFOs, one in Bavaria for example. This is an extreme claim that the CIA became the Intel arm of the new Forth Reich but one that has legs. And here is how it happened. After the end WW2, President Truman and his Military High Command imported over 9,000 Nazi scientists, technicians, bio-weapons experts, spy-chiatrists and mind-kontrollers, and Intel agents under Operation Paperclip. Midway through the war, US Naval Intel had become aware of the secret Nazi weapons research on jet aircraft, rockets, nuclear bombs and anti-gravity craft. US Navy Intel had deeply penetrated these secret Nazi weapons programs. And naval Intel was fully aware that the Nazis had recovered crashed UFOs, had formed a working alliance with an Alien ET group which abandoned them midstream. Senior US Naval Intel Officials knew the Allies would win the war and wanted to be able to get control over those technologies and the technicians working on them before the Russian could. A special deal was negotiated through back channels with certain Nazi Intel officials and General Kammler to do this before the war’s end. Secret negotiations were made through back-channels before the end of the war with General Kammler to import all this technology and those Nazis involved into the USA at the end of the war and give them full immunity if they agreed to work for the USA. So the USG wanted not only all this Nazi secret technology, it wanted access to what they believed was the Nazi’s exceptionally proficient network of spies deeply embedded inside the Soviet Union. However, General Kammler had a secret plan. He decided that he would share the rocketry, and guidance systems and the jet aircraft but would hold back on much of the Alien ET technologies and instead attempt to create a secret separate Nazi space program running parallel. In a strange unanticipated turn of events, many of the top technicians working on de Glocke (the Bell) and related anti-gravity were murdered so they could not talk or be taken to America. It has been suspected and rumored that a select group of the best were Scientists and technicians working on anti-gravity were secretly transported to South America, some say to a secret base in Antarctica. This group of Nazi scientists and technicians was to re-establish connections to a Alien ET group and continue developing weapons. What happened to them is unclear but perhaps will be disclosed with all the big disclosures coming soon over Antarctic archaeological digs, which according to rumors may involve beings frozen in the ice from ancient times and alien ET matters. After NASA was developed, it was rumored that a secret Nazi section was developed to set up Space War division to rival the USAF and the USN’s. Because of all the excess well-compartmented secrecy levels set up based on “need to know” only, it is always difficult to get accurate information on any of this. This cylinder device generated a tremendous vortex in the etheric field by counter-rotating mercury plasma, though many speculate it was merely an anti-gravity flying device, it seems more likely to have been a primitive attempt to create an artificial ‘wormhole’ portal that could pierce the quarantine barrier. The Bell project and its designers vanished just before WWII’s end. Up until about five years ago, any mention of the Secret Space War program usually resulted in the discloser being murdered without mercy. The late New Mexico Congressman Steven Schiff (1947-1998) Some of the murders have seemed to be from defense contractor security teams, but others are suspected of being from strange “Men in Black” (MIBs who have been alleged to be human looking Alien ETs). Over the last 20 years those who run the programs, Majestic Twelve, has had a big split in perspectives among its members with the younger set wanting disclosure and pushing for it. This split has allowed a softening of the policy to immediately murder anyone disclosing. And now with Dr. Steven Greer’s disclosure project over 100 American heroes have disclosed collectively. Offers have been made to present all this in open Congressional hearing, but because NM Congressman Schiff appeared to have been murdered (CIA Flu) trying to break it open, most Members of Congress are too afraid of the Secret Shadow Government (SSG) to attempt to set up disclosure hearings. If you think the claims that the USN had serious Intel during WW2 from inside the Nazi high technology programs that dealt with recovered UFOs and Alien ET partners is complete bunk, not so fast. Jeff Rense (of Rense.com) who is a Veterans Today affiliate has a Radio Network which carries some remarkable guests. One of his recent guests is a highly respected man William Tompkins, who has produced supporting credentials showing long term participation in the Secret Space War program. Some of these very interesting Rense programs with William Tompkins have been posted on Rense.com and also on Youtube.com and are well worth listening too. Take the time to listen to this remarkable man before you just discount such claims out of hand about the Navy penetrating Nazi alien ET/UFO high technology development during WW2. These matters are incredulous to most and even for a period of time to those who have worked in these programs at the highest levels. Yes, this is “twilight zone” time, but you will find it to be real if you do enough deep research. In 1990 the respected “Aviation Week and Space Technology Magazine” confirmed development of exotic top-secret flight machines. In two feature articles, the lid was ever so slightly lifted on super-classified projects under way at Nellis AFB in Nevada and Edwards AFB in California. Both bases “…have been home to ‘classified’ vehicles for decades.” But here is what we actually do know for certain. Nazi Intel Gehlen and Mueller were brought over and used to help set up the CIA under the infamous, now declassified Operation Paperclip. Joseph Mengele  (aka Dr. Green) traveled in and out of America from his South American home and was brought over to help set up the CIA’s secret Mind-kontrol programs, which included MK-Ultra and numerous subprograms, many of which are ongoing even to this very day, although completely denied.  Prescott Bush and the Dulles brothers were supportive of the Nazis. Prescott and GHWB both have been accused of being secret Nazis. Prescott for his part in the Union bank support for the Nazis in WW2, in which he was arrested but given immunity to become an “informant,” as long as he signed an agreement that his progeny would never run for political office. Caught with his pants down literally! Sandy Berger was caught attempting to steal this document out of the national security archives and received a minimal hand-slapping where anyone else would have  been given a life sentence. GHWB was responsible for running CIA Op40 (run out of Room 40 at Langley which mimicked the old British room 40 Intel group from WW2. GHWB’s reward for murdering JFK and stopping his plan to break up the CIA into a thousand pieces was to become head of the CIA, Vice President and then President. It was GHWB that ran the assassination attempt on President Reagan for the CIA and formed a strong alliance with the Nazi Fourth Reich, the Mossad and the South American drug Cartels to traffick massive quantities of illegal drugs into America through Zapata and DEA controlled deliveries into Mena, Arkansas, LA (Freeway Ricky Ross) and every major American city. And the CIA formed a strategic alliance with the NY mafiosi John Gotti to distribute the Mena cocaine. It’s no coincidence that well-informed insiders have referred to the CIA as “Cocaine Importing Agency” for many years. Isn’t it interesting how John Gotti came down with a strange rare case of throat cancer so he couldn’t talk. When the Secret Shadow Government was initially being formed, there were struggles to gain control over the Alien ET/UFO matter between the US Army and the US Navy. After the CIA was created entered the fray, a strained but workable partnership was established allowing each entity to carve out their own areas of control in these matters. It wasn’t long before main responsibilities for back-engineering the recovered UFO technologies was transferred to numerous Defense Contractors which had the specialization and expertise needed. These defense contractors became more and more engulfed in higher and higher levels of secrecy deemed necessary to protect the recovered and developed technologies from other nations, especially the Soviet Union. Soon these Defense Contractors in a sense became independent and unaccountable to the American People and part of a large subterranean (literally and figuratively because of their numerous Deep Underground Bases) Secret Shadow Government, accountable to themselves only with no serious Congressional or Presidential oversight. As the Secret Shadow Government grew larger, more diversified, it also became stronger and more tyrannical toward the American people, setting up massive spying and surveillance systems against war protesters to begin with, then with the advent of the cell phones and Internet against every single America. Soon America became run by the Secret Shadow Government (SSG) as its main controller which either picked and promoted its elected officials. Once elected if not chosen these officials are usually “human compromised” by using sophisticated sexual and pedophile “honey traps” often using alcohol and hypnotic drugs like Rohypnal, Placidyl, Chloral Hydrate, and Scopolomine (Boradinga). The United States has become a nation that has been secretly transformed into a Super-Fascist State. Soon the United States of America became a secretly Fascist nation, best described as a “Super Fascist” nation. Fascism in general is the fusion of the State and the Corporations with the state setting policy and deploying the corporation as its political servant. With Super-Fascism, the corporations become dominant and stack the government with their puppets and thus the Government itself is controlled by a select set of major corporations. In America today we have Super-Fascism but it is a situation where the Corporations which are stacking the USG (the State) and running it just happen to be the very same large and power Defense Contractors that run the Secret Space program, the various spy operations for the CIA and the Contractors that run the Deep Underground military Base network of 140 DUMBs all connected by a high speed maglev railroad. In essence, this Secret Shadow Government had become a sovereign nation unto itself. The original mandate of the CIA was to engage in foreign intelligence, with the FBI’s Division Five handling counter-intelligence inside the USA. This mandate remained the same until the illegal unconstitutional passage of the Patriot Act, which has been used by the CIA as a false mandate to spy on Americans under the guise of protecting national security and stopping terrorism inside America. And now we have the massive leakage of Vault 7 from Wikileaks which has disclosed what is claimed to be a mere 1% of all the secret CIA crimes against We The People. The source of this leak has to track back to the NSA, one way or another. No one else has the technology to have collected and dispersed all these secret methods that have been used to criminally spy on Americans without probable cause and a warrant signed by a judge, not some puppet, backslapping FISA court which is a joke. Who has access to all this NSA data that could be motivated to have leaked this. The answer in that it would have to be some powerful Intel faction and anyone who is part of the Six Eyes System — normally called Five Eyes publicly by the USG, but Israel was secretly brought in, and now has had full access to all NSA raw feeds, so realistically it should be called the Six Eyes System. It well known that numerous powerful factions exist in non-CIA American Intel groups that are sick and tired of the crimes and corruption of the CIA. I will briefly list the most egregious of them here: (Note: these are all major RICO crimes). Do not be surprised if it turns out some inside the CIA have assisted in this major leak, which is just 1% of what is coming. Although candy-coating the facts as much as possible, the CIA Internal Investigation report by Frederick Hitz showed conclusively that at a minimum the CIA looked the other way and “allowed” illegal narcotics to be trafficked in and shared in the profits for covert operations. Hitz resigned as soon as his report was made public. 1- Major illegal drug trafficking into the USA designed to provide lots of off the books black money and to create massive chaos in the US urban areas to destroy society. 2- Setting up, training financing private mercenary armies in foreign lands to start color revolutions, and deploy terrorists, all done to start wars for the Industrial, Banking Defense Complex which need wars to make profits for their 66 major family shareholders. The CIA’s main job today besides drug trafficking is to use creative means to set the stage for starting foreign wars that the Military Industrial Banking Complex needs to generate massive profits for the big 66 families that own the big blocks of their stock. 3- Running massive Mind-kontrol operations inside America by using the Satanic Cult Network as cover and sharing in their Satanic Ritual Abuse, pedophilia, and human sacrifice rituals (the CIA Finders program is but one example, many like this are currently active too). Top Satanic pedophiles and Trauma-based  Mind-Kontrollers are given the status of informants, considered CIA assets and are treated as if they had full diplomatic immunity. The CIA runs these Satanic pedophile ops like the “Finders” and the FBI’s job is to keep them covered up (forever). 4- Deploying advanced highly sophisticated psychotronics and Psyops against the American public without their consent through targeted EMF, ELF, Scalar, Wi-Fi, cell phone towers, Doppler radar, dirty electricity and Lilly Waves. The CIA is responsible for shaping the masses group mind set and psychotronics allows them to directly entrain thought and attitudes into the brains of the American People without them knowing or understanding it. These systems are designed to also dumb-down the masses, keep them tranquilized, cause sleep disorders and many have symptoms like fatigue, fibromyalgia, short term memory problems even in younger folks, ringing in their ears, hot flashes followed by cold flashes with no temperature changes, dental problems, stomach problems, and migraine headaches, EKG and EEG irregularities. 5- Running numerous sophisticated bust-out schemes using infiltrated banks, consumer scams, infiltrated and hijacked corporations, and secret proprietaries to gain access to vast amounts of money needed for their black budget. It is no coincidence that insiders call the CIA the “Company”, since it functions like a greedy, illegal organized-crime enterprise that is oriented to asset-stripping anything it can, using any means to gain vast amounts of black funds. 6- Controlling each and all of the six Major Mass Media (aka the CMMM), which functions as a News and Media Cartel, an illegal monopoly controlled by a secret “News Council” which answers to a large investment firm that claims to be on the vanguard of investments. This large investment firm has two parts, a legitimate part for investors and an illegitimate criminal part used to finance foreign mercenaries and terrorist armies such as ISIS; it financed the tankers ISIS has used to transport stolen crude oil in for Turkey. The CMMM specializes in the use of specially constructed false narratives, big lies and twisted propaganda designed to mislead and mind-kontrol the American masses to love their captivity under the thumb of the CIA and the SSG. The CIA is notorious for running serial mass-murder operations against a single terrorist usually by taking out many innocents with them and then hitting their funerals to murder their families too. These are blatant war crimes, and these terrorists were set up, trained, financed, supplied and mind-kontrolled (radicalized) in the first place by the CIA and the Mossad. A massive, unprecedented CMMM coverup was rolled out to discredit this 100% truthful book which laid out the truth about CIA Treason, Sedition and RICO in spades. Gary Webb was murdered for this and for a new book he was working on, which would have rocked and shocked the world. 7- Assassinating folks who the CIA decides must be “Terminated With Extreme Prejudice”, such as Presidents like JFK and politicians like Robert F. Kennedy, Senator John Tower, Senator Paul Wellstone, public figures like Martin Luther King. The list is a very long one that includes hundreds, some obvious, some completely masked by highly sophisticated means, and some obvious murders classified by crooked, compromised LE as suicides, like Gary Webb supposedly shooting himself twice in the head with a shotgun. Arranging for masked assassinations that look like death from natural causes or suicide (aka “arkencides). Insiders typically refer to such deaths as “CIA Flu”. Naturally the CIA specializes in painting automotive steering wheels with short acting poison mixed in DMSO for good skin penetration or placing short acting, dissolving Cesium radioactive discs close to where targets sit at their office or home or spraying such materials inside the vents of their automobiles or running “Boston Brakes” cyber interfaces with their autos to cause strange accidents like the way they murdered Michael Hastings for writing his last article on why Democrats love spying on the American people. Toyota was a victim of Industrial sabotage by this means with runaway cars and allegedly so has been the recent Samsung battery fires. 8- Forming strategic alliances with organized crime and giving immunity to major Felony offenders in exchange for becoming “informants” and CIA partners in crime. This provides great cover for secret deep black CIA covert operations, good deniability and access to Intel otherwise denied. Like the phrase goes, “if you sleep with dogs, you get fleas”. Well the CIA has become as soulless and dirty as the worst organized crime thugs out there. 9- Setting up lots of special interest political groups, NGOs, fake charities, infiltrating certain churches, infiltrating legitimate political action groups to generate conflict to disjoint them, etc. These actions have been fully disclosed in the past as Operation Chaos and claimed to have been stopped. Actually the name of the operation has been changed and they have expanded into hundreds of sub-programs each working to help implement the Globalist NWO Agenda of the main group at the top of the Pyramid of Power that controls everything, the Babylonian Talmudic private central Banksters run out of the City of London, also known as the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia. More will be disclosed on this important root cause soon in a new series of articles by Preston James and Mike Harris. _________ Conclusion Deep underground levels (file photo) The Vault 7 leak has exposed the CIA massive illegal spying crimes against all Americans and all US Politicians but it is only the tip of the Iceberg of the massive crimes and theft of assets of the Secret Shadow Government. The SSG has become the real, operational USG and transformed the visible USG including Congress, the President, the Administration and Judiciary into a ceremonial government system, designed to fool We The People and make us believe we have a system sensitive to our needs. The fact is the SSG and the CIA itself will only yield control when populism has arisen to the point those in its own ranks rebel and feel 100% supported by We The People and the Military. Consider this. Approximately 985-Billion dollars goes to American Defense and Intel. The actual figure could be as high as one Trillion USD per year. But this figure does not include all the money that is spent on the highly classified Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMBs) or in the deep black and beyond-black Secret Space War Programs. Insiders estimate this to be between 1/2 trillion to one trillion USD total that is secretly spent in space and underground. Thus, this is all “off the books” black budget unsupervised expenditures. Yes this is a lot of money that has been asset stripped from Americans one way or another. If you are wondering why you don’t have the spendable income you used to have and are losing hope for any decent economic future for yourself, your family, and especially children or grandchildren, now you know why. Yes, there are a lot of reasons, like too many immigrants taking our jobs, too many factories exported from so-called Free Trade (a Globalist ploy), and too many illegals on our welfare. Yes, it’s all part of the Globalist agenda that the CIA assists with. But the biggest reason of all is the Secret Shadow Government massive expenditures that require massive stripping of the American taxpayers in hundreds of ways you never ever thought of. Be thankful for the Vault 7 leak, because for once a very powerful faction has decided that the CIA has just gone too far, and the Secret Shadow Government must be exposed and deconstructed piece by piece down to a workable size fully known by and authorized by We The People. Stay tuned because the CIA and the SSG is going to be exposed piece by piece in the months and years to come. As the CIA is fully exposed and deconstructed, hopefully eliminated, the USG must start telling We The People the truth about Alien ETs, crashed and recovered, back-engineered anti-gravity craft and our own Secret Space War program. And it is time that all the new zero point energy technologies be shared too. The time for all these massive official USG lies to stop has come. In short all the massive USG and SSG lies proclaimed by the Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) needs to stop. The CIA and its propaganda stooge the CMMM must both be broken into a thousand pieces. The CIA must be prosecuted under RICO, for serving as a tool of foreign espionage inside America (Nazi Fourth Reich, Mossad and City of London Banksters). The CMMM must be broken up under anti-trust laws and the CEO’s who set these editorial policies requiring lies be fully prosecuted for doing espionage against We The People. Their FCC licenses need to be immediately revoked for violating them and not meeting the base requirements to serve the public’s needs. _________ _________   _______________ Related Posts: Secret Space War VIII: Alien Quantum Computing and the End of Secrecy?

The Secret Space Program is darker than anyone knows or can understand given the science taught in universities. Elena Kapulnik explains what’s happening in her latest video. Human DNA is made up from many aliens races. Human DNA is of enormous value to malevolent self-serving alien races. Hence reason for why so many humans go missing every year. Human DNA is a hugely valuable off-planet export commodity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzTcg9SPes8 Log in to Reply Tony Niller  March 20, 2017 at 12:26 pm This is the real news that’s going on right now.

I hope it happens within my lifetime. I would be surprised if the world could continue on the same path for more than a decade or so, without humanity becoming extinct. Since governments are PR puppets for their evil paymasters and law enforcement agencies exist to ensure the continuity of their existing tyranny, I wonder who will hold them accountable? It seems we might need a miracle. Thanks again, Preston. RIP Gary Webb.

Amelius  March 21, 2017 at 12:48 am Indeed! Thanks for sharing the excellent news. Rarely do I feel it’s appropriate to celebrate the death of anyone. But in this case, let’s just say I’ll sleep a little easier tonight, knowing one of the most evil and repulsive men of our time is no longer with us. After a lifetime of parasitical scheming to expand his already tremendous fortune and influence, the worms will now crawl through his corpse, the same way they crawl through the corpse of a man who had nothing. Good riddance! Alex B  March 20, 2017 at 11:46 am Michael Hastings: occult code “3 9”,Gary Webb: “2 6”, John Tower: “1 9”=6 1”, Paul Wellstone: “3 9”. Respectively:“Journalist dies in a high-speed car accident” =362/38=390/(-30+11)+11.“Investigative journalist commits suicide by shooting himself TWICE in the head” = 803/68=11+110/(60/(-2+6)+ 11*11) – note “11:11” TWICE as well. “A leading Republican US Senator dies in a plane crash” =444/44= 666/(6*10+6)=(10+9*10+11)/11. “American politician and academic is killed in a plane crash” = 432/50= 6*6*6/300/(9+3). Those are just one point out of dozens of such for each case, present in names, places, dates (where, sometimes, it can be seen even by an “unarmed” eye, like in Gary Webb’s case: 12.10.2004=11*110.(2006-2), etc. Log in to Reply alan colorado  March 20, 2017 at 6:50 am We need more people to lay out the big hidden picture. When presented with the picture the average man cannot totally deny it for it explains the whys and wherefores of everything. It makes all the puzzle pieces fit revealing the big ugly picture for all to see. The scope of the state of affairs is too complex to incessantly be going into each minute detail of each level and debating all the possibilities as so many nitpickers are doing. If only all the public would unite by generally agreeing that there are undeniable crimes, committed by government agencies that must be stopped.These have nothing to do with the ridiculous Republican/Democrat side taking stances which only makes one side right and the other always wrong.

What could be the reason that “the vault” only opens slowly and we are fed fragments of truth instead getting it done and over with ALL deceit right NOW? “We are not ready yet” does sound more like the ones clinging on to control mankind are not ready yet to let go. As long as matters of security have a right to secrecy in any country there never will be any change in direction of freedom, resulting in more fake worldwide conflicts, further humiliation of nations, exploiting of resources, causing chain effect events on Earth which most likely will wipe out much of humanity anyway. What a way to go! BS never seems to leave mankind – much like the soul. Log in to Reply MileHighLife  March 19, 2017 at 10:04 am Thanks Dr. James.

Definitely worth the time, mind blowing stuff… New Linda Moulton Howe Lecture Stunning Alien Binary Code Messages [FULL VIDEO] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKTDxz98yKI&feature=youtu.be Log in to Reply MileHighLife  March 19, 2017 at 10:20 am The first part of the lecture in Linda’s video is regarding a very recent event, ongoing in fact, about a high ranking U.S. military official receiving binary code “downloads” (like the 1980 Rendesham Forest binary code incident) that he can’t understand nor explain. The codes play through his mind continuously, only stopping after he records them on paper. Those codes are then sent to one of the few that can decipher them. This downloads are apparently still occurring. Check the vid to see what those codes say….yikes! The rest of the lecture goes places Tompkins has yet to travel, though other high ranking whistle blowers and docs back up. I found Linda’s lecture as fascinating as anything I’ve yet to learn. Interesting times indeed! jensingr  March 21, 2017 at 12:00 am I have seen a few different interviews with the men from Rendesham and each time the binary code message interpretation was different. One time it was a positive message, and another one was very negative. They don’t want anyone to really know…. JohnZ  March 19, 2017 at 5:50 am During Steven Greer’s Disclosure conference several former USAF missilemen disclosed the infiltration of U.S. missile sites by alien craft and that the ICBM missile sites went completely dark at the Malmstrom AFB missile site in Montana.Several gave evidence of this occurrence. The ICBM were completely deprogrammed. At other missile sites the ICBMs were mysteriously switched to the ready mode by these visitors. These incidents are not just isolated to the U.S. The Soviet Union also experienced the same incidents. All covered up by the SSG and the media.

By Fora Staff Sunday 19 Mar 2017, 7:10 AM Sun 7:10 AM 17,346 Views 6 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3291231 Share Tweet Email5 Sean Mitchell Image: Vimeo Sean Mitchell Image: Vimeo THE CO-FOUNDER OF Movidius says the decision to sell his company to Intel in a €300 million deal was tough, but a step he felt was right for the business. Chief operating officer Sean Mitchell, who set up the Dublin-based company with David Moloney 10 years ago, also said that the company plans to retain a significant presence in the Irish capital. Speaking at the InterTradeIreland Venture Capital Conference during the week, Mitchell said that he thought that the sale – estimated to be worth at least €300 million - ”was the right one for the stage that we were at”. “Losing the ultimate control is difficult, but I think it is key to have trust that you’re going into a deal that is going to have success.” Speaking to Fora at the event, he added that “there is always that issue of having control over your own destiny and passing that control on”. Movidius is one of the Irish tech industry’s most promising companies, having received about $85 million in investment over several years to develop its microchips, which handle advanced vision-processing duties in various devices. It has signed a string of deals in recent years to supply its technology to major tech-industry players like Google and night-vision equipment designer FLIR Systems. Intel deal It was announced at the start of September that Movidius was to be acquired by Intel, with the Californian chip giant indicating the Irish company’s technology will likely be used to improve its ‘realsense’ platform, which, among other things, is used in advanced 3D cameras. Movidius was loss-making at the time of its sale as it pumped money into its software and hardware development, and nearly went under in 2013 before getting a cash injection. Sean Mitchell (left) and David Moloney Source: Maxwell Photography Mitchell said: “People would love to have the big Irish company that remains independent, (but) there are a lot of dynamics at play. “We were in a position where we had proven the product market fit, the technology and were starting to scale up. If we were to remain independent we would have needed to raise another $50 or $100 million. “We would have had to scale up incredibly aggressively. The market we’re involved in is probably going to end up as winner takes all, there’s not much of a prize for second place.” That meant there would be “many more years” of work and “lots more risks as the competition heated up”, he added. “That was the choice. There was a good deal on the table with a partner who could help us achieve that scale. “A lot of investors in play there, the founders had limited influence (and) it suited people to do that. Losing the ultimate control that’s difficult, it’s definitely an adjustment. “We had a responsibility to the team, all of these people who worked so hard on it, they wanted to see it have an impact. If I didn’t feel that was going to happen through Intel I would have been a lot more concerned about it, but I’m pretty optimistic.” Co-founder Moloney previously said the sale to Intel was “a validation of decades worth of blood, sweat and tears”. Responsibility Mitchell told Fora that the sale marked a “new beginning” for the company. “We’re part of a bigger company, but we’re still building on what we were building before,” he said. Movidius currently has about 80 staff in Dublin and 200 worldwide, a number Mitchell said he could “easily see doubling”. He said that the company is also “hiring a lot” of people in Ireland. Mitchell at the InterTradeIreland event Source: Conor McCabe Photography Ltd While Movidius’s complex share structure means it is difficult to determine how much Mitchell personally gained from the sale, his significant holding meant he stands to make millions. Asked if he was tempted to ‘cash in his chips’ and leave altogether, he said: “When a company spends a large amount of money on an acquisition, they have to make sure that they’re going to get the value from that so they’re very careful that they have a means to retain the team. “Generally speaking, the team don’t get their money out in the way that an investor would. “The choice wouldn’t be there, whether I wanted to or not, it’s going to take years for the proceeds of the sale to flow, but I’m quite happy with that because I have a responsibility to make sure that the transition goes well.” Written by Paul O’Donoghue and posted on Fora.ie Take me to Fora Get the top business news from Fora delivered to your inbox: Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

This disrupts Intel's market in a big way, because AMD is offering performance similar to, or better than the Core i7-6900K, a processor that costs $999.     The latest rumor is that AMD is ready to hit Intel in the HEDT market even harder, offering a new 16C/32T processor for the $1000 mark - beating out Intel's current flagship Core i7-6950X, which costs $1600+. AMD would reportedly unveil this new Ryzen CPU behemoth at Computex, in just two months time - while Intel launches its next-gen X399 chipset and new flagship Core i7 processor. The rumor is floating over from the ChipHell forums, picked up by Overclock3D.net.   According to the rumor: "Public knowledge by now but AMD has a new HEDT platform coming out in a couple of months. You'll see more of it at Computex I believe. It's a 16 core /32 Thread, quad channel behemoth. And it is insanely quick in the tests that Ryzen is already excelling at. So Cinebench, and all other related productivity programs. The gaming issues that were causing the Ryzen AM4 CPUs to behave erratically to say the least have been ironed out. It's akin to a newer revision on a newer platform. This should be competing with the Xeon and of course 6950X Intel offers for $1700~$1800USD, but at about $1,000 USD if not less for some Skews. Coming soon".   Great tease, huh? The rumor continues: "CPSs are pretty big physically, about twice the size of surrent 6950X CPUs and a bit more perhaps. And if you were hoping for pins, nope it's strictly LGA! It's NOT 8 channel, but Quad. Will be a splendid competition between X299 and this AMD platform. Skylake-X is pretty good, not revolutionary but a meaningful step up in IPC and the clocks are pretty high as well. If Intel will have a 32 core part to compete on X299 remains to be seen, but the HEDT platform is going to change quite a bit in the next 4 to 6 months.?"   I don't think we'll see a revised Ryzen or 'Ryzen 2' processor - but the 16C/32T processor is believable, considering AMD's upcoming Naples CPU will have 32C/64T of pure brute performance - with 128 PCIe 3.0 lanes. AMD could utilize its Naples platform with a HEDT-like Ryzen release with a 16C/32T processor for $999, and a $250-$400 motherboard and really compete with the $2000+ kit from Intel.

Intel may not be quite in the driver’s seat with its deal to buy Mobileye, a tech analyst requesting anonymity told On the Money. The chip giant last week reached a $15 billion deal to buy the Israeli tech company that makes computer vision systems for most carmakers. Intel agreed to pay a relatively high 39 times projected 2018 earnings to reach a deal since Mobileye was not on the market. However, Mobileye could be looking to see if it can get higher offers, the analyst said. The merger agreement has some unusual language. Mobileye, for example, can only take a superior proposal that is 10 percent higher than Intel’s current offer of $63.54. Research firm William Blair in a March 13 report lists Apple, Google and Uber as companies that may have the financial wherewithal and strategic interest to offer a much higher price.

Reuters/Shailesh Andrade If latest reports are to be believed, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could be the fastest hybrid yet from the Redmond tech giant. It is believed to be coming with the all-new AMD Ryzen chip. Moreover, the hybrid will be the right platform to show off the power of Windows 10. The Surface Pro 4 was released back in October 2015. Hence, the next-gen hybrid is due for long. Microsoft is yet to reveal concrete details of the device though. Previously it was being speculated that the device will be powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake processor. Microsoft has long had an incredible working relationship with Intel, and has provided the Core i3, i5 and i7 chips for previous Surface Pro devices. The Kaby Lake chips seemed like a sure thing as it would increase the performance, power and battery life of the hybrid. However, there are whispers that the device-maker may not go with the Kaby Lake architecture and settle for a Ryzen 7 chip from AMD. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 predecessor received raging reviews but was also criticised because of poor battery performance. PC Advisor states that the theory emerged from a trailer of “Alien: Covenant,” which reportedly shows a Surface device. The surprise lies in the description of the YouTube video uploaded by 20th Century Fox. Video has been shared below. “Introducing Walter, the latest synthetic by Weyland-Yutani. Created to serve. Intelligence powered by AMD, Ryzen and Radeon,” the description reads. It is also possible that the Pro 5 will come in two processor variants, one with the Kaby Lake and the other with the AMD chip. The Ryzen 7 chip has been launched recently, and now it seems it will find a place inside the Surface hybrid. The trailer shows a group of scientists using a device that has amazing similarities to the Surface Pro in build and design. AMD’s logo also appears in the video. There were rumours in February that the device has been leaked on Microsoft’s French website. The image of the product that surfaced online was definitely a Surface product. There is immense anticipation among fans regarding the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 hybrid. It is expected to come in 4K UltraHD display. The screen could be the same 12.3 inches. Other rumoured specs include 16GB RAM, 512GB internal storage, highly-upgraded Surface Pen and wireless charging. While the device is expected in October, Microsoft may surprise fans by releasing it right after the Windows 10 Creators Update in April.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

So I should spend my hard earned money on inferior hardware in order to support some fanboi’s favourite multinational corporation in its failing attempts to earn more than another?

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

I played every single game I tried without problems. Of course the performance wasn’t exactly desirable after, I don’t know, 2013. But they worked flawlessly, both as CPU/GPU and as a great space heater. Damn, those things get hot. They worked, though.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules).

Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 18:51 waltC says: Just as was true for the original Athlon, it will take a bit of time for game developers to optimize for Ryzen and for the proper Ryzen compilers to make the developer circuit. In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Have a Kaby Lake/Ryzen CPU and Windows 7 or 8? Say goodbye to Windows Updates 03/16/2017 at 3:13 PM by Brad Linder 19 Comments Microsoft really wants you to run Windows 10. So while the company continues to offer security updates and bug fixes for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 (and Windows Vista for a few more weeks), the company announced last year that it would not support those operating systems for devices with the latest Intel and AMD chips. Up until now that’s basically just meant that if you were running Windows 8.1 or earlier on a PC with an Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Bristol Ridge or Ryzen processor you wouldn’t get officially supported drivers. But now Microsoft is going a step further: Windows Update won’t work on Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 computers with the most recent Intel or AMD chips. Specifically, users attempting to download updates through Windows Update may get a message that says: Unsupported Hardware Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates. Microsoft says that’s because only it will only support the latest Intel and AMD chips for Windows 10. And that probably won’t be an issue for most users, since most people upgrade their CPU and operating system at the same time: when they buy a new computer. But folks who may build their own computers and prefer Windows 7 to Windows 10 for one reason or another are now in a position where they have to choose between using an older processor or giving up on automatic updates. Or you could just skip Windows altogether and switch to Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, or another GNU/Linux operating system. via Hacker News Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 19 Comments on "Have a Kaby Lake/Ryzen CPU and Windows 7 or 8?

That might be true (I don’t use Office to know) but if you buy the full license for a computer you have access to the office suite for life, if you pay a monthly or annual subscription you only have one month or year of full access. With Windows 10 supposedly being the last Windows theoretically you could use Office 2013 or Office 2016 for 15-20 years if the computer remains in working condition that long. I still have an old computer (obviously not my main computer, good luck connecting to the internet with that thing) with what I recall was the first version of Microsoft Office on it from the mid 90’s that I could use if I connected the computer with an old parallel port printer and had the driver CD-ROM to it.

I want a big ass button, that says “Do Not Reboot This Machine Until I Choose To”. I don’t want to set a timer, I don’t want to set a metered connection (only works with WiFi BTW), and definitely no registry hacks that can get overwritten without my knowledge.

It’s perfectly fine if a Facebook & gaming machine reboots when it chooses to, no value lost, only annoying. But there are places where it’s absolutely unacceptable for a machine to decide to just reboot out of the blue, and Windows 10 is not suited for such places. BTW what is “fake rumor”?

I am not a fan of Windows 10’s insistence on updating immediately (unless you know how to set up the computer to delay a reboot until after the end of the work day) but when I first started using a computer in the late 70’s and early 80’s it was drummed into everyone’s heads to save your work every five minutes. If people did that they wouldn’t lose that much of their document due to lack of incremental saving.

While it might be irritating, it’s becoming much less of an issue all the time as apps and applications move towards autosaving every change you make. It used to be easy to lose your work when an app or the machine crashed (it happened to me more times than I can count) but you have to work quite hard to lose anything these days — especially on a scheduled reboot. Can’t remember the last time I lost anything. Time lost is still a pain, but again, it used to be much worse when it took several minutes just to boot up Windows.

There are screens in the kitchen and the cooks see what dish they need to make, then they press a button below the screen (custom keyboard with 15 keys) and the machine prints a sticker that goes on the box of the dish. The machines are last gen Intel NUCs, and they need to be on 24/7. When a cook comes, they log on the machine with an RFID card. We couldn’t use linux, because both the printer driver and the client program is made for Windows. We ended up using Windows 8.1, and disabled updates, because Windows 10 would reboot the machines and log out the cooks in the process.

I beta tested it and loved it before it actually came out, its a flaming POS now and honestly has broken every computer I have installed it on. I don’t want a version of windows that I have to reinstall multiple times per year, and nevermind the forced updates and bugged drivers that just come break your computer and there is literally nothing you can do about it.

But it needs drastic changes before I start to trust it on a mission-critical place.” Why would you EVER install Windows 10 in ANY work-place?

Should you sell NVIDIA after its disappointing start in 2017? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 18, 2017 at 4:00PM NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of the hottest stocks in 2016, surging 220% throughout the year and crushing the NASDAQ's 20% gain. But that rally abruptly petered out in 2017, and the stock has declined 3% year-to-date. Does that weak start indicate that NVIDIA could be running out of steam? Or is the stock merely taking a breather before fresh catalysts propel it to new highs? Let's take a closer look at the bearish and bullish cases to find out. NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 powered Roborace vehicle. Image source: NVIDIA. Why NVIDIA might be running out of steam A common bearish argument against NVIDIA is that the stock simply got ahead of itself. NVIDIA's current P/E of 40 marks a multi-year high and doesn't compare favorably to analyst expectations for 10% non-GAAP earnings growth this year. That's a significant slowdown from its 83% growth in fiscal 2017. NVIDIA's revenue is only expected to rise 16% this year, compared to 38% growth in 2017. Several factors are causing this slowdown. First, the expiration of NVIDIA's graphics cross-licensing deal with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) this month will reduce its revenues by $66 million per quarter. While that impact might seem small relative to the $2.2 billion in revenues it generated last quarter, it was "free" revenue which went directly to NVIDIA's bottom line and accounted for 9% of its non-GAAP net income. NVIDIA also faces fresh competition in its high-growth gaming GPU and automotive CPU markets this year. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) will launch its next-gen Vega GPUs within the next three months, which could put a lot of pressure on NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal-based GeForce cards. NVIDIA's high-end GTX 1080 Ti GPU. Image source: NVIDIA. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel are both aggressively scaling up their automotive chip businesses. Qualcomm will likely close its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, making it the largest automotive chipmaker in the world. Intel recently announced that it will acquire Mobileye, which supplies 90% of the world's top automakers with collision detection systems. Both Qualcomm and Intel believe that these purchases will bolster their presence in connected and driverless cars -- which could threaten NVIDIA's early lead with Tegra processors. Intel has also taken notice of NVIDIA's progress in data centers, where it's been pairing its Tesla GPUs with non-Intel CPUs for machine-learning purposes. To strike back, Intel recently launched its new "Knights Landing" Xeon Phi processor, which reportedly outperformed the Tesla GPUs in several scientific benchmarks. Why NVIDIA might be taking a breather NVIDIA faces more challenges this year than it did before, but the company has kept its core businesses healthy with a steady stream of fresh partnerships. In the driverless car market, NVIDIA partnered with Baidu to develop a driverless platform last August, partnered with Bosch to create a next-gen driving supercomputer called Xavier in early 2017, and unveiled a proof-of-concept autonomous truck with Paccar in March. In the data center market, NVIDIA launched a new hyperscale GPU accelerator blueprint with Microsoft in March, which is aimed at strengthening its cloud-based AI computing capabilities. NVIDIA also pushed back against AMD in the console market by supplying Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) with the Tegra X1 SoC for its new Switch console. Initial demand for the Switch seems strong, which indicates that the console could become a new pillar of growth for the Tegra line alongside connected cars. The Nintendo Switch. Image source: Nintendo. As for gaming GPUs, NVIDIA plans to counter AMD's Vega with its next-gen Volta GPUs. The Volta probably won't arrive until early 2018, but hardcore gamers might skip the Vega in favor of this next-gen chipset. All these factors indicate that its core growth businesses of gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and Tegra CPUs should all continue growing for the foreseeable future. The verdict: NVIDIA is just taking a breather NVIDIA faces a lot more headwinds than it did before, but it's still making solid progress across the gaming, AI, and connected car markets. Its P/E of 40 admittedly looks high, but investors should also note that the stock also trades at 37 times 2018 earnings, 31 times 2019 earnings, and 24 times 2020 earnings -- so that multiple will eventually cool off to more reasonable levels. Investors shouldn't expect NVIDIA to repeat its massive gains from last year, but they also shouldn't believe the stock will fall off a cliff. I believe that the stock will trade sideways over the next few quarters, until the company proves that new challenges from AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm won't throttle its long-term growth.   Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The new Connected Modular 45 timepiece uses an Intel SoC, runs Google’s Android Wear 2.0, and is listed with 'expanded functionality'. Tag Heuer will also offer a variety of customization options for the new smartwatch and aim to address different market segments with the new product. Furthermore, the watchmaker says that the Connected Modular 45 design could easily fit a mechanical module and be converted into a regular timepiece. Tag Heuer, Google and Intel formally introduced their first-gen connected smartwatch in late-2015. The wristwatch was the first device of the kind for Tag Heuer and for Intel, and so it was largely a test vehicle for both of them. As it turned out, the Tag Heuer Connected was considered a success by its developers and with the second generation they decided to install a more capable computing platform, a better display and introduce customizable design options. The use of Google Android Wear 2.0 should expand the overall functionality of the new smartwatch, in order to offer more features. Tag Heuer will offer different configurations of the Connected Modular 45: 11 standard versions available in retail and additional configurations upon request. Each timepiece consists of three key elements which users can mix and match: the watch module, the lugs, and the strap. All watch modules are made of grade 5 titanium 5 with a sand-blasted satin finish (of a chosen color), but users can choose bezels of different colors made of ceramic, gold, aluminum, titanium, and even covered with diamonds. The lugs can match the bezels and thus can be made of aluminum, titanium, ceramic and so on. Finally, the manufacturer will offer a variety of straps featuring different colors (black, brown, red, green, etc.) made of calfskin, rubber, ceramic or titanium. The central piece of the Connected Modular 45 is, of course, the watch module. The latter is based on the Intel Atom Z3400-series SoC (Merrifield, two Silvermont cores, 1 MB cache) equipped with 512 MB of LPDDR3 memory (down from 1 GB in the previous-gen model) and 4 GB of NAND flash memory. The device comes with a wireless module featuring Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and NFC as well as a host of sensors, including an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a tilt detection sensor and an ambient light sensor. In addition, the module has a water-resistant microphone and a vibration/haptics engine, but no speaker. The most notable upgrade of the new Tag Heuer smartwatch is the new 1.39” AMOLED display, with a 400×400 resolution and 287 PPI, which is higher than many competing wearable devices. The display is covered with a 2.5-mm sapphire glass, just like many Swiss-made watches. As for the battery, the manufacturer states that it has a capacity of 410 mAh and claims it can last for up to 25 hours.

Now, speaking of mechanics, when someone buys the Connected Modular 45, they can easily switch the smartwatch module with a mechanical watch module that Tag Heuer offers: a moderately-priced Swiss mechanical movement module with 3 hands (calibre 5) or an expensive COSC-certified chronograph Tourbillon Heuer 02-T. Both are also water resistant. One of the things that Tag Heuer has learnt since the launch of the original Connected smartwatch is that there is a market for premium smartwatches. As a result, the Connected Modular 45 will be available at different price points depending on their external finish. The starting price of the smartwatch is $1650/€1600/£1400, but when fully beefed up with diamonds, their price increases to around $7000. Additionally, Tag Heuer offers the so-called Deluxe Box Set that includes one Connected Modular 45 (in grade 5 titanium, with titanium lugs and brown natural leather strap) and one chronograph Heuer-02T tourbillon mechanical module for a total price of €16,650/$17,000 (ex. tax). Both electronics and mechanical modules come with a two-year warranty. Sources: Tag Heuer, Google, Intel.

But maybe there is a better way to get this kind of watch, I mean, really the exact same capabilities with less money? Here you go http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watch-phone/pp_57617... . Same display (AMOLED, 1.39 inch 400x400), bigger battery (450mAh), metal case (you don't really need titanium, you will die before this watch is destroyed), full android experience - you can install everything you like, quad core CPU (compared to two Intel Silvermont), 1GB of RAM compared to 512, 8GB of storage compared to 4GB, SIM support compared to...nothing. Shall I continue? The only thing missing on the Finow X5 plus compared to this watch is the missing Tag Heuer badge which....can be engraved easily.

Reply shabby - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link There's nothing luxurious about this watch, its a regular smartwatch with a "high end" brand stamped on it, it will drop in value as soon as you put it on your wrist... meaning its not a luxury watch at all. Reply eddman - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link "smartwatch with a "high end" brand stamped on it" ...which is the whole point. Rich people buy brands. That's the most important thing to them.

Reply geekman1024 - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link well, this watch and that one which yeeeeman linked, might be manufactured by the same Chinese factory....if that's the case, that will be a rather sad and funny ironic. Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link It's stereotypical to say wealthy people care about branding. I'd argue to the contrary. People who have wealth are more effective money managers that understand the value of things and take into account product specifications, value for the cost, brand prestige, AND (something you forgot which is most important) the usefulness of a particular purchase. These trinkets are more for the upper middle class sorts that are trying to demonstrate wealth, but are actually not exactly above the masses of working class they're trying to escape. Reply fanofanand - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link I have to disagree with this. There are some wealthy people who are concerned with specifications and performance, but "most" wealthy people cannot be bothered to research items they are purchasing. Half the time they have an assistant who will be doing the purchasing for them, and the other half just buys whatever their friends have or whatever is most expensive. Truly wealthy people don't have time to sit down for a couple hours researching each purpose. They just tell their assistant "I need a new watch, get me a new Rolex and make it a good one" or something to that effect. We all probably have our own unique experiences with the wealthy that might guide our understanding, but my personal example would be my uncle in-law. The man is worth a few hundred million dollars, and all he cares about is prestige and appearance. He only buys/drives Mercedes "because it's a Mercedes", his watch is a Rolex, the list goes on and on. He doesn't know the first thing about tech, but he knows that "Apple is the best" so whatever is Apple, he buys. That doesn't make him dumb, the man is a brain surgeon and a lung surgeon, he is a brilliant man. He just doesn't have time to research "toys" which is what stuff like this is to the wealthy. It's one more watch to add to their collection. Nothing more. Reply boozed - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link That is how luxury brands like Tag Heuer operate. In the case of its mechanical watches, they're generally lightly modified off-the-shelf movements (e.g. ETA, Sellita) surrounded by a bunch of marketing. It's not so much about the value proposition.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run).

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely?

Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?

Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it.

It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay.

In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Exclusive  ⋮  Finance Analysis: Intel Agrees To Buy Mobileye, Is The Company Worth $15.3 Billion? By Usman Pirzada Mar 16, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel has made the decision to diversify away from its core business to a very significant extent with the acquisition of Mobileye for $15.3 Billion. Mobileye currently accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year.On paper, the deal looks good, the market for autonomous vehicles is clearly a race Intel wants to get into and analysts have commented that this might be a fair price for something that is “key technology” to break into this sector. So the question then becomes, is Mobileye worth $15.3 Billion? The deal and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC 35.58 0.88%)’s past record I’ll tell you right off the bat that I am not going to be giving an alternative valuation for the acquisition, just pointing out some considerations regarding Mobileye that could point to an over-valuation driven by the heating arms race among autonomous-automobile companies. Let’s start off with a little bit of context, Intel has a history of reacting incorrectly to new and emerging platforms. The most clear example of this is the fact that it refused to jump onto the smartphone ship until it was too late and in the process missed what could have been the biggest diversification opportunities of recent past. Another example would be spinning out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Related NVIDIA and AMD Witness Increased GPU Market Share in Q4 2016 As Intel Declines – Green Team Market Share Now at 17.5%, Red Team at 14.4% Keeping that in mind, we can see how it might set the stage for Intel(NASDAQ: INTC 35.58 0.88%) overcompensating in a manner of speaking and jumping on-board whatever seemingly disruptive opportunity comes up next. Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. So in terms of the sector it has chosen to diversify into, there is very little argument; the autonomous market is definitely an opportunity for Intel and it will definitely be the big leagues of the future.  So the race itself that Intel has opted for is one it should very much try to get into. Mobileye however, may or may not be the right horse depending on a number of variables which we will get into this article. Lets start with the basics, the first question that we can ask is what will be Mobileye’s state post-acquisition and what exactly has Intel in store for the Israeli chip designer. Interestingly, according to Intel, it will be giving Mobileye an unusual amount of autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. The two companies already have an ongoing relationship in the form of their ongoing collaboration with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year So considering the fact that Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP, just what is the verdict on this deal. As is always the case however, the answer isn’t in black on white, and depends primarily on how Intel utilizes the company. To give our readers some more context, Mobileye adopted the MIPS approach recently going to use Intel’s technology for its fifth generation of Vision processors that are going to enter the market sometime in 2021. Comparing Mobileye’s offerings to that of competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA 108.47 2.27%) In terms of current offering, Mobileye plans to introduce the EyeQ4 chip by 2018 – a truly worthy upgrade (to the EyeQ3) with 14 computing cores, out of which 10 are accelerators. You will have your usual 4 cores as well as accelerators of three different kinds: PMA (Programmable Macro Array), VMP (Vector Microcode Processors) and MPCs (Multithreaded Processing Clusters). The actual count will be 4 Cores, 6 VMPs, 2 PMAs and 2 MPCs for the EyeQ4. This will result in approximately 1.26 Billion MAC/s or 2.5 Tflops. And here is the best part – all of this will be done while staying within a TDP Target of less than 5 Watts. Unfortunately however, there is a problem with Mobileye’s approach to tackling ADAS and the self-driving challenge. According to statements of their own key execs, the market started accelerating towards self driving much faster then they had anticipated. Their products utilize fixed function philosophy and while they have a high utilization rate and were much faster then GPUs previously, not only are they starting to fall behind in terms of the performance increase offered every year but aren’t as flexible or powerful as Nvidia’s approach – which is basically machine learning on the go. Take the EyeQ4 processor for eg which will have (in roughly comparable terms) a performance rating of 1.5-2.5 TFLOPs where as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA 108.47 2.27%) is equipping Tesla cars with the Drive PX 2 set which can churn out 24 TFLOPs. I have seen some arguments which point out that the cuDNN equivalent utilization is roughly 0.3 for GPUs and even if we assume that Tesla has made no in-house optimizations, you are still looking at a bare bones performance of 8 TFLOPs. So Nvidia’s worst case scenario is 3.2x faster than the best Mobileye chip (which hasn’t even fully landed yet) right now. Related PC Gaming Hardware Market Breaches $30 Billion For The First Time in History – High-End Hardware Accounts For 43% Share Advertisement Let’s talk about the Intel-Mobileye chip now. The EyeQ5 will probably be designed in advanced 10nm or below FinFET technology node and will feature eight multi-threaded CPU cores coupled with eighteen cores of Mobileye’s next-generation, innovative, and well-proven vision processors. Taken together, these enhancements will increase performance 8x times over the current 4th generation EyeQ4. The EyeQ5 will produce more than 12 Tera operations per second, while keeping power consumption below 5W, to maintain passive cooling at extraordinary performance. Engineering samples of EyeQ5 are expected to be available by first half of 2018 and are supposed to be delivered to market by 2020. Let’s compare this to an upcoming product Nvidia has already announced: Xavier is a complete system-on-chip (SoC), integrating a new GPU architecture called Volta, a custom 8 core CPU architecture, and a new computer vision accelerator. The processor will deliver 20 TOPS (trillion operations per second) of performance, while consuming only 20 watts of power. As the brain of a self-driving car, Xavier is designed to be compliant with critical automotive standards, such as the ISO 26262 functional safety specification. Xavier samples will be available the fourth quarter of 2017 to automakers, tier 1 suppliers, startups and research institutions who are developing self-driving cars with availability in 2018. Wccftech NVIDIA Drive PX 2 NVIDIA Xavier SOC Name Parker Xavier Process Technology 16nm FinFET 16nm FinFET+ CPU 12 Core CPU 8 Core CPU CPU Architecture 8 x A57 4 x Denver2 4 x ARM64-bit GPU Architecture Pascal Volta Total Chips 2 x Tegra X2 2 x Pascal MXM GPUs 1 x Xavier Compute TFLOPs 8 TFLOPs ~6.6 TFLOPs Compute DLTOPs 24 DLTOPs 20 DLTOPs System Memory 8 GB LPDDR4 (50+ GB/s) TBD Graphics Memory 4 GB GDDR5 (80+ GB/s) TBD TDP 250W 20W Roadmap Current (Tesla Motors) Upcoming, expected 2018 So where does that leave Intel? Nvidia is first and foremost a GPU designer and when the name of the game is DNN, it will be able to provide both the back-end for training as well as the onboard system for fully autonomous driving systems. Mobileye and Intel however can only provide one (the onboard system) since CPUs have never been good at deep learning applications. The lack of GPGPU IP is another weakness in the Intel-Mobileye fit that could potentially hurt its chances of fully utilizing the acquisition. Nvidia Corporation can provide both the back-end and the front-end (in a manner of speaking) for autonomous driving systems. That said, this is something Intel can tackle in numerous ways. The first way to do it would be to to utilize its in-house talent that it poached from Nvidia (An example being Sanjay Gongalore from NVIDIA. At NVIDIA, Gongalore served as director of GPU ASIC Engineering). Secondly (and admittedly less probably), it can utilize the Radeon IP it already has to provide backend functionality to compliment the Mobileye initiative. In any case, one thing is very clear: Mobileye in its current state and function does not appear to be wholly capable of matching Nvidia in either capability or performance and will quickly be far outstripped by the fast paced chip-maker if it does not change its current fixed function philosophy. That said, Mobileye would have been a very good buy just for the IP it offers at a significantly lower premium. At the current pricing, it is priced more like the on-paper specs of the company (70% market share) without accounting for the severe risks it faces going forwards from new but powerful entrants like Nvidia Corporation. To justify its purchase, Intel must seek to broaden the vision of Mobileye and offer a truly integrative approach that matches the one provided by Nvidia.       Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Related Analysis: Emerging Trends in the PC and Hardware Industry for 2017 – What Do Intel, NVIDIA and AMD Have in Store?

Should you wait and see if we have a big correction? Will the Trump administration unleash the power of the economy with a huge infrastructure project and cash repatriation program? Where are the best opportunities after an eight-year bull market run? The best ideas may be the simplest: stick with big, established companies that pay dividends. One of the best sectors to stick with could be technology, and the winners could very well be some of the old guard that are adding to their capability and raising the dividends they pay to their shareholders. We screened the Merrill Lynch research database, and found four companies rated Buy that fit the bill, some of which have current catalysts that could drive share prices. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. Intel posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that were flat compared to the previous year, as well as revenue that was up 1%. But both the top and bottom lines exceeded the consensus analysts’ estimates posted at Thomson Reuters. This week the company announced the purchase of Mobileye for $15.3 billion. The Israel sensor company gives the chip giant a leg up in the autonomous car competition, and it also adds many other capabilities. While some say the valuation paid is high, the dividends down the road could be worth the price. Intel investors receive a 2.96% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the shares is $42, while the Wall Street consensus target is $40.34. The stock closed Tuesday at $35.18 a share. [nativounit] Microsoft This top old-school technology stock is top pick at Merrill Lynch, and it has a massive $136.79 billion sitting on the balance sheet. Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) continues to find an increasing amount of support from portfolio managers, who have added the software giant to their holdings at an increasingly faster pace all of this year and last. Numerous Wall Street analysts feel that Microsoft has become a clear number two in the public or hyper-scale cloud infrastructure market with Azure, which is the company’s cloud computing platform offering. Some have flagged Azure as a solid rival to Amazon’s AWS service. Analysts also maintain that Microsoft is discounting Azure for large enterprises, such that Azure may be cheaper than AWS for larger users. Many believe the company continues to make steady progress with its cloud transition and expect Office 365 and Azure to be solid contributors to top and bottom line for the next several years. While not likely to snag the top slot from Amazon, it could add huge incremental revenue for years to come, especially when you factor in the huge revenue potential from the banks, insurance companies and the financial services industry. Microsoft has reported quarterly earnings and revenue that easily topped analysts’ expectations, as its key cloud product, Azure, saw revenue grow 102%. Fiscal fourth-quarter results exceeded the Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. Microsoft shareholders receive a 2.37% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $75 price objective, and the consensus target is $69.42. The shares close most recently at $64.41. Lam Research This remains one of the top chip equipment picks across Wall Street. Lam Research Corp. (NASDAQ: LRCX) designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The company offers plasma etch products that remove materials from the wafer to create the features and patterns of a device. Many Wall Street analysts have highlighted the company and its peers as having a significant equipment opportunity from the NAND evolution as well. Lam Research also appears well positioned to gain share in the wafer fab equipment market, driven by a strong focus on technology inflection spending over the next few years. Despite so-so foundry and logic spending over the past year, many on Wall Street think that Lam will also continue to benefit from technology transitions such as FinFET, 3D NAND, multi patterning and advanced packaging in 2016 and beyond. Many analysts believe it is the “cleanest” semi-cap story benefiting from cyclical tailwind, SAM expansion and share gains. The analysts noted that Lam Research reported solid results and an impressive shipment outlook. The $8 billion in estimated revenues was well ahead of Wall Street expectations for 2017. The wafer spending outlook looks strong, and the company should easily grow revenues over 20% year over year in 2017 and once again outperform the industry. Shareholders receive a 1.52% dividend. The whopping $140 Merrill Lynch price target compares with a consensus target of $132.37. The shares closed Tuesday a $122.35. Qualcomm This is a top technology stock was hit hard earlier this year and is offering investors a great entry point. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) designs, develops and supplies semiconductors and collects royalties on wireless handheld devices and infrastructure based on its dominant position in CDMA and other related technology patents. In addition, Qualcomm provides systems software and components to wireless handset vendors and promotes applications and services that run on high-speed wireless networks. The company operates primarily through two segments: CDMA Technologies and Technology Licensing. The company posted inline fourth-quarter results, but a lawsuit from Apple and some regulatory pressures weighed heavily on the shares. The company was also forced to defend the licensing model it has used for years and address patent leadership. Merrill Lynch remains bullish on the company’s acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, which Qualcomm is buying in an all-cash deal at $110 per share. The deal is expected to close at the end of 2017 and should be immediately accretive to earnings. The merger brings together complementary products for mobile, automotive, Internet of Things and networking applications. Shareholders receive a 3.65% dividend. Merrill Lynch has set its price target at $66. The consensus is $64.99, and shares closed Tuesday at $58.22.

Israeli company Mobileye develops Advance Driver Assistance Systems for two dozen auto manufacturers worldwide. Washington Post photo by William Booth   William Booth The Washington Post     Editor's note: The U.S. chipmaking giant Intel announced Monday that it had reached a deal to acquire an Israeli company called Mobileye for $15 billion -- making it the biggest buy of an Israeli high-tech company ever. Mobileye is a leader in the race to make self-driving vehicles a reality. Weeks ago, Washington Post reporter William Booth went for a drive in one of company's test cars. Here's how it felt. -- -- -- JERUSALEM -- Ziv Aviram has one of his tech guys bring the test car around to the parking lot. The co-founder of Mobileye tells me he's going to drive around Jerusalem without touching the steering wheel. "Hop in," the CEO says. The test car bristles with eight cameras. The interior contains laptops with blinking screens. The tech guy jumps into the back seat and begins to do things. You hear typing. Mobileye is a global player, building Advanced Driver Assistance Systems for two dozen international automobile manufacturers. These are the sensor packages that auto-brake for imminent collisions, warn drivers about lane drift and reduce speed when approaching slow-moving vehicles. Calamity-avoidance stuff. "Buckle up," Aviram instructs. "We go for a ride." This street-ready prototype is good for "proof of concept" testing, meaning it is not fully self-driving yet. When the true autonomous vehicles go on sale, Aviram promises, you won't see any cameras, maybe just lenses. The processors, satellite receivers, mapping, laser radar, sonar will all be shrunk. The tech guy in the back seat will disappear. Later, they will get rid of the steering wheel, too. I want to trust Aviram. But this is Israel, a place where people boast about how badly they drive. Many Israelis already drive without their hands on the wheel, because they are drinking coffee or having a smoke while talking on a cellphone. Aviram hand-steers Mobileye's white sedan out of the lot into traffic. He waits until he has merged onto a decent three-lane highway before he lets go of the wheel. "You're driving now in the future," he says. Mobileye is partnering with BMW, Intel and Delphi to make this happen sooner than you might think. I notice that Aviram, while in spiel mode, is not really paying total attention to the road ahead, or to the beater passenger van filled with yeshiva kids shouldering into our lane from the right, without signaling, or to the gravel truck up ahead, belching smoke, crawling in the passing lane on the left. "You're in the time machine," he purrs. We're in heavy Jerusalem traffic, I think. "You have the opportunity to glimpse how our lives will look in a few years." I'm glimpsing the van muscling into our space. Then Aviram has to subtly adjust the wheel -- for the van. This is not a gotcha moment. This is beta-testing. If the technologists in San Jose, Yokohama and Munich are right, it will soon give way to the biggest advance in automotive technology since the Ford Model T rolled off assembly lines around a century ago. In the 2020s, they say, autonomous cars will be the wheeled version of the smartphone. "In two decades, it will be illegal to drive in developed countries," Aviram predicts. He understands that this concept takes a few minutes to sink in. "The wave is too big to stop," he says. The world's first self-driving taxis, operated by a company called nuTonomy, began picking up passengers in central Singapore in August. An Associated Press reporter along for a test ride noted that "the safety driver" had to tap on the brakes -- but just once. Uber customers in downtown Pittsburgh started getting rides in semiautonomous cars with a human chaperon at the wheel in September. A journalist from Wired reported that the human driver took back control several times, but in a very low-key way: "Once, he's not happy with how long the car is waiting before slowing for a pedestrian. Another time, he manually steers around a double parked truck, knowing the system will just stop and wait for it to move." In the United States, the presence of a human driver remains a requirement -- just in case. Tragedy has already struck. An early adapter named Joshua Brown was killed while driving his all-electric Tesla Model S in hands-free Autopilot Mode in Florida last year. The vehicle crashed into a white semitrailer truck, which the car apparently thought was a cloudy sky. (Mobileye supplied the vision sensors for Tesla and blamed the radar; Mobileye and Tesla ended their relationship.) But the machines are learning. Google's car project is called Waymo, for "New Way Forward in Mobility." Autonomous cars are driving around in four cities and have racked up 2 million miles in self-driving mode. In California, which is closely tracking the experiment, Waymo operators reported 341 "disengagement incidents" in 2015, in which a test driver had to take control of the steering wheel, gas pedal or brakes. Last year, there were just 124 disengagements, despite an increase in the numbers of cars and miles driven. As the Mobileye test car cruises through tunnels down Jerusalem's Menachem Begin Expressway, Aviram says: "This is semiautonomous first implementation," meaning: Don't get too excited yet. In all, we drove at 50 mph for a half-hour along the highways. We didn't take surface streets. It was like hands-free cruise control, but better. "The vehicle understands the scene in front of us and drives accordingly," Aviram said. The car accelerated and braked, maintained its lanes and even changed lanes. Inside one of Mobile's semiautonomous cars in Jerusalem. Israeli company Mobileye develops Advance Driver Assistance Systems for two dozen auto manufacturers worldwide. - (William Booth/The Washington Post) The self-driving revolution is gathering speed. There's better imaging, sensors, sonar, software and laser radar. Faster satellite positioning, sharper detail. Still, a Global Positioning Satellite can pinpoint a position to within only about three to six feet. To self-drive, you need to be talking inches. Aviram says companies such as Mobileye and the automakers will partner to gather data from all the vehicles traveling the same roads and use it to create "drivable paths." Mapping systems pioneered by the Israeli company Waze already do this. The biggest challenge, according to Aviram, will be teaching artificial-intelligence programs humanlike intuition. He gives an example: Four cars simultaneously approach a four-way intersection with stop signs. "A machine might sit there all day, waiting," he says. But a human driver would intuit who goes first. The processors of autonomous cars will have to learn this "human-level negotiation." The hardest situation developers face? "The most effort may go into how to merge into traffic," Aviram says. Imagine a traffic circle in Rome or the entrance to New York's Holland Tunnel. The machine will have to learn from millions of possible scenarios -- as well as figure out different countries' driving habits. Later, after we safely parked the test car back at the Mobileye offices, I asked Aviram why he is unconcerned about the loss of our right to drive. "I am also a driver, and I like to drive," he said. But he has also computed the odds of injury or worse. Driver error, he noted, is responsible for 93 percent of car accidents. There are 1.5 million auto fatalities a year worldwide, and more than 50 million people injured. The economic costs are estimated at $500 billion. "Driving is like a global pandemic," he concluded. Self-driving cars are the cure -- or so he says. Then he ticked off some positives. Imagine a driving experience, he said, in which your car operates itself while you doze, work, chat, read, look out the window. "Once there were elevator operators," he said. "We don't miss them." In the future, there's no steering wheel, so the car has a little card table and passengers sit salon-style around it. The vehicle is a lightweight plastic bubble. It runs on whatever is the cleanest or cheapest energy source. What about all the taxi drivers? The truckers? My FedEx delivery person? What about Bruce Springsteen's "Thunder Road"? Bruce and Mary don't drive away in an autonomous pod. Aviram said that when the automobile was invented, the livery, buggy and horse industries rebelled, and lost. Robots are now ubiquitous in manufacturing -- and so robots will drive vehicles. I asked Aviram if he'd watched the "Terminator" films. He said he has. But not to worry.

Huawei Mate 9 review: the P10 is coming soon Nintendo Switch: better pack a powerbank for Zelda Computers / AMD Ryzen 5 revealed, to take on Core i5? By Hadlee Simons on 16 March, 2017 It was just a few weeks ago that AMD revealed the first processors in its new Ryzen family. The Ryzen 7 range is meant to close the gap to Intel’s Core i7 family, but at a much cheaper price point than Intel’s silicon. Now, the chipmaker has revealed Ryzen 5, being positioned as a rival for the Core i5. The Ryzen 5 starts with the 1400 model, being a quad-core chip running at 3.2Ghz (boosting to 3.4Ghz) and having a suggested price of US$169. Spend US$189 and you get the quad-core 1500X model, upping the ante to 3.5Ghz and 3.7Ghz when boosting. Got US$219 to spend? Then the hexacore 1600 is worth a look, delivering speeds of 3.2Ghz or 3.6Ghz when boosting. Otherwise, the top-end model in the Ryzen 5 range is the US$249 1600X, being a hexacore with speeds of 3.6Ghz (or 4Ghz for boosting). The chips, based on AMD’s long-awaited Zen architecture, are meant for gamers and content creators on desktop, the company wrote in a press statement. AMD seems to have upped its game with the Ryzen 5 series, meant to take on Intel’s Core i5 “Ryzen will ultimately bring innovation and competition to virtually every segment of the PC market, and Ryzen 5 is the next big step on that journey, designed to achieve new levels of compute performance for millions of PC users,” said Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s Computing and Graphics Group. “AMD reinvigorated the high-performance desktop market with Ryzen 7 earlier this month, and AMD Ryzen 5 now brings the power and efficiency of the ‘Zen’ core to users in the highly popular sub-$300 segment of the market.” So what kind of performance should you expect? The chipmaker cited earlier testing in the release. “Previously, AMD demonstrated the Ryzen 5 1600X beating the Intel Core i5 7600K by 69 percent in CPU performance testing using Cinebench R15 nT.” Of course, benchmarks are one thing, so we eagerly await tests from real games and real-world applications. Expect to get your hands on these chips on 11 April. Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings almost seven years of tech journalism experience to the table. When he's not at work or watching motorsport, he's in the foetal position on a jiu jitsu mat.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact AMD Takes The Fight to Intel With New Midrange Ryzen 5 Processors Azeem Ullah 5 days ago AMD shocked everyone when they released their long awaited Ryzen series of processors. At first the company released the high end processors which competed with $1000+ Intel chips and cost less than half of that. Following up on that, the chipmaker announced the rest of the Ryzen lineup. Called Ryzen 5 it includes 4 different CPU models. These are are essentially just two processors, with a normal and a beefed up frequency variant. Ryzen 5 Series Specifications and Price The highest end processor in the Ryzen 5 lineup is the Ryzen 5 1600X, which comes with a 6-core configuration and 12 threads. The base clock is set at 3.6GHz with a turbo clock of 4GHz. The 1600X also has a TDP of 95W and starts at $249. The next in line is the Ryzen 5 1600, with similar core and thread-count. It is clocked lower at 3.2GHz with a lower turbo boost of 3.6GHz. It has a TDP of 65W, like every other processor in the range that follows it. It is priced at $219. AMD is likely trying to tackle Intel’s i5-7600K chip with these two processors as they cost the same as Intel’s offering. Intel’s chip has four cores and slightly lower TDP compared with AMD’s 1600X and 1600 and does not feature hyper-threading unlike AMD’s processors. Moving on towards the less expensive CPUs, the 1500X and 1400 come in quad-core configurations with 8 threads each. The former has a base clock of 3.5GHz with a turbo of 3.7GHz,while the latter comes with a 3.2GHz base clock and 3.4GHz on boost. As for the pricing, 1500X costs $189 while the 1400 costs $169 Here, AMD is targeting the i5-7500K with the 1500X and 1400. All 3 feature the same TDP and cores but AMD offers double the threads (8 compared to 4). The price falls within the same range as well. Close Competition As for performance benchmarks, we don’t have any yet. With its high end Ryzen processors AMD tried to make up for the lack of single-core performance by including more cores and threads. However with Ryzen 5 the only difference is the number of threads which would make the competition interesting. The Ryzen 5 series is compatible with AM4 sockets, the same ones used in the high end Ryzen processors. Compatibility would not be an issue if you try to upgrade from a lower end Ryzen CPU to a higher end one. AMD will also pair the processors with its own Wraith series of optional coolers. The series is set to launch on April 11th, 2017.

Intel will buy Mobileye for more than $ 15 billion (14 billion euros), the companies said, in a deal signalling the US computer chip giant's commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. THOMAS COEX / AFP (From L-R) Amnon Shashua co-founder and CTO of Mobileye, Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen, Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and fellow co-founder of Mobileye Ziv Aviram give a press conference at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem on March 14, 2017. US giant Intel announced it would buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than $ 15 billion (14 billion euros), the largest cross-border tech deal in the Jewish state's history. MENAHEM KAHANA / AFP Intel’s $ 15-billion purchase of Israeli firm Mobileye could help fuel the country’s rise in the driverless car industry — not as a builder of vehicles, but as the brains behind them. Monday’s deal, the largest ever in Israel’s tech sector, could help boost trade despite the fact no commercial cars are assembled in the country. The self-styled “startup nation” has no real tradition of auto manufacturing: an ignoble previous stint in the 1960s and 70s produced the fibreglass Sussita car, parts of which, according to legend, were edible for camels. But the rise of new technology including driverless cars has opened space for the tech-savvy country to excel. In 2013, Google paid more than $ 1 billion (900 million euros) for Waze, an Israeli crowd-sourced app that plots the quickest journeys in real time, followed by Monday’s $ 15 billion Mobileye deal. The company makes advanced driver assistance and accident avoidance systems for car manufacturers, and has already collaborated with Intel and BMW on self-driving car technology. It was founded in 1999 but Yossi Vardi — considered one of the fathers of Israel’s high-tech startup scene — said the automobile industry’s growth in Israel really began in 2007 when General Motors established a research and development centre. “It surprised everybody that a company like General Motors would go to Israel to source innovation and technology.” In the last three years, Vardi said, Honda, Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo and others have followed suit. Most Israeli companies in the field don’t involve production, but ways to make driving more efficient. Among them are Otonomo, which provides in-depth data on car usage; Argus, one of the market leaders in protecting cars from cyber hacking; and VocalZoom, dubbed “Siri for cars.” Elan Zivotofsky, general partner at the OurCrowd equity platform that invests in a number of companies working on autonomous cars, compared it to smartphones, laptops and other sectors where Israeli technology is heavily used but the final products are still made elsewhere. “Israel is not going to be in the business of building cars,” he said. “Israel is in the business of building some of the most important core elements that will enable autonomous driving.” – ‘Doors will open’ – Vardi said the country’s military experience, with some of the world’s most advanced monitoring, laser-guiding and other technologies, place it in a good position. “When you drive a car, you cannot stop the car and wait 15 minutes for the computer to process. It has to be immediate,” Vardi said. “This kind of talent you find in the military — in airplanes etc.” The impact of Mobileye could be significant, said Yaniv Feldman, editor-in-chief of the Israeli Geektime tech blog. There are dozens of companies in the sector and Feldman reckons Israel is already one of the leading players in autonomous driving behind the United States and China. In 2016, around $ 70 million was invested in automotive tech in Israel, he said, but that will increase by “somewhere between 25 to 40 percent.” “We will probably start seeing much more activity in the space and investor interest rising,” he told AFP. None of the other companies were as advanced as Mobileye, though, he added. Aquarius Engines, an Israeli firm that claims to have developed a radically improved combustion engine, is currently seeking $ 10 million in a second round of funding. Chairman Gal Fridman said they had already noticed a change. “Since Mobileye happened, our phone is ringing all the time,” he told AFP. “Until now, when I came and told (car companies) I was an Israeli developing an engine, it was a bit odd as the country has no history of automobiles,” he said. “Now, after Waze and Mobileye, we have more credibility, I think, and doors will open easier.” What do you think?

It’s been another exciting week across the tech world, with no end of exciting news keeping us on our toes. But if you’ve struggled to keep with it all, fear not, for 7 Days is here once more with a handy walkthrough of the week’s top tech news. "Laser beam" Our journey begins this week on a beam of light, as researchers at the University of Michigan revealed significant progress in development efforts for “lightwave” computers, relying on ultra-fast laser impulses to get electrons firing at incredible speeds. Their discoveries could pave the way towards creating quantum computing devices. Amazon announced that it’s bringing support for its Alexa digital assistant to iPhones – but oddly, not in the Alexa app. Instead, the functionality is being added to the Amazon app on iOS devices. On Thursday, Apple released the seventh betas of iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 Sierra, both for developers, and testers on its Public Beta program. A passenger on a flight to Melbourne, Australia suffered injuries when her wireless headphones ‘exploded’ on board. The incident raised fresh concerns over battery-powered consumer devices on airliners, following the ban on Samsung’s Galaxy Note7 on flights last year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke with Australia's Prime Minister, offering energy storage solutions and reliable supplies to solve recent electricity shortage issues that left 40,000 people without power in South Australia. But domestic energy suppliers criticized the government for even considering Musk’s offer, calling for a “transparent bid process” and a level playing field to give Australian companies “a fair go”. Over in the UK, telecommunications giant BT agreed to spin off its Openreach network division into a separate company that will provide rivals with access to its domestic network. Rivals such as Virgin Media mocked the move, claiming that it will make little difference to BT’s competitors and to UK customers, as Openreach will continue to offer “the same old snail’s paced network with a new shell”. In Russia, Apple was found guilty of price-fixing after regulators determined that it was compelling companies to sell many of its iPhones at a minimum retail price, stifling competition in the domestic market. Several Russians were among those alleged to have been involved in major digital attacks against Yahoo, which compromised hundreds of millions of user accounts. Image: Getty Images for Visa Visa is considering launching - or at least supporting - wearable devices with support for mobile payments – but rather than going down the ‘typical’ route of wristbands, it’s instead trialling sunglasses with NFC support. On Friday, Qualcomm announced that its processors will now be known as ‘platforms’, and that it's ditching the Snapdragon branding from its current Snapdragon 200-series chips, which will now be branded under the ‘Qualcomm Mobile’ moniker. Meanwhile, rival chipmaker Intel stunned the markets by announcing its $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that focuses on developing technology for autonomous vehicles. The purchase is a hugely significant move for Intel, giving it a huge boost in the technology behind self-driving cars. Intel was also a key partner in the launch of Tag Heuer’s new Connected Modular 45 smartwatch, an Android Wear 2.0 device with a diverse ecosystem of modular accessories. Promising more than a day of power, along with water resistance, the new device also comes with a hefty price tag: you’ll need to hand over $1,600 to own one. Google has developed a new system to replace the infuriating CAPTCHA tool, which features on many websites that demand that you prove that you’re “not a robot”. The "invisible reCAPTCHA" system works in the background and uses magic and witchcraft "an advanced risk analysis engine" to determine that real humans are accessing websites. Meanwhile, the latest version of Chrome’s web browser brings massive improvements in power usage for PCs, as well as introducing a new offline reading mode to iOS. Google also updated its Gmail app on Android allowing users to send and request money, just as easily as sharing an attachment. Impressively, the company says that the feature is "completely free" for both senders and recipients. Sony’s new ultra-thin Android TV, the Bravia OLED 4K HDR TV, finally got a launch date and official price tag this week – but you’ll need to be earning some serious dough to be able to afford one. Samsung also announced details of its new QLED TVs this week, featuring ‘Quantum Dot’ technology, with the 55-inch models starting at almost half the price of Sony’s 55-inch OLED TVs. Those who pre-order LG’s impressive new G6 flagship in the United States will get a free Google Home speaker hub worth $129.99 with the device. T-Mobile will be offering the new phone in the US, and announced its pricing this week. Google Home is powered by the Google Assistant – but it hasn’t been a great month for the digital assistant so far. After spewing loony conspiracy theories last week, Google Assistant unexpectedly threw in ads for Disney’s new Beauty and the Beast movie a few days ago. However, Google later insisted that the ads weren’t ads at all, but rather “timely content”. And after announcing wider availability of the Assistant on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat devices last month, Google confirmed this week that it won’t be supported on any Android tablets. Nougat is currently installed on just 2.8% of active Android devices. Google is believed to be planning to release the newest version of the OS, Android 7.1.2, on April 3 – but for now, its long, slow rollout continues to more handsets: T-Mobile is now testing Nougat for the HTC One M9 OnePlus brings Android 7.1.1 to the 3 and 3T Google Nexus 6 owners on Android 7.1.1 get over-the-air ‘downgrade’ to Android 7.0, causing all sorts of issues on their devices Nougat heads to Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and S6 in India Samsung begins Android 7.0 rollout to Galaxy Note5 Earlier this month, Google released its latest monthly Android security updates. Some manufacturers have begun distributing the March patches quickly – but others have not: March security updates now available for Sony’s Xperia X, X Performance, X Compact and XZ AT&T brings February security updates to Samsung Galaxy Note5, Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S5 active Samsung (re)commits to monthly security updates for unlocked Galaxy smartphones in the US HMD says it will deliver monthly Android patches to the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 ZTE finally gets around to bringing January updates to its Blade V8 Pro, which was released in February The need for timely security updates was highlighted again this week with yet more Android malware having been discovered. Disturbingly, security researchers at Check Point found that malware had been pre-installed on 38 devices, including some from major manufacturers such as ZTE, Samsung, Lenovo, Xiaomi and ASUS. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ will be unveiled later this month, but there may not be much left for the company to announce by then. More details on the new flagships emerged this week: Images leak of Samsung Experience launcher ‘Black Pearl’ model revealed Galaxy S8 might have camera capable of capturing 1000 frames per second China expected to get exclusive S8 model with 6GB RAM Time ran out to develop the Galaxy S8’s on-screen fingerprint scanner Pricing of the new Galaxy Tab S3 was also revealed this week in the UK and US – but the new high-end tablet, which has a Snapdragon 820 chip – won’t come cheap. Also in the UK, Sony’s Xperia XZ Premium, which it unveiled at Mobile World Congress last month, has been priced at £649. After increasing the price of its Windows 10 Mobile flagship in the UK by 7% last week, HP is hoping to tempt people to buy the Elite x3 and Desk Dock by offering them up to £500 to trade in their existing handsets. Unfortunately, owners of Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile flagships will only get £125 for their devices. Meanwhile, Microsoft cut the price of the Elite x3 and Desk Dock this week… by 2.4%. Can’t see that making a big difference in boosting sales. Sales of Windows phones have plummeted over the last two years. Industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel wrote off Microsoft’s mobile OS this week, declaring that there’s no hope for a comeback, and that we’re now living in a “two-OS world” as far as the mobile industry goes. Microsoft gave in to that reality a long time ago, bringing more of its software to rival platforms in recent years. It’s made huge improvements to its Arrow Launcher for Android devices over the last few months, adding new support for Android tablets this week. There’s now less than a month until Microsoft ends support for Windows Vista, including security updates. Microsoft has also apparently begun blocking software updates for older versions of Windows running on the newest hardware. Some Windows 7 and 8.1 updates aren’t being offered to PCs running Intel’s latest Kaby Lake (7th-generation) Core processors, along with other new-gen chips, as Microsoft is trying to force encourage users to upgrade to Windows 10. At the same time, Microsoft is now preparing to push through certain Windows 10 updates to devices over metered connections. The company says that it will only do so for “critical fixes” and other “updates required to keep Windows running smoothly”. Microsoft has begun the process of finalizing its Windows 10 Creators Update, ahead of its anticipated release in April. The next step for the company is to select a release candidate which is likely to be distributed to Windows Insiders next week. Microsoft detailed new security improvements in the Creators Update this week, but it also revealed details of features being removed from Windows 10 as part of that update. It’s been a busy week for Windows 10 development, as three new builds rolled out to the Fast ring: 15058, 15060, and on Friday, build 15061. You can find details of the fixes and known issues in build 15061 here. The latest Windows 10 SDK Preview, build 15052, is also available, along with ISOs for build 15058. The latter build is now available on the Windows Insider Slow ring too. Microsoft hasn't yet announced a firm date for the Creators Update's release, so there's plenty of room for speculation! Microsoft released its latest cumulative updates for all versions of Windows 10 on Tuesday, including build 10240.17319 (Version 1507 – the original release of the OS), 10586.839 (Version 1511 – the November Update), and 14393.953 (Version 1607 – the Anniversary Update). However, the latest update for Windows 10 Mobile devices did not include a fix for a rather unpleasant bug that leaves all users’ photos available to view without unlocking a handset. That bug was revealed over a month ago, and yet Microsoft still hasn’t resolved the issue – we checked! Microsoft did fix nine critical security issues in Windows 10 with its latest Patch Tuesday updates though. We don’t yet know exactly when Microsoft plans to announce its second-generation Surface Book, but the device is certainly ripe for replacement. It went on sale almost a year and a half ago, but there are plenty of newer and more capable alternatives available now, including some at lower prices. This week, a report claimed that the new Surface Book 2 will have a more ‘traditional’ laptop form factor, ditching the detachable display of the current model, and thus helping to reduce the cost of the entry-level model by as much as a third, bringing its price down to as little as $1,000. The thing is, that doesn’t make a great deal of sense unless Microsoft plans to differentiate the Surface Book 2 in some other remarkable new way. Surface has always been dedicated to developing new product categories to lead the way for other manufacturers to follow with their own devices. Competing head-on with existing machines by launching a ‘conventional’ notebook would go against the Surface ethos, and would likely do little to help sales of similar laptops from Microsoft’s hardware partners. Over in the UK, Microsoft is continuing to soften the blow of its recent – and massive – price increases on the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 by extending its offer of free insurance and Office 365, along with new discounts on both devices. The total savings amount to as much as £600. Microsoft has been working with researchers in the UK on a remarkable project, helping visually impaired children to learn coding by using physical, tangible objects. And after several months in preview, Microsoft officially launched its Slack competitor, Teams, in 19 languages and 181 countries across the globe. Microsoft brought its OneDrive app, developed on the Universal Windows Platform, to the Xbox One this week. It also released Xbox Insider Preview build 15058 to the Alpha ring on Friday, bring a new feature along with a single fix, and a long list of known issues. It followed the release of build 15055 to the Alpha ring earlier in the week. Microsoft also revealed that its Alpha Preview of the new Xbox Game Pass will end on April 7. Game Pass is a monthly $10 subscription that will give gamers access to over 100 games, and will launch this Spring. For the first time in two weeks, Microsoft added four more titles to the list of Xbox 360 games that are backward compatible with the Xbox One. It also introduced a new in-game chat transcription feature for the Xbox One and Windows 10, with speech-to-text and text-to-speech support. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission announced a recall of Energizer’s Xbox One 2X Smart Charger, following reports of potentially dangerous overheating on some units. And after releasing its 4.50 system software update for the PlayStation 4 family last week, some owners of Sony’s consoles have reported issues being able to connect to wireless networks. In happier news, Sony announced that it’s expanding its PlayStation Now service to include PS4 games, allowing PC gamers to enjoy those titles on their Windows machines. Nintendo brought a range of indie titles to its new Switch console, which launched earlier this month. But it also emerged that the Switch is vulnerable to a WebKit exploit, demonstrated through a proof-of-concept earlier this week.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 March 2017 by Military News Why Intel Is Paying $15.3 Billion to Acquire Mobileye By now, you’ve probably heard that chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) made waves in the tech space earlier this week by announcing a deal to acquire Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) . The dea l is noteworthy for a number of reasons, least of which is the dollar value involved. Intel is paying $15.3 billion for a relatively small company in what amounts to a shot across the bow of NVIDIA, the current leader in driverless car chips. However, this deal carries deeper implications for the semiconductor industry, so let’s look at why Intel is buying Mobileye and what it means for the parties directly and indirectly involved. Intel and Mobileye: A winning pair? Superficially, the deal seems like a match made in heaven. Intel’s long-standing growth issues in its PC and data center segments are well-known. Moreover, its failure to capitalize on the once-in-a-generation growth opportunity presented by the rise of smartphones and tablets likely left the company anxious not to miss the boat the next time around. The autonomous vehicle market looks like a similarly major opportunity for the company. In that vein, adding Mobileye suits Intel’s aims. Mobileye already enjoys partnerships with 25 automakers to install its Advanced Driver Assist System (ADAS) into their vehicles. It also has experience working with Intel, and reports indicate that the cultural similarities of the two companies were an important factor that helped facilitate the deal. Intel and Mobileye are currently working with BMW to help the automaker develop fully autonomous vehicles and bring them into wide-scale production by 2021 at the latest. However, the deal also involves at least one meaningful downside that investors need to understand. Image source: Intel Intel is paying handsomely As is the case with so many things, there was some give-and-take at work in Intel’s Mobileye buyout. Of its possible flaws, by far the most glaring is the valuation Intel put on the target. Though the long-term results could eventually validate it Intel paid a steep price to get this deal done. Mobileye generated GAAP net income of just $108.3 million on sales of $358.1 million in 2016.  At the agreed-upon price, this means Intel valued Mobileye at either 42 times sales or 141 times earnings. For those scoring at home, the S&P 500 currently trades at about 26 times earnings,  which itself is well above its historic average. Time will tell whether this deal works out for Intel shareholders, but Intel hasn’t enjoyed a lot of success with large-scale acquisitions in the past.  Its particularly garish $7.6 billion  buyout of security firm McAfee in 2011 has done little to lift the chipmaker’s financial fortunes; the jury remains out on its 2015 buyout of Altera for $16.7 billion. Plenty of potential still Perhaps the best way to sum up this move is that it’s a gutsy, all-in bet on the future of self-driving cars and Intel’s place as a major component supplier to the market. In that vein, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that autonomous vehicles will represent a potential $70 billion addressable market by the year 2030.  Beyond that, Intel believes that supporting self-driving cars will require a large amount of additional data center, network security, and cloud computing hardware — and it sees a $30 billion economic opportunity for the company in supplying chips to power those systems. If all of this comes to pass as predicted, Intel will eventually recoup far more than the $15.3 billion it is spending. So though it comes at a hefty premium, Intel’s aggressive purchase of Mobileye is the kind of potentially transformative bet this low-growth tech giant needs to make if it intends to remain relevant over the next 20-plus years.

By: AP | Published:March 18, 2017 11:26 am Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. ( Source: Mobileye) As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” Also Read: Intel to buy Mobileye for about $15 Billion in car tech push She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. Founders of Mobileye present at the Prime Minister’s office at Jerusalem. (Source: AP) He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said. Israel has long billed itself as “Startup Nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Also Read: Uber self-driving cars are coming back to California roads Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and othe sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. (Image for representation, Source: AP) “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Also Read: California says autonomous cars don’t need human drivers Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. “This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak,” he said.

Now, there's a little smoke and fire in some corners of the internet, though, since a Microsoft Knowledge Base page has popped up about a potential error message that users with systems based on the forementioned CPUs might encounter when running Windows Update. More to the point, you might be told that "your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows," and that you'll need to upgrade to Windows 10. Despite this bit of news making the rounds around the web, and the fact that there's a running Reddit thread with close to 600 comments on the subject, there have yet to be reports of systems in the wild where this error message popped up. The support page doesn't appear to be a fluke, though, since searching the Knowledge Base for article 4012982 yields results in multiple languages. The company stated back as early as August 2016 that Windows 10 is the only supported version for new-generation systems, and its FAQ says as much: As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support. This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon, while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon. For example, Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform on Intel's upcoming "Kaby Lake" silicon, Qualcomm’s upcoming "8996" silicon, and AMD's upcoming "Bristol Ridge" silicon. Rather predictably, some commenters are up in arms about this event, assuming it ever pops up in production systems. However, as recently as January, Youtuber JayzTwoCents installed Windows 8.1 on a Kaby Lake Core i5 system without fuss. Veering a little into an editorial piece, there are a few things to consider. The whole situation begets the question of what are the expectations of users trying to run what's effectively a legacy OS on their new boxes, since they already knew what the support policy is. Ma and Pa may not, but it's not likely they're installing a fresh operating system on their computers anyway. There's also the matter of install media to consider. While there's a Media Creation Toolkit for Windows 10, most people trying to install Windows 7 or 8.1 will use a DVD or USB stick that (as far as we know) doesn't appear to have a CPU generation check, and possibly never will. That means that in order to not let people use an unsupported OS, it makes at least some sense that the check be done in Windows Update. Technically-minded users might point out that they're fine with running an "unsupported" operating system at their own risk, but the average user is likely not even aware of Microsoft's policy regarding Windows 7 and 8.1. In turn, he may encounter problems that he doesn't know the origin of, much less how to fix them. Flipping the subject on its head, it could be argued that at least Windows 8.1 could be supported on those CPUs, since its support ends in 2023, while Windows 7's EOL is reasonably close in 2020. At this point, it's difficult to tell if Microsoft's policy and execution on the matter creates a real problem. Tags: Windows Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

It also has experience working with Intel, and reports indicate that the cultural similarities of the two companies were an important factor that helped facilitate the deal. Intel and Mobileye are currently working with BMW to help the automaker develop fully autonomous vehicles and bring them into wide-scale production by 2021 at the latest. However, the deal also involves at least one meaningful downside that investors need to understand. Image source: Intel   Intel is paying handsomely As is the case with so many things, there was some give-and-take at work in Intel's Mobileye buyout. Of its possible flaws, by far the most glaring is the valuation Intel put on the target. Though the long-term results could eventually validate it Intel paid a steep price to get this deal done. Mobileye generated GAAP net income of just $108.3 million on sales of $358.1 million in 2016.  At the agreed-upon price, this means Intel valued Mobileye at either 42 times sales or 141 times earnings. For those scoring at home, the S&P 500 currently trades at about 26 times earnings,  which itself is well above its historic average. Time will tell whether this deal works out for Intel shareholders, but Intel hasn't enjoyed a lot of success with large-scale acquisitions in the past.  Its particularly garish $7.6 billion  buyout of security firm McAfee in 2011 has done little to lift the chipmaker's financial fortunes; the jury remains out on its 2015 buyout of Altera for $16.7 billion. Plenty of potential still Perhaps the best way to sum up this move is that it's a gutsy, all-in bet on the future of self-driving cars and Intel's place as a major component supplier to the market. In that vein, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that autonomous vehicles will represent a potential $70 billion addressable market by the year 2030.  Beyond that, Intel believes that supporting self-driving cars will require a large amount of additional data center, network security, and cloud computing hardware -- and it sees a $30 billion economic opportunity for the company in supplying chips to power those systems.  If all of this comes to pass as predicted, Intel will eventually recoup far more than the $15.3 billion it is spending. So though it comes at a hefty premium, Intel's aggressive purchase of Mobileye is the kind of potentially transformative bet this low-growth tech giant needs to make if it intends to remain relevant over the next 20-plus years.

That was the title of the presentation Intel CEO Brian Krzanich delivered at the Los Angeles Auto Show in December, and it's probably the most important thing you need to know about this week's big news from America's premier chipmaker: the acquisition of Mobileye, a leader in autonomous driving, for a cool $15.3 billion.   For anyone who hasn't been paying attention, the future of autonomous cars promises to be lucrative. As Krzanich himself said in the email he sent to Intel employees about the deal, autonomous driving is estimated to be a $70 billion "vehicle systems and data services" market by 2030. And the horsepower under the hood, as he noted, is computing. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car." Krzanich touted. The partnership will allow Intel "to accelerate innovation for car-makers" and deliver the "technology foundation for highly and fully autonomous driving." The deal also reinforces Intel's new narrative -- namely that the chipmaker (which notoriously missed out on the mobile revolution) is more than a PC processing company. "We are a DATA company," as Krzanich emphatically put it in his email: "Our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across every technology and every industry." James McQuivey, principal analyst at Forrester Research who tracks the development of digital disruption, doesn't disagree. "Intel would be foolish not to try to join this melee," McQuivey said in an email. Indeed, the market is rich with possibilities for data service providers. "Expect the company to pull an IBM and become an autonomous vehicle consulting bureau and service provider, spinning up cloud-based resources that will ingest and analyze data from the vehicles, then spitting out not just better driving recommendations or even in-car services, but data infrastructure services that help municipalities track road use, store owners measure passing traffic, and bicyclists plan long-distance rides," McQuivey said. Fast track into the future of autonomous cars But is it a good deal? According to analysts, the Mobileye acquisition promises to make Intel a player in the future of autonomous cars. They point out that the Israeli company comes with a resume that boasts partnerships with major automakers and original equipment manufacturers; Mobileye's chips and algorithms previously powered Tesla's autopilot system. The company has a dominant market share in the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) technology space, which means that Intel now owns a leading player in adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency breaking and lane keeping. And Mobileye also has a 30% profit margin. "Intel paid a very high cost for this company and what it did was it saved Intel time," Mike Ramsey, analyst at Gartner's CIO research group, said. Beyond ADAS, Mobileye technology has rapidly evolved to support "the three pillars of autonomous driving -- sensing, mapping, and driving policy." "Not only did Intel buy the technology, but all the existing relationships with all of the major automakers and it gave them a jump of five years -- and in this business five years is an eternity," he said. Autonomous car future fueled by data David Keith, assistant professor of system dynamics at MIT, agreed that as automobiles increasingly look like computers on wheels, the demand for computing power and data analysis in vehicles is reaching new heights -- and that data is the new oil in the ecosystem. Driver assistance systems work by using machine learning to identify the environment they're in, Keith explained. In order to learn the environment, a huge amount of data is required -- indeed, millions of miles of vehicle travel data -- to train the systems to identify the environment and also make good decisions about how the vehicle should respond to its environment. "Mobileye is clearly the leader in this aspect of the business as they have huge amounts of data that they have refined and have features that are very reliable," Keith said. But the data management issues related to autonomous driving are far from solved. On a basic level, IT experts in the field have to think about where (and whether) all the data generated from vehicles gets stored, said Gartner's Ramsey. "[IT experts] are going to have to think about whether the data should be analyzed on the vehicle first and then uploaded to the cloud, and how to generate value from it," he said. Bob O'Donnell, president, founder and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, agreed that autonomous vehicles are pushing IT on many fronts. CIOs and other IT experts in this industry will have to think about distributed computing architectures and their implications, and about what sort of computing capabilities their companies have on the edge. "Autonomous cars serve as a poster child example of the kinds of multi-tiered analytics and the need for very strong edge based computing because that's where you should have the ability to react to real-time data coming in." O'Donnell said. And CIOs watching this from outside of the industry will want to be ready for what happens when all of that vehicle-based data becomes available to their industries, McQuivey said. "If you don't know how to follow website traffic and understand what it means, how will you be able to follow actual on-site traffic in a meaningful way?" The (un)reality of full autonomy While the technical capability of autonomous vehicles is moving pretty quickly, the commercialization prospects of the technology are more uncertain, Ramsey believes. "We are certainly sneaking up on Level 4 autonomy," he said. "But the real question is: When do we get to full automation?" Bryan Reimer, research scientist at MIT AgeLab and associate director at New England University Transportation Center, believes that true Level 5 automated vehicles may be theoretically impossible. "As SAE [Society of Automotive Engineers] defines a Level 5 autonomous vehicle, a fully self-driving vehicle needs to be able to take us from Point A to Point B under all use conditions; 'ALL' is a big word," Reimer said. But Reimer sees deployment of Level 2 and Level 3 technologies "growing even further over time." Level 4 deployments in very select ecosystems, perhaps in a city in good or reasonable weather, is something that is theoretically feasible in the next 10 years, he added. But don't expect dealer showrooms to look much different in the coming years. The smart vehicles that will continue to evolve and dominate the market place globally will look much like those today only with increasing levels of automated technologies available, Reimer said. "So while the automotive ecosystem will change over the coming decades, it's not going to forget its past instantly. It's not going to be a revolutionary change … we are going to go through an evolution." Whether Intel has an inside track to that future remains to be seen. CIO news roundup for week of March 13 While Intel buying Mobileye drew discussions about the future of autonomous cars this week, here's what else made news: Russian officials charged in Yahoo hack. The U.S. Justice Department has charged two Russian intelligence officers with facilitating the breach of 500 million Yahoo accounts in 2014. Two hackers were also charged in the 47-count indictment that includes charges of conspiracy, computer fraud and abuse, economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, access device fraud and aggravated identify theft. The Russian government used the information obtained in the breach to spy on targets that included White House officials, business executives and an airline, according to the indictment. Details of the breach were not announced until 2016, and threatened a multi-billion dollar deal to sell Yahoo's core business to Verizon. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer took a share of the heat after the breach was made public. Earlier this week Yahoo named board member Thomas McInerney as Mayer's replacement once the Verizon deal is finalized. This announcement generated additional controversy for Yahoo because McInerney’s compensation includes a higher base salary with annual cash and stock bonus that total at least double the amount Mayer received. It remains unclear what Mayer's role will be with Verizon or with Yahoo's remaining assets -- to be renamed Altaba -- after the sale, slated to close in the second quarter of this year. Tech companies unite against travel ban. A group of 58 companies, including Airbnb, Lyft and Dropbox, joined together to protest the revised travel ban on majority-Muslim countries that the Trump administration released earlier this month. The companies submitted an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit filed by the state of Hawaii requesting a temporary restraining order on the executive action. In the brief, the group stated that the ban would "inflict significant and irreparable harm on U.S. businesses and their employees." The revised travel ban was put on hold Wednesday after a federal judge ruled in favor of the state of Hawaii's request for the temporary restraining order. In February, technology companies filed a similar amicus brief to protest President Trump's original executive order on immigration. More IT pros receive security training. As cyberattacks and data breaches continue to make headlines, a new study from Pearson VUE finds that enterprises are investing more in cybersecurity training. Among 6,605 U.S.-based IT professionals surveyed in the last year, there was 48% increase in those taking security training and a 60% increase in those taking security exams compared to prior year, the study found. Employers funded the security training for 53% of respondents, while 26% of respondents said they paid for it themselves. Enterprises are scrambling to find qualified cybersecurity personnel to face additional cyber threats: In a recent survey conducted by ISACA, 55% of organizations reported that open cybersecurity positions take at least three months to fill, 32% said they take six months or more, and 27% said they are unable to fill cybersecurity positions.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque    Intel Committee Chair: ‘No Evidence’ Of Collusion Between Trump Campaign And Russians Alex Pfeiffer Reporter 6:51 PM 03/19/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5540850 House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes said Sunday that there is “no evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the presidential campaign. Nunes’ committee is investigating alleged Russian interference in the presidential election, as well as leaks from the intelligence community. The California Republican told Fox News’ Chris Wallace that the only crime there is evidence for is the leaking of the names of Americans who were caught up in surveillance, such as former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Nunes maintained that he has yet to see evidence of collusion between “Trump world” and the Russian government. His committee is holding its first hearing on the matter on Monday. The House Intelligence Committee chairman seemed to tell Wallace that there is an investigation or surveillance currently being conducted on a member of the White House. “If you look at the folks who are working at the White House today that are involved in the Trump administration, I don’t think there is any but one there that is under any type of investigation or surveillance activities at all,” Nunes said.  A spokesman for Nunes told TheDC the congressman didn’t mean to say this. “It’s a bit garbled in the video but he didn’t mean to say there is one person under surveillance, he’s saying there is no one under surveillance, which is why he says ‘at all’ at the end of the sentence,” the spokesman said.   Tags: Devin Nunes, Donald Trump Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

Scott Applewhite, File) By MICHELE SALCEDO / The Associated Press Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF WASHINGTON – The top two lawmakers on the House intelligence committee said Sunday that documents the Justice Department and FBI delivered late last week offered no evidence that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower, but the panel’s ranking Democrat says the material offers circumstantial evidence that American citizens colluded with Russians in Moscow’s efforts to interfere in the presidential election. “There was circumstantial evidence of collusion; there is direct evidence, I think, of deception,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said. “There’s certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation.” The House intelligence committee is to begin hearings Monday into Russia’s role in cybersecurity breaches at the Democratic National Committee, as well as President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor had authorized a wiretap of Trump Tower. FBI Director James Comey and Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, are slated to testify. Intelligence officials have said that Russia was behind the theft of Democratic National Committee emails last summer. The U.S. government later concluded that the Russian government directed the DNC hack in an attempt to influence the outcome of November’s presidential election. “For the first time the American people, and all the political parties now, are paying attention to the threat that Russia poses,” committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said. “We know that the Russians were trying to get involved in our campaign, like they have for many decades. They’re also trying to get involved in campaigns around the globe and over in Europe.” Nunes said the committee will also examine whether the Russians were trying to sow doubt in the U.S. electoral system or whether they were trying to help Trump get elected to the White House. “We need to get to the bottom of that,” Nunes said. Nunes and Schiff were among a number of lawmakers who said on Sunday’s news shows they had seen no evidence that the Obama administration ordered wiretaps on Trump during the campaign. “Was there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No there never was,” Nunes said. “The information we received Friday continues to lead us in that direction.” Nunes added: “There was no FISA warrant I am aware of to tap Trump Tower.” FISA stands for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which requires investigators to seek a warrant from a secret court to wiretap a foreign suspect. Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Susan Collins of Maine also said Sunday they had seen no evidence that the Obama administration had placed Trump under surveillance at Trump Tower, the Manhattan high-rise that houses Trump’s residence, business office and campaign office. Collins encouraged Trump to turn whatever evidence he has of the surveillance over to the congressional intelligence panels looking into the matter. The president repeatedly insisted last week that former President Barack Obama had Trump Tower put under surveillance late last fall. Trump’s claims widened to two of the U.S.’s staunchest allies. He repeated an unsubstantiated claim that Britain’s cyber intelligence organization conducted the surveillance at Obama’s behest, a claim the agency GBHQ flatly denied; and mentioned during German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first visit to the Trump White House the Obama administration’s monitoring of Merkel’s cellphone, a bruising incident in German-U.S. relations. “What the president said was just patently false,” Schiff said of the Trump Tower allegations, “and the wrecking ball it created has now banged into our British allies and our German allies and continuing to grow in terms of damage. And he needs to put an end to this.” Nunes spoke on “Fox News Sunday;” Schiff and Collins appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press;” Cotton was on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Police shoot man in Huntington Beach, sending him to hospital; officer also injured Retail-restaurant roundup: GardenWalk gets more tenants; South Coast Plaza adds 4 new sto Highlights from Day 3 of Musink Tattoo Convention & Music Festival Is Albertsons considering a merger with organic grocer Sprouts?

A frappuccino is a frappuccino because it sounds tasty, right? Actually, it's a frozen cappuccino. WiFi may just seem like a funky word for the life-sustaining force that makes internet browsing possible, but it's actually short for "Wireless Fidelity."  What about Bluetooth? What is the so-obvious-it's-funny explanation for the technology that made you think strangers on the bus were talking to you when in reality they were just on the phone? As it turns out, Bluetooth is named after a 10th-century Scandinavian king. Harald "Blåtand" Gormsson was a viking king who ruled Denmark and Norway from the year 958 until 985. There are many accomplishments credited to him, but greatest of all is that he united Denmark and Norway under his rule. Gormsson was also known for his dead tooth, which had a very dark blue/grey shade. It was so prominent that his nickname was Blåtand, which literally translates from Danish to "Bluetooth."  But what could this possibly have to do a wireless technology that lets you use a hands-free headset while you drive?  Fast-forward a little over 1,000 years to 1996, and short-range radio technology was in its very early stages — Intel had a program called Biz-RF, the Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson had MC-Link, and Nokia had Low Power RF. The three powerhouses quickly recognized that the best way to drive the technology forward within the industry and avoid fragmentation would be to create a single wireless standard.  © Provided by Business Insider Inc King Bluetooth In December of that year, representatives from each group met at the Ericsson plant in Lund, Sweden to plan their industry-standard technology. Before they could get started, however, they decided that they needed a codename for the project while it was in development. Intel representative Jim Kardash suggested that the temporary name be "Bluetooth," and his reasoning was simple.  "King Harald Bluetooth ... was famous for uniting Scandinavia just as we intended to unite the PC and cellular industries with a short-range wireless link," he wrote in a blog post.  Later on, when the technology was nearly finalized and it was time to choose a permanent name, Kardash explained that Bluetooth wasn't even in the running. The two top contenders were RadioWire (the Intel proposal) and PAN (for Personal Area Networking, the IBM proposal). In April we held our board meeting and voted for the official name which went to PAN in a 4-1 vote. At this point everybody started using the name PAN and we were driving towards the launch event which would occur in about four weeks. About a week later, an emergency meeting was called. The other member companies had performed a trademark search on the word PAN and surmised that this would be a poor candidate for a trademark: an internet search produced tens of thousands of hits. It turned out that no trademark search was done on the backup name (Radio Wire) and the only name we could go to launch with on short notice was Bluetooth! © Provided by Business Insider Inc Bluetooth rune Somehow, the Bluetooth origin story doesn't end there. Once the technology had an official name, it also needed a logo.  "But isn't the Bluetooth logo just a 'B' written in a tacky '90s font?" I imagine you're asking right now. No, it's not.  That "B" logo is actually ol' King Blåtand's initials written in ancient Danish runes. So, there you have it. Bluetooth is called Bluetooth because its developers were big history nerds and they couldn't come up with a better idea.  Who knew?

Sure, you’ll find deals from Apple occasionally, but there’s not much movement on product prices. Consumers often turn to eBay, Craiglist, and other alternative routes to find deals on Apple products, but these purchases can be unpredictable. Instead or trying your luck, it may be better to stick with authorized retailers such as Best Buy, which currently has 12 standout deals on top Apple products. More: MacBook Pro 13-Inch With Touch Bar Review First up is the latest edition of the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air, which is currently discounted by $200.

You can also go wireless by using the built-in Bluetooth, connecting speakers, headphones, and more. Other features include an LED-backlit 1440×900 pixel display that’s a mere 0.19-inches thick,  720p FaceTime HD camera, a spacious Multi-Touch trackpad, and a backlit keyboard with built-in ambient light sensor that detects changes in lighting conditions and adjusts the display and keyboard brightness automatically. The Apple MacBook Air normally retails for $1,000, but is currently discountedto $800 on Best Buy, providing a $200 (20 percent) discount for a limited time only. Best Buy is also currently offering 11 different Apple iPad Pro deals, with $100 slashed off the regular retail price of each product. These next-generation iPads pack impressive computing power that leaps past most portable PCs. A 64-bit A9X chip and M9 processor allow you to use the iPad Pro for tasks once reserved for workstations and PCs. The latest iPad Pros are available in two sizes, a 12.9-inch model or the new 9.7-inch model. Each model offers various storage and color options to match your individual style and needs. The 9.7-inch model has a 2048 x 1536 pixel multitouch display, while the 12.9 model offers the highest resolution of any iOS device with a 2732 x 2048 screen resolution.

Schiff says the House Intelligence investigation into Russian election hacking has seen “direct evidence” of deception. #MTP pic.twitter.com/m80zSEZEyb — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) March 19, 2017 As highlighted by ShareBlue’s Tommy Christopher, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press today and told host Chuck Todd that there was a lot of information when it comes to cooperation between the Russian government and Trump campaign. With FBI Director James Comey scheduled to speak at a Congressional hearing on Russian election interference tomorrow, Schiff — the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee — was asked about former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper saying there’s no evidence of collusion and if there will be “fire to go with all of this smoke.” Schiff said he was surprised by Clapper’s comments, and then mentioned that there may be some fire. “There is circumstantial evidence of collusion,” the California lawmaker stated. “There is direct evidence, I think, of deception, and that’s where we begin the investigation.” He continued, “Now I don’t want to prejudge where we ultimately end up, and of course, there’s one thing to say there’s evidence, there’s another thing to say we can prove this, or prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, or there’s enough evidence to bring to a grand jury for purposes of criminal indictment. But there is certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation.” Todd also brought up how the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested that former Trump advisor Roger Stone preserve all Russian-related communication and documentation and wanted to know if the House Intel Committee had done the same. Schiff explained that they asked the U.S. government but hadn’t sent letters to individuals yet. Watch the clip above, via NBC News.

If cramming 3840x2160 pixels and Nvidia's variable refresh rate technology into a 27" panel isn't impressive enough for you, perhaps the pixel density in the 17" 4K G-Sync display in EVGA's SC17 1070 gaming laptop will be satisfactory. The mobile gaming station packs an Intel sixth-generation Core i7-6820HK CPU, a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070, and 32 GB of system memory to go with that UHD panel. Laptops in the 17" class are never compact, but the SC17 justifies its size by bringing a lot of hardware along for the ride. The system boots from a 256GB M.2 NVMe SSD, but also carries a 2.5" HDD for 1TB of additional storage. The keyboard is a full-sized affair with a number pad and white LED backlighting. If the built-in 4K display isn't enough, the machine has an HDMI 2.0 jack and a pair of mini DisplayPort connectors. The Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11ac Wi-Fi controllers are both Intel units. The laptop packs a pair of USB 3.0 ports and a USB 3.1 Type-C port. EVGA is quite proud of the tweaking features built into the SC17 1070, claiming that the machine has a "full BIOS" implementation with overclocking capabilities. When those overclocking experiments go awry, a hardware CMOS clear button should make it easy for the user to put things back to factory settings. The manufacturer says the SC17 1070 is bloatware-free, a claim that saddens me that it has to be mentioned at all. The EVGA SC17 1070 is available now in the company's online store for $2550. For the time being, that price also includes an EVGA Torq X10 gaming mouse and a backpack that hopefully can swallow up the machine's 16.1" x 11.6" x 1.1" (41 cm x 30 cm x 2.7 cm) dimensions and 9 lb (4.1 kg) bulk.

By Chris Duckett | March 19, 2017 -- 16:00 GMT (09:00 PDT) | Topic: Hardware (Image: Intel) Intel has taken the wraps off its first Optane 3D XPoint storage product, the SSD DC P4800X, which the company claims can make database transactions up to 10 times faster. Optane will first be available from today to select early customers as a 375GB add-in card, and during the second half of the year will also be available in 750GB, 1.5TB sized cards, and as U.2 drives. Your social data is doomed, and don't count on Facebook to save you Your status updates, your uploaded photos, your videos, all of it is going to be inaccessible sometime in the future. Not just by you, but by your descendants as well. Read More Beyond its speed as a standard SSD replacement -- which the chip giant said is between 8 to 40 times more responsive under load compared to a SSD DC P3700 -- Intel is touting its usage as a memory extender. Coupled with Memory Drive found on Xeon chips, an Optane SSD is able to be used in a memory pool along with DRAM without needing to adjust the OS or any applications. For select workloads, the company said it believes as much as 90 percent of DRAM can be replaced with Optane SSDs. In an example the company showed off, it took a dual-Xeon server with 678GB of RAM that was handling a 675GB MySQL database, and replaced all but 128GB of RAM with a pair of Optane 375GB drives, and only saw a 20 percent drop off in database performance. With the larger capacity of Optane drives over memory modules, a dual-socket Xeon system could have 24TB of memory, and a quad-socket system would top out at 48TB of memory. Intel said it sees Optane as being particularly useful for analytics, machine learning, and in-memory databases. In the future, Intel said it would produce memory modules based on 3D XPoint technology. At the end of 2016, Lenovo said it would be the first to ship Optane in its ThinkPad laptop lineup -- but the Optane drives will only be 16GB in size, and will be used in tandem with more traditional drives. In early January, Intel said it would begin labelling motherboards with an M.2 slot using its 200 series chip as "Optane Memory Ready". For the 2016 fiscal year, Intel posted operating income of $16.5 billion on revenue of $59.5 billion. Revenue for the non-volatile memory solution group came in at $2.6 billion, down 1 percent from 2015.

The German empire and territories would soon give birth to an overwhelming portion of future Nobel Laureates and many of the greatest minds of the 20th century including Max Born, Hans Bethe, Alexander Grothendieck, Bernard Katz, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Walter Kohn, Hans Adolf Krebs, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, and Albert Einstein. All of these people would be forced to flee the German empire. Where did they go? Well… The United States is universally renowned for its universities and industry giants today like Apple, Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox and Uber; as well as Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM all the way to Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, United States Steel, Ford, and General Electric. Albert Einstein, fleeing Germany, would find refuge at Princeton and change the world forever in many ways. On the eve of World War II, he penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which would establish the Manhattan Project. There, future Nobel Laureates Hans Bethe and Enrico Fermi, refugees from Italy, ran the labs that invented the atomic bomb to end WW2 for the United States. Picture shows a German 55 euro cents special edition stamp commemorating the the 100th anniversary of the publication of late German-born physicist Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity in Berlin June 15, 2005. Reuters Nobel Laureates With Immigrant Roots Abdul Fattah Jandali is a political migrant from Homs, a city now destroyed by the Syrian civil war. Jandali started university at the American University of Beirut, but protests ultimately forced him to flee Lebanon. He finished his degree at Colombia University in the U.S. and continued with an economics PhD at Wisconsin University. There he met and dated Joanne Carol Schieble, a German-Swiss Catholic. She became pregnant, and they placed their child for adoption in San Francisco. The couple that adopted their baby named him Steve Jobs. In the late 1960s, Michael and Eugenia Brin left the USSR to escape anti-Semitism with their son. Michael Brin became a professor at the University of Maryland, and Eugenia Brin became a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Their son, Sergey Brin, received a NSF fellowship that took him to Stanford University. He met Larry Page; the duo became fast friends and transformed information technology. Google was born with an investment of $100,000 by Stanford alum and Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim, a German immigrant. Steve Chen, born in Taiwan, founded YouTube. Jan Koum from Ukraine founded WhatsApp. Brazilian Mike Krieger founded Instagram. Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox founder, is an Iranian-American. Travis Kalanick, Uber founder, was born to Polish and Russian Jewish immigrants. Andrew Grove, born in Hungary, founded Intel. Jerry Yang from Taiwan founded Yahoo, Herman Hollerith from Germany founded IBM and Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart from Germany founded Pfizer. AT&T? Alexander Graham Bell from Scotland; P&G? William Procter from England and James Gamble from Ireland; Goldman Sachs? Marcus Goldman from Germany. Pierre Omidyar, France, founded eBay. Scottish American Andrew Carnegie founded US Steel as well as Carnegie Mellon University. Irishman William Ford and Mary Ford, daughter to Belgian immigrants, raised Henry Ford who in turn founded the Industrial Revolution, automobiles, and the Ford Motor Company. General Electric's Thomas Edison was born to a Canadian father. Walt Disney, Amazon, Boeing, Citigroup, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, Walgreen, State Farm Insurance, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, McDonalds — the list goes on and on and on. Fortune 500 Companies With Immigrant Roots These companies employ more than 19 million people globally with combined revenues of $4.8 trillion (2014) for the United States. This figure exceeds the GDP of every country in the world except the U.S., China, and Japan. Immigrants are twice as likely to start a new business than non-immigrants. Seven of the 10 most valuable brands in the world come from American companies founded by immigrants or children of immigrants. A Luo boy was born on the shores of Lake Victoria outside Kendu Bay, British Kenya in 1936. As he grew up, he traveled widely — visiting Europe, India and Zanzibar — and became a cook for missionaries and a local herbalist in Nairobi.

Reuters South African Elon Musk builds on the Martian dream with his work at SpaceX. In his biography, answering why he choose to move to the U.S., Musk says, "The United States is definitely ahead in culture of innovation. If someone wants to accomplish great things, there is no better place than the U.S.” This is absolutely correct. But let us imagine a slightly different world. A world where Maryam Mirzakhani and Pardis Sabeti are Canadian Professors; where Apple and Google are Canadian companies; where Carnegie Mellon University and the Industrial Revolution were founded in Canada; and so were YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber, Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, Boeing, Citigroup, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, Walgreen, State Farm Insurance, Lockheed Martin, Walt Disney, Oracle, Amazon, McDonalds, and innumerable other companies. Imagine Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, and Vinod Khosla running Canadian internet giants. For our entire history, our country has been defined by welcoming when other nations oppressed. The most American thing is unconditional love — love that ended wars; love that helped build everything from YouTube and Instagram to McDonalds and Disney; love that uncovered new laws of physics, advanced the frontiers of space, and saved countless millions of lives on earth. The most American thing ever is exclaiming boldly and unyieldingly, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free; the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me.” Those were the greatest minds of the last century who came and helped transform America into the global center of innovation from technology and politics to sciences and the arts.

That he was the victim of an illegal wiretap ordered by president Obama. 15 days later, we know two things. The president's charge is untrue. And he knows it's not true. At least he should. The attorney general has not dpich him evidence to back up the claim. Nor has the FBI direct, the CIA direct eer, or the director of national intelligence. He asked the senate intelligence committees to investigate. Here's what the top members of the house said this week. I don't think there was an actual tap of trump tow zplerp we have seen no basis for that whatsoever. We see no indications that trump tower wz you the subject of Su valance by any element of the United States government either before or after election day 2016. No evidence the charge is true. Overwhelming evidence it's false. Which may be why only trump's truer believers are standing by the claim. And one of his top allies in congress now says the president should apologize. To the Obama is owed an apology in that regard. Because if he didn't do it, we shouldn't be reckless in accusations that he did. Instead, at that awkward press conference with German chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, trump doubled down. Joking about the fact that Merkel had been spied on by our NSA. As far as wire-tapping by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps. That look on Merkel's face shows how well the joke landed. Trump refused to disavow his press secretary's embrace that trump was spid on by British intelligence. Is the. That was a statement made by talented lawyer on fox. You shouldn't be talking to me. You should be talking to fox, okay? Fox News quickly disavowed the report. The British called it utterly ridiculous. Demanded an explanation from the national security adviser who promised it would not be repeated. Two of America's closest allies upset. The president's agenda overshadows. The credibility of his spokes people? Tatters. Tomorrow, a public showdown. The FBI director, before congress, likely to defy the president and publicly testify that the president's claim is not true. How trump responds is anyone's guess. We asked the white house for a guest to ard this topic. They declined. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

BLOG: Six Ways to Secure Big Networks NEWS & ANALYSIS: SIA Backs House Republicans' Tax Plan News & Analysis Intel Boots Drives with 3D XPoint Optane prices debut at 3x NAND SSDs Rick Merritt 3/19/2017 12:01 PM EDT 11 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet FOLSOM, Calif. — Intel Corp. announced its first solid-state drives using its 3D XPoint memory chips. The Optane SSDs are expected to establish a small, but significant, beachhead for the technology, which is one of several alternatives pioneering a new market between flash and DRAM chips. The DC P4800X is a server drive riding the NVMe interface, initially available in a 375-GByte version that lists for a retail price of $1,520, about three times the cost of a similar NAND card. It delivers less than 20-microsecond read-and-write latencies and a 30-disk-writes/day endurance with an estimated three-year lifetime. Intel will ship before the end of the year 750-GByte and 1.5-TByte versions with an estimated five-year lifetime. All will be available in 2.5-inch U.2 and add-in card form factors. The SSD’s performance varies widely from 2.5 to 77x better than NAND drives, depending on workloads. The drives generally beat NAND SSDs easily on read performance but are a closer match on writes that vary depending on use of buffers. Initial targets are broad but include metadata key-value searches, transaction processing, logging/journaling, and in-memory databases. Intel will sell software to spoof applications and operating systems into treating the SSDs as main memory, replacing or augmenting DRAM. Intel’s Optane controller chip supports seven channels, and performance is best with an even die-to-channel loading, a spokesman said. The initial 375 GByte drive uses four media die per channel, or 28 die total. Some Optane drive capacity outside user space is dedicated to ECC, firmware, and metadata to ensure similar reliability as NAND SSDs. However, Optane drives do not support overcapacity used in NAND SSDs because 3D XPoint is a write-in-place media not subject to NAND’s fragmentation, the spokesman added. Intel declined to forecast sales of the new drives. However, it currently hopes to fill its joint-venture fab with Micron in Lehi, Utah, by the end of the year with 3D XPoint chips for the Optane and Micron Quantx SSDs that use it. The fab is currently running less than 10,000 3D XPoint wafers/month. Micron announced its Quantx drives in August. So far Micron hasn't announced specs, prices or availability of its SSDs but said they will ship for revenue this year. A storage executive with Hewlett Packard Enterprise that expects to use Optane in servers and flash arrays estimated that the new drives could make up 5–10% of the SSDs that it buys next year. Storage analyst Alan Niebel of Web-feet Research (Monterey, California) estimated Intel’s 2017 sales at about $100 million. One wild card is how widely that big web data centers adopt the drives. Facebook expressed support for 3D XPoint a year ago and is working on supporting the RocksDB software that enables it. However, at this year’s Open Compute event, a Facebook representative had no update on its plans for the SSDs. At a launch event, Intel shared a quote from a manager of Alibaba’s data centers. He expressed enthusiasm for re-architecting the company’s search engines to make use of the Optane SSDs. It also listed China’s TenCent and server OEMs Dell EMC and Lenovo as supporters. Niebel said that the initial specs and prices were reasonable and in line with expectations. Intel’s software to enable use as main memory paves an important path for DIMM cards, with 3D XPoint expected next year, he said.

BTW, good questions on the 3DXP roadmap. However, I am certain they are ones Intel will not answer at this point, though they did say they have the next two generations in development. Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: ...XPoint scalability resistion   3/20/2017 3:15:48 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I would be interested to see the scaling path for 3D XPoint. The trouble with this version of 3D (as opposed to 3D-NAND) is that adding more layers adds more cost proportionally, so cost/bit saturates. The mature, higher-voltage underlying CMOS should be relatively cheap. As I understand it is already at the same design rule as DRAM (and in fact NAND) ~20 nm. Whether it can scale lower, could depend on what factors could disturb the cells, e.g., thermal. Also the lines connecting the cells get more resistive, which hinders the reading. MLC/TLC would be the best or most practical hope. But this requires a mature enough (resistive) memory, and this would also slow down the writing. The retention is the key for any power savings to be realized. But it is not highlighted, which has me worried for this release..

It doesn't matter how much capacity you have if it disappears while writing.

Intel has spent probably a ton of money developing this technology, and have yet to see any revenue, so of course the initial costs will be high with low volumes. But of course the costs will fall nicely as this technology matures and the volume goes up with the economies of scale benefits. Secondly, DRAM progress has basically come to a stand still, while Intel already has 3 generation of 3DXP in the pipline. They can achieve higher bit density and thus cost with three vectors: smalles geometries (and associated scaling beneifts like possibly performance, latency and endurance), more layers (now 2, although not as scalable as 3D NAND), and more bits per cell. So this technology has a lot of long-term potential. Of course one shouldn't expect a revolution overnight, but this technology is really promising certainly given the general trends in high-performance computing we're seeing.

Joaquin Castro: 'No conclusion one way or another' on Trump campaign ties to Russia And we're joined by two key members of the house intelligence committee holding the hearing with the FBI director tomorrow. Joaquin Castro, Democrat, and R R representative will Hurd. Have you seen any evidence of that? To quote my father, Bob Hurd who has given this advice to all my friends when they got married, it never hurts to say you're sorry. You think the president should say he's voir? Think so. It helds with our allies. We live if a dangerous world. We can't do this alone. When we have major ally. Not just sorry to the president. But also to the uk. For the claims, or the intimation that the uk was involved in this as well. It doesn't hurt. It takes away from the rest of his agenda. And congressman Castro, I assume you agree with that right there. What do you expect from FBI director Comey tomorrow? Do you think he's prepared to address this publicly? On the wiretapping, I hope he will. This will be an opportunity for us to have an open discussion about this investigation. I'm sure that we're not going to hear everything because we're not in a classified setting. There are a few things I'm hoping to hear. First, whether any Americans are being investigating for cooperating or conspiring with the Russians. Second, the scope of the investigation. Third, a timeline for resolving it. To follow up on something Chris ruddy was saying. We have the former director of intelligence saying he's seen no evidence of collusion with people from the trump campaign and the Russians. Have you? It's my understanding that's what's being investigated. He's stating there's a conclusion being reached. My understanding is that's being investigated. You haven't seen any evidence? No conclusion one way or another. Meanwhile, congressman Hurd, how do you expect to go about this? And bottom line, do you think the house intelligence committee will get to the bottom of this? What is it going to stake? I think it takes a bipartisan, thoughtful, thorough investigation. E think some folks will be frustrated on Monday not hearing certain answers because there may be an active investigation going on. Criminal investigation. If there's an active criminal investigation, we need to allow awe enforcement in order to do their job. Then the house and senate intelligence commutes should be reviewing what law enforcement's responses have been. What the intelligence community is doing. I'm looking forward on Monday to having the NSA director and the FBI director go through the time line, publicly, on the Russian involvement in our -- in attempts to influence our elections. What was -- how did we respond? And also, part of this is, if we understand what they did to plot out how we defend against this in the future. And maybe be able to tell our allies like France and Germany what they should be doing to inculcate themselves from Russian attacks. How much damage has been done to our intelligence relationships with great Britain and perhaps Germany as well? Given what's happened in the last couple of days. It's quite alarming, George. You think about our long standing relationship with the British. Our relationship and information-sharing with the five eyes. And how hostile the president has been, not only to the CIA and the FBI, our own intelligence age sis. Also to Australia. Now Britain, certainly Germany. These relationships work. And working together on things like counterterrorism is only successful if these nations and their intelligence agencies trust and have confidence in the United States. So when you hear these outlandish comments, what I keep thinking is that there's a real possibility that the president is undermining these relationships. As you know, congressman Hurd, the president and his allies believe he's been undermined by people inside the intelligence community. You have worked at the CIA. What do you make of the claims there's a so-called "Deep state" working against president trump? I spent 9 1/2 years as an undercover officer. I was the dude in the back alleys at 4:00 in the morning collecting intelligence. You have professional intelligence folks. And you have the political intelligence folks. The men and the women in the CIA, they do their job regardless of who is in the white house. Same with the NSA. Same with the FBI. They putting themselves in harm's way. Have to deal with difficult situations. What I think -- this is how the intelligence community refers to the Russian involvement or attempts to manipulate our elections, grizzly stat -- it will go down in the history of mother Russia as the greatest covert action. Not because trump won. But because it created a wedge, real or perceived, between the white house, the intelligence community, and the American pluck. This investigation has to be bipartisan. Thorough. And it has to be thoughtful. We're feeding into the covert action narrative that the Russians are trying to create. Thank you both for your time.

The logical step down for more mainstream folks is the Ryzen 5 series of chips. AMD revealed two of those parts—the Ryzen 5 1600X and the Ryzen 5 1500X—alongside the Ryzen 7 family, and today we're learning more about a new pair of Ryzen 5 CPUs that complete the midrange tier of AMD's new processor lineup. Model Cores Threads Base clock Boost clock XFR TDP Price Ryzen 5 1600X 6 12 3.6 GHz 4.0 GHz Yes 95W $249 Ryzen 5 1600 3.2 GHz 3.6 GHz 65W $219 Ryzen 5 1500X 4 8 3.5 GHz 3.7 GHz $189 Ryzen 5 1400 3.2 GHz 3.4 GHz $169 At the top of the range, the Ryzen 5 1600X is joined by the Ryzen 5 1600. The 1600X will likely be pitted against Intel's entry-level six-core CPU, the Core i7-6800K. The aggressively-clocked 1600X boasts what AMD calls a "full" XFR range, although the company says the definition of "full" isn't being revealed at this time, and our guess is that it could vary from chip to chip in this lineup. Of the Ryzen 5 CPUs being announced today, the 1600X is the only one that will slot into a 95W TDP. Meanwhile, the modestly-clocked Ryzen 5 1600 retains XFR, but it likely won't benefit as much as its sibling from a bigger cooler on top.  That chip puts an impressive six cores and 12 threads into a trim 65W thermal envelope. Most builders are used to four cores and eight threads from Intel's $300+ Core i7 CPUs, but AMD is taking four Zen cores with SMT under $200 with the Ryzen 5 1500X and Ryzen 5 1400. The Ryzen 5 1500X will boast 200 MHz of XFR headroom on top of its already-appealing base speeds, and it'll retain the unlocked multiplier common to all Ryzen CPUs. Whether that's enough to match or outpace the potent Core i5-7500 at $205 will be an interesting question as we approach review time. At the base of the lineup, the Ryzen 7 1400 offers what could be an impressive level of multithreaded performance and unlocked multipliers for about $25 less than the Core i5-7400. AMD will include unilluminated versions of its Wraith Spire cooler with the Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500X, while the Ryzen 5 1400 will get the more modest Wraith Stealth heatsink. In response to questions about whether it would offer RGB LED-illuminated versions of these coolers separately, AMD said that builders who want the blinkenlights will need to shell out for a Ryzen 7 chip. As the enthusiast-class six-core chip in this lineup, the Ryzen 5 1600X will sell as a bare processor only. Some mysteries remain about the Ryzen 5 lineup. AMD didn't answer my questions about CCX arrangements for these parts, although the wide XFR boost range the company let slip for the Ryzen 5 1500X suggests that only one CCX may be underneath four-core Ryzens' heat spreaders. We also don't know these chips' cache arrangements just yet. All will be revealed soon enough, as AMD says the entire Ryzen 5 family will hit store shelves April 11.

A turbulent history has stifled the economy, but things are starting to look up for the Caucasus republic. A highly-skilled, post-soviet engineering workforce and a diaspora of advocates, combined with new government initiatives, are igniting renewed growth in Armenia’s IT sector. These businesses are creating new technologies — from award-winning mobile apps to world-first presentation tools — recognized across the globe and many startups are making their way to the US. The Armenian tech industry is growing at an annual rate of 20 percent, greatly exceeding the country’s two percent economic growth. Annual tech revenues from some 400 IT companies make up $475 million and by 2018, it is estimated this industry will be the dominant sector driving new wealth for the economy.

Armenia’s tech scene is at a real turning point. The Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union has morphed into a thriving tech startup hub, attracting global recognition. So, how is the Armenian tech scene growing? What is the country doing to drive international investment and which startups are making the biggest waves in the global tech scene? Reigniting IT innovation In the days of the Soviet Union, Armenia designed and manufactured 40 percent of the mainframe computers for the military. The Yerevan Computer Research Institute, a secret building in the capital city, employed 5,000 highly skilled workers, but later fell to ruin. This is just a small portion of the “several hundred thousand specialists” that worked behind the scenes at the heart of IT innovation, according to the Union of Information Technology Enterprises in Yerevan. © Provided by The Next Web This history, combined with Soviet academia’s celebration for the sciences and great Armenian determination, have provided the foundation to kick-start a resurgence of tech innovation. As tech revenues continue to rise, the largest foreign investment, according to the Armenian government, is going into “telecommunications, mining, energy, air transportation and financial sectors.” Online gaming and sports betting software company BetConstruct, an investor in my company ucraft, launched in Yerevan in 2003 and today has offices worldwide. BetConstruct’s founder and CEO Vahe Baloulian told me, “When we launched, the technology sector in Armenia consisted mainly of software houses serving the nascent industries and the government and some offshoots of foreign technology companies, looking for more affordable resources. The successes of these prompted local entrepreneurs to set up development firms that would attract outsourced work.” He described how improvements in infrastructure mean opening business in Armenia today is far easier, “The old communication monopoly has been abolished, and competing providers have made the Internet a lot more affordable and accessible.” Many of the largest IT companies operating in Armenia, such as Microsoft, Google and Oracle, are internationally headquartered with development teams based in the country. The government encourages expansion from these corporates with the implementation of its “open door” policy, designed to encourage foreign business owners and investment, with legal regimes that protect foreign capital. In 2012, Intel announced the launch of a new research center during the ArmTech Congress. US Ambassador to Armenia John Heffern reported the potential for IT growth, “The creative mind is the key to the future of Armenia. The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued a report based on UNESCO data, according to which Armenia is the first among CIS member states with the number of inventions per capita,” he said. The multinational joined global names such as Synopsys, D-Link and “virtualization giant” VMWare after its acquisition of IT startup Integrien — each running operations from the country and taking action to rouse a new generation of tech innovation. © Provided by The Next Web Synopsys, the largest global company in electronic design automation (EDA), with an annual revenue of over $2 billion USD, launched offices in Armenia in 2004. Today it is one of the largest IT companies in the country, with over 650 employees. It is also heavily involved in schemes to support rising talent. Synopsys collaborates with Armenia’s Polytechnic University to provide educational programs for students, and also hiring a large number of graduates. These initiatives work to support Armenia’s youth through education and increasing work availability for skilled Armenians. But large corporates are not the only option, a burgeoning startup scene enabled by new government tax reduction schemes is changing the face of Yerevan and attracting global attention. New legislation empowers entrepreneurs in Yerevan Yerevan is one of the oldest cities in the world. However this ancient transit hub has renewed energy as the center of Armenia’s startup scene. Recent legislation has made founding, operating and growing a tech startup in Armenia much simpler. After lobbying from the Union of Information Technology Enterprises (UITE), Armenian headquartered startups, tech centers, incubators and accelerations with fewer than 30 employees, now benefit from tax privileges. Yerevan is also home to two free economic zones (FEZ) where businesses that meet certain startup requirements can operate without paying VAT, profit, property and income tax, also escaping export customs duty charges. One of these is found in the area of the RAO Mars Closed Joint-Stock Company and Yerevan Research Institute of Mathematical Machines, and is designed to enable, manufacture and export of new technologies. Today, you really can launch a startup for a very low cost — and the effects of this are a growing startup ecosystem, and a culture of excitement. Armenian businesses are gaining traction and experiencing global recognition. Companies such as PicsArt, Triada Studios, Plexonic and BetConstruct are making waves in the tech industry, showing the enormous potential Armenia has as a center of innovation. © Provided by The Next Web Yerevan-based Triada Studio is the creator of puzzle app Shadowmatic, the winner of the prestigious Apple Design Award and App Store Best of 2015. Triada Studios launched in 1993 as a computer graphics and animation studio. Cofounder and CEO Ara Aghamyan described the “huge intellectual potential” in Armenia. Aghamyan claims the biggest challenge that the Armenian tech-scene faces today is the exodus of talent, as a large number of startups end up moving to the U.S. to raise capital and reach greater audiences. “We can only overcome this by creating an ecosystem that will not only make people stay in the country, but also attract great minds from all over the world,” he told me. The move to Silicon Valley Nigel Sharp is the former technical project manager for Armenia’s TUMO Center for Creative Technologies and founder of Armenia-based startup Lionsharp creator of Voiceboard, “the world’s first gesture and voice controlled presentation solution.” Sharp told PSFK that a poor track record of foreign investment “plagued with corruption and losses” has created a barrier to foreign investment. This distrust combined with the challenges of networking, common in any emerging startup hub, prevents many businesses from putting their creations in front of a global audience. This is made more difficult by limited access to entrepreneurial education, language differences and the need to travel. As a result, Armenian startups are moving to the U.S. to gain support, funding and improve their growth prospects. In April, photo-editing app PicsArt raised an additional $20M in VC, bringing its total funding to $45M and enabling the Armenia-born startup to grow its presence in China and Japan. In 2015, PicsArt’s CEO Hovhannes Avoyan relocated to join the company’s Chief Revenue Officer in San Francisco, helping to further solidify PicsArt’s recognition in the U.S. tech scene. PicsArt was later that year included on Forbes’s list of ”Hottest Startups of 2015”. © Provided by The Next Web Influencers in the tech world are making efforts to strengthen ties between Armenia and the US. In March Triada Studios’ Ara Aghamyan wrote to President Obama explaining the tech community’s role in developing US-Armenian commerce. He drew attention to the issue of double taxation that deters foreign investment and restricts growth for businesses that are based in Armenia. Shadowmatic is not the first to take a stand. PicsArt, Microsoft, FedEX, NASDAQ, Marriott, Grant Thorton and more have all gone on record in support of better economic relations to empower growth within the country. US advocates of Armenian tech growth Armenia’s enormous diaspora means that there are actually more Armenians living outside of the country: There are between seven to 10 million Armenians concentrated in Russia, the US and France, in contrast to just three million within the country. Second generations Armenians today also add to this global network actively working to support Armenia’s future growth. Co-founder of Inet Technologies, Sam Simonian and his wife Sylva founded TUMO Center for Creative Technologies; a free digital learning center in Yerevan, that provides classes for around 5,000 12-18 year olds working with new technologies. Armenia boasts a number of innovative centers such as TUMO, launched as a result of international advocates, and big partnerships. Former Twitter VP, Uber executive Raffi Krikorian, sits on the board at TUMO, and is active when it comes to supporting new startups, “Honestly, if you are Armenian, I will probably want to help you” he said in an interview with Itel.am. © Provided by The Next Web In 2011, Microsoft launched the Microsoft Innovation Center Armenia in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF). The center aims to enable IT growth by supporting students and startups. It offers programs such as coding bootcamps, training courses and workshops and startup acceleration schemes that include early-seed investment, helping to power a growing startup ecosystem. Entrepreneurs also benefit from a new emergence of enterprises such as the Center for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED) which this year launched the Armenia – US IT Acceleration Program with the EIF, the Government of Armenia and the World Bank, helping to connect new startups with global markets. As with any emerging industry Armenia’s startup scene struggles with limited cash flow and a need to respond quickly to changing tech. New businesses such as Armenia’s first virtual networking and startup accelerator, HIVE and the country’s first technology-focused VC firm, Granatus Ventures, help startups to get off the ground. However, in order to compete on a larger-scale, these businesses need to attract larger audiences and global investment. But the wheels are in motion, today it is far easier than ever before. As more business leaders draw attention to both the barriers that Armenia faces, but also the potential of this emerging industry, we can expect continued growth from this ancient center of innovation.

Reigniting IT innovation In the days of the Soviet Union, Armenia designed and manufactured 40 percent of the mainframe computers for the military. The Yerevan Computer Research Institute, a secret building in the capital city, employed 5,000 highly skilled workers, but later fell to ruin. This is just a small portion of the “several hundred thousand specialists” that worked behind the scenes at the heart of IT innovation, according to the Union of Information Technology Enterprises in Yerevan. © Provided by The Next Web This history, combined with Soviet academia’s celebration for the sciences and great Armenian determination, have provided the foundation to kick-start a resurgence of tech innovation. As tech revenues continue to rise, the largest foreign investment, according to the Armenian government, is going into “telecommunications, mining, energy, air transportation and financial sectors.” Online gaming and sports betting software company BetConstruct, an investor in my company ucraft, launched in Yerevan in 2003 and today has offices worldwide. BetConstruct’s founder and CEO Vahe Baloulian told me, “When we launched, the technology sector in Armenia consisted mainly of software houses serving the nascent industries and the government and some offshoots of foreign technology companies, looking for more affordable resources. The successes of these prompted local entrepreneurs to set up development firms that would attract outsourced work.” He described how improvements in infrastructure mean opening business in Armenia today is far easier, “The old communication monopoly has been abolished, and competing providers have made the Internet a lot more affordable and accessible.” Many of the largest IT companies operating in Armenia, such as Microsoft, Google and Oracle, are internationally headquartered with development teams based in the country. The government encourages expansion from these corporates with the implementation of its “open door” policy, designed to encourage foreign business owners and investment, with legal regimes that protect foreign capital. In 2012, Intel announced the launch of a new research center during the ArmTech Congress. US Ambassador to Armenia John Heffern reported the potential for IT growth, “The creative mind is the key to the future of Armenia. The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued a report based on UNESCO data, according to which Armenia is the first among CIS member states with the number of inventions per capita,” he said. The multinational joined global names such as Synopsys, D-Link and “virtualization giant” VMWare after its acquisition of IT startup Integrien — each running operations from the country and taking action to rouse a new generation of tech innovation. © Provided by The Next Web Synopsys, the largest global company in electronic design automation (EDA), with an annual revenue of over $2 billion USD, launched offices in Armenia in 2004. Today it is one of the largest IT companies in the country, with over 650 employees. It is also heavily involved in schemes to support rising talent. Synopsys collaborates with Armenia’s Polytechnic University to provide educational programs for students, and also hiring a large number of graduates. These initiatives work to support Armenia’s youth through education and increasing work availability for skilled Armenians. But large corporates are not the only option, a burgeoning startup scene enabled by new government tax reduction schemes is changing the face of Yerevan and attracting global attention. New legislation empowers entrepreneurs in Yerevan Yerevan is one of the oldest cities in the world. However this ancient transit hub has renewed energy as the center of Armenia’s startup scene. Recent legislation has made founding, operating and growing a tech startup in Armenia much simpler. After lobbying from the Union of Information Technology Enterprises (UITE), Armenian headquartered startups, tech centers, incubators and accelerations with fewer than 30 employees, now benefit from tax privileges. Yerevan is also home to two free economic zones (FEZ) where businesses that meet certain startup requirements can operate without paying VAT, profit, property and income tax, also escaping export customs duty charges. One of these is found in the area of the RAO Mars Closed Joint-Stock Company and Yerevan Research Institute of Mathematical Machines, and is designed to enable, manufacture and export of new technologies. Today, you really can launch a startup for a very low cost — and the effects of this are a growing startup ecosystem, and a culture of excitement. Armenian businesses are gaining traction and experiencing global recognition. Companies such as PicsArt, Triada Studios, Plexonic and BetConstruct are making waves in the tech industry, showing the enormous potential Armenia has as a center of innovation. © Provided by The Next Web Yerevan-based Triada Studio is the creator of puzzle app Shadowmatic, the winner of the prestigious Apple Design Award and App Store Best of 2015. Triada Studios launched in 1993 as a computer graphics and animation studio. Cofounder and CEO Ara Aghamyan described the “huge intellectual potential” in Armenia. Aghamyan claims the biggest challenge that the Armenian tech-scene faces today is the exodus of talent, as a large number of startups end up moving to the U.S. to raise capital and reach greater audiences. “We can only overcome this by creating an ecosystem that will not only make people stay in the country, but also attract great minds from all over the world,” he told me. The move to Silicon Valley Nigel Sharp is the former technical project manager for Armenia’s TUMO Center for Creative Technologies and founder of Armenia-based startup Lionsharp creator of Voiceboard, “the world’s first gesture and voice controlled presentation solution.” Sharp told PSFK that a poor track record of foreign investment “plagued with corruption and losses” has created a barrier to foreign investment. This distrust combined with the challenges of networking, common in any emerging startup hub, prevents many businesses from putting their creations in front of a global audience. This is made more difficult by limited access to entrepreneurial education, language differences and the need to travel. As a result, Armenian startups are moving to the U.S. to gain support, funding and improve their growth prospects. In April, photo-editing app PicsArt raised an additional $20M in VC, bringing its total funding to $45M and enabling the Armenia-born startup to grow its presence in China and Japan. In 2015, PicsArt’s CEO Hovhannes Avoyan relocated to join the company’s Chief Revenue Officer in San Francisco, helping to further solidify PicsArt’s recognition in the U.S. tech scene. PicsArt was later that year included on Forbes’s list of ”Hottest Startups of 2015”. © Provided by The Next Web Influencers in the tech world are making efforts to strengthen ties between Armenia and the US. In March Triada Studios’ Ara Aghamyan wrote to President Obama explaining the tech community’s role in developing US-Armenian commerce. He drew attention to the issue of double taxation that deters foreign investment and restricts growth for businesses that are based in Armenia. Shadowmatic is not the first to take a stand. PicsArt, Microsoft, FedEX, NASDAQ, Marriott, Grant Thorton and more have all gone on record in support of better economic relations to empower growth within the country. US advocates of Armenian tech growth Armenia’s enormous diaspora means that there are actually more Armenians living outside of the country: There are between seven to 10 million Armenians concentrated in Russia, the US and France, in contrast to just three million within the country. Second generations Armenians today also add to this global network actively working to support Armenia’s future growth. Co-founder of Inet Technologies, Sam Simonian and his wife Sylva founded TUMO Center for Creative Technologies; a free digital learning center in Yerevan, that provides classes for around 5,000 12-18 year olds working with new technologies. Armenia boasts a number of innovative centers such as TUMO, launched as a result of international advocates, and big partnerships. Former Twitter VP, Uber executive Raffi Krikorian, sits on the board at TUMO, and is active when it comes to supporting new startups, “Honestly, if you are Armenian, I will probably want to help you” he said in an interview with Itel.am. © Provided by The Next Web In 2011, Microsoft launched the Microsoft Innovation Center Armenia in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF). The center aims to enable IT growth by supporting students and startups. It offers programs such as coding bootcamps, training courses and workshops and startup acceleration schemes that include early-seed investment, helping to power a growing startup ecosystem. Entrepreneurs also benefit from a new emergence of enterprises such as the Center for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED) which this year launched the Armenia – US IT Acceleration Program with the EIF, the Government of Armenia and the World Bank, helping to connect new startups with global markets. As with any emerging industry Armenia’s startup scene struggles with limited cash flow and a need to respond quickly to changing tech. New businesses such as Armenia’s first virtual networking and startup accelerator, HIVE and the country’s first technology-focused VC firm, Granatus Ventures, help startups to get off the ground. However, in order to compete on a larger-scale, these businesses need to attract larger audiences and global investment. But the wheels are in motion, today it is far easier than ever before. As more business leaders draw attention to both the barriers that Armenia faces, but also the potential of this emerging industry, we can expect continued growth from this ancient center of innovation.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon A former DND employee and Canadian Forces soldier whose $400-a-day cocaine addiction led to the theft of nearly $1 million in computer parts from the federal government was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison Friday. And if 33-year-old Andrew Heggaton doesn’t pay back the $966,933.82 the Intel core processors, hard drives, motherboards, and graphics cards were worth within the next eight years, he could be sentenced to another three years of prison time. Ontario Court Justice Heather Perkins-McVey said the fraud had a “significant impact” on the Canadian Forces Crypto Support Unit where Heggaton once worked, leaving its IT network on the verge of collapsing and seriously affecting the unit’s capacity to function. “This is not a victimless crime,” Perkins-McVey told Heggaton during the sentencing. “This is the type of offence that erodes the public trust.” Heggaton pleaded guilty to fraud, trafficking in property obtained by crime and breach of trust by a public officer after stealing the computer parts over a four-year period between 2011 and March 2015. Some of the computer parts were sold by Heggaton on the Internet classified site Kijiji. Heggaton told a probation officer who prepared a pre-sentence report for the court that drug addiction fuelled the thefts. Heggaton, who had been a soldier in the Canadian Forces for eight years between 2001 and 2009, had begun using illicit drugs during a seven-month tour in Afghanistan in 2003. It all went up his nose The drug use began spiralling out of control once he returned to Canada, and he started using magic mushrooms, ecstasy, speed and cocaine. Heggaton has since attended some Narcotics Anonymous meetings, but has made no effort to attend formal drug addiction counselling, the judge said. “He has nothing to show for it,” Heggaton’s lawyer Michael Smith of the fraud during a sentencing hearing earlier in the week. “It all went up his nose.” Heggaton was arrested after suppliers started contacting DND in 2014 looking for payment for outstanding invoices for computer equipment that had been ordered but could not be located. Heggaton was listed on the invoices and would have received the items, many of which were ordered with authorization forms that didn’t have any recognizable signature or were missing an additional level of certification. When challenged by his superiors, Heggaton gave nonsensical answers or tried to pass off older model computers as the missing merchandise. Related How a New York-based model was allegedly recruited to smuggle cocaine by an ex-Vice Canada editor School board will pay salary of teacher on ‘home assignment’ after being accused of trafficking cocaine Ontario police arrest 18 people in cross-border drugs and guns investigation under ‘Project Silkstone’ An internal investigation was launched to ensure any deliveries sent to Heggaton were authorized, and on March 6, 2015, a package addressed to Heggaton containing a large number of Intel Core i7 processors was intercepted. The CFCSU verified the processors were not required, the parcel was put out for delivery and Heggaton was placed under surveillance. Heggaton was stopped as he left work, and 15 of the processors and four hard drives were recovered from his bag. A search of his work space uncovered additional suspicious invoices and orders along with brand new hi-tech computer parts that were not used by the unit. During his sentencing submissions, Crown prosecutor Bruce Lee-Shanok said Heggaton’s greed left his co-workers under the lens of suspicion before his arrest. In a victim impact statement, a major said that morale in the unit had reached an all-time low, according to Lee-Shanok. Court heard Heggaton grew up in a military family. He was born on a military base in Germany. His father was in the British forces, and the family relocated often to bases across the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. His arrest has strained his relationship with his family, court heard. Heggaton has since attempted suicide and was admitted to hospital for his depression, Perkins-McVey said. He is now on public assistance, although he earns some extra money fixing laptop computers. During a hearing earlier in the week, Heggaton told the judge he intends to use his time behind bars on redemption. “I truly understand the actions betrayed the trust that had been placed in me by my country,” said Heggaton. “I realize that my actions were inexcusable, and for that I am deeply sorry.” Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (11) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Make your next move with a beautiful website and customized domain name.

Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU.

According to a report in Forbes on Friday, when a user tries to run Windows Update, Windows is unable to search for new updates generating a message “Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error”. “As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support. This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon,” the report quoted a Microsoft spokesperson as saying. Micosoft is making sure its runs new silicon on latest Windows and install them on most new-build PCs running these processors. “While there will be user benefits to this strategy, it also means that Microsoft is taking away a measure of control from users,” the report noted. Intel Skylake processors will also not be supported on Windows 7 and 8 from July. Therefore, its users will have to upgrade to keep the updates coming.

Armenian News Network / Groong [Next Article][Previous Article][Main Index] Armenia’s rising tech scene: The new Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union From: Mihran Keheyian <mkeheyian@gmail.com> Date: Sat, 18 Mar 2017 18:21:47 +0000 Armenia’s rising tech scene: The new Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union March 17, 2017 364 0 By Gev Balian The Next Web Armenia was once the center of IT innovation for the USSR. A turbulent history has stifled the economy, but things are starting to look up for the Caucasus republic. A highly-skilled, post-soviet engineering workforce and a diaspora of advocates, combined with new government initiatives, are igniting renewed growth in Armenia’s IT sector. These businesses are creating new technologies — from award-winning mobile apps to world-first presentation tools — recognized across the globe and many startups are making their way to the US. The Armenian tech industry is growing at an annual rate of 20 percent, greatly exceeding the country’s two percent economic growth. Annual tech revenues from some 400 IT companies make up $475 million and by 2018, it is estimated this industry will be the dominant sector driving new wealth for the economy. Emerging startups, global expansion and initiatives from some of the biggest names in tech – from Intel to Microsoft — are creating great momentum. Armenia’s tech scene is at a real turning point. The Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union has morphed into a thriving tech startup hub, attracting global recognition. So, how is the Armenian tech scene growing? What is the country doing to drive international investment and which startups are making the biggest waves in the global tech scene? Reigniting IT innovation In the days of the Soviet Union, Armenia designed and manufactured 40 percent of the mainframe computers for the military. The Yerevan Computer Research Institute, a secret building in the capital city, employed 5,000 highly skilled workers, but later fell to ruin. This is just a small portion of the “several hundred thousand specialists” that worked behind the scenes at the heart of IT innovation, according to the Union of Information Technology Enterprises in Yerevan. This history, combined with Soviet academia’s celebration for the sciences and great Armenian determination, have provided the foundation to kick-start a resurgence of tech innovation. As tech revenues continue to rise, the largest foreign investment, according to the Armenian government, is going into “telecommunications, mining, energy, air transportation and financial sectors.” Online gaming and sports betting software company BetConstruct, an investor in my company ucraft, launched in Yerevan in 2003 and today has offices worldwide. BetConstruct’s founder and CEO Vahe Baloulian told me, “When we launched, the technology sector in Armenia consisted mainly of software houses serving the nascent industries and the government and some offshoots of foreign technology companies, looking for more affordable resources. The successes of these prompted local entrepreneurs to set up development firms that would attract outsourced work.” He described how improvements in infrastructure mean opening business in Armenia today is far easier, “The old communication monopoly has been abolished, and competing providers have made the Internet a lot more affordable and accessible.” Many of the largest IT companies operating in Armenia, such as Microsoft, Google and Oracle, are internationally headquartered with development teams based in the country. The government encourages expansion from these corporates with the implementation of its “open door” policy, designed to encourage foreign business owners and investment, with legal regimes that protect foreign capital. In 2012, Intel announced the launch of a new research center during the ArmTech Congress. US Ambassador to Armenia John Heffern reported the potential for IT growth, “The creative mind is the key to the future of Armenia. The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued a report based on UNESCO data, according to which Armenia is the first among CIS member states with the number of inventions per capita,” he said. The multinational joined global names such as Synopsys, D-Link and “virtualization giant” VMWare after its acquisition of IT startup Integrien — each running operations from the country and taking action to rouse a new generation of tech innovation. Synopsys, the largest global company in electronic design automation (EDA), with an annual revenue of over $2 billion USD, launched offices in Armenia in 2004. Today it is one of the largest IT companies in the country, with over 650 employees. It is also heavily involved in schemes to support rising talent. Synopsys collaborates with Armenia’s Polytechnic University to provide educational programs for students, and also hiring a large number of graduates. These initiatives work to support Armenia’s youth through education and increasing work availability for skilled Armenians. But large corporates are not the only option, a burgeoning startup scene enabled by new government tax reduction schemes is changing the face of Yerevan and attracting global attention. New legislation empowers entrepreneurs in Yerevan Yerevan is one of the oldest cities in the world. However this ancient transit hub has renewed energy as the center of Armenia’s startup scene. Recent legislation has made founding, operating and growing a tech startup in Armenia much simpler. After lobbying from the Union of Information Technology Enterprises (UITE), Armenian headquartered startups, tech centers, incubators and accelerations with fewer than 30 employees, now benefit from tax privileges. Yerevan is also home to two free economic zones (FEZ) where businesses that meet certain startup requirements can operate without paying VAT, profit, property and income tax, also escaping export customs duty charges. One of these is found in the area of the RAO Mars Closed Joint-Stock Company and Yerevan Research Institute of Mathematical Machines, and is designed to enable, manufacture and export of new technologies. Today, you really can launch a startup for a very low cost — and the effects of this are a growing startup ecosystem, and a culture of excitement. Armenian businesses are gaining traction and experiencing global recognition. Companies such as PicsArt, Triada Studios, Plexonic and BetConstruct are making waves in the tech industry, showing the enormous potential Armenia has as a center of innovation. Yerevan-based Triada Studio is the creator of puzzle app Shadowmatic, the winner of the prestigious Apple Design Award and App Store Best of 2015. Triada Studios launched in 1993 as a computer graphics and animation studio. Cofounder and CEOAra Aghamyan described the “huge intellectual potential” in Armenia. Aghamyan claims the biggest challenge that the Armenian tech-scene faces today is the exodus of talent, as a large number of startups end up moving to the U.S. to raise capital and reach greater audiences. “We can only overcome this by creating an ecosystem that will not only make people stay in the country, but also attract great minds from all over the world,” he told me. The move to Silicon Valley Nigel Sharp is the former technical project manager for Armenia’s TUMO Center for Creative Technologies and founder of Armenia-based startup Lionsharp creator ofVoiceboard, “the world’s first gesture and voice controlled presentation solution.” Sharp told PSFK that a poor track record of foreign investment “plagued with corruption and losses” has created a barrier to foreign investment. This distrust combined with the challenges of networking, common in any emerging startup hub, prevents many businesses from putting their creations in front of a global audience. This is made more difficult by limited access to entrepreneurial education, language differences and the need to travel. As a result, Armenian startups are moving to the U.S. to gain support, funding and improve their growth prospects. In April, photo-editing app PicsArt raised an additional $20M in VC, bringing its total funding to $45M and enabling the Armenia-born startup to grow its presence in China and Japan. In 2015, PicsArt’s CEO Hovhannes Avoyan relocated to join the company’s Chief Revenue Officer in San Francisco, helping to further solidify PicsArt’s recognition in the U.S. tech scene. PicsArt was later that year included on Forbes’s list of ”Hottest Startups of 2015”. Influencers in the tech world are making efforts to strengthen ties between Armenia and the US. In March Triada Studios’ Ara Aghamyan wrote to President Obamaexplaining the tech community’s role in developing US-Armenian commerce. He drew attention to the issue of double taxation that deters foreign investment and restricts growth for businesses that are based in Armenia. Shadowmatic is not the first to take a stand. PicsArt, Microsoft, FedEX, NASDAQ, Marriott, Grant Thorton and more have all gone on record in support of better economic relations to empower growth within the country. US advocates of Armenian tech growth Armenia’s enormous diaspora means that there are actually more Armenians living outside of the country: There are between seven to 10 million Armenians concentrated in Russia, the US and France, in contrast to just three million within the country. Second generations Armenians today also add to this global network actively working to support Armenia’s future growth. Co-founder of Inet Technologies, Sam Simonian and his wife Sylva founded TUMO Center for Creative Technologies; a free digital learning center in Yerevan, that provides classes for around 5,000 12-18 year olds working with new technologies. Armenia boasts a number of innovative centers such as TUMO, launched as a result of international advocates, and big partnerships. Former Twitter VP, Uber executive Raffi Krikorian, sits on the board at TUMO, and is active when it comes to supporting new startups, “Honestly, if you are Armenian, I will probably want to help you” he said in an interview with Repat Armenia. In 2011, Microsoft launched the Microsoft Innovation Center Armenia in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF). The center aims to enable IT growth by supporting students and startups. It offers programs such as coding bootcamps, training courses and workshops and startup acceleration schemes that include early-seed investment, helping to power a growing startup ecosystem. Entrepreneurs also benefit from a new emergence of enterprises such as the Center for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED) which this year launched theArmenia – US IT Acceleration Program with the EIF, the Government of Armenia and the World Bank, helping to connect new startups with global markets. As with any emerging industry Armenia’s startup scene struggles with limited cash flow and a need to respond quickly to changing tech. New businesses such as Armenia’s first virtual networking and startup accelerator, HIVE and the country’s first technology-focused VC firm, Granatus Ventures, help startups to get off the ground. However, in order to compete on a larger-scale, these businesses need to attract larger audiences and global investment. But the wheels are in motion, today it is far easier than ever before. As more business leaders draw attention to both the barriers that Armenia faces, but also the potential of this emerging industry, we can expect continued growth from this ancient center of innovation. https://thenextweb.com/asia/2017/03/17/armenias-rising-tech-scene-new-silicon-valley-former-soviet-union/#.tnw_HN9VEA7c http://horizonweekly.ca/en/armenias-rising-tech-scene-the-new-silicon-valley-of-the-former-soviet-union/ [Next Article][Previous Article][Main Index] [ Reply to sender | Write to Groong ]

At the Mobile World Congress in February, a small device maker showcased its new augmented reality helmet for workers. Is there an opportunity for AR in business and investing? Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Mar 18, 2017 at 11:22AM We become so limited by this idea of technology replacing workers when the better idea is to power-up their senses and extend what they're capable of doing. So says Brian Mullins, founder and CEO of the augmented-reality device maker DAQRI. Those are powerful words, especially in a world where championing and empowering common workers can take you as far as the White House. Politics aside, though, the statement does beg the question: Does extending a worker's senses using augmented reality (AR) make business and investment sense? The case for augmented reality First, what is augmented reality? Unlike virtual reality (VR), which closes off the user from the real world, augmented reality works alongside it. VR has received much attention the last few years as an entertainment medium for things like video games and fully immersive movies. Last year, though, AR finally got some attention when Pokemon Go went viral. While the mobile game was an example of the potential applications for AR, DAQRI sees it being used for far more serious matters. The company was founded on the idea that AR could help empower workers with data, make them more productive, and even keep them safe. Image source: DAQRI. Because of its potential in the workplace, most estimates show that longer-term growth will favor augmented reality, not virtual. However, in 2016, the total VR/AR market brought in about $4 billion in revenue. More than half of that -- about $2.7 billion -- came from virtual reality sales. By the start of the next decade, estimates put annual AR/VR sales anywhere from $90 billion to $120 billion. While VR is leading right now, expectations are that AR will account for well over half of those estimates. The driver? Not video games and entertainment but enterprise solutions tethered to the Internet of Things and geared toward helping workers process data. What is DAQRI up to? Entering the scene last month at the Mobile World Congress 2017 was DAQRI's new Smart Helmet. Just like the name implies, this device looks like a hard hat with a front visor. But in this case, the visor is where data, pictures, and schematics are overlaid onto the real world. Image source: DAQRI. The company hopes its new device is the future of the industrial workforce, carrying a range of capabilities that workers need. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) provides the brains with its sixth-generation Core m7 processor, as well as several sensors to help project depth perception to the wearer. The device carries several cameras, including an infrared and thermal imaging camera for relevant applications. The helmet looks like a byproduct of Intel's Project Alloy, its bet on augmented reality that it announced last fall. DAQRI's helmet features similar hardware as Alloy, but Intel's goggles are being presented as a multiuse device for things ranging from entertainment to office environements, rather than a hard hat for futuristic industrial workers. DAQRI followed suit and also released a less-rugged version of its helmet in goggle form, simply called Smart Glasses. The design is again similar to Project Alloy and is being marketed for less-hazardous workplaces like distribution centers and for remote experts. A case study for augmented reality Evidence has been mounting that AR at work is a good idea for businesses. For example, German logistics and shipping company DHL equipped warehouse workers with AR glasses. The company reported that the glasses-equipped employees worked 25% faster and error-free during the three-week pilot program. The potential for AR to transform the workplace is there, but it is still early. Some challenges that will need to be tackled include boosting battery life for devices and building out an ecosystem of apps. For investors, there isn't much opportunity in AR outside of the major tech players or companies like Intel making the components powering the devices. As for DAQRI, it is a very small company and not yet publicly traded. Though early in the game, AR is still worth keeping tabs on. We are in an interesting time where technology is helping us more efficiently use the massive amounts of information and data available to us. AR represents one such option that, once refined, can help businesses and employees put that information to use in the best way possible, reducing costs, boosting profitability, and more.

A message that’s spreading like ‘wildfire’ claims white people should stay indoors on April 6th or risk destruction. A fearsome message inflicting unimaginable destruction has spread like wildfire in Pretoria warning people that Black South African citizens are planning something “big”, reports Centurion Rekord. People all over social media platforms and WhatsApp crime prevention groups are scratching their heads, trying to figure out where the message is coming from. The person who constructed the message said the following: “Listen carefully. On the 6th April I need you to be very careful. Book off from work. Tell everybody to stay home. The kids too. The blacks are planning something very big in PTA and JHB and surrounding areas that day. This is not a game.” The person then tries to persuade the reader of the above by saying it is not just a story, warning people to pile up on supplies. “This is not just a story. I’m connected with some very important people and the warnings are going out. Have enough water and food.” It also incites violence: “Get some sort of weapon or two. Put the dog/s inside as well for protection. Don’t leave your house! Start warning friends and family!” The message continues to say: “We believe this to be either a practice run with destruction and death; or the start of the civil war in this country.” It states further that this mass plan is going to disrupt all things possible, including cellphones, all highways and businesses. The manufacturer of the message then goes on to say they hope they are wrong, but “Intel” from their side says otherwise. By “Intel”, they mean information of military or political value. “Let’s hope we are wrong but the Intel at the moment says we are very right to fear. The chances of this spreading to other towns and cities are very good.” The community crime prevention on social media administrator in the Moot, Susan Andrews, strongly condemns the legitimacy of the message. Andrews advised that people should not go into panic mode. “There are many well-informed people who will issue a warning to the right forums and that message will be shared as confirmed.” She also called on the public to join their Community Policing Forums (CPF) to assist the police in crime prevention and to obtain skills in cases of emergency. A post containing AfriForum’s logo was also distributed in Pretoria, warning people that the message was false, and encouraging people not to distribute it. . AfriForum, however, said they were not aware of it, as it did not come from their organisation. It said itwas distributed without their approval and the organisation dissociated itself from the content. Police could not comment on the matter by the time of going to print. – Caxton News Service Related Stories Woman seriously wounded in KZN clinic shooting 19.3.2017 DA to submit questions on security at chief justice’s office following break-in 19.3.2017 WATCH: Video evidence leads to arrest of officers for fraud 19.3.2017 JSE Currencies Commodities what's hot National Yah neh, says cop ‘exposed’ as OR Tambo thief with Lamborghini National What did Singapore teach you about racism, Helen, asks confused Ndlozi National LISTEN: UDM coalition partner insults DA counterparts Entertainment Somizi may be separated from Mbau in Metro FM ‘reshuffle’ Celebrities We are traumatised and still in shock, says Joe Mafela’s family readers' choice National PIC: Joe Mafela’s accident scene National EFF claps back at Moonsamy, says she is seeking attention National Brothers killed in butchery robbery National What did Singapore teach you about racism, Helen, asks confused Ndlozi National Brothers killed in Pretoria central business robbery poll Do you think the break-in at the Office of the Chief Justice is highly suspicious?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 March 2017 by Military News 6 Things You Didn’t Know About FireEye, Inc. Tech investors might recognize FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE) as the hot cybersecurity IPO from 2013 that fizzled out over the following years. After going public at $20, FireEye soared to the mid-$80s before concerns about its valuation, lack of profits, cash burn rate, and a secondary offering torpedoed the stock. FireEye now trades at about $10, and its sales growth has flatlined, with analysts expecting just 1% sales growth this year. I’ve discussed the many shortcomings of FireEye’s business model before, but today I’ll focus on six lesser-known facts about this struggling cybersecurity firm. Image source: Getty Images. 1. The first cybersecurity firm certified by Homeland Security In 2015, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security certified FireEye’s Multi-Vector Virtual Execution (MVX) engine and  Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DHI) cloud platform under its SAFETY Act. That made it the first cybersecurity company to achieve SAFETY certification for its products, and reinforced its reputation as a „best in breed” threat prevention solutions provider. That’s why FireEye was asked to investigate high-profile data breaches at Target , JPMorgan , Sony , and other companies over the past few years. 2. Its core technologies came from an acquisition FireEye was founded in 2004 as a security appliance maker, but it wasn’t considered a major threat prevention player until it acquired Mandiant for $1 billion in 2014. Mandiant was founded by current FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, and used digital forensics and an aggressive „SWAT team” approach to contain data breaches. Mandiant rose to prominence in early 2013 after it published a report which  implicated China in cyber espionage activities. Image source: FireEye. 3. Its founder has left the company FireEye’s founder Ashar Aziz, who has been frequently hailed as  a „technical visionary,” orchestrated the company’s early development of security appliances and oversaw its acquisition of Mandiant. Prior to founding FireEye, Aziz worked at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle ) as an engineer and CTO. That’s why Aziz’s abrupt resignation from FireEye’s board of directors last August stunned investors. FireEye said that Aziz’s departure wasn’t caused by any disagreements with the company, but rather a „desire to spend more time with his family here and abroad, and also to pursue new projects.” 4. Its former CEO loved buyouts In 2012, FireEye hired Dave DeWalt, the former CEO and President of McAfee, as its CEO to prep the company for its IPO. DeWalt had a reputation for orchestrating buyouts — he engineered the sales of Documentum to EMC in 2003, and McAfee to Intel in  2011. Neither company turned out to be a great deal for the buyers — EMC sold Documentum this January, and Intel agreed to sell  a majority stake in McAfee (rebranded as Intel Security) last September. As FireEye dipped below its IPO price in late 2015, many investors speculated that DeWalt would also try to sell the company. However, DeWalt resigned last June and  was replaced by Mandia, which suggests that quick buyouts are now off the table. 5. It turned down several buyout offers Shortly after DeWalt’s departure, reports claimed that several major suitors, including Cisco and Symantec (NASDAQ: SYMC) , had tried to buy FireEye. A Bloomberg report claimed that FireEye had rebuffed the offers because they were lower than its expected buyout price of $30 per share. A Reuters report from earlier this year claimed that FireEye ended buyout talks with Symantec shortly after Mandia took over due to disagreements over the price. That time frame indicates that the talks occurred after Symantec announced the acquisition of BlueCoat for $4.7 billion, but before it agreed to buy LifeLock for $2.3 billion. 6. It’s settling a big class action lawsuit It probably isn’t surprising that FireEye is being sued by its investors. The company was hit by multiple class action lawsuits in 2014 after its secondary offering triggered a steep sell-off. The plaintiffs also allege that FireEye execs made misleading claims about the effectiveness of its threat prevention technologies. The Register recently reported that  FireEye plans to settle these lawsuits for $10.2 million. That would only account for 1.4% of its  projected revenues for the year, but it would also represent the second largest recovery ever achieved in a case argued in a California state court under the Securities Act of 1933. The settlement would also inevitably tarnish FireEye’s reputation. The key takeaways FireEye might look like a tempting contrarian play, but the company is in serious trouble. It isn’t pivoting from appliances to cloud-based services quickly enough to boost its top line growth, and Mandia’s plan to grow margins by laying off employees could dull FireEye’s competitive edge. Several of the facts I discussed in this article support that bearish case and indicate that FireEye might not ever revisit its IPO price again. 10 stocks we like better than FireEye When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Beignet 1.3 was released back in January and it was big for finishing OpenCL 2.0 for Skylake and newer. Beignet 1.3.1 that's out today is just a bug-fix update. Beignet 1.3.1 now allows a single Beignet binary to offer OpenCL 2.0 where available while dropping back to OpenCL 1.2 dynamically for older hardware, only enable OpenCL 2.0 when LLVM 3.9 is used on a x86_64 host, and more. This release also allows OpenCL-OpenGL sharing via the cl_khr_icd. A list of the v1.3.1 changes can be found via the Beignet 1.3 Git branch. Meanwhile on Git master there continues being a lot of work on the backends, cl_intel_media_block_io support, and other changes. There is also a new "newRT" branch that may be work around run-time improvements, but is still in early stages of development. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Sure, it can happen. But when's the last time you had to upgrade your OS to, er, use your OS, because of your processor? Yep, that's a new one, with Microsoft taking the first step towards discouraging the use of AMD and Intel's latest hardware on the company's older platforms of Windows 7 and 8.1. Although reports are mixed as to whether the change is actually live, a new page on Microsoft's support site outlines what users will — eventually — see when they try to download updates on Windows 7 and 8.1, while using a recent processor: Unsupported Hardware Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates. The page goes on to say that Intel's 7th-gen and AMD's Bristol Ridge chips are affected (Kaby Lake and Ryzen respectively), along with the Qualcomm 8996, better known as the Snapdragon 820. So, what's Microsoft's recommended resolution? Buy Windows 10, of course: We recommend that you upgrade Windows 8.1-based and Window 7-based computers to Windows 10 if those computers have a processor that is from any of the following generations... It's not outside the realms of possibility that someone will cook up a workaround, if you want to persist with a pre-Windows 10 platform. If you can't wait, it should be possible to use a program such as WSUS to grab updates manually. [Microsoft] Comments Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 18, 2017, 1:13pm It's not outside the realms of possibility that someone will cook up a workaround, if you want to persist with a pre-Windows 10 platform. If you can't wait, it should be possible to use a program such as WSUS to grab updates manually. The OS isn't going to stop working, you don't need a workaround to keep using older Windows versions. The 'no updates' thing is vague but the underlying reason is that you can't write security updates that make use of modern chipset features for operating systems where the hardware access layer has no knowledge of those features, and rewriting the kernel on older operating systems to introduce it to those features is difficult and quite expensive. General purpose updates may still be available (though Windows 7 is almost EOL now anyway) but security and compatibility updates just won't work - older OS's will still get updates for older chipsets because the HAL was designed for it, but they won't get updates for newer chipsets. From Microsoft's description (which could certainly use more detail), WSUS isn't likely to help as the updates simply won't exist for older versions of the OS. This isn't as big a deal as some people are making it out to be. Modern CPUs will continue to work on older operating systems just fine, the only real difference is they're effectively running in compatibility mode and half their features are unused. It's not unusual for old software (Win7 is eight years old now) to not be compatible with the latest hardware without significant rework and that's what's going on here. Reply 3 skrybe @skrybe Mar 18, 2017, 2:46pm This is the problem I have with what MS are doing; Windows 8.1 falls under the same lifecycle policy as Windows 8, and will reach end of Mainstream Support on January 9, 2018, and end of Extended Support on January 10, 2023. On January 13, Microsoft's mainstream support for Windows 7 Service Pack (SP) 1 ends. Nobody panic. ... "Extended support" -- the period during which Microsoft continues to provide for free security updates for products -- doesn't end until January 14, 2020 for Windows 7 SP1 Now MS might be able to argue for stopping updates on Win 7 since it's mainstream support has ended. Though, it's still got nearly 3 years left for extended support. Windows 8/8.1 on the other hand absolutely should be getting compatibility upgrades to support Intel and AMD CPUs being released this year. If not what is their mainstream support worth? I forgot to add, the worst thing this does is (assuming the keep working) is keep people using Win7/8/8.1 without updating their OS. Meaning more security risks and problems. Because there are absolutely people who will refuse to update to Windows10.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Apple, Google and Facebook Have Backed Away From Fighting Trump’s Latest Travel Ban By Rafia Shaikh Mar 16, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Earlier in February, a number of tech companies had filed a legal brief opposing President Trump’s first executive order on immigration. Apple and Google were among the first to respond to this travel ban. However, these tech giants have now reportedly “backed away” from the legal fight against the second version of this travel ban. Apple, Facebook, Google, and others “skip” fighting the second travel ban “Apple, Google and Facebook are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order,” Reuters reported late last night. Related [Updated: More Join] Apple, Facebook, Google, Uber, and Others File Legal Brief to Oppose President’s Immigration Order While the first amicus brief that was filed to oppose the original executive order had received support from 127 companies, the latest brief filed in the federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed support of only 58 companies. Advertisement Microsoft, Dropbox, Netflix, Twitter, Intel, Kickstarter are some other companies that had supported the original brief but didn’t sign the latest one. However, while Reuters’ report is based on the fact that the above-mentioned companies haven’t signed the “friend-of-the-court” brief yet, they could still do so. For example, Uber was reported to be in the process of adding its name to the brief. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. “We do expect the group to expand.” It should be noted that Google and Apple were among the most outspoken companies who not only signed the original brief but had also donated to the crisis funds. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said it is “painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues”. Cofounder Sergey Brin was also spotted at a march at San Francisco International Airport. Apple CEO Tim Cook had written a letter to his staff, noting that “Apple would not exist without immigration“. Reuters added that while the lawsuit may have lost some big names, it is still likely to succeed. A Hawaiian judge last night ordered an emergency halt to the latest ban, saying that it would cause “irreparable injury” by violating First Amendment protections against religious discrimination. Another judge in Maryland also blocked the latest travel ban, which was due to begin midnight on Thursday. President Trump has called this ruling “unprecedented judicial overreach”. Related Uber CEO Quits President Trump’s Economic Council After Criticism While it is unlikely that Apple, Google or other tech companies are more favorable to the second travel ban considering how heavily they rely on immigrants, none of the companies responded to a Reuters’ query on why they have chosen not to sign the latest brief.

Here is the latest from the annual Mobile World Congress hosted in Barcelona. Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Mar 19, 2017 at 5:21PM In February, over 2,300 companies showed up at Mobile World Congress 2017. The annual event, hosted by the GSM Association (a trade organization for mobile operators), is an opportunity for the wireless and tech community to showcase its best ideas. Here were five of this year's high points. Nokia phones 3.0 Wireless connections have become the driving force behind many of today's biggest innovations. It is ironic, then, that one of the big hits at MWC this year was a dead-but-resuscitated favorite from the past. Image source: Nokia. Nokia (NYSE:NOK), which primarily concerns itself these days with wireless network services, has licensed out its phone business to HMD Global. The start-up phone maker released a revamped 3310 "dumbphone," which was a staple in its early 2000s heyday but went by the wayside when smartphones became a thing. The new 3310 will purportedly have the same near-indestructible build as the original but sport a color screen instead of the original monochrome display. It's a no-frills option the phone maker hopes will find a niche in today's fancy-smartphone market. The Nokia name will also be featured on three affordably priced smartphones the company is trying to market on its own. After Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) failed in revitalizing Nokia phones a few years ago, maybe this time things will be different. 360-degree camera action MWC 2017 also had its fair share of new smartphone previews. One of them, built by the obscure company Protruly of China, was touted as the world's first "virtual reality" phone and has a 360-degree camera built in. How does it work? Two fisheye lenses are built into the top, one mounted to the front and one at the back. Users can preview recordings taken on the phone in sphere-shaped videos and then quickly upload them to sites like YouTube. The phone is not for sale outside China right now, but it presents a unique feature that is worth monitoring for popularity. Samsung battles the Microsoft Surface Image source: Samsung. Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) delayed unveiling its new Galaxy 8 phone. On display instead was a new tablet designed to go toe-to-toe with Microsoft's Surface series. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft's Surface sales increased by $486 million, a 13% increase over the previous year. Samsung would like to take a chunk out of that nearly $4 billion business, and its new Galaxy Book could do that as it sports similar looks and features to the Surface. The devices are still a win for Microsoft, though, as Samsung Books will use Windows 10 as an operating system. Whether it's a Galaxy Book or Surface sale, the popularity of "tablets that replace your laptop" earns Microsoft revenue either way. Technology for blue-collar workers A lot of attention has been given to virtual reality the last few years, but most estimates anticipate augmented reality to be the bigger market. This is because of the possible applications in the workplace, everything from digital workstations to data visualization. Image source: DAQRI. Enter the company DAQRI, which showcased its smart helmet at MWC. The helmet was designed with industrial workers in mind and has the ability to overlay everything from data to thermal vision onto the wearer's view of the real world. The device is powered by an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processor and uses input from multiple sensors, including a basic camera, an infrared camera, and a thermal scale camera. It puts on display Intel's work in the augmented- and merged-reality space, and gives us a glimpse into what future workplaces could look like -- at least workplaces requiring a hard hat. A self-driving race car A company called Roborace showed up with the world's first driverless electric race car. The futuristic machine was built to compete in Formula E, a new all-electric racing circuit started a few years ago, but the company hopes that one day autonomous racing will be a thing. In Robocar, it's all about the tech. Instead of a driver and a pit crew, there is a computer programmed by a team of techies. Roborace is using NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips as the brain powering its vehicles. Image source: Roborace. Car races have a long history of being the testing ground for features we now take for granted while driving. Things like disc brakes, rearview mirrors, and push-button ignition all got their start on the track. Roborace sees its autonomous racers helping develop future autonomous cars for the general public. The information learned can help automakers and tech companies like NVIDIA home in on what works best for cars of the future. Mobile World Congress has developed into more than a show for phones and mobile providers; it's a venue for companies that rely on wireless tech to show off their latest developments. Investors can watch the action to see what's the future might look like.  Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Eurotech’s Intel Atom E3800 “Bay Trail” based CPU-163-15 COM Express Type 10 Mini computer-on-module continues the Amaro, Italy based company’s tradition of offering rugged embedded boards with support for its cloud-based Everyware Software Framework (ESF) IoT platform. Other recent Intel-based COM Express modules from Eurotech include the CPU-161-18, a headless COM Express Type 6 Compact module with a 12-core Xeon-D1500 from the Broadwell generation. Like the CPU-161-18, the CPU-163-15 runs Yocto Project based Linux and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. It also similarly supports Eurotech’s ESF, a commercial, enterprise-ready edition of Eclipse Kura, an open source Java/ OSGi middleware for IoT gateways. CPU-163-15 (click image to enlarge) In the past, Eurotech’s COMs primarily used its proprietary, 100 x 67mm Small Form Factor (SFF) format, such as the similarly Intel Atom E3800 driven Catalyst BT. More recently, however, it has focused more on COM Express. Eurotech gives you a choice of the single-core, 1.46GHz Atom E3815 (5W consumption) or dual-core, 1.75GHz Atom E3827 (8W), both of which are supported with 2GB of soldered, 1066MHz DDR3L-ECC. You can also choose a quad-core, 1.91GHz Atom E3845, which clocks to 1.91GHz. This 10W model ships with 4GB of soldered, 1333MHz DDR3L-ECC. All three models supply 8GB to 32GB of soldered eMMC. The single-core E3815 model supports extended -20 to 70°C temperatures while the dual- and quad-core SKUs can live in the fully industrial -40 to 85°C range. All other features are consistent across the board. The product page formatting suggests the quad-core model lacks the dual SATA 2.0 ports, but the datasheet identifies the interface is available for all three SKUs. The CPU-163-15 offers a GbE controller with integrated transceiver, as well as a USB 3.0 interface and 8x USB 2.0 (4x native, 4x via USB HSIC). You get a DDI interface with support for up to 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz using HDMI or DVI, and up to 2560 x 1600 @ 60Hz for DisplayPort. There’s also an 18/24-bit, single-channel LVDS connection for up to 1366 x 768 @ 60Hz. The module is further equipped with dual serial interfaces, 8-bit DIO, HD audio, and I2C. Expansion buses include LPC, SMBus, and 3x PCIe x1. There’s a watchdog and support for RTC, as well as a factory option for TPM. The module supports 4.75V to 20V input in ATX or AT modes. Eurotech provides customization services including BIOS personalization, carrier board design, system development, and production.   Further information The CPU-163-15 is available now at an undisclosed price. More information may be found on Eurotech’s CPU-163-15 product page. At Embedded World this week, Eurotech is showcasing both the CPU-163-15 and its recent, Xeon-D based CPU-161-18. It also announced the development of a new i.MX6-based Pico-ITX SBC, which is due by the end of Q3 2017.   Related posts: Rugged module runs Yocto Linux on up to 12-core Xeon-D Atom-based gateway taps new open source IoT cloud platform Kura-based Linux IoT framework adds multi-cloud support ARM Linux IoT gateway offers cloud services support ARM-based IoT gateway kit includes PLC and demo board Wireless-enabled i.MX6 SBC offers remote IoT management Tiny COM Express module runs Linux on quad-core Atom Tiny μQseven module aims Bay Trail Atoms at IoT Tiny COM features Apollo Lake and soldered RAM Tough, expandable Bay Trail SBC measures just 95 x 55mm (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Freedman | March 15, 2017 MORE $799.99 Editors' rating: The Pros Responsive keyboard; Strong speakers; Above-average battery life The Cons Bland display; Tons of bloatware; Few good storage options Verdict The Acer Aspire VX 15 is a solid budget gaming laptop, but it suffers from a poor screen and too little storage. Review Yes, it's true: For less than $1,000, you can play your favorite games at 1080p. The Acer Aspire VX 15 (reviewed at its starting price of $799.99) is a budget gaming laptop with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU and a Core i5-7300HQ CPU. This attractive, 15-inch gaming rig also features a snappy keyboard, good audio output and strong performance for the money, but to get it at this price, you have to compromise on screen quality and internal storage. article continued below Design Though I usually find the red-and-black color scheme on gaming laptops to be a bit of a clich&#233;, the Aspire VX 15's look is subtle enough that I find it handsome. The lid is made of black plastic with a faux-brushed-aluminum pattern, and features Acer's logo in silver and two red stripes. The silver hinge reads "Aspire VX" and is flanked by two red vents that would look at home on a Transformer. When I lifted the lid, I found the 15.6-inch, 1080p display; an island-style keyboard complete with a number pad; and the touchpad. There are a few more red trimmings here, including on the A, S, D and W keys as well as the touchpad's border. At 15.3 x 10.5 x 1.1 inches and 5.4 pounds, the Aspire VX 15 is slightly larger than competitors but also a little bit lighter. The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 is 15.2 x 10.8 x 1 inches and 5.8 pounds, and the Asus ROG Strix GL553VD is 15.1 x 10 x 1.2 inches and 5.6 pounds. On the left side of the laptop, you'll find a lock slot, a USB 2.0 port, an SD card reader and a combination headphone/microphone jack. On the right are a USB Type-C 3.1 port, a pair of USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI output port and an Ethernet jack. MORE: A Guide to Computer Ports and Adapters Display The VX 15's 15.6-inch, 1080p screen is sharp, but its colors are bland and lifeless. When I watched the latest trailer for Wonder Woman, the skies and seas of Themyscira did not appear as two distinct, vivid shades of blue, but rather one pale shade of cyan. While the green grass that Diana tramples as she trains is sharp (you can see the individual blades), it didn't look rich and full of life. When I stormed a beach in Battlefield 1, the craggy rocks were sharp, and I could see the sparks emanating from fires and pistols, but the scene was slightly darker than it should have been. The Aspire's panel reproduces just 65 percent of the sRGB color gamut, falling far behind the 96-percent sRGB average. That's a worse range than on the Inspiron's dull display (67 percent), but the Strix was far superior (122 percent). The screen's colors are not accurate, either. The Aspire got a Delta-E score of 6.8 in our testing (0 is ideal). While the Inspiron was much less precise (12), the Aspire scored much worse than  the category average (2.4) and the Strix (1.6). To top it all off, the Aspire's screen is relatively dim, measuring just 247 nits on our light meter. That's lower than the average (271 nits), the Inspiron (253 nits) and the Strix (269 nits). Keyboard and Touchpad The VX 15's keyboard is responsive and comfortable. With its 1.6 millimeters of travel and 65 grams of force required to press the keys, I found that the backlit keys (just red, no RGB here) struck a solid balance that made sure I rarely bottomed out. I reached 115 words per minute (the high end of my average range) on the 10fastfingers.com typing test with my usual error rate of 2 percent. The 4.1 x 3-inch touchpad is smooth and responsive, and it works with Windows 10's precision gestures. Besides pinching-to-zoom and two-finger scrolling, I switched between apps with three finger side swipes and opened the Action Center with a four-finger tap. Audio When I listened to White Rabbits' "Percussion Gun" on the VX 15, the drummers practically reached out and punched me in the face. The speakers are surprisingly powerful and well-balanced. The song's namesake percussion is loud and strong, while the vocals, keys and rhythmic hand claps were equally clear and loud. It easily filled our small conference room with sound. The drums on White Rabbits' 'Percussion Gun' practically reached out and punched me in the face. When I played Battlefield 1, I could clearly hear the thud of cannonballs landing on a sandy beach as my fellow soldiers shouted over the chaos. Despite all of that, I could still make out the orchestrated music in the background. Gaming, Graphics and VR The Aspire rocks an Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU with 4GB of VRAM, which is enough to play your favorite games at 1080p, although not on the highest settings (and definitely not in VR). I fired up Battlefield 1 and stormed the beaches of Gallipoli at high settings between 33 and 43 frames per second. When I moved the settings down to medium, I reached a more consistent 57 to 60 fps. On our budget gaming test, in which we run Rise of the Tomb Raider at high settings with SMAA anti-aliasing at 1080p, the Aspire reached 43 fps, surpassing the Strix and the mainstream notebook average (both 38 fps). But when we ran our regular Rise of the Tomb Raider test, the Aspire choked at an unplayable 16 fps. The Inspiron (22 fps) and the Strix (18 fps) weren't much better. The average is 32 fps, though that includes laptops with stronger GPUs. (Both the Strix and the Inspiron also have Nvidia GTX 1050 GPUs.) Performance Armed with a 2.5-GHz Intel Core i5-7300HQ CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive, the Aspire VX 15 is no slouch when it comes to performance. I had 40 tabs open in Google Chrome, including one streaming an episode of Last Week Tonight, at 1080p on YouTube, and I didn't experience any lag at all. However, the Aspire earned a score of 7,898 on the Geekbench 4 overall performance test, falling far below the mainstream notebook average (11,235), the Inspiron (10,363, Core i5-7300HQ) and the Strix (12,253, Core i7-7700HQ). The Aspire took 49 seconds to copy 4.97GB of mixed media files, which is faster than the average (1:10) and the Strix (0:54). The Inspiron 15 was one second faster (0:48). It took the Aspire 3 hours and 39 seconds to pair 20,000 names and addresses in our OpenOffice Spreadsheet macro test. Both the Inspiron (3:37) and the Strix (3:31) were a hair faster, but all three were speedier than the category average (4:15). Battery Life For a gaming notebook, the Aspire VX 15 has solid endurance. It lasted 7 hours and 8 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi.  MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life The category average is a slightly lower 6:59. The Strix fell far short (3:41), but the Inspiron had far better endurance (11:23). Heat During regular use, the Aspire stayed nice and cool in our testing. After streaming HD video from YouTube for 15 minutes, the Aspire measured 94 degrees Fahrenheit on the bottom, 88 degrees between the G and H keys, and 79 degrees on the touchpad. But when I booted up Battlefield 1, the computer heated up. As I battled to take the beaches of Gallipoli, the bottom climbed to 111 degrees and the center of the keyboard reached 105.5 degrees, but the touchpad stayed cool, at 81.5 degrees. Webcam The 720p webcam on the Aspire VX 15 is pretty standard for a laptop camera. In a photo I shot at my desk, I appeared slightly blurry, and my beard looked like it had been  drawn on with a Sharpie. But you could make out all of my facial features, and the gray stripes on my black shirt were clear enough. You should get an external webcam for Twitch streaming, but this is good enough for Skyping with your pals. Software and Warranty The Aspire VX 15 is jam-packed with software, and although a few of them are useful utilities from Acer, the rest is junk you'll want to delete ASAP. Acer's apps include abFiles and abPhotos to access your content from any connected device, as well as Quick Access to turn on features such as Bluelight Shield and Color Intelligence. There's also a ton of bloat, including eBay, Priceline, Netflix, Kindle, the Acer collection (links to download more partner software), WildTangent games and Dashlane. Even Firefox is preinstalled. That's on top of the usual crap that comes with Windows 10, including Candy Crush Soda Saga, Facebook, Twitter and Royal Revolt 2. Acer sells the Aspire VX 15 with a one-year warranty. See how the company performed on our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands ranking. Configurations Our $800 review configuration of the Acer Aspire VX 15 came with a 2.5-GHz Intel Core i5-7300HQ CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU with 4GB of VRAM. It's hard to recommend this particular configuration because of its limited storage space. That 256GB SSD will be filled after installing just a handful of games. Gamers who buy any model with only an SSD can open it up and add a 2.5-inch HDD, but they'll have to buy that drive separately. Additionally, they will also need to fill out an online form for a complimentary mounting kit, which comes with a 2.5-inch bracket, a SATA cable and eight screws, so there's some assembly required. For $1,000, you can get a version with an intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and the GTX 1050. This has the same storage limitations as our review model. There are two options at $1,050. The first is the same as the $1,000 model, except it swaps out the GTX 1050 for the more powerful GTX 1050 Ti. You'll get better graphics but will still have limited storage. The other option at this price uses the regular GTX 1050 and includes a 1TB HDD. It's not as fast as an SSD, but you'll be able to install far more games straight out of the box. Bottom Line The Acer Aspire VX 15 is a solid budget gaming notebook despite its rock-bottom price of $800, but the corners it cut to get to that price are quite annoying. The screen is dull, and there's just not enough room to hold a lot of games until you get to a more expensive configuration (unless you send away for a mounting kit and buy another drive). However, it lasts long for a gaming notebook, has a comfortable keyboard and even looks spiffy. If you have more money to spend, consider the $1,099 Asus ROG Strix GL553VD, which has a superior screen and better storage options, and starts with a faster processor, although the speakers and battery life aren't as good. The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 also starts at $799, lasts much longer on a charge and has more configuration options, but its screen is even blander than the Aspire's. Overall, the Aspire VX 15 is a strong choice if you need a gaming rig and can't afford to spend more than $1,000.

WD made the fundamental leap in 2015 with the announcement that they would purchase flash memory giant Sandisk. This transformed WD into a storage powerhouse with a product portfolio able to compete with anyone in the market. Here for review we have one of the fruits of the new Western Digital: the WD Blue 1Tb SSD. Rather than go all out and instantly try to compete with performance oriented NVMe drives like the Samsung 950/960 Pro series or Intel 750, WD instead went with the more value oriented SATA interface, aiming to offer a value drive in 250Gb, 500Gb and 1Tb capacities that will be equally at home in modest consumer systems, laptop upgrades or as a HDD replacing storage solution for enthusiasts. WD’s drive line up follows the same recognizable segmentation as their HDD range, denoted by their Green, Blue, Black etc product branding.   Specifications Here are the specifications straight from WD. While the drive we have on hand is the 2.5″ variety, there are also M.2 versions available in the 2280 form factor. As is typical with SSD, the larger capacity drives have slightly higher performance levels that are typically bottlenecked by the SATA interface in all but the cheapest 2017 era SSD’s. The warranty is 3 years (limited) which is probably a little lower than we’d like given the very good endurance rating. A Closer Look There’s not much to talk about regarding the box.   The box contains the drive itself in a plastic shell. There is nothing else included.     SSD’s are hardly the most attractive PC parts. We appreciate SSD’s more for their beautiful performance instead of their aesthetics. Now that we think about it.. will we ever see RGB SSD’s? It’s only a matter of time since we all know RGB makes things go faster…. On the rear we have all the model information as well as regulatory approvals.       Here is the PCB of the WD 1Tb Blue SSD.   The single sided PCB is cooled by this metal lid with a thermal pad that makes contact with all the key components.   A Marvell 88SS1074 controller powers the WD Blue SSD. This is an off the shelf controller used by many vendors in their value SSD ranges. It supports a wide rand of NAND packages. One of the key features is support for a deep sleep mode which reduces idle power into the low mW range. This is a useful feature for laptops and battery life.   The cache is made up of two of these Micron 512Mb DDR3 DRAM chips.   There are a total of 8 128Gb TLC NAND packages populating the PCB. This gives a total of 1024Gb, meaning there is a 24Gb of reserve area Interestingly, WD rates the 1Tb Blue SSD as having a 400 TBW (terabytes written)  endurance rating. This is a very competitive rating and means the WD drive should be well suited to heavy workloads and a theoretical long lifetime.   Test Setup and Benchmarks     Anvil is a great SSD test because it tests not only transfer performance, but adds IOPS and access times too. The overall score puts it in the middle of the pack as far as TLC results go.   AS-SSD performance is about right where we’d expect it to be for a modern TLC NAND SSD, thought he 4K read and write is a little lower than we’d like it to be, this isn’t a problem ans the overall score is still 1177 which only the top drives like the Samsung 850 Pro series beat.   ATTO Disk Benchmark a old benchmark and shows the drives peak performance specifications. Here we see the drive max out the SATA bus which is typical for modern SATA SSD’s   CrystalDiskMark shows similar maximum SATA speed in the sequential reading with 553MB/s read and 525MB/s write.  We are impressed with the 4K read and write results . Though we are not focusing on comparisons here due to only having smaller (and generally lesser performing) drives on hand, we will say that the 4K read results is the fastest we have tested.   Conclusion Performance wise, the 1Tb WD Blue SSD performed well though unspectacular. SATA SSD’s are quickly losing ground to NVMe drives as the preferred choice for a OS drive.  Of course WD also cater to the NVMe market and we’d definitely like to get one of their Black SSD’s to test out. As it stands, the WD Blue SSD provides solid, though unspectacular performance in a highly competitive space. This makes value a significant weighting in our recommendation. At the time of writing, Newegg is selling the WD Blue 1tb for just $260, making it one of the cheapest 2.5″ 1Tb SSD’s available. If you can find the WD Blue SSD on sale or discounted, then it’s a no brainer. The drive’s 3 year warranty is not exceptional, though with a 1.75M hour mean time before failure, we hope that the drive will last a few hundred years before needing to worry about it! An endurance rating of 400 Terabyte writes is also very strong and should inspire confidence in the longevity of the drive. If you need the capacity in a notebook, you will be well served by the performance/price ratio as well as the low power usage. We can also see this drive being a very good choice for something like a Steam game library in conjunction with a small capacity NVMe drive as the primary C drive. Though using a SSD a a storage drive is not the most economical route, it sure is a fast and quiet one and one that many enthusiasts would be happy to use it for. With the price dropping steadily, it is now one of the best value drives available and we have no hesitation in recommending the WD Blue 1TB SSD.     Leave a comment SCAN THIS QR CODE WITH YOUR PHONE Close Next Post To keep up with demand, Nintendo is doubling production of the Switch Tags © 1999 - 2016 VR Zone AP Pte.

Answer from Aaron Yip, software engineer: With the turn of the 1900s, Germany was perfectly poised to become the greatest superpower in written history, one of the most industrialized nations at the time (next to UK and Argentina) paired with the biggest military for the following 50 years. Trending: Pep Guardiola’s Bizarre Claim After Liverpool Draw The German empire and territories would soon give birth to an overwhelming portion of future Nobel Laureates and many of the greatest minds of the 20th century including Max Born, Hans Bethe, Alexander Grothendieck, Bernard Katz, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Walter Kohn, Hans Adolf Krebs, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, and Albert Einstein. All of these people would be forced to flee the German empire. Where did they go? Well… The United States is universally renowned for its universities and industry giants today like Apple, Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox and Uber; as well as Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM all the way to Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, United States Steel, Ford, and General Electric. Albert Einstein, fleeing Germany, would find refuge at Princeton and change the world forever in many ways. On the eve of World War II, he penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which would establish the Manhattan Project. There, future Nobel Laureates Hans Bethe and Enrico Fermi, refugees from Italy, ran the labs that invented the atomic bomb to end WW2 for the United States.

In his biography, answering why he choose to move to the U.S., Musk says, "The United States is definitely ahead in culture of innovation. If someone wants to accomplish great things, there is no better place than the U.S.” This is absolutely correct. But let us imagine a slightly different world.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Mar 20, 2017 - Page 15　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Israeli tech firms revved up about driverless cars ‘START-UP NATION’:Israel has long touted its high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, often powered by veterans of murky technology units in the military AP, JERUSALEM As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel Corp’s more than US$15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye NV last week. Israel is now home to hundreds of start-ups that provide everything from censors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. The Israeli “smart” transportation sector has attracted about US$4 billion in investment over the past four years, about half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze Inc, said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. During that time, the number of Israeli start-ups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to more than 500. Virtually every major automaker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the nation regularly. General Motors Co has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault SA and Daimler AG are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Subaru, BMW AG, Mazda Motor Corp, Hyundai Motor Co, Volvo Car Corp and Audi AG are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract more than 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, Zeno-Zamansky said. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Economy said. Israel has long billed itself as a “start-up nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the automotive field, Granoff said. However, there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies are not certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle local traffic customs. Also, no one knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or if humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising are otonomo, which allows automakers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital partner Levy Raiz said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries such as cybersecurity and medical devices. However, he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector, but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2833 times.

Also in the news was the embarrassing comportment of the U.S. executive in chief when he met with the German head of state. Academia was on the hot seat, with accusations of sucking up to right-wing climate change deniers, and autonomous driving was all the talk, with Intel and MobilEye coming to terms on a new merger. Here are those stories and more in our Gas2 Week in Review. Electric Car Road Trip Causes Angst For Chevy Bolt Owner On a recent 800 mile road trip, Chevy Bolt owner, Dawn Hall spent more hours on the road and more expenses on electricity than she would have spent for gasoline for the same trip in a conventional car. The culprits? Difficulty in finding and connecting to chargers, plus some associated parking charges. Hall’s regular commute is about 100 miles, with occasional family visits often adding another 60 miles to her daily mileage total. Charging her electric vehicle overnight generally takes care of all those daily electric vehicle needs. But in one recent trip, Hall had to reroute to available charging stations and open an EVgo account because her ChargePoint membership didn’t offer charging stations where she needed them. Cities Dangle $10 Billion EV Order In Front Of Automakers If the U.S. government is backing away from alternative transportation incentives, many states are not. Thirty U.S. cities have announced that they will purchase full or partial electric vehicles totalling $10 billion— if automakers will provide increase production to meet the state demands for electric vehicles. “If you build it, we will buy it,” says Chris Bast, Seattle’s climate and transportation policy adviser. The electric vehicle offer from the cities comprises automobiles, light duty trucks, street sweepers, trash haulers, and fire trucks, totaling 114,000 electric or hybrid vehicles. That’s more than 70% of all electric vehicles sold last year. Angela Merkel, Three German CEOs Met With Trump On Friday. It Wasn’t Pretty President Donald Trump refused to shake hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a press ceremony, even after a reporter prodded him to do so. The first joint appearance for the U.S. and German leaders took place on March 17 and included CEOs of three major German corporations. Topics on the table included a proposed 35% tax on cars BMW plans to build at a new factory in Mexico. Recently, a senior U.S. administration official huffed that Germany is benefiting unfairly from a weak Euro. “The accusations of President Donald Trump and his advisers are plucked out of thin air,” the president of Germany’s VDMA engineering industry association, Carl Martin Welcker, said in a statement on Monday. Climate Change Studies By Academia Paid For By Fossil Fuel Industry Many of the U.S. top universities are little more than shills for fossil fuel companies, and the white papers they release about climate change incorporate one-dimensional literature reviews that favor climate denial. According to a newly released report, energy companies are using a model developed by the tobacco industry to flood academia with enormous amounts of money to fund energy and climate change research, so much so that impartiality has been lost. The authors say the problem is endemic throughout academia. MIT’s chairman told the Boston Globe, “I don’t see a conflict.” Intel Buys MobilEye For $15.3 Billion At at time in which computers and cars are in convergence mode, Intel has agreed to purchase Israel-based MobilEye for $15.3 billion. MobilEye was deeply involved with the development of the original all-electric Tesla Autopilot until a driver death while using the technology in his electric vehicle caused the Tesla/ MobilEye relationship to collapse. The Intel/ MobilEye transaction is expected to close in about nine months. Until recently, MobilEye has relied on chips manufactured by European chip maker STMicroelectronics but intends to use Intel’s fifth generation chips in the autonomous driving system it is developing for BMW.

The retailer now has Dell's latest available in two different configurations starting at $1,599. The first model, priced at $1,599, packs Intel's 7th-generation Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage. The other doubles the RAM and storage while also upgrading the processor to a Core i7 chip for $1,999. Otherwise, the two are the same with a 15.6-inch 4K display and NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics. And if security is at the top of your list of wants, these models both sport a built-in fingerprint reader — an option that we haven't always seen at other retailers.

TrendsViral Trump took the lightning round quiz as he appeared on the Fox News show Watters World, which aired Saturday night. Host Jesse Watters put a number of famous names to the president, asking him to give his personal opinion on the well known figures ranging from politicians to news channel chiefs. READ MORE: ‘No evidence’ yet of Trump campaign contacts with Russia – House Intel Committee Chair  Trump, whose alleged relationship with the Russian president has come under major public scrutiny, said he didn’t know Putin, “but certainly he is a tough cookie.” “I don’t know how he’s doing for Russia, we’re going to find out one day I guess,” the US leader added. Trump, as usual, didn’t mince words when it came to describing those who don’t quite see eye to eye with him. The first word that came to his mind when asked about his former rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, was simply “disappointed.” VIDEO: #Clinton comeback? Hillary declares she’s ‘ready to come out of the #woods’ https://t.co/sMoIwmygR3pic.twitter.com/15Kkbfe017— RT (@RT_com) March 18, 2017 However, he had a lot more to say when asked about a possible future rival, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been very vocal in her criticism of Trump. “I think she’d lose so badly,” he said, adding that it would be a dream come true if she ran against him. He also blamed her “anger” for damaging Clinton’s presidential chances, and made reference to the Native American figure Pocahontas. “Pocahontas would not be proud of [Warren] as her representative, believe me.” Trump repeatedly used the name as a dismissive moniker for Warren in reference to her claim of Native American ancestry Rapper Snoop Dogg also came under the president’s fire for a music video he produced, depicting himself pointing a toy gun at the head of a Trump-like clown character. Trump said it was a terrible thing to do to any president or person, describing it as a publicity stunt from someone whose “career is failing.” Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama?

The research, conducted by Dr. Sigal Ribon of the Bank of Israel Research Department, examines the effect of the Bank of Israel’s intervention in the foreign exchange market on the exchange rate in that period. The Bank of Israel has been trying to curb the rise of the shekel, which is trading near its highest level since 2014 and hurting exporters whose sales in foreign markets account for about a third of gross domestic product. Its rally is also due to incoming currency as foreign firms acquire local companies, such as the recent acquisition of Mobileye by Intel Corp., and to the impact of natural gas production, which lowers the need for imported energy resources. After about a decade of not intervening in the foreign exchange market, the Bank of Israel resumed the practice in March 2008. In the beginning, the intervention came at predetermined amounts — purchases of $25 million per day, and then $100 million per day. In August 2009, the Bank changed its policy and switched to intervening at its discretion, at amounts that were not set in advance, the report said. The results of the research, which examines whether the interventions in the market contributed to a depreciation in the exchange rate, or a slowdown in the rate of appreciation, indicate that from September 2009 through the end of 2015, every $100 million purchased by the central bank contributed, all else being equal, to deprecation of 0.07–0.09 percent in the exchange rate. The average monthly scope of purchases during that period — 830 million — was found to have an impact of 0.6 percent on the exchange rate during that month. The research also shows that both the interventions themselves as well as the overall monetary policy, which created intervention expectations, had an effect on the currency. “The intervention’s impact derives as well from the signaling — by the intervention itself — regarding the Bank’s overall monetary policy, and not just from the direct effect of the intervention on the asset market,” the research showed. The research found that the central bank intervenes in the market “when it assesses that the real exchange rate is deviating (overvalued) relative to the long-term equilibrium exchange rate,” the report said. The level of foreign exchange reserves relative to GDP was also found to have an impact on the intervention — the lower the level, the greater the intervention. It was found as well that growth of exports tends to reduce the intervention. Also, the research found that to the extent that 1-year inflation expectations are lower, the Bank will tend to intervene more. That is, intervention in the foreign exchange market also serves as a tool to support the attaining of the inflation target, the report said. The central bank has come under pressure recently by critics who say that its intervention policy has not managed to keep the shekel’s rise in check. In January, in an interview with Bloomberg News, Barry Topf, a former director of market operations at the Bank of Israel who helped design the central bank’s foreign currency intervention program, said the dollar purchases that initially helped Israel weather the global financial crisis may now be hurting the economy by distorting prices. Topf suggested the Bank of Israel should scale back the program significantly, after the country tripled its foreign exchange reserves in less than a decade. The central bank cut the benchmark interest rate to a record low 0.1 percent in 2015 in an effort to boost inflation and rein in the currency, and held it at that level also last month. In February, Flug hinted the Bank of Israel would continue intervening in the market, when necessary, by buying dollars to keep the shekel in check.

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 19, 2017 at 7:38AM Looking for a little income and growth for your portfolio? Consider buying shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA might seem like an odd choice for an investor seeking income, but what gets overlooked with this hot tech stock is the willingness of management to reward shareholders with dividends and share repurchases. NVIDIA Gaming has been good to the graphics specialist. In 2016, NVIDIA raked in $4.06 billion in revenue, an increase of 44% over 2015 as the upgrade cycle to the latest high-end graphics processors got under way. Continued advances in gaming technology, higher-resolution displays, and the emergence of eSports provide nice tailwinds for demand over time. Volvo XC90 SUV powered by NVIDIA DRIVE technology. IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIA INC.  In addition, NVIDIA has other promising growth opportunities emerging with the growing adoption of its high-end GPU technology by other industries for deep learning, artificial intelligence, and self-driving vehicle applications. The combined revenue from its Datacenter and Automotive segment could be the company's biggest business in the not-too-distant future. In 2016, NVIDIA generated $830 million in revenue from its Datacenter segment, an increase of 145% over 2015, while the Automotive segment grew 52% to $487 million in revenue. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang expects the next phase of growth in datacenter to come from several industries, including healthcare, retail, transportation, and life sciences, among others. Here's what he said on a recent earnings conference call: The first adopters were hyperscale companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google, which use deep learning to provide billions to customers with AI services that utilizes image recognition and voice processing. The next area of growth will occur as enterprise in such fields as healthcare, retail, transportation and finance embrace deep learning on GPUs. NVIDIA's technology is essentially affecting every area of the economy, so how do you value a company like that? The best way to evaluate the investment merits of a high-PE, high-growth business is to consider the market opportunity relative to the company's market capitalization. Intel believes the self-driving car market will be worth $70 billion by 2030 and could reach $100 billion. Compare that amount to the less than $500 million NVIDIA generated last year within its Automotive segment, and it's easy to understand the huge opportunity here -- and why NVIDIA's stock has rocketed to the stratosphere. NVDA data by YCharts. While NVIDIA's multibillion-dollar growth opportunities get all of the headlines, the vision and business skills of its management team, led by CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, get overlooked. Jen-Hsun Huang is the founder of the company and the reason the company is where it is today. He's also been a very shareholder-friendly leader willing to reward shareholders with the company's excess cash flow, something you don't see very often with relatively small companies in technology. The company has consistently paid out a growing dividend since it was initiated in 2012. Over the last three fiscal years, NVIDIA has distributed 83% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It's a good signal from management that they expect the company to continue growing in the future. NVIDIA currently offers a dividend yield of 0.5%; however, the quarterly dividend has nearly doubled over the last four years. As the business continues to grow and generate more cash from operations, the dividend could double again in the next five years, which would put the dividend yield then at 1% on today's share price. Apple Apple has built a sticky ecosystem with its lineup of iPhone, iPad, and Mac. IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.  The Apple logo is as recognizable as The Coca-Cola Co logo, Nike's swoosh, or the golden arches. Once you own at least two Apple devices, it's very likely you are hooked for life. Over the last four quarters, Apple generated $218 billion in total revenue and $45 billion in profits. The key driver of Apple's growth is iPhone sales, which made up 69% of total revenue in the first fiscal quarter of 2017. The most important thing for investors to know about is Apple's huge financial advantage over its competitors. Apple earned every penny of the smartphone industry's profits in 2016 while commanding less than 20% market share of unit sales. Absorbing all of the profits among smartphone makers gives Apple an enormous competitive advantage to reinvest in more advanced features, digital content, and other services, making the Apple ecosystem even stronger over time.  As Apple sells more devices, it should boost services revenue from iTunes, Apps, Apple Music subscriptions, and other digital content over time. Services revenue has been Apple's fastest-growing segment recently. In the holiday quarter, Services grew 18% year over year to $7.1 billion, bringing the trailing-12-month amount to over $25 billion. Apple generates robust cash flows, and the cash has been piling up on the balance sheet in recent years. At the end of December 2016, Apple had about $46 per share in cash and marketable securities. This is 33% of the current stock price. The cash-rich balance sheet gives management a lot of flexibility not only in running the business, but in how it chooses to reward shareholders. Apple has paid a steadily increasing dividend for about five years, as well as regular share repurchases to reduce the share count and boost earnings-per-share growth. The share buybacks have also been very timely thanks to the conservative valuation on the stock in recent years. Analysts expect earnings to grow about 9% annually over the next five years, and investors are not paying much for future growth, with the stock currently sitting at 17 times earnings. The stock's dividend yield is currently 1.6%. Even after the stock's recent 30% to 40% increase, it still looks attractive. Investors may not hit a home run with Apple given its nearly $1 trillion market value, but the business has a brand customers love, and it generates a lot of cash, and this should leave shareholders with a decent return over time.

The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in an interview on Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said later at a press conference. Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple Inc. entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operation systems in smartphones and watches. Hayek’s strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel. Hours after Swatch’s announcement, Richemont said it plans its first smartwatch, the Montblanc Summit, which will sell for $890 and up starting in May, using Android 2.0 technology. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch’s approach will work better because it’s trying to “think small” as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. “There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system,” the CEO said. “I’m not convinced,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who follows the luxury industry. “People use smartwatches expecting to use the same apps they have on their mobiles. A proprietary operating system defeats the object.” Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialized in miniaturization, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don’t want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to Francois Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather and helping the wearer find lost keys. Swatch also forecast a rebound in US and European markets as it published its annual report on Thursday. Hayek said revenue may increase about 7 per cent to 9 per cent this year. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

TAG Heuer on Tuesday unveiled the new generation of a $1,650 smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the $890 Summit. Also on Thursday, Swatch Group Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc., and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” $15,000 watches Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15,000. The original version of the Apple Watch starts at $269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP. So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represents a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honored watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, which is Swiss-made, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google, Apple Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and in February Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Models from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a previous forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 per cent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 per cent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch this week forecast a rebound in US and European markets after previously reporting improvement in Asia and the Mideast. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got slightly less than than 10 per cent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity by launching too many smartwatches,” Guy said. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

It’s not unlikely, then, for an entrepreneur to crave more. In this aspect, the world is their oyster. But how do you choose a city with the right conditions that will provide ample opportunities for success? Fear not! We’ve scoured the ends of the Earth for the perfect spots to call home for your business. This isn’t your traditional one to 10 scale of definitive criteria, but mixes the expected with the soul of a go-getter. Whether you’re a nomadic at heart or crave a tight-knit community, here are 13 amazing locales every entrepreneur should consider expanding to. Amsterdam, the Netherlands Amsterdam boasts a thriving business ecosystem – with a stable business climate and diverse talent pool. Amsterdam enjoys a strong competitive position as a location for foreign companies and startups. The city is connected to the rest of Europe and the world – not only by an extensive transport network and the world’s largest internet hub, but also by the city’s collaborative approach to doing business including initiatives such as StartupAmsterdam, StartupDelta, as well as Business in Amsterdam – a comprehensive resource for doing business in area. The city is also home to one of Europe’s leading tech festivals. Additionally, there are various incentives for international employees and entrepreneurs. Highly skilled migrants enjoy a major fiscal benefit in the 30 percent tax ruling. The strategic location, an appeal to international talent, and excellent physical and digital accessibility makes Amsterdam an attractive place for European expansion.  Austin, Texas While you’d expect to see cities such as San Francisco and New York represented on this list, status should be more than a mere zip code. Texas payrolls and labor participation rate have been increasing at a healthy rate in Texas, unlike the national level where these numbers have shrunk to their lowest rate since the 1970s.  Texas business tax – called franchise tax – is very cut and dry. The state taxes most businesses at a rate of one percent on their taxable margins. This tax rate ranks very low nationally, making the state a popular place for businesses of all sizes. As a progressive and fiercely entrepreneurial city – boasting a talent pool that’s highly educated and growing – Austin, Texas is a great place for businesses to call home. Ranking second in the country, Austin’s gross metropolitan product grew 18.2 percent from 2011 to 2014. Many global conglomerates have operations in the Central Texas area including Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Google, Facebook, Cisco Systems, Intel, and Oracle.  Tech companies in Austin actually account for a large amount of all tech-related revenue in Texas – second only to the DFW area. In fact, the Texas capital was recently named number one place in America to start a business. Bali, Indonesia For the nomadic businessman or woman, Bali offers a never-ending stream of inspiration. One of the attractions for startups and other companies working in Bali is, obviously, the cost of living is cheaper than elsewhere on this list. The average cost living – including food, living, office, social and entertainment costs ­­– is under $1,100 per month. Bali attracts an abundance of local and international talent thanks to its digital nomad culture. As such, the tropical paradise has developed an abundance of co-working spaces. Things have been set in motion, allowing entrepreneurship to flourish in Bali. Part of a growing ecosystem, the great thing about starting a business in Bali is that you don’t need a significant amount of capital. With the cost of living fairly cheap, you can keep operational costs low. That said, Indonesia has quite a bit of regulation, meaning several different types of permits are needed for local businesses. And Bali’s resident tax payers are subject to taxes based on international income, though Indonesia does have a double taxation treaty with over 57 other countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, and the US. Berlin, Germany Though the largest population, market, and economy in the EU, businesses shouldn’t shy away from the many offerings Germany presents. In fact, entrepreneurs are increasingly drawn to Berlin’s creative and open-minded ethos. The German government is very open to the establishment of all types of businesses – regardless of whether or not it involves a German or a foreigner. As such, companies can easily employ international workers, as local visas aren’t difficult to acquire. Berlin boasts the highest concentration of researchers and academics in Germany (per capita). Coupled with the city’s declining unemployment rates means an available and able workforce for new companies. Additionally, businesses based in Berlin rub shoulders with innovation centers of more-established tech competitors such as Microsoft, German software giant SAP SE, and networking pioneer Cisco System. Overall, Berlin is a fully developed hub for creativity and entrepreneurship with the talent to boot. Dublin, Ireland Ireland prides itself for having a competitive corporate tax rate – 12.5 percent to be exact – particularly when compared to many other EU capitals. Additionally, because the country taxes on a strictly territorial basis, companies that expand here pay only the local rate on whatever profits are generated in foreign subsidiaries. This alone is extremely attractive to foreign investment. Ireland has the youngest population in the European Union, with an average age of 34 years. For those thinking of long-term investment, this is a great asset for employers. Dublin is alive with tech companies. It’s docklands, dubbed Silicon Docks, plays host to the large tech giants such as Google and Facebook but also to a number indigenous startups. The area has become one of the most prosperous of the country, and makes Dublin a good choice for global expansion. A young and educated workforce means the business culture in that country is actively seeking new technology. Additionally, labor and real estate is less expensive in Dublin than most other European cities its size… though labor costs throughout Ireland are expected to rise. Hong Kong One of the world’s leading financial centers, the ‘Pearl of the Orient’ enjoys a supportive government along with a plethora of startup organizations, VCs, and angels. Setting up a company in Hong Kong is fast, easy and inexpensive. The pseudo-independent country operates a low and simple tax system where corporate tax is maximum 16.5 percent, and personal income tax 15 percent. Sales tax, no Withholding tax, and no tax on capital gains, dividends or an individual’s estate. In addition to a favorable corporate tax rate, Hong Kong-based companies promote easy access to Shenzhen and Guangzhou – two of Mainland China’s most prosperous and sophisticated manufacturing hubs. Hong Kong’s proximity to and unique relationship with Mainland China has made it the business gateway to China for more than 150 years. London, Great Britain Benefiting from flexible employment laws and low-cost legal structures, entrepreneurs’ visas and capital gains tax relief, London remains highly attractive. London continues to be a magnet thanks to its unique blend of market size, maturity and high degree of transparency. London offers one of Europe’s best and most diverse workforce. Among more than four million workers you’ll find 230 languages, tech specialists, and 400,000 creatives. While some feared a post-Brexit decline in the economy – and the full impact of Brexit will take years to be realized – Britain’s economy performed far better than expected, with GDP growth falling to 0.5 percent from 0.7 percent the previous quarter. Paris, France France is the eighth largest economy in the world, and with its steely economy and business ethic, the country is a global force. Additionally, France hosts some of the continent’s leading businesses and is the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment. Working almost 18 percent less hours than the global average, Paris enjoys the top spot when it comes to a work-life balance. But it’s not all berets and baguettes for the city of love. The French capital also has one of the highest concentrations of the world’s biggest companies and is home to the headquarters of oil company Total, investment bank BNP Paribas, and global communications agency Havas. With one of the highest GDPs than other cities, Paris is one of the most important business, financial, and political centers of the world. Santiago, Chile While there are a various choices when entering the LATAM market, Chile has been “one of the fastest-growing economies of Latin America” over the last decade. And seven years ago, the country set out to transform itself into the innovation and entrepreneurial hub of Latin America. Since 2010, the Chilean government has continued to pour money into promising startups through its Startup Chile program. By all accounts, this experiment has paid off, as more than 1,000 startups have graduated from the program, with many remaining in Santiago and others going on to raise additional capital for growth. Santiago is big by any measure, but what makes it truly imposing is its size in relation to the rest of Chile, the sheer extent to which is concentrated the country’s power and wealth. Here, new businesses are immersed in a vibrant startup culture, enjoying low costs and relatively light tax burden, and visionaries come to stay. Seattle, Washington Washington, unlike many other states, does not have an income tax. The state’s business and occupation (B&O) tax is calculated on the gross income from activities, meaning there are no deductions from the B&O tax for labor, materials, taxes, or other costs of doing business. The business atmosphere in Washington state is best described as young and healthy, with the state’s economy growing faster than the nation’s overall economy.  In fact, Washington has hit a sweet spot of both strong employment and wage growth, and Seattle is driving the state’s economy forward. The Emerald City is more than the Wizard of Oz could have imagined. Seattle area has emerged as the epicenter of the cloud technology industry and the city is on fire with Silicon Valley tech giants —Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Adobe, Twitter — expanding in the region. Seattle has a community of angel investors who are not only investing in the future of technology but able to provide great insight to budding entrepreneurs. You’ll find a legacy of experience building great companies — both consumer and enterprise. Stockholm, Sweden With lower bureaucracy and quicker processing times than its European neighbors, Sweden is known as the easiest and most efficient country in Europe to start new enterprises in. Additionally, the Scandinavian nation’s $493 billion economy grew 4.2 percent last year. Stockholm is an attractive hub for business with the advantage of an open, competitive, and resilient environment which has long defined Sweden. In fact, no other European city has produced more billion-dollar unicorn startups per capita. Taxes are still high relative to the rest of the developed world, but taxes paid as a percent of profit are down eight percentage points over the past decade. With an active business community complemented by world-class academic institutions, Stockholm is diverse, innovative, and globally connected. Tel Aviv, Israel The people of Israel have built a successful economy, and Tel Aviv is a buzzing and modern city. Though quite a small country, the Israeli economy is successful and has seen growth in excess of five percent over the last few years. More than 6,000 startups call the city home, and accelerators like the 8200 EISP and The Junction are also there to welcome budding businesses. Nicknamed ‘Silicon Wadi’, Israel is known for its relationship with high tech industries. With an open and liberal FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) regime, incentives such as tax breaks, setting up a business in Israel can be a highly profitable profitable move. Toronto, Canada As the business and financial capital of Canada, it’s no wonder why major corporations want to be located in Toronto. The Toronto economy is dominated by free market activities and private enterprise. As a result, it’s relatively easy to commence or expand business activities. With the lowest total taxes, including the most generous R&D tax treatment, and the second lowest business costs among G8 countries, professionals enjoy a much better cost of living and plenty of talented workers available for hire. Wellington, New Zealand New Zealand ranks as the easiest place in the world to start a business, taking less than a day. The country’s GDP rose 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2016, one of the top growth rates in the developed world. The local market is highly deregulated and guarantees stability, free trade, and active government support for investments to companies expanding in New Zealand. Wellington boasts a highly-educated, creative and innovative workforce, continued economic growth as well as lower operating costs and a great mix of small business support. And at 47 percent, the capital city is well above the national average (33 percent) for workforce in knowledge intensive industry. Pack your bags Launching in a new market isn’t easy, but with the same tenacity you used to setup your first shop, it’s certainly possible. Now that you’ve found the right city, now it’s time to make the next move. TMF Group is running series of webinars on European cities. Register to hear about Paris and Dublin from local experts.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News NSFOCUS launches in Australia, ideally placed to halt cyber attack tsunami from China SYDNEY, March 17, 2017 – NSFOCUS, a global provider of intelligent hybrid DDoS defences, today announced its launch into Australia. The company believes it is uniquely placed to defend against cyber-attacks from China.   Recent reports have indicated that up to 40 percent of global cyber-attacks are associated with China and the exploits discovered in this region can take days, weeks, or even months before they are replicated elsewhere.   “NSFOCUS Global Threat Intelligence is ideally placed to help Australian organisations improve their awareness and enterprise security posture – delivering both strategic and tactical intelligence, and providing organisations with a complete view of the global threat landscape, including China,” said Attley Ng, Senior Vice President Asia Pacific, NSFOCUS.   NSFOCUS is the only company that can provide insight from inside China as well elsewhere around the world, making it uniquely qualified to help mitigate these risks before they escalate. With more than 4,000 active customers, 12,000 network sensors, extensive honeypot networks, over 700G of data collected daily, and visibility into 400 million endpoints, NSFOCUS’ suite of Threat Intelligence solutions help organisations to get ahead of future attacks by implementing countermeasures quickly to protect critical assets.   “The launch of NSFOCUS into Australia is a natural extension of our progress across Asia Pacific,” said Mr. Ng. “Australia has a mature information technology market, with a rich depth of IT expertise that includes cyber security professionals, yet corporates and governments are still falling prey to cyber-attacks.”   He added: “In the aftermath of the massive cyber-attacks the world witnessed last year, organisations in Australia and worldwide can no longer rely solely on threat intelligence feeds to alert them to risks.   “Despite rapid innovation to combat growing threats, security professionals with limited intelligence resources still struggle to keep up with the overwhelming amount of data points these systems aggregate. Implementing a holistic, intelligence-driven solution with true global insight can help security teams to understand strategic and tactical intelligence – not just feed data – to take immediate action on the threats to their business. Our worldwide team of researchers and engineers work around the clock to help customers gain visibility and threat context to effectively respond to threats, both known and unknown.”   The NSFOCUS Threat Intel feed integrates seamlessly with the company’s Cloud and On-Premises DDoS defences, giving organisations such as government, big enterprises and service providers in Australia an additional layer of secured protections.   NSFOCUS has appointed Aquion as its Authorised Value Distributor, to provide localised support to the Australian market and help in recruitment and enabling security channel partners. Already NSFOCUS has committed to sponsoring two major security events this year: the AISA security conference and AusCert 2017.   Stephen Balicki, Managing Director, Aquion said: “Our partnership with NSFOCUS presents us with exceptional opportunities, as their comprehensive solutions deliver a real edge in the data security arena. These will appeal to channel partners and reinforce our AqSEC business unit which helps customers to monitor, manage and secure all elements of enterprise infrastructure using the best technologies.”   “As an endorsement of our capabilities, NSFOCUS is the leading choice when it comes to data security options,” said James Braunegg, Managing Director of Melbourne-based Micron21. “Our Tier IV data centre is the first in Australia to achieve Uptime Institute Tier IV Fault Tolerant Design Certification. This establishes Micron 21 as the most secure, reliable and high calibre commercial information technology facility in Australia.   “In addition to our Tier IV compliance, Micron 21 is ISO 27001 certified. To achieve these stellar standards, we researched the best data security options, and selected NSFOCUS. Now we are confident that reliability, security and premium technology set the standard for our services.”   The NSFOCUS suite of Threat Intelligence solutions includes:   NSFOCUS Threat Intelligence (NTI) Portal: Allows users to gain additional insight into various threats and threat actors via research, data collection, and analysis of crowdsourced information. NSFOCUS customers can drill deeper into detail on threats, upload malware samples for analysis, and monitor/track IP addresses with automatic notifications – providing a tailored experience for the most relevant threats. Threat Analysis Alerts and Reports: NSFOCUS provides timely analysis on threat trends, campaigns and actors, in addition to critical vulnerabilities identified. Via weekly blogs, emergency alerts and regularly released reports, customers are updated on the latest threat information available. Actionable Data Feeds: Delivered by strategically located NSFOCUS Cloud Centers, these feeds provide information across four crucial risk areas: IP Reputation: A list of IP addresses that have earned a negative reputation through involvement in suspicious activity, including phishing, botnets, APTs, DDoS attacks and more. Malicious Web/URL: A domain reputation list that includes malicious websites that are the source of exploit kits, malware and phishing attacks. Command & Control:  A set of IP addresses that are known to control botnet armies used to take services offline. This feed is used to prevent organizations’ own resources from unknowingly participating in cyber-attacks, mitigate ransomware, as well as conserving network resources. Malware Hashes: A set of MD5 file hashes that can be used to identify malware in email or file transfers, as well as stored data – protecting against malware, ransomware, Trojans, scanning, probing, and data leakage. NSFOCUS can easily augment existing threat intelligence through integration with other threat intelligence offerings or SIEM deployments, and across NSFOCUS’ network and application security products.   To learn more about NSFOCUS’ approach to threat intelligence, visit http://nsfocusglobal.com/threat-intelligence/   Contact Christine Tee Sr. Director, Channels and Marketing, NSFOCUS (65) 9679 1481 ctee@nsfocusglobal.com   About NSFOCUS IB   NSFOCUS IB is a wholly owned subsidiary of NSFOCUS, an award-winning enterprise application and network security provider, with operations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.

Last week, Tag Heuer unveiled the new generation of a $1,650 smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel, Montblanc released the $890 Summit, and Swatch Group CEO Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract Millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for Apple, and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while Tag Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15,000. The original version of the Apple Watch starts at $269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. So far, Swiss watchmakers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represent a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honored watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” Tag Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version, which is Swiss-made, Tag Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were sold last year, missing the forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 percent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 percent, IDC said. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch forecast a rebound in U.S. and European markets. Guy estimates that Tag Heuer got slightly less than than 10 percent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity (with) too many smartwatches,” Guy said.

An almost normal segment between CNN's Chris Cuomo and Rep. Sean Duffy suddenly descended into ridiculousness when Duffy changed topics to lie about U.S intelligence services for supposedly targeting Gen. Flynn and surveilling him. Um, they were surveilling the Russians, Sean. And all of a sudden there was Trump's National Security Adviser on the Russian's phone call. Really. That's what happened. At first Rep. Sean Duffy said Trump should show his evidence that Obama wiretapped him, and it appeared like CNN's New Day would have a fairly normal segment about how the wiretapping nonsense caused an international incident with the UK, but instead turned into a fight about "alternative facts," yet again. What was I thinking? As I was saying, Gen. Flynn's conversation was captured by U.S. Intel agencies because they were monitoring the Russians, but Rep. Duffy went on and on about how awful our Intel agencies are for targeting an American citizen. You know, the one who was working as a foreign agent. Host Chris Cuomo made all the right arguments and had the facts to back up what he said, but couldn't stop Duffy from changing topics from 'Trump should put up or shut up and apologize" about his wiretapping claim, to the LIE that "intelligence services are tapping American citizens and disclosing them." One can only assume Duffy is confusing the issues on purpose to cover up for Trump and particularly Flynn. Gen Michael Flynn, Rep. Sean Duffy, Wiretapping Click here for reuse options!

Aaeon closed out the Embedded World show by announcing a more compact and COM-like UP Core version of its community-backed UP board SBC. The similarly Linux- and Android-ready UP Core will soon hit Kickstarter with a price of $69 (vs. $89 retail) with a base level of 1GB RAM and 16GB eMMC. Also at Embedded World, Aaeon unveiled several IoT-oriented products, including a LoRa gateway based on the UP SBC (see farther below). UP Core (left) vs. original UP board (click images to enlarge) The main differences of the UP Core compared to the UP include the smaller size — 66 x 56.5mm vs. a Raspberry Pi-like 85.60 × 56.5mm for the UP board – and the fact that it ships with WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 BLE instead of a GbE port. The only coastline ports are an HDMI port and a USB 3.0 port. UP Core top and bottom views (click images to enlarge) You get the same 64 bit, “Cherry Trail” Intel Atom x5 Z8350 SoC that can be clocked at up to 1.84GHz. There is also a 500MHz Intel Gen 8 HD 400 GPU featuring 12 Execution Units. Aaeon supports the SoC’s Intel AES New Instructions and Intel Identity Protection Technology. UP Core detail views, front and back (click image to enlarge) The UP Core can be further equipped with up to 4GB DDR3L RAM and up to 64GB eMMC. In addition to the coastline HDMI and USB 3.0 ports, interfaces include a UART and 2x USB 2.0 headers, compared to 4x coastline USB 2.0 ports and 2x USB headers on the UP SBC. UP Core block diagram (click image to enlarge) A DSI/eDP interface is once again available, and there are dual MIPI-CSI camera interfaces instead of one on the SBC. The 0 to 60°C board has a 5V DC jack and an RTC. UP Core 100-pin expansion interface pinout (click image to enlarge) Instead of offering the RPi-compatible 40-pin expansion bus, there is now a 100-pin docking connector. Aaeon makes no claim of RPi compatibility, but the block diagram appears to suggest that the UP Core’s 100-pin expansion interface offers the signals required for implementation of a HAT40-compatible interface on a carrier board, plus “many more (PCIe, USB, HSIC,…” according to Aaeon. The company plans to offer several carrier boards for the UP Core, and will post free schematics for the carrier spec in order to encourage third party development (see farther below). Specifications listed for the UP Core include: Processor — Intel Atom x5-Z8350 (4x Cherry Trail cores @ 1.44GHz / 1.84GHz burst); Intel HD 400 Graphics (200MHz/500MHz) Memory — 1GB, 2GB, or 4GB DDR3L-1600 RAM; 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB eMMC flash Display/camera: HDMI 1.4b port with audio (via docking) eDP (DSI) 2x MIPI-CSI (2-lane and 4-lane) Wireless — 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n; Bluetooth 4.0 BLE; antenna Other I/O: USB 3.0 port 2x USB 2.0 via headers I2S audio (via docking) 100-pin docking connector to carrier with HAT40 compatibility Other features — RTC Power — 5V DC-in @ 4A 5.5/2.1mm jack Dimensions — 66 x 56.5mm Operating system — Linux (Ubuntu, ubilinux, Yocto); Android Marshmallow; Windows 10 (full); Windows 10 IoT Core   Community orientation Like the UP board, the UP Core offers a community website, hacker-friendly documentation, and lower prices than commercial Atom-based SBCs. Neither board, however, appears to be fully open source except for the UP Core’s carrier board spec. The UP is available with Ubuntu, ubilinux, and Yocto based Linux distributions, as well as Android, but Windows 10 and Windows 10 IoT seem to be the main course here. With regard to Linux, Aaeon says “we support and enable Linux, through our UP Community.” Additionally, Aaeon is launching an UP Core carrier board reward program in order to turn UP Core carriers into open source platforms. Aaeon will share several carrier board schematics that developers can modify, or they can design from scratch from the carrier spec. Developers then submit their designs for qualification, which will include an online poll of community users. Specs for four proposed UP Core expansion boards (preliminary) (click image to enlarge) Aaeon will then post the accepted designs on the UP community site. Third parties can manufacture boards, and in some cases, Aaeon will manufacture the boards to sell at the UP shop. Additional details are available in Aaeon’s overview of the UP Core Carrier Board Reward Program, available for download here [PDF]. UP Squared In October, Aaeon went to Kickstarter to launch the community-backed UP Squared SBC, due to ship to backers in April. Starting at $98, the UP Squared features a faster Intel Apollo Lake SoC, and offers up to 8GB DDR4 of RAM and up to 128GB eMMC 5.0. Additional features include 4K video encode and decode, dual GbE, dual HDMI, SATA, M.2, and mini-PCIe, as well as new 40- and 60-pin GPIO connectors. In addition, the original UP board has appeared in Aaeon’s UP-GWS0 gateway. It also forms the foundation of a Smart Vending Now platform from Aaeon and Kii that combines the UP with with Kii’s cloud-based IoT platform for vending machines. Meanwhile, Aaeon’s parent company Asus is prepping its own maker-oriented Tinker Board. The SBC runs Debian and Kodi on a quad-core 1.8GHz Cortex-A17 Rockchip RK3288, and offers 2GB RAM, GbE, 4K video, and RPi-compatible 40-pin connector.   An UP-based LoRa gateway In addition to introducing the UP Core, Aaeon announced a LoRa Gateway & Network Server that uses a gateway with an “UP Connect LoRa” board based on the UP board. The UP Connect LoRa board adds an IMST LoRa Radio concentrator. The LoRa gateway is integrated with a LoRaWAN network server from The Things Industries. The combined solution provides gateway and device management, data management, and representation services, says Aaeon. It also provides a high grade of security, incorporating encryption from sensor to application without intermediate decryption, says the company. We’ve seen several LoRa gateway products recently, including Dragino’s OpenWrt-based LoRa Gateways and SODAQ’s Arduino-compatible LoRaONE. The LoRa (Long Range Radio) spec is a low-power wireless technology, typically based on Semtec LoRa transceivers. Compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4g standard, LoRa operates at 868MHz and 915MHz, near the lower end of the GPRS range. A single LoRa gateway can service thousands of nodes, with a range of 2.5km in urban areas up to 15km in the suburbs. The power-efficient technology uses a spread spectrum modulation type with wide-band linear FM pulses. LoRa is typically used in LoRaWAN networks, often deployed in European “smart city” networks. This Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) protocol for IoT is overseen by the LoRa Alliance. LoRa radios also support a more advanced Symphony Link protocol for more industrial and enterprise applications. At Embedded World, Aaeon also announced Spring 2017 availability of an Aaeon UP IRQF Starter Kit for IoT developers. The UP board based starter kit, which will be supported with workshops, enables developers to rapidly prototype and develop wireless- and sensor-enabled IoT products with a Microsoft Azure backend. The products use the AES-128 encryption features of the IRQF 4.0 operating system. Finally, at Embedded World, Aaeon demonstrated a pairing of the UP board with Emutex’s Linux-based ubiworx IoT software framework for embedded systems. The demonstration showed off smart home IoT solutions with the ubiworx-enabled UP board.   Further information The UP Core will appear soon on Kickstarter starting at a price of $69 (vs. $89 retail). More information may be found on Aaeon’s UP Core page on the UP-Board community site.

Previous Article Video: Watch AWS Try to Blow up Its Snowball Data Transfer Box Next Article Ascenty Secures $190M to Fund Data Center Construction in Latin America Microsoft Project Olympus server (Image: Microsoft) Blades, Data Center World, Featured, Microsoft, Open Compute Meet Microsoft, the New Face of Open Source Data Center Hardware by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on March 15, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet If you’re running a cloud platform at Microsoft’s scale (30-plus regions around the world, with multiple data centers per region) and you want it to run on the best data center hardware, you typically design it yourself. But what if there are ideas out there — outside of your company’s bubble — that can make it even better? One way to find them is to pop your head out as much as possible, but which way do you look once you do? There’s another way to do it, and it’s proven to be quite effective in software. We’re talking about open source of course, and Microsoft — a company whose relationship with open source software has been complicated at best — has emerged as a pioneer in applying the open source software ethos to hardware design. Facebook, which has been a massive force in open source software, became a trail blazer in open source data center hardware in 2011 by founding the Open Compute Project and using it to contribute some of its custom hardware and data center infrastructure designs to the public domain. But there’s been a key difference between Facebook’s move and the way things work in open source software. The social network has been open sourcing completed designs, not trying to crowdsource engineering muscle to improve its infrastructure. Late last year, Microsoft, an OCP member since 2014, took things further. In November, the company submitted to the project a server design that at the time was only about 50 percent complete, asking the community to contribute as it takes it to 100 percent. Project Olympus (that’s what this future cloud server is called) is not an experiment. It is the next-generation hardware that will go into Microsoft data centers to power everything from Azure and Office 365 to Xbox and Bing, and it’s being designed in a way that will allow the company to easily configure it to do a variety of things: compute, data storage, or networking. Learn about Project Olympus directly from the man leading the charge next month at Data Center World, where Kushagra Vaid, Microsoft’s general manager for Azure Cloud Hardware Infrastructure, will be giving a keynote titled Open Source Hardware Development at Cloud Speed. There’s a link between the design’s modularity aspect and the open source approach. Microsoft wants to be able to not only configure the platform for different purposes by tweaking the usual knobs, such as storage capacity, memory, or CPU muscle, but also to have a single platform that can be powered by completely different processor architectures — x86 and ARM — and it wants to have multiple suppliers for each — Intel and AMD for x86 chips, Qualcomm and Cavium (and potentially others) for ARM. The sooner all the component vendors get involved in the platform design process, the faster a platform will emerge that’s compatible with their products, goes the thinking. Read more: Why Microsoft Says ARM Chips Can Replace Half of Its Data Center Muscle “Instead of having a team do everything in-house, we can work with these folks in the ecosystem and then bring the solutions to market faster, which is where differentiation is,” Kushagra Vaid, general manager for Azure cloud hardware infrastructure, said in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. “So, it’s been a completely different development world from that standpoint versus what we used to do.” Making Data Centers Cheaper to Operate Microsoft has already seen the benefits of going the Open Compute route with its current- and previous-generation hardware developed in collaboration with suppliers. Project Olympus widens the pool of potential engineering brainpower it can tap into. About 90 percent of the hardware it buys today is OCP-compliant, meaning it fits the basic standard parameters established by the project, such as chassis form factors, power distribution, and other specs. It hasn’t always been this way. Microsoft’s Project Olympus servers on display at the Open Compute Summit in Santa Clara in March 2017 (Photo: Yevgeniy Sverdlik) The company started transitioning to a uniform data center hardware strategy for its various product groups around the same time it joined OCP. The goal was to reduce cost by limiting the variety of hardware the groups’ infrastructure leads were allowed to use. And Microsoft decided it would make that hardware adhere to OCP standards. So far, Vaid likes the results he’s seen. Standardization has helped the company reduce hardware maintenance and support costs and recover from data center outages faster. A Microsoft data center technician no longer has to be acquainted with 10 to 20 different types of hardware before they can start changing hard drives or debugging systems on the data center floor. “It’s the same hardware, same motherboards, same chassis, same racks, same management system, it’s so much simpler,” Vaid said. “They spend less time to get the servicing done. It means fewer man hours, faster recovery times.” One Power Distribution Design, Anywhere in the World Project Olympus is the next step in Microsoft’s pursuit of a uniform data center infrastructure. One of the design’s key aspects is universal power distribution, which allows servers to be deployed in colocation data centers anywhere in the world, regardless of the local power specs, be they 30 Amp or 50 Amp, 380V, 415V, or 480V. The same type of rack with the same type of power distribution unit can be shipped for installation in Ashburn, London, Mumbai, or Beijing. The only thing that’s different for each region is the power adaptor. This helps Microsoft get its global hardware supply chain in tune with data center capacity planning, and few things have more bearing on the overall cost of running a hyper-scale cloud – and, as a function of cost, end-user pricing — than good capacity planning. The less time passes between the moment a server is manufactured and the moment it starts running customer workloads in a data center, the less capital is stranded, which is why it’s nice to have the ability to deliver capacity just in time, when it’s needed, as opposed to far in advance to avoid unexpected shortages. “Essentially we can build a rack one time, and after it’s built we can very late in the process decide which data center to send it to, without having to worry about disassembling it, putting in a new PDU,” Vaid said. “It all delays the deployment.” Taking Cost Control Away from Vendors If the Project Olympus design was 50 percent done in November, today it’s about 80 percent complete. Vaid wouldn’t say when Microsoft is expecting to start deploying the platform in production. The company still maintains a degree of secrecy around timing of deployment of its various technologies. He also had no comment on the report that surfaced earlier this month saying Hewlett Packard Enterprise was expecting Microsoft to cut back on the amount of data center hardware it would buy from the IT giant. The report was based on anonymous sources, and Vaid pointed to the fact that HPE was listed as one of the solution providers involved in Project Olympus. HPE of course was one of several on the list, along with Dell, ZT Systems, Taiwanese manufacturers Wiwynn and Quanta, and China’s Inspur. That’s one of the biggest reasons behind OCP to begin with. The hyper-scale data center users drive the design, while the suppliers compete for their massive hardware orders, leaving little room for suppliers to differentiate other than on price and the time it takes to deliver the goods, flipping the world upside down for companies like HPE and Dell, who until not too long ago were enjoying market dominance. “We have full control of the cost,” Vaid said. “We can take what we want, we can take out what we don’t want, and the solution providers are just doing the integration and shipping.” Previous Article Video: Watch AWS Try to Blow up Its Snowball Data Transfer Box Next Article Ascenty Secures $190M to Fund Data Center Construction in Latin America Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Zack Hudgins, D-Tukwila A new bill in the Washington State House of Representatives seeks to regulate testing of autonomous vehicles, deal with insurance issues, and potentially create a mechanism for licensing driverless car occupants and manufacturers once the technology is ready for public use. House Bill 2131 was introduced late last month, and it isn’t meant to be voted on this session, said Rep. Zack Hudgins, D-Tukwila, a former program manager at Amazon and Microsoft and one of the bill’s co-sponsors. Legislators have been discussing autonomous vehicles throughout the last year, and the bill is meant to continue the conversation between lawmakers, government agencies and autonomous vehicles manufacturers about the nascent technology. The state, Hudgins said, is not ready for these vehicles to hit the road, and this bill aims to get various government agencies ready to deal with driverless cars. Hudgins said the bill language was mostly plucked from regulations in California. He went this way because these regulations are a known quantity, so rather than coming up with an entirely new set of rules, he wants to improve something that is already on the books elsewhere. “The bill doesn’t go into too much depth,” Hudgins said. “The bill itself isn’t trying to regulate autonomous vehicles in our state as much as start the discussion about what regulation would look like.” We’re still a long way from seeing driverless cars alongside regular vehicles at rush hour. But several companies are working on it. Among the most advanced is Google autonomous vehicle spinout Waymo, which is testing its driverless car technology in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland and other cities around the country. Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, announced earlier this week, is another sign of the burgeoning technology in this sector. Mobileye makes sensors and camera for self-driving cars. Before going from testing to releasing driverless cars to the public, manufacturers would first have to be certified by the state’s Department of Licensing. The bill also stipulates that vehicles should have mechanisms to turn autonomous mode on and off, and means to notify drivers when the driverless system has malfunctioned. DOL would have the authority to add more rules in the future, like caps on the number of autonomous vehicles on public roads and new requirements for operators of driverless cars. According to the bill, makers of driverless cars would be required to store sensor data in the event of a crash while a vehicle is an autonomous mode in order to get a clear picture of what happened. Once driverless cars become available to the public, the bill requires manufacturers to disclose the data they are collecting. Michael Schutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association. Hudgins emphasized that nothing in the bill is set in stone, and he hopes that the industry and other experts can help shape rules as the technology itself comes into focus. “There’s an old adage: If you want to find out what’s wrong with your idea put it in bill form and drop it,” Hudgins said. “That’s what we are doing. We’re throwing the bill out there and saying, ‘OK tell us what’s wrong with it.’ That’s the feedback loop that we’re looking for.” Not everyone is happy with Hudgins’ approach. Michael Schutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association, said there is still so much to learn about autonomous vehicles, and we don’t know what the technology is going to look like a couple years from now. As a result, he said, it is way too soon to regulate this technology. Other states have allowed testing free of regulation, Schutzler said, and then worked with manufacturers to get data and start building regulations around that. Schutzler told GeekWire that this bill, as is, does not lay out a clear path of regulations from testing to large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles. He encouraged proponents of the bill to take a look at the research available from tests in other states and apply it to HB 2131. Schutzler warned that the current version of the bill could hurt Washington’s ability to be a hub for development and testing of driverless cars. But, he said he is in favor of bringing in subject matter experts to improve the legislation and set the stage for regulation of autonomous vehicles. “There will be useful, relevant regulation of autonomous vehicles,” Schutzler said. “We are very supportive of the desire to draft, but we are not supportive of passing a bill at this time.” An Uber self-driving car in Pittsburgh. (Uber Photo) Hudgins and Schutzler agree that autonomous cars will drastically change travel in a variety of ways. Schutzler pointed to the established rules of the road and how they will be disrupted. Anyone who has driven consistently knows conditions, and drivers, are different everywhere. Algorithms and systems underpinning autonomous vehicles will have to take into consideration the unique nature of driving conditions in different cities. Driverless cars will force changes to infrastructure, such as optimizing road signs and stoplights so that autonomous vehicles can read them, and Schutzler argues that regulating this new technology goes far beyond the vehicles themselves. New rules should complement each other in the same way that traffic laws work together to roads and highways. “A whole bunch of systems are going to be required for autonomous vehicles to be on the road at same time as regular cars,” Schutzler said. “All those systems will create safety mechanisms that will probably end up in cars with drivers. There’s so much still yet to be figured out that we are really far away from, that to regulate just the cars, is almost silly thing to think about. It’s actually an entire system that needs to be regulated.” Hudgins said he is thinking about how driverless cars will affect other regulatory structures. For example, he said, Washington has laws requiring steering wheels in all vehicles. With autonomous vehicles, laws like that could become outdated and have to change. What happens if a car without a driver gets into accident? How does that work from an insurance perspective? These are some of the questions Hudgins wants to hash out before these cars hit the road. Additionally, the state passed a $16 billion transportation package in 2015 that will lead to a lot of new road projects. By the time many of those projects are done, autonomous vehicle technology could be ready for public consumption, so Hudgins wants to have rules and regulations in place so that they can be integrated with new projects as they are coming together rather than being forced to work retroactively to fit things together.

For more than a decade Joan worked as a documentary reporter for The National.

A battle involving some of America's most powerful men and some of Africa's most powerful warlords is being waged in Donald Trump's White House. At stake are billions of dollars, child labour, sexual violence, and the precious minerals that make our tech gadgets work. Soon after Trump took office, his plan to suspend the law on what are known as conflict minerals was leaked to the media. White House eyeing executive order targeting 'conflict minerals' rule Coltan: a new blood mineral The law was part of former president Barack Obama's 2010 financial reform package known as the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 1502 of the act requires U.S. companies to avoid using conflict minerals from Congo and surrounding countries that are used to fund war, perpetuating human rights atrocities. It also asked companies to track their global supply chains and provide independently audited reports to the Securities Exchange Commission. U.S. President Donald Trump has drafted an executive order targeting a rule requiring U.S. companies to disclose whether their products contain 'conflict minerals' from a war-torn part of Africa and to report on their supply chains. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Rights groups called the transparency law groundbreaking. "The conflict minerals law is a vital way of breaking the chain between horrific human rights abuses in Central Africa and consumer products like smartphones," said Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty International's director of global issues. Tantalum, tin, tungsten (the 3Ts) and gold — heavily mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) — are referred to as conflict minerals because of the immense profits they bring in help warlords finance their wars with rival armies and the Congolese military. The Enough Project, a Washington-based NGO, refers to what is happening in the DRC as the deadliest conflict since the Second World War, with more than 5.4 million people killed since the late 1990s and millions more displaced. "The whole point of [Section 1502] was to remove the warlords," adds Joanne Lebert, executive director of Ottawa's non-profit Partnership Africa Canada. "So this is going to send a signal that it's carte blanche. They can do whatever they want." Industry fights back, wins partial victory Big business and some U.S. Republicans have spent years trying to get Section 1502 repealed or radically revised. From the very beginning, then-chair of the SEC, Mary Jo White, said that while she personally would like to see an end to the human rights atrocities in the DRC, the new law seemed "more directed at exerting societal pressure on companies to change behaviour, rather than to disclose financial information that primarily informs investment decisions." Apple touts progress on suppliers' labour, environmental practices Intel says processors now free of 'conflict minerals' In May 2012, Franklin Vargo, vice-president of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the largest industrial trade group in the U.S., testified at a House subcommittee that while NAM also abhorred what was going on in the DRC, the new rules would pose a potentially huge financial burden on his membership.

(Finbarr O'Reilly/Reuters) Later that year, three of America's largest industry associations — NAM, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable (a group of top CEOs) — filed suit against the SEC, hoping to repeal the conflict minerals law. Trump expected to roll back U.S. fuel-economy requirements Trump moves to ease Wall Street regulations, review 'fiduciary rule' for retirement advisers They won a partial victory when the court ruled that the requirement to describe products as having "not been found to be DRC conflict-free" violates the First Amendment. The rest of the law, involving documenting product supply chain and reporting to the SEC, was upheld in 2014 and then again in 2015. As the legal battles were playing out, rights and development groups were working to let the public know what mining conditions are like in the DRC. Their highest profile campaigner was House of Cards actress Robin Wright. Wright stars in a documentary called When Elephants Fight, the name taken from the African proverb, "when elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers." It means that in conflicts between the powerful, it is the weak who are hurt. We know about conflict diamonds, but what about conflict gold The film documents warlords using slave labour in the mines and children forced at gunpoint to dig with their hands for the minerals that fire up our smartphones and laptops. "We are using these devices all day, every day, for our convenience and it's basically perpetuating a war," Wright said. "I find it unacceptable that as consumers we allow this to go on." DRC 'most dangerous' for women Sexual violence is also often fuelled by the militias and armies warring over conflict minerals, says The Enough Project's co-founder John Prendergast. "The Congo war has the highest rate of violence against women and girls in the world," he said. "And reports indicate that hundreds of thousands have been raped, making it the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman or girl." Human rights abuses, specifically sexual violence, have been widely reported by NGOs at small-scale artisanal mines of the Democratic Republic of Congo. (Evelyn Mayanja) Softening the profits-over-people optics, tech giants Apple, Blackberry, Motorola and Intel have decided to move away from allowing conflict minerals into their products and toward using ethically mined 3Ts. Cobalt mined with child labour used by Apple, Samsung, Sony & others, says Amnesty Intel made it clear the company wanted to be seen as a socially conscious industry leader. In early 2014, CEO Brian Krzanich announced that all of the company's microprocessors released that year would be free of conflict minerals. "As a shareholder, you should care about this, you should want us to address it," Krzanich said in a keynote speech to the SEC. "It did cost us a lot to set up this program, but now it's running, the cost of the actual materials is no more." Tech companies supporting due diligence After Trump's plan to suspend the conflict mineral law was leaked, Intel, Apple and a few other companies let it be known that regardless of whether the law was scraped, they would continue sourcing only ethically mined minerals. Jewellery giant Tiffany & Co. also weighed in with a written statement urging U.S. Congress "to support legislation that effectively promotes due diligence and transparency for the source of all conflict metals and gemstones." Apple to track suppliers' sourcing of conflict minerals Intel says its chips and processors are now free of conflict minerals Six years later, inspectors determine which mines are ethically run or "green" and the specially tagged 3Ts are shipped to smelters that are part of the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). Companies are then expected to buy their supplies from only CFSI smelters. The Enough Project's Sasha Lezhnev believes the system is working. "In 2010, the UN said nearly every mine was controlled by a military actor," Lezhev says. "Now 79 per cent of miners are working in mines that are conflict free." Getting around the rules Evelyn Mayange, who is writing her PhD thesis on conflict minerals at the University of Manitoba, doesn't share that assessment. She says there is a desperate lack of independent monitors in the DRC, and that conflict minerals are smuggled into neighbouring countries and green-washed as they go. There is corruption, she says, at every level. "I interviewed custom officials, and two told me that when the minerals are brought from the mines, they're paid money and they just put a tag on the bags," said Mayange. "Then they go as if they're conflict free." Having recently returned from a research trip to the DRC, Mayange argues that Section 1502 of Dodd-Frank needs to be strengthened, not struck down. She says the mines need closer scrutiny on the use of child labour and sexual violence. "Of the mines I visited, 50 to 70 per cent were children. Some are working as miners, some as porters, some in prostitution, and others are just there as beggars, looking for ways to survive," she said. Mining sites in the eastern regions of the DRC employ children who work alongside adults. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that governments should protect children from work that is dangerous or might harm their health or education. (Evelyn Mayanja) Still, many believe the U.S. conflict mineral law is a critical start. Dozens of human rights, social and religious groups in the DRC and neighbouring countries are pleading with the Trump administration to keep the regulation in place. Child soldiers on front lines of Congo conflict An open letter by Congolese civil rights leader Jamal Usseni Jamael read, in part, that suspending the Dodd-Frank rule "will have negative consequences for millions" in eastern DRC. He said rebel groups will "find the means" to finance the war. "They will kill the children, they will rape the women. They will destroy all hope for the Congolese people to live in peace in their own territory."

Microsoft has admitted that it is blocking Windows 7 and 8 updates on Intel's seventh generation Core i3, i5, Qualcomm's 8996 and other processors to 'force' users upgrade to Windows 10, a media report said. According to a report in Forbes on Friday, when a user tries to run Windows Update, Windows is unable to search for new updates generating a message "Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error". "As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support. This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon," the report quoted a Microsoft spokesperson as saying. Micosoft is making sure its runs new silicon on latest Windows and install them on most new-build PCs running these processors. "While there will be user benefits to this strategy, it also means that Microsoft is taking away a measure of control from users," the report noted. Intel Skylake processors will also not be supported on Windows 7 and 8 from July. Therefore, its users will have to upgrade to keep the updates coming.

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Tesla bulks up checking account ahead of Model III… Tesla bulks up checking account ahead of Model III production run By Bill Roberson — March 16, 2017 12:35 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: They’ve got some robots they need to buy Tesla is gearing up for mass production of its “affordable” Model 3 electric car with a fundraiser of sorts. Despite its popularity, Elon Musks’ electric car company operates pretty close to the bone financially, so they’re issuing stock to pad their checking account with just over a billion dollars, although Wall Street thinks they’re hoping to raise about $2.5 billion. Sources say Musk is actually buying about $25 million dollar in stock himself. Always nice to see the boss buy some of the baked goods. Musk says Model 3 production is scheduled to hit 5,000 cars a week this year and 10,000 a week by next year. They’ll need the capacity as pre-orders for the $35,000 car hit nearly 500,000 units after it was announced. Tesla also noted they’re working on plans for Gigafactory numbers 2,3,4 and 5 as well, so as usual, all of Tesla’s plans are… really big plans. When is the “Pringle” line coming out? Hot on the heels of their Ryzen 7 series of CPUs, AMD has announced the 5 series, which take aim at Intel’s Core i5 line of silicon chips. AMD hasn’t revealed full performance specs for the series yet, but expect them to be on par or a bit better than Core i5 stats at a slightly lower price. The base 3.2ghz Series 5 chip will go for $169, with the top-spec 3.6ghz, 6-core “1600X” variant selling for $249. All the chips can be overclocked or “boosted” for more performance, providing you can properly cool it inside your PC. The new chips will be available on April 11th, and later this year, AMD plans to introduce an even more affordable “3-series” line of CPUs, so stay tuned. I can see clearly now Anyone think the iPhone 8 or iPhone Pro or whatever it’s going to be called won’t be a big deal? Don’t tell that to Netflix, which Mac Rumors says it is planning to offer High Dynamic Range mobile content soon – especially in light of what is expected to be a very, very high-quality OLED screen on the next iPhone. How much that will enhance your Iron Fist viewing experience while riding a commuter train is up for debate, but hey, better is always… better, right? Well, we should probably just get ready for HDR content pretty much everywhere. The new LG G6 halo phone has an AMOLED screen that is both HDR 10 and Dolby Vision HDR compliant, and new tablets from just about everyone are expected to start incorporating HDR-spec performance in top level models. No complaints here, and we’ll know much more about the iPhone 8 in September. We’ve got more news on our Facebook page and YouTube channel, and be sure to tune in to this week’s DT podcasts: Close to the Metal (computers and such) on Tuesday, Trends with Benefits (general tech shenanigans)  on Thursdays, and Between the Streams (movie and TV topics) every Friday.

Skip to main content PC Games news and reviews from PCGamesN.com Reviews Hardware About Mass Effect: Andromeda|18 March 2017 Mass Effect: Andromeda PC graphics, performance and 4K analysis - the PCGamesN tech review By Matt Purslow Subscribe to PCGamesN on YouTube We’ve spent five years waiting, like Reapers lurking in dark space, but Mass Effect: Andromeda has finally dropped out of warp and is ready to be downloaded onto planetside hard drives. But is the PC version primed for flawless atmosphere breach, or does it need further calibrations? We’ve analysed every preset, setting, and option to find out just how well Andromeda runs on PC. Welcome, Pathfinder, to the PCGamesN tech review. Need to know how to fight aliens? Learn all there is to know with our Mass Effect: Andromeda combat guide.  Our tech reviews are written to offer you the broadest picture possible, focusing on hardware similar to what the majority of players have installed in their machines. We test the game on all graphical settings using an i5 powered rig with 8GB of RAM, and try to hit 60 fps with four of the most popular graphics cards. Even if your PC is not identical to our test set ups, you should still be able to estimate the performance levels you can expect from your own machine.  Graphics options (larger image)  Mass Effect: Andromeda gets off to a bumpy start with its graphical settings menu, which feel a little on the amateur side. Forgetting that they don’t feel very Mass Effect in aesthetic, they make terrible use of screen space and offer very few tooltips to help explain what each setting does. The list scrolls slowly, and requires multiple scrolls to see the entire list. It’s a pretty poor layout.  Thankfully the menus do include everything required to tailor Andromeda to your hardware. 12 different settings feels a little on the short side, but among them are the vitals like texture detail and filtering, terrain and vegetation quality, meshes, and lighting and shadows. Anti-aliasing comes in the form of FXAA and Temporal AA, while ambient occlusion is offered up in SSAO, HBAO, and HBAO Full flavours.  There’s a few personal preference settings such as an on/off toggle for film grain and chromatic aberration. You can also scale the resolution, maintaining your native resolution for the overall image but rendering the game at a lower setting.  Andromeda will auto-detect graphical settings for you, and it generally seems to select sensible, well performing options. You can take control yourself with the presets, opting for low, medium, high, or ultra. It’s important to note that when using these presets the game will use resolution scaling as a tool; at low the game will render at 720p and medium at 900p. If you’d rather stay at native resolution you’ll need to make a custom setup in order to prevent the scaling.  Outside of graphic options there’s a solid set of control settings, including a complete key rebinding menu and mouse sensitivity sliders for every movement function (on foot/in vehicles etc). You can also ‘multiply’ the field of view, making the viewing area larger in-game. Graphics analysis Tested on an Intel i5 6500k @3.2GHz, 8GB of RAM, Nvidia GTX 1060, Windows 10 For our graphics analysis we compare screenshots taken on the four standard presets of ultra, high, medium, and low. To apply any settings changes you’ll have to reset the entire game. Most modern games require exiting to the main menu, but it seems excessive to require a complete reboot. As you can imagine this is incredibly annoying when making several minute changes to maximise frame rates.  Ultra (larger image) Andromeda is a new galaxy, and BioWare have made a concentrated effort to make that apparent with the look of the game. This feels like a true generational leap ahead of Mass Effect 3, with beautifully bumpy rock formations, dense (and very weird) plant life, and mists that hang close to the ground. The lighting work is similarly strong, making the skyboxes feel genuinely sunny and offering dark, soft shadows in the more shady areas of the scene. Things look slightly hazy and unfocused in the mid-distance, but overall Andromeda produces a beautiful image on ultra settings.  This most demanding preset runs well on our GTX 1060-powered rig, too. With an average frame rate of 65 fps and a low of 47, it’s a very smooth and stable performance. It should be noted that we use the 6GB variant of the GTX 1060; BioWare’s tales of 30 fps with the same card applies to the 3GB version.  High (larger image) The high preset retains most of the quality of ultra with just a few minor changes to help boost performance. Immediately noticeable is the dramatic decrease in mist effects, although what remains still looks authentically wispy. Other changes require a closer look, such as the reduced tessellation in the rock surfaces. You can see on the floor area where certain ridges have been removed and smoothed over, but you certainly need to inspect thoroughly to find the changes.    These small changes result in an equally small performance boost; an average of 70 fps and a low of 54 fps. Medium   (larger image) A more obvious change in quality can be seen on the medium preset, most obviously in the lighting. It’s less complex, with there being a more obvious contrast between light and shadow. The terrain has also been reduced in quality, with even more of the small bumps and ridges having been smoothed out. The overall line work is far fuzzier than at high, with the Ryder’s armour looking notably poorer. While some of this is due to reduced anti-aliasing, the medium preset also scales the image down to 900p, which certainly does it no favours.  You’d hope that such concessions would result in a large performance jump, and thankfully it does. On average medium will net you 125 fps, with a low of 70 fps.  Low (larger image) At the lowest end of the graphical spectrum Andromeda looks a bit of a mess. With its blurry image and smoothed-out models it takes on the appearance of a voxel-based game, or a film viewed through a jar of incredibly dense transparent goo. Any detail is eradicated by the combination of low-grade textures and the 720p resolution, and the lighting work feels incredibly artificial.  As you’d expect, there’s a healthy performance boost for such a downgrade. Our rig managed an average of 163 fps, and bottomed out at 88 fps. I couldn’t recommend using low though; it’s not just rough-looking, it destroys the cinema of the game.  Performance benchmarks  To see how Mass Effect: Andromeda performs on various hardware setups, we have tested the game on four graphics cards; two from Nvidia, and two from AMD. We’ve sampled the most popular cards from the current and last generation of GPUs in order to offer the most useful information.  All four cards were tested at ultra settings, with every texture option up as high as they’ll go and every graphical effect turned on. For the test we played a three-minute sample that involved dynamic weather effects, running, climbing, cutscenes, and combat. The same section is repeated three times in order to find an average.  In the graph below you can see how all four cards perform.  As mentioned previously, there’s a very clear generational leap apparent in Andromeda’s graphics, and you can see that an older card like the AMD R9 380 struggles to keep up. An average of 37 fps is still playable, of course, and ultra will look far better than the console alternative. The current gen RX 470 naturally fares much better, but as one of the lower end cards available at the moment it doesn’t quite manage to hit 60 fps with all the bells and whistles turned on.  The popular GTX 1060, our main testing card, performs admirably at an average of 65 fps. It’s good news for the previous generation of Nvidia cards too, with the 970 being within four frames of 60 fps.  Several hours of play confirms that BioWare have created a very solid build with Mass Effect: Andromeda, but it’s worth saying that I did experience problems the first time I booted the game. I experienced frame rates as low as single figures, with combat being unplayable. Thankfully after rebooting my PC these issues disappeared and have never returned, not even with the use of a significantly less powerful GPU.  How does Mass Effect: Andromeda run in 4K?  Andromeda runs solidly at 1080p, but what if you own a 4K display? Our UHD test rig - rocking an i7 6700K CPU, an Nvidia GTX 1080, and displaying on an Acer Predator 4K monitor - copes as well as can be expected. At a huge 3840 x 2160 resolution on ultra settings, Andromeda runs at an average of 36 fps, and a minimum of 27 fps. We wouldn’t expect close to 60 frames on a single GPU, but for a game as effects-heavy and detailed as Andromeda, it’s nice to see that it maintains a playable frame rate. It’s worth noting that our preset analysis found very little difference between high and ultra, so if you’re playing in 4K you should certainly consider dropping down a notch to improve performance.  How to run Mass Effect: Andromeda at 60 fps If you’re running one of the cards we’ve tested you’ll no doubt be making a decision right now: do you opt for the most beautiful image and make do with a lower frame rate, or settle for nothing less than 60 fps no matter the graphical cost? If you’re planning on doing the latter, we’ve got tips on how to achieve the gold standard frame rate on our selection of four test GPUs.     For a breakdown of how to run Mass Effect: Andromeda at 60 fps, see our settings guide below.  Nvidia GTX 970 (larger image) If a 970 is your weapon of choice, you’ll be pleased to hear there’s very little you need to do to squeeze 60 frames out of it. Simply using the high preset will ensure a smooth experience with almost all of the visual tricks still running.  Nvidia GTX 1060 (larger image) A 1060 GPU is more than capable of hitting 60 fps at ultra, so just keep those settings turned up as high as they go. If you find more taxing areas are pulling your frame rate down into the 50s, reducing one or two of the graphical elements like vegetation or terrain detail down a setting should keep you in the smooth.  AMD Radeon R9 380 (larger image)  The older R9 380 struggles with Mass Effect: Andromeda, but that doesn’t mean you can’t strike a decent balance between visuals and frame rate. Start by applying the high preset, but then adjust it to custom in order to fine tune it. You’ll want to drop anti-aliasing down to FXAA, and set post processing, lighting, shadows, effects, mesh, and vegetation down to medium. Shaders need to go a little further down, so drop those to low. It’s a more complicated setup than the other cards, but this combination will net you an average of 60 fps while looking as pretty as possible.   For a more detailed breakdown, see our R9 380’s in-game graphics menus here and here.   AMD Radeon RX 470 (larger image) Our lower-end current generation card can run Andromeda at 60 fps with a few adjustments. Using the high preset as a base, by lowering post processing, lighting, and vegetation to medium you can achieve a very playable frame rate that still looks pretty swish.  For a more detailed breakdown, see our RX 470’s in-game graphics menus here and here.   Conclusion Before I got my hands on Mass Effect: Andromeda I already had it in my head that this wasn’t going to be a great PC game. Excited as I was for exploring a new BioWare story, the unusually high recommended specs and talk of it running at 30 fps had me worried. And, as previously mentioned, things didn’t get off to a good start. While the opening scenes on the Ark were smooth, the moment I went planetside and started engaging in combat or doing anything requiring fast movement the frame rate plummeted to a crawl. I feared that I really did need 16GB of RAM and a 1070 to run Andromeda, but luckily a system reboot later and those issues were gone and I was never able to replicate them.  Andromeda, while having a more ‘concept art in motion’ look rather than photorealism, is a detail-dense and demanding game, but it runs great on mid-range modern hardware like the GTX 1060. Older and lower-end cards will struggle a little, though. This isn’t the kind of game you’d upgrade your GPU for, but thankfully the settings offer enough adjustment room to squeeze 60 fps out of weaker components.  BioWare could certainly have put more PC-centric effort into Andromeda; there’s no DirectX 12 here, and the menus feel as if they’ve been pulled from a console rather that created bespoke for our platform. Compared to the games Ubisoft have been putting out recently, Andromeda really pales as a PC game.  But a few clunky menus aren’t the end of the world, and in-game your character controls perfectly well with a mouse and keyboard. Overall it still feels like a game that was intended to be played with face buttons on a controller, but if you’re used to using the number keys to trigger abilities you’ll be very much at home here. Combined with the lovely look of the environments and the solid performance, there’s really no reason not to opt for the PC as your weapon of choice when it comes to Mass Effect: Andromeda.  Mass Effect: Andromeda| Tech Review| Bioware| EA Try these free to play games ?

Not only are the animations lengthy (~10s to zoom into current planet, rotate camera towards next planet, then fly across space and slow to arrive at new selected planet), but the FPS also hits hard there. I've been running on a 970 with the High preset, getting an average around 70 fps in open world gameplay. The galaxy map is hammering that down to an average 20-25fps (I've seen as low as 18 when it zooms the camera around the asteroid clusters). I hope this isn't because of the 970's ram issue. If that's the case then it may take dropping the textures of the map, or finding a way to limit the engine to only use 3.5gb of the GPU's ram maximum. 1 Reply using your Steam account 306 Rock1m1 1 Day ago Lots of hitches, frame rate is good but frame times must be very very uneven. 1 Reply using your Steam account 1 Lingo 1 Day ago I'd like to see how the game runs with different CPUs.

According to a report in Forbes on Friday, when a user tries to run Windows Update, Windows is unable to search for new updates generating a message "Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error". "As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support. This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon," the report quoted a Microsoft spokesperson as saying. Micosoft is making sure its runs new silicon on latest Windows and install them on most new-build PCs running these processors. "While there will be user benefits to this strategy, it also means that Microsoft is taking away a measure of control from users," the report noted. Intel Skylake processors will also not be supported on Windows 7 and 8 from July. Therefore, its users will have to upgrade to keep the updates coming. --IANS qd/na/nir SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features BJP's Yogi Adityanath takes charge of Uttar Pradesh Modi's Yogi Adityanath pick baffles the political pundits Goa assembly elections 2017: Winners Punjab Assembly Polls: Prominent winners and losers Early Holi for BJP after historic victory in UP About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2017.

Pipeline statistics queries allow applications to query a set of Vulkan pipeline counters and is further explained via the the Vulkan documentation. This pipelineStatisticsQuery for ANV was done by Jason Ekstrand and Ilia Mirkin. This support for pipeline statistics query landed last night across several commits. This crosses another item off their TODO list and one less Vulkan device feature that needs to be implemented by ANV. The ANV TODO list is now getting quite slim aside from performance-related optimizations.

Reduced Energy Microsystems pits startup chip chops against industry giants Posted Mar 16, 2017 by Devin Coldewey 0 SHARES Next Story Instagram is the latest nexus of the Marines photo sharing scandal Advertisement Whether or not you like the so-called Internet of Things, the fact is that we do live in an internet of things, and every one of those things has a chip inside it. These chips are very advanced, of course, but also in many ways very traditional. Reduced Energy Microsystems wants to upend the status quo with a chip tech that could seriously improve the AI and computer vision capabilities of everyday devices — but that the competition is too set in their ways to adopt. REM is one of Y Combinator’s latest picks, and the accelerator helped connect them with Draper Associates, which was impressed enough to fund a $2 million seed round. There are plenty of ways to improve the performance of our devices, be they cameras or mobile phones. You can improve the software: moving from Windows 8 to Windows 10, for instance. You can improve the architecture: moving from 32-bit to 64-bit. And you can improve at the level of the chip itself, which is where REM is hoping to make its mark. Related Articles X-ray technique creates nanometer-scale 3D reconstructions of computer chips As Xiaomi’s home market share slips, the smartphone maker reportedly looks to build its own chips WTF is machine learning? Of course, chips are being improved constantly — there are new ones every year. But Intel or ARM, x64 or x86, Core or Ryzen, they’re all what’s called synchronous. That means there’s a clock somewhere that ticks forward millions of times a second, syncing all its little operational units together and producing the familiar “gigahertz” speed metric. But in these CPUs, the overall speed is limited by the speed of the clock. What if a certain operation, like a simple logic step, is done in an even smaller fraction of a second than the clock duration? Part of the CPU is just sitting there, waiting. And while a fraction of a fraction of a second doesn’t sound like much, if it’s happening in thousands of places, millions of times, it starts adding up real quick. Multiple cores and threads address this issue somewhat, but can also multiply the severity. If only there were a way to remove those operations from the tyranny of the clock… In fact, there is! Asynchronous processing lets calculations proceed at their own pace, saving time and power. Chip makers have known about it for a long time — but they’ve dedicated so many resources for so long to synchronous that there’s no chance of seeing one hit the market. REM plans to change that. I spoke with Eleazar Vega-Gonzalez and William Koven, two of REM’s three co-founders, about the company’s hopes and claims. “When you look at the embedded mobile space, you have this talk of big/little, right?” said Vega-Gonzalez, the company’s software head. “You have this wimpy ARM core that handles the easy things, then when the user starts doing something more complex, it switches over to the bigger, beefier core. That’s fine, that’s a good solution for now… but what we’re able to do is take one single core and dynamically throttle it down or up.” That throttling goes to much greater extremes than existing chips, again due to the asynchronous nature; the same chip can operate at a fraction of a volt for some purposes, then ratchet up the power smoothly and on demand. A prototype chip on a test board – the production chip is smaller, naturally. But it isn’t some exotic fabrication process — the costs of which have inhibited startups in this space for years — nor is it yet another esoteric new discipline or architecture for coders to learn. “We figured out how to use all the same design tools as the rest of the industry, and when we implement an ARM core, it still looks like an ARM core to the programmer,” said Koven, the CEO. “And users won’t see a difference, they’ll just see a part that runs better. What we do is all in between those two pieces.” The result is a standard chip that can operate at super-low voltages so it can run the bare necessities needed to run, say, a home security camera. But when necessary, it can spin up and perform facial recognition algorithms more efficiently than a traditional chip of equivalent power. So you add capabilities while improving energy efficiency — by 3 or 4 times or more, depending on the application. Perhaps it sounds a little too good to be true. If asynchronous chips are so cool, how come existing chip giants haven’t gotten in on the game? Koven, who worked at Intel for years, said they’ve purged it from their DNA. “I spent a lot of time looking for a home for this at Intel,” said Koven. “Asynchronous is kind of a dirty word at Intel. It’s just too different from what they do as an organization. They’ve thrown out a lot of technologies like this because they’re different and scary.” “It’s been tried a few times and historically what’s happened is you see these benefits but it takes way longer to get to market,” said Vega-Gonzales. “Something we’ve emphasized a lot is our internal tooling, so that we can move faster than the rest of the industry — which is exactly what lets software startups beat or exceed bigger companies.” The company is looking at things like police body cameras, DVRs, drones, and security cameras, where manufacturers and developers are looking for a way to improve their offering with state of the art features while not breaking the bank or draining the battery. The work of creating the chips is largely done, and integration with products is what the company is testing now; they expect to have prototypes by the end of the year. REM is Y Combinator’s first chip startup, but the program seems to have been helpful even if its focus is ordinarily more on software. “There was kind of a consistent push to move quickly and focus on the business and customer relations kind of thing,” said Vega-Gonzales. Technical hardware startups, it should come as no surprise, are at great risk of whiffing the product side of things and, you know, the money-making piece. “For Draper… they really believe in the future we’re trying to enable,” said Koven. “They see it’s going to take more than software to do that. And the semiconductor industry is stagnating in so many ways.” It’s not an easy space to break into for technical, market, and monetary reasons; the idea of a startup designing and making its own fundamentally different chips isn’t an easy one to swallow. So one has to admire the chutzpah with which REM is happily marching to battle. They believe in their product and it seems really to be different from anything else out there right now; with luck and ingenuity (and a couple million bucks) they may be able to get the ball rolling with some customers hungry for change in a predictable market.

Those explorations have raised concerns about Ryzen's simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) implementation, interactions between Ryzen's core layout and the Windows 10 scheduler, and to a lesser degree, the chip's Turbo behavior. That growing clamor has had many, myself included, waiting for some kind of official response, and now we have one. Just a little under two weeks from launch, AMD says that Ryzen is working just fine for the most part, and that no major changes should be expected in Windows or elsewhere to correct perceived performance issues—especially those observed by some testers in Windows 7 versus Windows 10. Instead, the company says it's working with developers to deliver "targeted optimizations" for software that "can better utilize the topology and capabilities of [AMD's] new CPU." The company also says it's aware of "many small changes that can improve Ryzen performance in certain applications," and that it's investigating some games that appear to exhibit performance regressions when Ryzen's SMT is turned on. AMD thinks those outliers can be fixed with "simple changes that can improve a game's understanding of the 'Zen' core/cache topology," although those fixes don't have a definite ETA. That attitude is consistent with PC Perspective's take that there will be "no silver bullet" for improving Ryzen performance. AMD's most concrete advice for Ryzen owners experiencing what they perceive as less-than-ideal performance is to click over to Windows' power settings and to enable the High Performance power plan, which the company says will reduce core-parking behavior and allow for faster frequency response when apps require it. The company says that optimizations for the default Balanced profile that are better suited to Ryzen desktop CPUs will be made available through an AMD-provided update by the first week of April. Not to be too smug about it, but AMD's statements about Ryzen CPUs' performance bolsters my confidence that we delivered sound numbers about these chips' performance from day one. We didn't see anything out of the ordinary from our test numbers at the time of publication, and our only complaints about the platform stemmed from some teething issues with motherboard firmware that Gigabyte has addressed with frequent updates since. Should AMD point out a specific application in our test suite from which we should expect significant performance changes, we'll retest it. Until that point, however, our basic conclusion—that Ryzen is a superb value for heavy-duty productivity and a solid gaming chip, to boot—will stand.

Currently using: Corsair H100i GTX cooler i 7 7700k CPU Gigabyte Z170 HD3 motherboard. Idle temps in the CPU reading is around 32-33 degrees with am ambient temp reading of 28 degrees. However under load (Intel burn test) It fluctuates between 60-70 degrees and 99 degrees. Not sure what is going on. I checked the mount and it is on tight. There was thermal paste. I'm wondering whether a temp reading/monitor is shot on the motherboard? Why would it fluctuate that much? I though it was maybe the cooler, but this was happening on a different cooler...which is why I went out and bought the H100i thinking it was the cooler...

If IBT, it uses AVX extensions which overvolt CPU automatically and draw much more power which creates much more heat. P95 26.6 is perfect real world max usage test and you can expect IBT to be 20-30c over the P95 temps. But whatever you're doing, stop it, 100c is very high. If that's from p95 26.6 then you have an issue. Poor contact from heatsink which can be caused by poor installation of hardware and/or thermal paste. Also make sure fan is running on the Corsair and water pump. I assume it is because your corsair link picture shows RPMs on both.     Agent-A01 View Public Profile Find all posts by Agent-A01   (#8) dzy_1 Member Guru   Videocard: ASUS GTX 1070 STRIX Processor: i7 7700K Mainboard: Gigabyte Z170 UD3 Memory: 16GB DDR4 3000 Soundcard: Creative Xi-fi Fatal1ty PSU: 750w Corsair 03-17-2017, 21:58 | posts: 57 | Location: USA It was done in prime I took off the contact to check to make sure it was solid, and it was. The paste was well spread out and everything. And this was happening from my last cooler too, and that was an air cooler. Got the second readings and they were still the same after the reseat.

Also, have you tried resetting the bios?

It won't boot without it. The cooler is new so I don't think its buildup, and the cooling block temps are increasing but not up to 90 like the core. Plus it was happening on my old air cooler. Should I go and exchange the cpu for a different one to rule out the contact issue? Its a new chip so I'm still in the return period.

Since you are sure it's not a mounting issue, it could be the paste inside the CPU core and heatspreader have poor contact.. Only solution is to replace it or delid.

Either the GTX H100i is not functioning properly or it is a mounting issue. Have you used the right standoff screws? I have this feeling your cooling block plate is not properly touching the Intel processor heat spreader. Also please do not use Prime95 as it will go viral on your CPU much like to what Furmark does with GPUs (e.g. not a not realistic-stress workload) use something like Wprime or the internal AIDA CPU stress run or even the CPU-Z benchmark has a proper stress test Follow Guru3D on twitter - facebook and Youtube.     Hilbert Hagedoorn View Public Profile Find all posts by Hilbert Hagedoorn   (#22) dzy_1 Member Guru   Videocard: ASUS GTX 1070 STRIX Processor: i7 7700K Mainboard: Gigabyte Z170 UD3 Memory: 16GB DDR4 3000 Soundcard: Creative Xi-fi Fatal1ty PSU: 750w Corsair 03-18-2017, 19:16 | posts: 57 | Location: USA Well I was having issues with a different air cooler before this.

TAG Heuer on Tuesday unveiled the new generation of a US$1,650 (RM7,322) smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the US$890 Summit. Also on Thursday, Swatch Group Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc., and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” US$15,000 watches Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as US$10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about US$15,000.  The original version of the Apple Watch starts at US$269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP. So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represent a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honoured watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, which is Swiss-made, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra US$1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google, Apple Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and in February Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Models from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a US$17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a previous forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 per cent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 per cent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch this week forecast a rebound in US and European markets after previously reporting improvement in Asia and the Mideast. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got slightly less than 10 per cent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity by launching too many smartwatches,” Guy said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Hacked websites on the rise, Google confirms Singapore beats Silicon Valley for start-up talents, survey finds Adobe, Microsoft team up to share sales and marketing data Meet Bixby, Samsung’s new artificial intelligence assistant Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Cristiano Ronaldo wins Portuguese player of the year award Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles TAG Heuer gets smart with the Connected Modular 45 Is the MyKronoz ZeTime the future of smartwatch design?

EVGA has also included Gigabit Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 2 x USB 2.0 ports joined by a USB 3.1 Type-C port.     EVGA also says it has tweaked the hell out of the features on its SC17 1070, with the company giving the laptop a "full BIOS" implementation of overclocking abilities. If you push your EVGA SC17 1070 too far, there's even a hardware clear CMOS button that'll return you to factory defaults. EVGA also claims the SC17 1070 is bloatware-free, which is a great thing to see.   The new EVGA SC17 1070 is available now from their own online store for $2550, with the company throwing in an EVGA Torq X10 gaming mouse, and a backpack.

Here’s an overview of the 10 biggest European tech news items for this week: 1) Israel’s Mobileye is being acquired by Intel for up to $15.3 billion at $63.54 per share in cash, making it the largest acquisition deal for an Israeli tech company. 2) Lots of Spotify news, again: the Swedish music streaming giant is to make some music available only to paying customers in a major change to its service, as part of a negotiation with record labels that would reduce the amount of royalties Spotify pays for songs. You can now also navigate with Waze within Spotify (and access Spotify playlists from Waze). 3) Social media companies Facebook, Google and Twitter will have to amend their terms of service for European users within a month or face the risk of fines, a European Commission official said on Friday. 4) Swiss augmented reality startup WayRay has raised $18 million in a funding round led by Alibaba Group and has announced new partnerships to bring its AR tech to cars. 5) Evrythng, a London, New York and San Francisco-based provider of an IoT smart products platform, completed its $24.8 million Series B funding. The round was led by Sway Ventures with participation from Generation Ventures and Bloc Ventures and existing backers Cisco Investments, Samsung, BHLP, Atomico, Dawn Capital and Advance Vixeid Partners. 6) UK-based insurtech company Simply Business has been acquired by US-based The Travelers Companies for approximately $490 million. 7) Nokia’s head of mobile networks, the division which accounted for more than half of Finnish telecom network equipment maker’s sales last year, is leaving the company. Nokia said on Friday it would break out services as a distinct business group from mobile networks following the departure of Samih Elhage, who joined the company in 2012. 8) Amsterdam’s EV-Box, a supplier of electric vehicle charge points, has been acquired by French electric utility company ENGIE. 9) German fintech startup Solarisbank has just raised €26.3 million. Investors include the Japanese SBI Group, Arvato Financial Solutions, and Unicredit. 10) Russia found Apple guilty of iPhone price-fixing, potentially facing fines.

Still, if you're on the road all the time, it's just not convenient to haul around a gaming desktop. Over at Asus' ROG blog, the company is showing off the 15.6" Strix GL502VS and 17.3" Strix GL702VS. These machines promise to pack serious gaming speed into a size that won't cause back injuries if you have to carry it around all day. We'll start with the graphics card. These two new machines both come with a GeForce GTX 1070 and its associated 8GB of GDDR5 memory. That's a pretty good start. Asus pairs that potent GeForce with the buyer's option of a 120Hz 1920x1080 display or a 60Hz 3840x2160 display. Both displays use IPS LCD panels and support Nvidia G-Sync. The machines come standard with Intel's Core i7-7700HQ processor, a quad-core, eight-thread design that clocks up to 3.8 GHz. Either machine can take up to 32GB of DDR4 memory running at 2400 MT/s using a pair of SODIMM slots. You can also outfit them with both M.2 storage and a 2.5" drive. Asus offers SATA and NVMe M.2 SSDs and 2.5" SATA hard drives as purchase options. The hardware on offer is certainly powerful enough for us to call one of these a "desktop replacement", and yet both the GL502VS and GL702VS are only a little over an inch thick (3 cm). They aren't light, though—the smaller GL502VS weighs 5.2 lbs (2.4 kg), while the GL702VS weighs 6.4 lbs (2.9 kg). The extra weight likely comes from the high-powered cooling hardware, comprising two relatively large radiators and a pair of blowers that exhaust toward the back of the machine. Asus' blog post talks up the repairability of these two machines, and says that removing ten Philips screws is all that's required to replace all components, short of the motherboard itself. If you aren't willing to dig into your laptop's guts, you can still use three USB 3.0 Type-A connectors, a USB 3.1 Type-C connector, or a regular old Gigabit Ethernet jack to hook up other devices. The larger GL702VS gets its Type-C port upgraded to a Thunderbolt connector. The ROG blog doesn't talk about pricing or availability for the new laptops, but Newegg already has a listing for the GL502VS-DS71. This particular model includes 16GB of memory, a 128GB SSD, a 1TB HDD, and the 120Hz display for $1699. Tags: Mobile computing Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Submissions: tips@geekwire.com Andrew Toner. (Amplero Photo) Amplero, a marketing platform fueled by artificial intelligence, announced the addition of Microsoft and Amazon vet Andrew Toner as the company’s CTO this week. Toner comes to the position after working as a principal engineering manager in Microsoft’s cloud division for a year. Throughout his career, he has spent more than nine years working for the company in both the U.S. and the U.K. He also spent six years leading engineering teams at Amazon, including in AWS, and has served as a software architect for the Seattle Sounders and a mentor for the 9 Mile Labs incubator. He will drive engineering and operations strategy for Amplero, a particularly important role as the company is preparing to expand its platform. “Seattle is a hotbed for data-centric and AI technology advancements, and Amplero is no exception. They are at the forefront of the emerging artificial intelligence industry, and the work they are doing with machine learning and multi-arm bandit experimentation is completely transforming the way brands engage with their customers,” Toner said in a press release. “I am excited to join such an innovative group that is paving the way for this new category of marketing.” Marjorie Thomas. (LinkedIn Photo) — The Allen Institute announced this week that Marjorie Thomas will join the institute as CFO on May 8. Thomas is currently the CFO of media delivery software company RealNetworks, where she has worked for the past two years. She has also held senior financial positions at Intuit, Sony Electronics and Hewlett Packard. As the Puget Sound Business Journal reports, the job listing for the CFO position details a plan to double the headcount of the Allen Institute in a surge of growth. “We are fortunate to have such an experienced, accomplished and visionary business leader join our executive team,” Allen Institute CEO Allan Jones said in a press release. “I look forward to working with Marjorie as the Institute continues to accelerate foundational research and make a transformational impact on science around the world.” Maria Karaivanova. (Madrona Photo) — Madrona Venture Group announced the addition of two new employees: Maria Karaivanova joins the firm as a principal, and Alice Ryder will serve as the company’s director of investor relations. Karaivanova joins the company from Bay-Area IT services provider Cloudflare, where she spent five years leading business development. She also has past experience at Intel and Boeing. She will use that technological expertise to evaluate investment opportunities, focusing on enterprise and security. Alice Ryder. (Madrona Photo) Ryder was previously the VP of investor relations at King Digital Entertainment, which has produced mobile games including Candy Crush. She has also held leadership positions at Expedia and Clearwire. She will work with Madrona investors and continue to build out the firm’s C-suite program, which connects C-level leadership with Madrona portfolio companies. “Both Maria and Alice embody what we look for at Madrona, experts in their field who have a passion for working effectively with entrepreneurs and innovative ideas,” said Tim Porter, managing director, Madrona. “While they have been on board just a short time, each of them has already made meaningful contributions, and we are looking forward to working together in the coming years.” Ryan Windham. (Cedexis Photo) — Portland-based Cedexis — a well-funded startup that manages the transfer of things like app data, video, and other content — announced the promotion of Ryan Windham to CEO. Windham was previously Cedexis’ VP of product and strategy, prior to which he spent three years in leadership and executive roles at F5 Networks. Cedexis’ current CEO, Scott Grout, will become the company’s executive director. “A window of opportunity has opened for Cedexis, and I, along with the company, plan to move quickly and assertively to meet the challenge. Today’s DevOps teams are looking for truly cloud-native solutions to ensure reliable, efficient, and massively scalable application delivery for modern application architectures; Openmix provides exactly the platform to meet that need. We truly are in the right place at the right time and I look forward to leading the charge for the great change ahead at Cedexis,” Windham said in a press release. Don Antonucci. (LinkedIn Photo) — Don Antonucci, previously the president of Seattle-based healthcare provider Regence Blue Shield, announced this week that he is leaving the company to serve as the chief business development officer for San Francisco-based digital healthcare company 10xHealth. Antonucci had been a leader in various Regence branches for seven years. At 10xHealth, he will oversee business development for a young cloud-based digital health service that focuses on bringing down healthcare costs for its customers. “Today’s insured healthcare markets are ripe for transformation because premiums are too high and too much healthcare is suboptimal,” Antonucci said in a press release. “Poor outcomes, wasteful workflows and high error rates account for at least 30 percent of what we do in healthcare and as much as 70 percent of what we spend. I believe the adoption of 10xHealth’s advanced IT and risk management solutions will enable the nation’s most innovative health insurers to lead their markets with a ‘best care – best cost’ competitive position and accelerate their growth in share, revenues and earnings. Having the opportunity to join the team and help scale the adoption of these advanced solutions is something I wanted to be a part of.” Paul Farmer. (The Laurel Group Photo) — Pyramid Analytics, an Amsterdam-based developer of a business intelligence suite, announced that it has hired Paul Farmer as the company’s new CFO. Farmer is based in Bellevue, Wash. Farmer previously served as CFO of the San Francisco-based mobile marketing company Swyrv. At Pyramid, he will oversee the company’s global financial operations. His hiring was announced by executive talent search firm the Laurel Group. — Ossia, a Bellevue, Wash.-based startup developing wireless charging technology, added several new executives this week. Tim Beard, a former investment banker, joins the company as chief financial officer. He has held VP positions at Deutche Bank, Merril Lynch, and more. Doug Stovall has been named chief revenue officer. He was previously the CRO at marketing and advertising firm Mobivity. Preston Woo was hired as VP of corporate development and strategic alliances. He previously spent a year as the CFO of robotics company Sarcos, and formerly worked in business development at Bellevue-based invention lab Intellectual Ventures for three years. “Tim, Doug, and Preston are part of the team that will change the way world uses power,” Ossia CEO Mario Obeidat said in a press release. “Our technology is tested and more than ready for deployment. Our newest executives have the experience and skill sets to commercialize and scale real wireless power quickly.” Clare McGrane is a GeekWire reporter who covers life sciences, biotechnology and general assignment technology stories, in addition to producing the GeekWire radio show and podcast.

The brands bid to attract millennials with a technology the industry largely snubbed until consumers began turning away from traditional timepieces. Tag Heuer this week unveiled the new generation of a $1,650 (€1,080) smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel.  Richemont-owned Montblanc followed with the $890 Summit.  Swatch Group chief executive Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers in the middle of the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry.  Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple, and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be. Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. Instead they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear any watches, smart or otherwise.  Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while Tag Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15,000. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces.  The top five brands by sales — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest flurry of releases represents a change of heart for Richemont and Swatch.  Richemont chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watchstraps”.  Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.”  Bloomberg READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS business, technology, Montblanc, Tag Heuer, Tissot © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Did you know these six things about the struggling cybersecurity company? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 17, 2017 at 8:19PM Tech investors might recognize FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) as the hot cybersecurity IPO from 2013 that fizzled out over the following years. After going public at $20, FireEye soared to the mid-$80s before concerns about its valuation, lack of profits, cash burn rate, and a secondary offering torpedoed the stock. FireEye now trades at about $10, and its sales growth has flatlined, with analysts expecting just 1% sales growth this year. I've discussed the many shortcomings of FireEye's business model before, but today I'll focus on six lesser-known facts about this struggling cybersecurity firm. Image source: Getty Images. 1. The first cybersecurity firm certified by Homeland Security In 2015, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security certified FireEye's Multi-Vector Virtual Execution (MVX) engine and Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DHI) cloud platform under its SAFETY Act. That made it the first cybersecurity company to achieve SAFETY certification for its products, and reinforced its reputation as a "best in breed" threat prevention solutions provider. That's why FireEye was asked to investigate high-profile data breaches at Target, JPMorgan, Sony, and other companies over the past few years. 2. Its core technologies came from an acquisition FireEye was founded in 2004 as a security appliance maker, but it wasn't considered a major threat prevention player until it acquired Mandiant for $1 billion in 2014. Mandiant was founded by current FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, and used digital forensics and an aggressive "SWAT team" approach to contain data breaches. Mandiant rose to prominence in early 2013 after it published a report which implicated China in cyber espionage activities. Image source: FireEye. 3. Its founder has left the company FireEye's founder Ashar Aziz, who has been frequently hailed as a "technical visionary," orchestrated the company's early development of security appliances and oversaw its acquisition of Mandiant. Prior to founding FireEye, Aziz worked at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle) as an engineer and CTO. That's why Aziz's abrupt resignation from FireEye's board of directors last August stunned investors. FireEye said that Aziz's departure wasn't caused by any disagreements with the company, but rather a "desire to spend more time with his family here and abroad, and also to pursue new projects." 4. Its former CEO loved buyouts In 2012, FireEye hired Dave DeWalt, the former CEO and President of McAfee, as its CEO to prep the company for its IPO. DeWalt had a reputation for orchestrating buyouts -- he engineered the sales of Documentum to EMC in 2003, and McAfee to Intel in 2011. Neither company turned out to be a great deal for the buyers -- EMC sold Documentum this January, and Intel agreed to sell a majority stake in McAfee (rebranded as Intel Security) last September. As FireEye dipped below its IPO price in late 2015, many investors speculated that DeWalt would also try to sell the company. However, DeWalt resigned last June and was replaced by Mandia, which suggests that quick buyouts are now off the table. 5. It turned down several buyout offers Shortly after DeWalt's departure, reports claimed that several major suitors, including Cisco and Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), had tried to buy FireEye. A Bloomberg report claimed that FireEye had rebuffed the offers because they were lower than its expected buyout price of $30 per share. A Reuters report from earlier this year claimed that FireEye ended buyout talks with Symantec shortly after Mandia took over due to disagreements over the price. That time frame indicates that the talks occurred after Symantec announced the acquisition of BlueCoat for $4.7 billion, but before it agreed to buy LifeLock for $2.3 billion. 6. It's settling a big class action lawsuit It probably isn't surprising that FireEye is being sued by its investors. The company was hit by multiple class action lawsuits in 2014 after its secondary offering triggered a steep sell-off. The plaintiffs also allege that FireEye execs made misleading claims about the effectiveness of its threat prevention technologies. The Register recently reported that FireEye plans to settle these lawsuits for $10.2 million. That would only account for 1.4% of its projected revenues for the year, but it would also represent the second largest recovery ever achieved in a case argued in a California state court under the Securities Act of 1933. The settlement would also inevitably tarnish FireEye's reputation. The key takeaways FireEye might look like a tempting contrarian play, but the company is in serious trouble. It isn't pivoting from appliances to cloud-based services quickly enough to boost its top line growth, and Mandia's plan to grow margins by laying off employees could dull FireEye's competitive edge. Several of the facts I discussed in this article support that bearish case and indicate that FireEye might not ever revisit its IPO price again.   Leo Sun owns shares of Cisco Systems.

While these changes won’t be an issue for those with a stable internet connection, it will be of concern for users with limited service. To put it simply, Windows will force downloads of essential updates even when using a metered connection. In its current version, Windows 10 doesn’t automatically download and install software updates when on limited internet connections, such as those with strict data caps. But once the Creators Update is released, that will no longer be the case. Microsoft confirmed to SuperSite Windows that this change will only apply to “critical fixes” that are “required to keep Windows running smoothly.” Larger update patches will not be pushed, but Microsoft doesn’t offer any specifics about what the threshold is for downloads to be considered “large.” In other Windows new, Microsoft also confirmed that updates to Windows 7 and 8.1 are coming to an end for PCs with Intel 7th-generation Kaby Lake and AMD Ryzen processors. These latest chips will only be compatible with Windows 10 from here on out, while machines with older processors, such as Intel’s Skylake, will continue to receive Windows 7 and 8.1 updates for the next few years. Lastly, the company finally revealed that the time has come to bury Windows Vista once and for all. The much-hated operating system will no longer be supported after April 11th, meaning no more security updates will be released, critical or otherwise.

View All Posts Anytime a person worth $18 billion ups his stake in any stock, it’s worth considering the reasons he or she is doing so. According to Renaissance Technologies’ latest 13F, run by billionaire Jim Simons, the hedge fund added 8.2 million shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 254% increase from the quarter prior. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr However, just because his fund is buying doesn’t mean you should too. Here are three things to consider before jumping on the AMD stock bandwagon. AMD Stock — A Drop in the Bucket Renaissance Technologies’ 11.5 million shares represent $162.2 million in market cap through March 15, a 24% increase over the last two-and-a-half months; a mighty fine return. Ride the momentum would seem to be the play of the day when it comes to AMD stock, but remember one important thing: Simons’ $162 million holding is just 0.26% of the fund’s entire $63.2-billion portfolio. At the end of December, Renaissance’s portfolio had nine holdings larger than its AMD position — and that’s just counting the stocks whose names begin with the letter A. In total, the fund holds 3,218 companies, the largest investment being a $623.3 million investment in Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). The point I’m trying to make is that $162.2 million is a drop in the bucket for Jim Simons. Unless you can afford to lose your entire investment, it makes sense to diversify just as Rogers has done. A good place to start would be the PowerShares Dynamic Tech Sec (ETF) (NASDAQ:PTF), a momentum play that has AMD stock as its number one holding at 5.1% of the $135-million-portfolio. It’s not cheap at 0.6% annually but gives you a lot more diversification (if that’s what lets you sleep at night) with 46 holdings. You Gotta Make Money Unless you’re loaded like Jim Simons it makes sense to invest in companies that make money — AMD doesn’t and might not for some time to come. InvestorPlace contributor Ryan Fuhrmann recently discussed this very problem suggesting Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) might be a safer alternative. With Intel, you get a 3% dividend yield, $12.2 billion in free cash flow and a price-to-sales ratio of 2.9; AMD stock gives you no dividend, $13 million in free cash flow (that’s an M, not a B) and a price-to-sales ratio of 2.7, only marginally lower than Intel’s.

Nandini Ramnath Published Mar 17, 2017.   Phantom Films Mar 17, 2017.   Nandini Ramnath Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Vikramaditya Motwane’s Trapped is an allegory about present-day Mumbai as well as a lesson in screenplay deconstruction. The nail-biting drama sets narrative and philosophical snares for its lead character Shaurya, pushing him towards harm’s way ever so often to see how much he, the crew, and the audience can endure. For the bulk of the film’s 105 minutes, Shaurya navigates the equivalent of an obstacle course within the confines of the apartment in which he has been inadvertently locked. Victory is fleeting, and sparks of hope are quickly extinguished. Some of Shaurya’s tribulations could have been dispensed with in the interests of a tighter narrative, but Motwane mercilessly keeps his finger pressed to the wound, expertly evoking sighs and screams at just the right places. Some of the snares are foretold in the sly opening sequence, in which Shaurya (Rajkummar Rao) nervously woos his colleague Noorie (Geetanjali Thapa) at the travel agency where they work. The movie title comes right in the middle of Shaurya’s victory in winning over Noorie, who is engaged to be married. Play Trapped. Desperate to rent a house where he can live with Noorie, Shaurya moves into a 35th-floor apartment in a building that doesn’t have municipal clearances. When Shaurya gets locked into the boxy flat with grilled windows for days without water, food or electricity, his experience demonstrates that Mumbai is indeed a concrete jungle where a trap can lie halfway between the ground and the sky. Reverse shots amply demonstrate Shaurya’s diminutiveness in comparison to the low-rises and chawls that lurk below his building, appropriately called “Swarg” (heaven). The writing by Amit Joshi and Hardik Mehta, and Motwane’s direction, have a Lego set quality. Shaurya uses every element in the barely furnished apartment as a weapon towards his freedom. A rat drops by, pigeons flutter in, and a cockroach becomes a metaphor for life itself. But Shaurya is mostly alone, and since he is played by Rajkummar Rao, he becomes the movie’s thumping heart. Rao’s talent has been amply demonstrated in his previous films, and it reaches its zenith with Trapped. Despite inanimate objects and mute creatures to play off against, Rao brilliantly and effortlessly transforms the location and the movie into a battlefield of emotions. Shaurya wholly earns his empathy, one doughty move at a time. Since neither director nor actor embraces melodrama and sentimental short-cuts, Shaurya becomes a striking symbol of the Mumbai resident’s struggle to rattle the invisible cage in which he is imprisoned along with millions of others. Rajkummar Rao in Trapped. It sometimes appears that Mumbai cannot accommodate any more residential towers and office blocks. The megapolis is a byword for cheek-by-jowl existence, and the high-rises that have been shooting through the horizon in recent years are cynical proof that when the ground is packed, the only way to grow is upwards. Motwane brilliantly upends the idea that a sublime existence awaits those who wish to rise above the clutter. The higher Shaurya goes, the closer he gets to hell – most vividly demonstrated in the scene when he first enters his assumed paradise and takes in the view with a satisfied grin. What he is actually seeing, and what Motwane dexterously demonstrates, is a nightmarish vision of present-day Mumbai. The city is a silent member of the cast. It gives Shaurya the power to dream, but bares its teeth from beyond the grilled windows through which he yells for help. His screams ricochet through the air, and he learns the hard way that in Mumbai, you are well and truly on your own even in the middle of a crowd. Mumbai isn’t the only villain of the piece. Geetanjali Thapa’s Noorie is a bit of a tease, never quite returning Shaurya’s ardour in full measure and never quite shedding her share of the blame. In King Kong, it was “beauty killed the beast”. In Trapped, Shaurya’s endurance test is the result of falling in love. The big “what if” in this meticulously written and directed film isn’t “What if Shaurya hadn’t left his key in the lock?” It is “What if he hadn’t lost his heart in the first place?” The city is hell, and the Devil is disguised as a woman.

Published Mar 07, 2017.   Posted on Flickr.com by Design Milk Mar 07, 2017.   Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Homes in India are evolving to become works of art as home owners look to express their taste and lifestyle through design. It’s no surprise that global home design platform Houzz saw over a million visitors every month from India, even before their services were locally available. Architects and homeowners are spending enormous time and effort over structural elements as well as interior features, to create beautiful and comfortable living spaces. Here’s a look at the top trends that are altering and enhancing home spaces in India. Cantilevers. A cantilever is a rigid structural element like a beam or slab that protrudes horizontally out of the main structure of a building. The cantilevered structure almost seems to float on air. While small balconies of such type have existed for eons, construction technology has now enabled large cantilevers, that can even become large rooms. A cantilever allows for glass facades on multiple sides, bringing in more sunlight and garden views. It works wonderfully to enhance spectacular views especially in hill or seaside homes. The space below the cantilever can be transformed to a semi-covered garden, porch or a sit-out deck. Cantilevers also help conserve ground space, for lawns or backyards, while enabling more built-up area. Cantilevers need to be designed and constructed carefully else the structure could be unstable and lead to floor vibrations. Butterfly roofs. Roofs don’t need to be flat - in fact roof design can completely alter the size and feel of the space inside. A butterfly roof is a dramatic roof arrangement shaped, as the name suggests, like a butterfly. It is an inverted version of the typical sloping roof - two roof surfaces slope downwards from opposing edges to join around the middle in the shape of a mild V. This creates more height inside the house and allows for high windows which let in more light. On the inside, the sloping ceiling can be covered in wood, aluminium or metal to make it look stylish. The butterfly roof is less common and is sure to add uniqueness to your home. Leading Indian architecture firms, Sameep Padora’s sP+a and Khosla Associates, have used this style to craft some stunning homes and commercial projects. The Butterfly roof was first used by Le Corbusier, the Swiss-French architect who later designed the city of Chandigarh, in his design of the Maison Errazuriz, a vacation house in Chile in 1930. Butterfly roof and cantilever (Image credit: Design Milk on Flickr.com) Skylights. Designing a home to allow natural light in is always preferred. However, spaces, surrounding environment and privacy issues don’t always allow for large enough windows. Skylights are essentially windows in the roof, though they can take a variety of forms. A well-positioned skylight can fill a room with natural light and make a huge difference to small rooms as well as large living areas. However, skylights must be intelligently designed to suit the climate and the room. Skylights facing north, if on a sloping roof, will bring in soft light, while a skylight on a flat roof will bring in sharp glare in the afternoons. In the Indian climate, a skylight will definitely reduce the need for artificial lighting but could also increase the need for air-conditioning during the warm months. Apart from this cleaning a skylight requires some effort. Nevertheless, a skylight is a very stylish addition to a home, and one that has huge practical value. Staircases. Staircases are no longer just functional. In modern houses, staircases are being designed as aesthetic elements in themselves, sometimes even taking the centre-stage. While the form and material depend significantly on practical considerations, there are several trendy options. Floating staircases are hugely popular in modern, minimalist homes and add lightness to a normally heavy structure. Materials like glass, wood, metal and even coloured acrylic are being used in staircases. Additionally, spaces under staircases are being creatively used for storage or home accents.

However, ‘exposed’ bricks, that is un-plastered masonry, is becoming popular in homes, restaurants and cafes. It adds a rustic and earthy feel. Exposed brick surfaces can be used in home interiors, on select walls or throughout, as well as exteriors. Exposed bricks need to be treated to be moisture proof. They are also prone to gathering dust and mould, making regular cleaning a must.

Don’t underestimate cement and concrete when it comes to design potential. Exposed concrete interiors, like exposed brick, are becoming very popular. The design philosophy is ‘Less is more’ - the structure is simplistic and pops of colour are added through furniture and soft furnishings.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation Intelligence Committee Chairman Nunes: Trump Tower Was Not Physically Wiretapped (VIDEO) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Intelligence Committee Chairman Nunes: Trump Tower Was Not Physically Wiretapped (VIDEO) Posted at 11:00 am on March 19, 2017 by Jay Caruso Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Just over two weeks since President Trump said his phones were tapped by President Obama; it’s still in the news. That’s due primarily to Trump and his communications team refusing to acknowledge there is zero allegation to confirm the claim. They persist in standing behind the claim, and each day it’s in the news, is one less day they have to talk about important issues like the replacement of Obamacare. This morning, Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes was on Fox News Sunday and said, flat out, there was no physical wiretapping of Trump Tower. Watch: Devin Nunes: After talking with FBI, still no evidence Obama tapped Trump Tower pic.twitter.com/OLYWB9z096 — Tommy Christopher (@tommyxtopher) March 19, 2017 Trending The Founders' Intent for the First Amendment Ed Willing The hilarious aspect of this is Trump supporters citing the New York Times of all places to push back against people like Nunes. The story from January 20th contains the word “wiretapping” and that’s enough for Trump supporters to say he’s right. There’s only one problem. The NY Times story says nothing about Trump Tower or Trump’s phones.  Joe Scarborough of MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe’ saw Nunes on television and tweeted the following: Three Sundays later, the GOP House Intel chairman confirms that Trump's own Justice Dept admits that Donald Trump was lying about wiretaps. https://t.co/8nutLNFl1Q — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 19, 2017 Mr. President, stop lying, stop trashing allies and stop making a fool of yourself. Just do what the rest of us do and say you screwed up. https://t.co/pybxiXPXJC — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 19, 2017 Sorry Joe, that is never going to happen.

That’s because Israel is set to be included soon in an international bond index that economists expect to attract large investments to Israeli government-issued bonds – and further pressure on the shekel to appreciate, as even more foreign currency chases shekels. The Citigroup World Government Bond Index (WGBI) measures the sovereign debt of 22 of the most advanced economies in the world. According to a report that Bizportal said will be issued by Citigroup next week, Israeli bonds are very close to meeting the criteria required for listing in the index – an annual bond market value of over $50 billion, 40 billion euros, and 2.5 trillion yen. In recent months, Israel has surpassed the criteria in euro and yen, and is about $2 billion away from the dollar amount. That gap is set to be closed in the coming months, according to the study, as the government is set to issue another bond offering worth NIS 3.2 billion ($900 million) by the end of March. Entry of Israel into the WGBI, according to the report, will attract more investors to Israeli government securities. “Israeli bonds have long been on the radar of investors, and as soon as the dollar amount of bonds will meet our criteria, we estimate that it will not take long to include Israel in the index,” it said. Bizportal quoted officials in the Finance Ministry as expressing hesitation at the prospect of Israel’s inclusion in the index. According to the officials, the Bank of Israel would likely prefer not to have Israel listed in the index, as it will bring more investor money into the economy – as much as $2 billion – as Israel would be weighted at between 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent of the WGBI’s $3 trillion value. But the decision is Citigroup’s, the bank’s report said. “We realize that including Israel in the index is likely to strengthen the shekel even further,” the report said. “It remains to be seen how the Bank of Israel will deal with this.” The further pressure on the shekel comes after last week’s buyout of Mobileye by Intel, a deal which will stream billions of dollars into Israel. According to foreign currency trading experts FXCM Israel, “the Mobileye deal is likely to attract more investors to Israel,” as the “smart money” seeks out other Israeli tech investments. “The rush of investments is likely to further increase the value of the shekel,” the firm said, citing what it calls the “Mobileye Effect, which has been raising consciousness among investors around the world in the wake of the biggest tech deal in Israel’s history, and in Intel’s history as well.” Filed under: Economy Print Email Gmail Related Experts: Dollar Could Sink vs. Shekel After Positive Economic News Dollar Falls Again After Bank of Israel $200M Intervention New Challenge for Struggling Dollar: ‘Mobileye Effect’ Report: Bank of Israel Will Let Shekel Rise $1.5 Billion Israel Bond Issue Completed More in Israel A Purim Prank Too Far?

Reuters/Eric Gaillard Samsung has tried targeting working professionals with its newly unveiled Galaxy Book. The Apple iPad Pro is more like a high-powered tablet that some may feel is slightly over-priced. The Galaxy device is a tablet that can be a direct replacement for a laptop. The Samsung device has Windows 10 operating system, stylus and keyboard as a bundle. It provides a desktop feel to the tablet, more than the Apple device. The Super AMOLED screen is also a unique selling point for the tablet. However, it will be interesting to see whether the Samsung Galaxy Book can convert Apple loyalists and make them switch. New Atlas has compared the two devices with screen sizes 12-inch for the Book and 12.9-inch for the iPad Pro. Various other sizes are available along with slightly different configuration. Both devices are tablets first and have optional keyboard accessories that convert them into viable laptop replacements. The Samsung device is a bit thicker and is a smaller device. In the landscape orientation, it is however five percent shorter and 11 percent narrower. The Book is heavier than the iPad though both have aluminium build. While the Galaxy device is available in Silver and Black colour options, the Apple tablet comes in Silver, Gold and Gray. The iPad has a 4:3 display compared to the 3:2 display of Galaxy tab. The Samsung Galaxy Book has a display resolution of 2,160 x 1,440 pixels and 216ppi, making it a bit less sharper than Apple tablet’s 2,732 x 2,048 pixels and 264ppi. While both the tablets have their own advanced styluses, the 12-inch Galaxy Book has the battery-free S Pen included in the box. Apple fans have to shell out $99 for the stylus. The Apple Pencil charges via the Lightning Port. Even the keyboard accessories have to be bought separately for Apple, though Samsung includes them. While the Apple iPad Pro only has the 4GB RAM option, the Galaxy Book comes with a 4 or 8GB RAM option. The latter uses a seventh generation Intel core i5 chip, whereas the Apple device has the A9X processor. 128 and 256GB storage options are available for the Galaxy device. The iPad Pro is available in three storage variants, though the 32GB model is available only in the Wi-Fi model. Apple has no microSD option but Samsung has. Even though the Samsung model packs more megapixels in its camera, the iPad Pro is equally efficient in taking amazing photos. Both are available in standard Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + LTE variants and have similar battery capacities. The USB Type-C ports are included in the Samsung Galaxy Book, while the Apple iPad Pro only has the Lightning port for charging and data transfer. Biometric login is only present in the Apple tab. One runs on Windows 10 while the other on iOS 10.

With over 20 years of trading experience, Mark has amassed a wealth of knowledge with regards to training and teaching online traders across the world. Mark is a recognised pioneer in the retail currency trading industry and has achieved great success since forex trading was introduced to the retail online trading market in 1997. He founded PowerTraders in Vancouver Canada in 1997, the first educational company offering training classes for forex training and during his career he was employed as a forex instructor by the Online Trading Academy. Mark graduated 1981 from the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, earning a Bachelor of Arts Degree with Specialized Honors. Website: www.xtrade.com 19 March 2017 Changes in the global political climate have resulted in increasing uncertainty in trading markets and economies around the world. For investors, this could be either a great time to invest in assets or a better time to protect their net worth. Although positions may vary, the one thing that many economists believe is that inflation is set to rise in the lead up to 2020. The introduction of value-added tax (VAT) could push the cost of living and doing business within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region higher. This is because VAT will increase business costs and this will be passed on to the consumer which would, eventually, lead to a rise in prices and therefore result in inflation. For the United Arab Emirates, inflation rates are projected to reach 2.5 percent by Q4 of 2017 and potentially reach 3.3 percent by 2020. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is projected to realise a 3.5 percent inflation rate in Q2 of 2017 and forecast to reach 3.1 percent by 2020. On the other hand, with the adoption by the Bahrain Finance Minister and the Shura Council in Saudi Arabia of the GCC Value Added Tax (VAT) Framework Agreement, greater regional integration and commerce can be expected in 2018 when compliance is set to begin. This has the potential to lower compliance costs and to be highly stimulative, generating new business opportunities throughout the region.  Given that the economy is set to grow and inflation is forecast to rise it is evident that individuals in the region need to educate themselves on how to protect their wealth in real-terms and make decisions that will enhance the opportunity to achieve financial freedom. Advertisement A diversified portfolio will usually help protect any individual from inflation. However, the portfolio needs to be balanced with commodities, stock and currencies that are carefully chosen based on how they react to rising prices. Gold is the one commodity that everyone should have in their portfolio. Gold is a store of value and when prices rise, so too will the price of gold, thus protecting an individual’s wealth in real-terms. Certificates of Deposit (COD) are quite popular in this region as people purchase and hold these from local and international banks for a certain period of time in return for interest. Usually speaking, the interest rate is higher than the inflation rate, however in some situations there is risk involved if inflation rises faster than interest rates. Another form of investment is Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) which are quite popular in the West as the principal is always adjusted to account for inflation. For example, if you purchase a $100 TIPS with a 2 percent inflation rate, then the principal amount after adjusting for inflation will now be valued at $102. TIPS are available in many countries and it is advisable to contact a bank and request more information about this kind of security. In terms of stocks, with the introduction of President Trump’s Manufacturing Council consisting of many C-Level executives from renowned multinational companies, it is worth mentioning that these companies are the forerunners when it comes down to shaping the future of the global manufacturing industry. Some of these companies include: Intel Corporation; Dell Technologies, Ford Motor Company, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, Tesla, Boeing, Under Armour, 3M and many more The potential for growth of these companies has significantly increased and by investing in them or perhaps the companies that they collaborate with in the automotive, technology, aviation, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries and more, will certainly contribute to protecting investors from inflation and increase their overall net worth in the long-run. Lastly, currency trading. Search engines, mobile newsfeeds and push notifications are keeping people at the forefront of what is happening during the age of information. Furthermore, online trading Apps like Xtrade empower investors to make trades in real-time. Global events shape the rise or fall of certain currencies and by being aware of the macro- and micro-economic environments, individuals can make educated decisions on which currencies are on path to inflation and make trades to mitigate the losses incurred from a weakening currency. Protecting oneself from inflation is not a simple task. It is very complex and involves a plethora of economic, financial and political factors. However, by equipping oneself with the knowledge on options and how to react, the chances to succeed in protecting the real-value of their wealth are in fact, quite high.

Since January there's been Zen tuning in LLVM Clang with the "znver1" flag, similar to the znver1 tuning in GCC that's been in place since 2015. While LLVM Clang 4.0 has the initial znver1 support, it's incomplete. In LLVM/Clang 4.0 and currently in SVN/Git master, znver1 is relying upon the btver1 scheduler model. Btver1 is for AMD's Bobcat. A PhD student has realized he can squeeze better AMD Ryzen performance of generated binaries by LLVM Clang if switching to Haswell's scheduler model rather than btver2, about 5~10% better performance of the generated binaries, but that's still not as ideal as having a proper Zen scheduler model for LLVM Clang. Dans Dibyendu of AMD India has responded to LLVM's lack of a Zen scheduler model, "Yes we are working on the scheduler and we will upstream by llvm 5.0." Longtime LLVM developer Hal Finkel also commented that while LLVM is good at being architecture independent, there isn't as much effort around AMD CPUs with their x86 back-end. This sounds due in part due to lack of as much AMD hardware and testers as they have on the Intel side, but they welcome AMD performance bug reports and information to help them optimize for AMD hardware. LLVM 5.0 won't be released for about six months, but hopefully the scheduler will soon be introduced in mainline LLVM so it will be easier for interested individuals to try out and see how it impacts the AMD Ryzen performance. I'll certainly run some fresh AMD Ryzen compiler benchmarks when the code is updated -- for now see my current Ryzen GCC compiler tuning and GCC vs. Clang Ryzen benchmarks. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

By Lawrence C. Strauss Biography November 29, 2014 The playbook never changes that much for Bill Nygren, co-manager of the Oakmark fund. Emphasizing fundamental research and patience, he looks for undervalued stocks that can overcome their discounts. (The fund’s annual turnover is 19%, versus an average of 61% for Morningstar’s large-cap blend category.) However, Nygren isn’t afraid to make a few tweaks. Following a big upswing in equity prices since the market bottomed in 2009, the Chicago-based manager is finding few attractive companies that sport a single-digit price-earnings multiple. So he has added some growthier names like Google (ticker: GOOGL), which... Get The Full Story Subscribe   or   Log In Want to participate in the discussion? Already a subscriber?

In November 2015, its Amos-5 satellite failed despite being less than four years old. Then, in September last year, it lost its Amos-6 satellite in a catastrophic explosion atop a Falcon-9 rocket when a ground-test went badly wrong. That explosion didn’t just cost Spacecom dearly in lost business, it also scuppered a potential sale of the company to a Chinese business. Spacecom has rented AsiaSat-8 for a four-year period to fill the gap of the lost Amos-6, and has an option for a 5th year if needed. AsiaSat-8 is now being marketed by Spacecom as Amos-7.  The follow-on satellite (and totally replacing the lost Amos-6) will be Amos-8 and is due for launch early in 2020 provided that the company can raise sufficient capital and corporate backing. Spacecom’s CEO David Pollack says that his business was “very much hurt” by the September explosion, and that it represented a major setback to its business. Talking to trade magazine Space Intel Report, he admitted that the satellite’s loss also meant the loss of a deal in place with Facebook. Pollack says that the building of its Amos-17 satellite is continuing (with Boeing) and that he was now in discussion with a launch provider for the satellite, which is due for delivery in early 2019.  Amos-17 will go to 17 degrees East upon launch.

Rob Marchant, The Conversation Published Mar 16, 2017.   Issouf Sanogo / AFP Mar 16, 2017.   Rob Marchant, The Conversation Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print A severe drought threatens millions of people in East Africa. Crop harvests are well below normal and the price of food has doubled across much of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and nearby countries. The last major drought in the region, in 2011, caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. They are becoming more frequent and more intense – and each has a disastrous impact on the economies of nations and livelihoods of people. So what is causing these droughts? And why are they becoming more common? At least part of the explanation lies with a climate phenomenon known as the “Indian Ocean Dipole”. The dipole, often called the Indian Niño due to its similarity with El Niño, is not as well known as its Pacific equivalent. Indeed, it was only properly identified by a team of Japanese researchers in the late 1990s. Sea surface temperature anomalies during Indian Ocean Dipoles. Arrows indicate wind direction, white patches are areas with more clouds and rain. Marchant et al 2007, Author provided The dipole refers to the sea’s surface temperatures in the eastern Indian Ocean off Indonesia, cycling between cold and warm compared to the western part of the ocean. Some years the temperature difference is far greater than others. We are currently coming out of a particularly strong dipole. At its peak, in summer 2016, the sea off the Indonesian coast was 1℃ or so warmer than waters a few thousand kilometres to the west. Temperature differences between east and west Indian Ocean. Author provided Warmer seas evaporate more water and, on this sort of vast scale, a relatively small temperature difference can have a big effect. In this case it meant there was a lot more moisture in the atmosphere above the eastern Indian Ocean. As moist air is cooler than dry air, this in turn affected the prevailing winds. Wind is simply the atmosphere trying to equalise differences in temperature, density and pressure. Therefore, to “even out” the unusually cool air, a warm, dry wind began to blow eastwards from Africa across the ocean. This is disastrous for farmers in the Horn of Africa who rely on moisture from the Indian Ocean to generate the “short rains” that run from October to December and the “long rains” from March to June. With winds blowing out to sea, the air was even drier than usual. The 2016 short rains were a month late and in some places failed entirely. Aid agencies warned the failure of these rains could trigger mass famine across northern Kenya, South Sudan, Somalia and eastern Ethiopia. Things will not improve any time soon. As with El Niño, global warming means the Indian Ocean Dipole has become more extreme in recent years. In East Africa, these severe droughts will become the norm. What can be done? There are no easy answers. However, while we cannot control the Indian Ocean, we can change the way humans interact with the East African environment, making communities more resilient to climate change. Past land use offers us some important clues. For example, a number of sites across East Africa demonstrate the impact of switching to more drought-sensitive New World crops such as maize. Maize was introduced in 1608 and since then it has largely replaced more traditional and drought-resistant crops such as cassava or sorghum. Maize provides excellent calorific returns in good years, but it often fails and has challenges around infestation and storage during drought years. Further lessons from history show us that pastoral communities have become less mobile. Livestock farmers are settling down and becoming increasingly reliant on irrigation and crop growing, which makes them more sensitive to drought. Competing demands to conserve land for wildlife add to the problems. Seeds of eight different crops would be planted in a single throw. In a dry year maybe only the sorghum and beans will survive – in a good year sunflowers and maize would germinate and grow too. Daryl Stump, Author provided There are a few things East Africans can do to ease the impact of climate change, especially droughts. Livestock farmers could share large communal “grazing banks” to act as an insurance scheme and spread the risk of pasture failure. Pastoral movements could be better managed to ensure areas do not become overgrazed and conflicts with conservation areas are minimised. Mountain forests could be valued more and managed better to capture useful water without the need for costly and vulnerable irrigation systems. And finally farmers could switch to varieties of crops that are better at coping with climate variability. The “Indian Niño” isn’t going anywhere, along with the regular and severe droughts it causes. People in East Africa must prepare. Rob Marchant, Reader in Tropical Ecosystems, University of York.

It’s no surprise that global home design platform Houzz saw over a million visitors every month from India, even before their services were locally available. Architects and homeowners are spending enormous time and effort over structural elements as well as interior features, to create beautiful and comfortable living spaces. Here’s a look at the top trends that are altering and enhancing home spaces in India. Cantilevers. A cantilever is a rigid structural element like a beam or slab that protrudes horizontally out of the main structure of a building. The cantilevered structure almost seems to float on air. While small balconies of such type have existed for eons, construction technology has now enabled large cantilevers, that can even become large rooms. A cantilever allows for glass facades on multiple sides, bringing in more sunlight and garden views. It works wonderfully to enhance spectacular views especially in hill or seaside homes. The space below the cantilever can be transformed to a semi-covered garden, porch or a sit-out deck. Cantilevers also help conserve ground space, for lawns or backyards, while enabling more built-up area. Cantilevers need to be designed and constructed carefully else the structure could be unstable and lead to floor vibrations. Butterfly roofs. Roofs don’t need to be flat - in fact roof design can completely alter the size and feel of the space inside. A butterfly roof is a dramatic roof arrangement shaped, as the name suggests, like a butterfly. It is an inverted version of the typical sloping roof - two roof surfaces slope downwards from opposing edges to join around the middle in the shape of a mild V. This creates more height inside the house and allows for high windows which let in more light. On the inside, the sloping ceiling can be covered in wood, aluminium or metal to make it look stylish. The butterfly roof is less common and is sure to add uniqueness to your home. Leading Indian architecture firms, Sameep Padora’s sP+a and Khosla Associates, have used this style to craft some stunning homes and commercial projects. The Butterfly roof was first used by Le Corbusier, the Swiss-French architect who later designed the city of Chandigarh, in his design of the Maison Errazuriz, a vacation house in Chile in 1930. Butterfly roof and cantilever (Image credit: Design Milk on Flickr.com) Skylights. Designing a home to allow natural light in is always preferred. However, spaces, surrounding environment and privacy issues don’t always allow for large enough windows. Skylights are essentially windows in the roof, though they can take a variety of forms. A well-positioned skylight can fill a room with natural light and make a huge difference to small rooms as well as large living areas. However, skylights must be intelligently designed to suit the climate and the room. Skylights facing north, if on a sloping roof, will bring in soft light, while a skylight on a flat roof will bring in sharp glare in the afternoons. In the Indian climate, a skylight will definitely reduce the need for artificial lighting but could also increase the need for air-conditioning during the warm months. Apart from this cleaning a skylight requires some effort. Nevertheless, a skylight is a very stylish addition to a home, and one that has huge practical value. Staircases. Staircases are no longer just functional. In modern houses, staircases are being designed as aesthetic elements in themselves, sometimes even taking the centre-stage. While the form and material depend significantly on practical considerations, there are several trendy options. Floating staircases are hugely popular in modern, minimalist homes and add lightness to a normally heavy structure. Materials like glass, wood, metal and even coloured acrylic are being used in staircases. Additionally, spaces under staircases are being creatively used for storage or home accents. Floating staircase (Image credit: Design Milk on Flickr.com) Exposed Brick Walls. Brickwork is traditionally covered with plaster and painted. However, ‘exposed’ bricks, that is un-plastered masonry, is becoming popular in homes, restaurants and cafes. It adds a rustic and earthy feel. Exposed brick surfaces can be used in home interiors, on select walls or throughout, as well as exteriors. Exposed bricks need to be treated to be moisture proof. They are also prone to gathering dust and mould, making regular cleaning a must.

Nandini Ramnath Published Mar 17, 2017.   Disney Mar 17, 2017.   Nandini Ramnath Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print The tale is “as old as time”, as the song goes, but Beauty and the Beast isn’t a day over 26 – the number of years since the release of the animated musical that inspired this live action movie. The current Disney production is a slavishly faithful and stubbornly old-fashioned reworking of the 1991 animated blockbuster of the same name. The plot remains slim and many of the songs and sight gags are repeats from the original film, as are nearly all the memorable side characters. The real achievement of Bill Condon’s 2017 production is its ability to replicate the complicated kinetic movements, visual effects and grand production design of the original film. Emma Watson is a feeble Belle, barely convincing as the great beauty who transfixes and transforms Beast, while the monster is as cuddly as he was in the cartoon version. But Condon spectacularly compensates by creating one dazzling sequence after the next, conjuring up vividly choreographed scenes and moments that provide welcome distractions from the overly familiar story. The most radical idea in Condon’s version is that LeFou, the sidekick of the arrogant chauvinist Gaston, is gay, and as much in lust with Gaston as Gaston is with Belle. LeFou (Josh Gad) makes cow eyes at the dashing Gaston (Luke Evans) and sighs when his friend tries to conquer Belle despite her disinterest. But LeFou’s sexuality is ultimately as mild as Belle’s independent streak and lack of prejudice, which allows her heart to start thumping for a beast that is a cross between an American bison and a minotaur. Play Beauty and the Beast. Based on Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve’s French story La Belle et la Bête in 1740, the story has been adapted many times, most memorably by Jean Cocteau in 1946. Belle is a merchant’s daughter who takes her father’s place as Beast’s prisoner, and she soon learns that a heart of gold lurks beneath the layers of fur. Cocteau’s movie had a grown-up Belle who matched the lonesome beast in size and stature. Watson’s Belle is a barely grown-up post-teen who fits snugly into the misshapen animal’s huge paws. Belle’s transformation from adversary to lover is as smooth and seamless as the swirling camera movements that showcase the gorgeous sets and costumes. Neither Belle nor Beast was the most important character as far as fans of the animated film were concerned. Beast (Dan Stevens) was a handsome prince cursed into ugliness along with the staff at his castle, and they retain their human speech despite becoming part of the furniture. The voice cast of the anthropomorphised household objects has tremendous fun bringing warmth and cheer to the gloomy castle – Ewan McGregor is the candelabra Lumiere, Gugu Mbatha-Raw is the duster Plumette, Ian McKellen is the clock Cogsworth, Emma Thompson is the teapot Mrs Potts, Nathan Mack is her son Chip and Audra McDonald is the wardrobe Madame de Garderobe. (Stanley Tucci, as the harpsichord Cadenza, is the only new addition.) Their antics are familiar from the animated film, but their return in a new format is beautifully realised. When the spell finally lifts, their relief to be human again is the most affecting passage in a film that is perfectly calibrated to deliver a stunning spectacle rather than a romance for the ages. The filmmakers know better than to take the overall message of deceptive appearances seriously. We welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in.

The latest controversy over the machines, which have greatly simplified the process of polling and counting votes, erupted when Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati questioned the Bharatiya Janata Party’s sweep in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls on March 11. She accused the BJP of tampering with the machines to manufacture the verdict and dared the party to hold fresh polls with ballot papers if it was so confident about its victory. Days before Mayawati fired this salvo against the machines, protests erupted in Maharashtra after the results of the municipal polls were declared. In several areas, losing candidates claimed more votes had been counted than the number that had actually been cast. In Mumbai, independent candidate Shrikant Shirsat was stunned when he polled absolutely no votes, even though he had voted for himself. Since March 11, when the results of the Assembly polls were declared, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party have also joined the call for a thorough scrutiny of the machines. The problem is the selective nature of the accusations. For instance, while the Congress has questioned the BJP’s sweep in Uttar Pradesh, it does not want anyone to cast doubts about its thumping victory in Punjab, where it won a overwhelming majority with 77 of the 117 seats. The BJP too has blamed the machines when it has fared poorly. Its senior leader LK Advani spoke about the danger of compromised voting machines when the party lost the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. The party’s Rajya Sabha member, Subramanian Swamy, had moved the Supreme Court against the machines. Such accusations have the ability to undermine trust in elections, especially if they are only made after polls and are forgotten later. The ideal way for political parties to deal with the questions around the machines is to initiate a debate in the Parliament and work out a process of comprehensive scrutiny. While political parties may play politics with the machines, the Election Commission of India bears the responsibility of allaying fears about their integrity. Even as it reiterated on Thursday that the machines are infallible, it would do well to consider demands for an open audit. After all, many developed countries have tried electronic voting and then given up on the system. It should also move ahead to swiftly implementing a system to tally the final count of votes with the voter-verified papers, a system that was used across all constituencies in Punjab whereby every vote produced a receipt to confirm that it indeed was registered to the party it was meant to. On Friday, the commission said it would cost Rs 3,174 crore to introduce this system and would take 30 months to implement after the funds are released. The commission must do all it can to scotch doubts about electronic voting machines. After all, a foolproof election process is vital to democracy.

Dig into the data a little and there’s a bit of a trend: the older women get, the more they want a low-cost wedding. “The preference for a simple wedding could signify that older women prefer to spend less and save more for the future,” the survey suggested. Curiously, with age, the inclination for a court wedding also comes down. Indian men, on the other hand, are a fickle lot. Except this one thing: by the time they’re 30, well over 40% of respondents want it easy on the pocket. The divide between men and women becomes clearer when broken down in simple monetary terms. Exactly half of male respondents don’t want to spend more than Rs 5 lakh, although significantly fewer women desire such frugality. Hence, the great desi wedding survives – just about. But women turn the corner by the time they pass their mid-30s. A massive 59% of respondents aged 36 or above don’t want to spend more than Rs 5 lakh for D-day – the single largest votary of low-cost weddings, cutting across age groups and gender. Wisdom, it is said, apparently increases with age. However, the male tendency of thriftiness is unmissable if one were to look at the big cost heads. Around 45% of men spend under Rs 1.5 lakh on jewellery, compared to only 39% of women who kept their bling budget under that mark. “While both males and females realise the importance of spending on jewellery, men tend to be more prudent in their spending as opposed to women,” the survey noted. For hospitality at the wedding ceremony, too, men were more reluctant to prise open their wallets. Just look at the numbers. (Also, now you know who to thank for that delicious wedding food.) It doesn’t end here. The male propensity for frugality gets even worse if you look at how much they want to shell out for a honeymoon. Some 75% of men – compared to 63% of women – spend less than Rs1 lakh on their honeymoon. And no, it’s not only older (grumpier) Indian men who want that bargain honeymoon. The spring chickens are the worst: 80% of men aged under 25 years won’t go into six digits for their first post-wedding jaunt. Kids these days. All this isn’t just male posturing, though. Indian men, the survey suggests, are actually better at sticking with those canny calculations. A little over 75% of married male respondents managed to pull off their wedding within budget, compared to only about 64% of married female respondents. And since this was a survey by a financial services firm, Tata Capital also slipped in a question about wedding financing: where respondents willing to take out a wedding loan to finance the entire or part of the wedding? A significant number – 37% of men and 49% of women – declined. Of them, 26% insisted that they had enough savings to pay for their nuptials. But 45% had an even better answer: I’ve never heard of wedding loans! This article first appeared on Quartz. We welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in.

Published Mar 07, 2017.   Posted on Flickr.com by Design Milk Mar 07, 2017.   Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Homes in India are evolving to become works of art as home owners look to express their taste and lifestyle through design. It’s no surprise that global home design platform Houzz saw over a million visitors every month from India, even before their services were locally available. Architects and homeowners are spending enormous time and effort over structural elements as well as interior features, to create beautiful and comfortable living spaces. Here’s a look at the top trends that are altering and enhancing home spaces in India. Cantilevers. A cantilever is a rigid structural element like a beam or slab that protrudes horizontally out of the main structure of a building. The cantilevered structure almost seems to float on air. While small balconies of such type have existed for eons, construction technology has now enabled large cantilevers, that can even become large rooms. A cantilever allows for glass facades on multiple sides, bringing in more sunlight and garden views. It works wonderfully to enhance spectacular views especially in hill or seaside homes. The space below the cantilever can be transformed to a semi-covered garden, porch or a sit-out deck. Cantilevers also help conserve ground space, for lawns or backyards, while enabling more built-up area. Cantilevers need to be designed and constructed carefully else the structure could be unstable and lead to floor vibrations. Butterfly roofs. Roofs don’t need to be flat - in fact roof design can completely alter the size and feel of the space inside. A butterfly roof is a dramatic roof arrangement shaped, as the name suggests, like a butterfly. It is an inverted version of the typical sloping roof - two roof surfaces slope downwards from opposing edges to join around the middle in the shape of a mild V. This creates more height inside the house and allows for high windows which let in more light. On the inside, the sloping ceiling can be covered in wood, aluminium or metal to make it look stylish. The butterfly roof is less common and is sure to add uniqueness to your home. Leading Indian architecture firms, Sameep Padora’s sP+a and Khosla Associates, have used this style to craft some stunning homes and commercial projects. The Butterfly roof was first used by Le Corbusier, the Swiss-French architect who later designed the city of Chandigarh, in his design of the Maison Errazuriz, a vacation house in Chile in 1930. Butterfly roof and cantilever (Image credit: Design Milk on Flickr.com) Skylights. Designing a home to allow natural light in is always preferred. However, spaces, surrounding environment and privacy issues don’t always allow for large enough windows. Skylights are essentially windows in the roof, though they can take a variety of forms. A well-positioned skylight can fill a room with natural light and make a huge difference to small rooms as well as large living areas. However, skylights must be intelligently designed to suit the climate and the room. Skylights facing north, if on a sloping roof, will bring in soft light, while a skylight on a flat roof will bring in sharp glare in the afternoons. In the Indian climate, a skylight will definitely reduce the need for artificial lighting but could also increase the need for air-conditioning during the warm months. Apart from this cleaning a skylight requires some effort. Nevertheless, a skylight is a very stylish addition to a home, and one that has huge practical value. Staircases. Staircases are no longer just functional. In modern houses, staircases are being designed as aesthetic elements in themselves, sometimes even taking the centre-stage. While the form and material depend significantly on practical considerations, there are several trendy options. Floating staircases are hugely popular in modern, minimalist homes and add lightness to a normally heavy structure. Materials like glass, wood, metal and even coloured acrylic are being used in staircases. Additionally, spaces under staircases are being creatively used for storage or home accents. Floating staircase (Image credit: Design Milk on Flickr.com) Exposed Brick Walls. Brickwork is traditionally covered with plaster and painted. However, ‘exposed’ bricks, that is un-plastered masonry, is becoming popular in homes, restaurants and cafes. It adds a rustic and earthy feel. Exposed brick surfaces can be used in home interiors, on select walls or throughout, as well as exteriors. Exposed bricks need to be treated to be moisture proof. They are also prone to gathering dust and mould, making regular cleaning a must.

Don’t underestimate cement and concrete when it comes to design potential. Exposed concrete interiors, like exposed brick, are becoming very popular. The design philosophy is ‘Less is more’ - the structure is simplistic and pops of colour are added through furniture and soft furnishings.

What’s going on? BMW announced some new plans for its lineup in the coming years. According to AutomotiveNews, the Bavarian automaker seeks to produce and sell fully-autonomous vehicles by 2021. Speaking with BMW’s senior vice president for the brand’s autonomous driving division, Elmar Fickenstein, a new BMW will arrive with “Level 3, 4 and 5” stage autonomous vehicles. Click here for more news on BMW.  What does that mean? Well, it doesn’t mean the 3-, 4-, and 5-Series will be the models to become self-driving capable. It means there’s a new classification system for autonomous vehicles, representing just exactly how autonomous capable they are. At the bottom, you have minimally to no self-driving capabilities. At level three and above, the more self-driving capabilities are equipped. Beginning with level three, the car is semi-autonomous with assistants like lane departure correction, or Mercedes’ latest adaptive cruise control. Levels four and five are fully-autonomous capable, like Tesla’s Model S with AutoPilot. When could we expect to see these cars begin testing? BMW recently teamed up with Intel and Mobileye to help develop the new computers to run BMW’s autonomous driving programs. BMW engineers will focus more on developing the handling dynamics and safety systems. The plan: have a fully operational fleet of autonomous 7-Series for real-world testing by the end of this year. – By: Chris Chin Source: AutomotiveNews Self-Driving BMW 5-Series at the 2017 CES   ← Report: Could a new Toyota MR2 be on the horizon?

Digital Trends Home > Computing > EVGA crams G-Sync tech in its overclockable gaming… EVGA crams G-Sync tech in its overclockable gaming laptop, the SC17 1070 By Kevin Parrish — March 16, 2017 5:01 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you PC gamers looking for a new laptop now have an additional choice that features Nvidia's G-Sync technology for fluid visuals. EVGA is now selling a version of its SC17 1070 gaming laptop packed with Nvidia’s G-Sync technology for $2,550 after an instant $250 rebate. This should be good news for PC gamers currently looking for the ideal laptop to play For Honor, Ghost Recon Wildlands, or the upcoming game Mass Effect: Andromeda. The new unit joins EVGA’s current SC17 1070 model without G-Sync technology selling for $2,400 after an instant $400 rebate. Does the $150 price difference make a difference? Simply put, if you’re paying $2,400 for a gaming laptop, will you be likely to go ahead and take the additional $140 plunge? As a brief review, the graphics chip outputs multiple frames per second (FPS) that are received by the display and flashed on the screen numerous times per second (refresh rate). If the graphics chip and the display aren’t synchronized, then gamers will experience ugly screen ripping, stuttering, and input lag. Annoying stuff. More: EVGA offers 10 GTX 10-series graphics cards with its new iCX cooling tech However, G-Sync eliminates these visual problems by dynamically adjusting the GPU’s output framerate with the refresh rate of the display for smooth visuals. But this technology doesn’t simply work with every GPU: it’s developed exclusively by Nvidia for its GeForce graphics chips. G-Sync isn’t something users can simply add to their PC either, as the tech is pre-installed inside displays. That said, G-Sync is highly desirable given that it improves visual fluidity on-screen. In EVGA’s laptop, it’s backed by Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070 with 8GB of on-board GDDR5 memory. This GPU is based on Nvidia’s latest “Pascal” graphics chip design, and resides at the top of the bottom half of the Pascal totem pole, residing between the GTX 1080 and the GTX 1060. At one point, the GTX 1070 was Nvidia’s second-fasted graphics chip, until the company unleashed the Titan X (2016) and the recent GTX 1080 Ti (2017). Still, the GTX 1070 remains a great graphics chip that’s backed by other excellent components in EVGA’s laptop: Operating System: Windows 10 Home (64-bit) Display Size: 17.3 inches Display Resolution: 3,840 x 2,160 Display Type: IPS with G-Sync Processor: Intel Core i7-6820HK (unlocked) Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 (8GB GDDR5) System Memory: G.Skill 32GB DDR4 @ 2,666MHz (2x 16GB) Storage: 256GB M.2 NVMe PCIe SSD 1TB 7,200RPM SATA 3 HDD Connectivity: Intel Snowfield Peak AC-8260 (Wireless AC) Bluetooth 4.2 Audio: Realtek ALC 255 Battery: Info not provided Camera: 1,920 x 1,080 webcam Keyboard Lighting: White Ports: 1x Gigabit Ethernet 2x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A 1x USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C 1x HDMI 2.0b 2x Mini DisplayPort Dimensions: 16 (W) x 11.6 (L) x 1.07 (H) inches Weight: 8 pounds Outside the specs, enthusiasts should love the notebook for its aluminum unibody design, the rich colors generated by the IPS screen, and its dedicated buttons for immediately overclocking the processor and clearing the CMOS. It also includes a BIOS with a full GUI to provide complete control over the laptop’s CPU multipliers, voltage, graphics chip speed, and more. “Overclocking on a laptop? Seems like a myth but we have nothing to hide here,” the company said.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) At midday: Investors focus on expected Fed hike, oil rebounds Add to ... Reuters Published Wednesday, Mar. 15, 2017 11:37AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Mar. 15, 2017 11:39AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Financial markets braced for what was expected to be a U.S. interest rate hike later on Wednesday as a gauge of global stocks edged higher and the U.S. dollar dipped, while oil pulled out of a six-session slide. The U.S. Federal Reserve was due to release it policy statement at 2 pm ET, with the central bank widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time in three months. Market participants will be watching for whether the Fed will signal an even faster pace of monetary tightening this year than the three rate hikes it projected in December. “The 25-basis point-hike is fully priced in, so that’s not even going to be a factor ... it’s more what the Fed’s path is going to be going forward,” said Societe Generale currency strategist Alvin Tan in London. Canada’s main stock index rose on Wednesday, led by the resource groups as prices of oil and metals rose, while financials fell slighly as the industry’s watchdog said it will review business practices at federally regulated institutions. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 53.50 points, or 0.35 pe rcent, at 15,433.11 at 11:31 a.m. ET. Seven of the index’s 10 main groups were higher. MSCI’s all-country world stock index gained 0.2 per cent. U.S. stocks were mostly higher on Wednesday, with investors counting down to the conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to raise rates for the first time this year. The Fed is scheduled to release its latest policy statement along with updated economic forecasts at 2 p.m. ET. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a press conference half an hour later. Traders have priced in more than a 90-per-cent chance of a quarter point rate increase, according to Fed fund futures. Attention is turning to whether the U.S. central bank will signal an even faster pace of monetary tightening this year than the current three rate hikes that it projected at the December policy meeting. The U.S. economy has been strengthening, with the labor market nearing full employment and inflation perking up. Markets are also betting on a potential economic boost from President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal policies. “Overall expectations are largely priced in that we will have a hike today and the question will be if the Fed will be a little bit more hawkish,” said Myles Clouston, senior director at Nasdaq Advisory Services in New York. “If inflation heads in the right direction, four hikes may be warranted. The key here is the Fed really needs to stay ahead of the curve so that they’re not in a difficult position where they have to raise too quickly.” The Dow Jones industrial average was up 38.96 points, or 0.19 per cent, at 20,876.33 and the S&P 500 was up 6.78 points, or 0.28 per cent, at 2,372.23. The Nasdaq Composite was up 6.38 points, or 0.11 per cent, at 5,863.20. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy index’s 1.07 percent rise leading the gainers. Oil prices rebounded on Wednesday, lifted by a surprise drawdown in U.S. inventories and data from the International Energy Agency suggested OPEC cuts should create a crude deficit in the first half of 2017. Shares of oil majors Exxon and Chevron were up about 0.4 per cent. Economic data showed U.S. retail sales registered their smallest increase in six months in February. Other data showed consumer prices barely rose in February but the underlying trend remained consistent with rising inflation. The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index ticked up 0.1 percent last month, after jumping 0.6 percent in January. Intel fell 1.13 per cent to $34.78 after Credit Suisse downgraded the chipmaker’s stock. Twitter was down 2.3 per cent at $14.96 after a number of prominent accounts on the microblogging website were hacked. Oil prices rose more than 1 per cent Wednesday, lifted by a surprise drawdown in U.S. crude inventories and data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggesting OPEC cuts should create a crude deficit in the first half of 2017. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks fell last week, dropping after nine consecutive increases. Inventories fell by 237,000 barrels in the week to March 10, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 3.7 million barrels. Adding to the bullish sentiment, the IEA said global inventories rose in January for the first time in six months despite OPEC output cuts, but said if it stuck to its production curbs the market should see a deficit of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first half. “For those looking for a rebalancing of the oil market the message is that they should be patient, and hold their nerve,” the IEA said in its monthly report. Brent futures rose more than $1 from Tuesday’s close to a session high of $52.08 a barrel. Prices were up 63 cents, or 1.24 per cent, at $51.55 a barrel. Prices had hit a more than three-month low of $50.25 during the previous day’s trading. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 63 cents, or 1.32 percent, at $48.35. On Tuesday, the price fell to $47.09, also the lowest since late November. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said at the end of November it would cut 1.2 million bpd during the first half of 2017, and in December that non-OPEC producers would cut about 600,000 bpd from their output. Despite OPEC compliance with its share of the cuts, stockpiles have continued to rise, in part because OPEC members pumped heavily before cuts kicked in and also because U.S. shale producers have raised output as Brent spiked above $58 in January. Last week, prices plummeted more than 5 percent, the biggest drop in a year, as U.S. crude inventories surged much more than expected to a record high. “While such patience (counseled by the IEA) may indeed benefit longer-term investors it may not be much help for money managers facing year-to-date losses on long positions, whether longer-term holdings benchmarked to the December 30 Brent closing price of $56.82 or purchased over the long period of range trading over the first ten weeks of the year.” Tim Evans, Citi Futures’ energy futures specialist, said in a note. “Surplus inventories and rising U.S. production may be more of a worry to them.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Audi searched in connection with Volkswagen diesel scandal (Reuters)   COMPNASDAQ NMS COMPOSITE INDEX Latest Price5,901.53 0.00 (0.00%) GC-FTGold Front Month Futures Latest Price$1,227.20 -6.40 (-0.52%) CL-FTCrude Oil Front Month Futures Latest Price$48.48 +0.26 (+0.54%) TSXS&P/TSX Composite Latest Price15,442.32 -48.17 (-0.31%) DJIADow Jones Industrials Latest Price20,905.86 -8.76 (-0.04%) SPXS&P 500 INDEX Latest Price2,373.47 -4.78 (-0.20%) Updated March 20 4:52 PM EDT. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

So what should we expect to see from the new administration regarding cybersecurity? To answer that question, we're bringing you audio from a conference hosted by Lawfare with the Hoover Institution in Washington and Intel Security and featuring a keynote address from Steve Grobman, Chief Technology Officer at Intel, along with a panel discussion on cybersecurity and Congress moderated by Carrie Johnson of NPR with Hill staffers including Brett DeWitt, Hope Goins, Allen Souza, Michael Bahar, and Brett Freedman.  Topics:  Aegis, Podcasts, The Lawfare Podcast Quinta Jurecic is a research assistant at the Brookings Institution, where she focuses on national security law and policy.

The loan, which WEDC provided under its Technology Development Loan Program, is part of a $1 million-plus funding round that Scanalytics recently raised, says Joe Scanlin, the startup’s co-founder and CEO. According to Scanlin, the round was led by CSA Partners, a VC group based in Milwaukee that had invested in Scanalytics previously. Outside of the money contributed by WEDC, the round consisted entirely of equity financing, he says. Scanlin says his company plans to use some of the proceeds from the funding round to recruit clients, which could come from industries such as retail, manufacturing, hospitality, and healthcare. The startup, which launched in 2013 and currently has 15 employees, also plans to hire more data scientists and engineers in the coming months. Scanalytics will likely try to raise another round of funding later this year, Scanlin says. The most recent round, which he called “pre-Series A,” will help finance operations in the meantime. The company’s products include square-shaped “SoleSensor” mats measuring two feet per side that are able to measure foot traffic and transmit that data to other Internet-connected devices. Scanlin originally built a prototype for the SoleSensor by tearing apart and repurposing a mat used to play the video game DanceDanceRevolution. Currently the mats, which can be linked together like floor tiles to cover a store entrance or an entire room, need to be plugged into a power source, Scanlin says. Scanalytics is in the process of engineering a wireless, self-powered version of SoleSensor, he says. A number of the startup’s customers, such as Microsoft, Intel, and Qualcomm, use software developed by Scanalytics, but not its hardware. Scanlin says that some organizations approach the company with the goal of linking together Web-enabled devices, part of the so-called “Internet of Things” (IoT) trend. “A lot of companies, both small and even Fortune 50 companies, come to us to help create smart environments,” he says. “[That] could mean they already have sensors, or they’re already using IoT devices in their space, but they’re disparate and they want them to connect with either each other, or to a common data source.” One Scanalytics customer, which Scanlin did not name, combines information collected by the sensors with point-of-sale transaction data and data on employees working the sales floor. “And then we have customers … that are looking at embedding entire buildings with [sensors], so they can use [the system] as a more permanent fixture,” he says. Scanalytics has customers in Canada, Europe, and southeast Asia, in addition to ones in the U.S., Scanlin says. The company has participated in at least three accelerator programs: Gener8tor, in 2013; Microsoft’s home automation accelerator, in 2014; and Seamless, a Grand Rapids, MI-based program for IoT-focused startups, in 2015. Asked whether Scanalytics is working toward an “exit,” either in the form of an acquisition or initial public offering, Scanlin demurred. “Right now, we’re really focused on building a strong, independent, profitable, company,” he says.

You couldn’t save your work for later because the computer’s memory is wiped every time the power is turned off. That world would be a world without non-volatile memory, the aspect of computing architecture which allows for the retrieval of stored information and which is unaffected by power cycles. A recent market research report from consulting firm MarketsandMarkets predicts that the global market for all forms of non-volatile memory, including flash, embedded and many other forms of memory, will increase by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.96 between 2016 and 2022, when the entire sector is expected to be worth $81.51 billion USD. This Wednesday, March 22nd, gives us an opportunity to chronicle an important anniversary in the development of one seminal form of non-volatile memory. Some 23 years ago, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued a patent for a flash electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) technology invented by Eli Harari, a 2017 inductee into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and a co-founder of the American flash storage developer SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK). Harari’s career spans a pair of the most revolutionary discoveries enabling data storage on portable battery-powered devices like smartphones and digital cameras and many of the computing devices on which this article is being read. Harari’s EEPROM is World’s First Electrically Programmable and Erasable Memory Eli Harari earned his Ph.D. in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Princeton University in 1973 and shortly thereafter was employed by the microelectronics division of Hughes Aircraft Company. Harari’s doctoral thesis focused on the use of thin film silicon dioxide (SiO2) to create a floating gate in transistors for the long-term retention of electrons. Harari was also focused on the concept of electron tunneling, a quantum mechanical effect in which the wave properties of an electron may give it a limited ability to sneak past a barrier. Harari’s work between the years of 1976 and 1978 laid the foundation for the invention of the floating gate EEPROM. Erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) was known at the time but that type of memory is not erased electrically, it was erased when exposed to ultraviolet light, making it problematic for use in embedded electronics. Harari’s work demonstrated that thin film SiO2 was suitable for the efficient and reliable conduction of electrons for both program and erase functions in a memory. Further, Harari’s device incorporated the quantum mechanical principle of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, or field emission, a process by which electrons can tunnel through a barrier in the presence of a high electric field. Fowler-Nordheim techniques increase the probability of being able to measure electrons trapped within a floating gate and allows for data erasure to occur by reversing the voltage of the electric field. Much of this pioneering work into 0-volatile semiconductor memory is reflected in U.S. Patent No. 4115914, entitled Electrically Erasable Non-Volatile Semiconductor Memory. Issued in September 1978, it claimed a process for fabricating a nonvolatile field effect transistor storage device including the steps of forming active field effect transistor regions including source, channel and drain regions, forming a first layer of dielectric material on top of the field effect transistor regions, forming a layer of resistive material on top of the dielectric material to form a first gate electrode, forming a second layer of dielectric material on top of and around the resistive layer to make the first gate electrode a floating gate electrode and then forming a second gate electrode on top of the second dielectric material layer and covering the entire length of the channel region. The close proximity of the floating gate electrode to the semiconductor body improves the reliability of using the tunneling techniques as a conduction mechanism for transferring charges between the floating gate and the semiconductor. System Level Flash EEPROM Architecture Replaces Hard Disk Drives Harari’s invention of EEPROM non-volatile memory kicked off a decade of major discoveries in solid-state memory for computing devices. Harari would leave Hughes to continue development in EPROM and EEPROM devices at Intel Corporation. Across the Pacific Ocean, engineers at Japanese electronics company Toshiba developed what became known as flash memory, so-called because the quick removal of blocks of data from a memory reminded one Toshiba engineer of a camera’s flash. Flash memory didn’t allow for the erasure of individual bytes in the way that EEPROM devices developed after Harari’s invention could but that simplified architecture allowed flash devices to store data more compactly. Also, although EEPROM devices allowed for the erasure of individual bytes, those devices must be totally wiped before new data could be stored while flash allowed individual blocks to be erased and rewritten without having to wipe the whole memory. Toshiba built a flash EEPROM device which employed thick SiO2 and did not employ Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and invented NAND-gate flash memory which did employ thin SiO2 and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. The conventional flash technologies of the late 1980s had drawbacks other than the inability to erase individual bytes. The reliability of flash devices was much lower in data storage write and erase activities compared to code storage as data storage applications had very low tolerance of error bits occurring over multiple write/erase cycles. Individual cells in flash memory had a tendency to break down over time, contributing to this problem. This only becomes exacerbated as flash memory devices were scaled up to meet the requirements of more complex computing architectures. Harari, still steeped in the development of non-volatile memory devices, thus recognized that a need existed to create a flash memory which could work on a system-level computing architecture. Having co-founded the SanDisk Corporation in 1988, Harari set about developing a flash memory array that could provide system-level reliability and reduce bit-errors to zero with a technology that proactively detected and replaced defective cells before any failures could develop. The flash EEPROM memory developed by Harari worked cooperatively with a controller for the detection and correction of defective memory cells. This important advance in solid-state memory is reflected in U.S. Patent No. 5297148, titled Flash EEPROM System and issued to Harari and two other inventors on March 22nd, 1994. It claimed a memory card connectable to a computer system having an array of EEPROM cells partitioned into a plurality of flash sectors, each flash sector a group of cells erasable together as a unit and having a portion reserved for redundant cells, a memory controller controlling operation of the EEPROM cells, error detection means within the memory controller that detects defective cells in the array, defect pointers generated by the memory controller linking a defective cell’s address to a corresponding redundant cell substituting for the defective cell and a defective cell substitution means responsive to the defect pointers. This results in a flash memory array which can last through a longer lifetime of write/erase cycles, thus providing enhanced performance and the capability to serve as non-volatile memory in a computer system and thus obviate magnetic disk storage devices which were conventionally used. Like many other innovations in computer architecture have been in the past, SanDisk’s System Flash architecture was too expensive to become much of a consumer success in the tech industry. However, as the National Inventor Hall of Fame’s bio for Harari notes, SanDisk continued to develop technologies which drove down the price of flash EEPROM devices by 100,000 thanks to the progress of Moore’s Law. One of these innovative technologies noted by the Hall of Fame were multi-level cells (MLCs) which stored two or three bits of data on each flash EEPROM transistor. Harari retired as CEO of SanDisk in 2010, one year after he received the IEEE Robert N. Noyce Medal awarded for exceptional contributions to the microelectronics industry. In 2012, the floating gate EEPROM developed by Harari at Hughes was declared to be an IEEE Milestone. That same year, Harari was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, which is awarded to innovators who have contributed to the economic, environmental and social well-being of the United States. Over the course of his career, Harari was listed as an inventor on more than 180 U.S. patents. A 2012 interview with Harari published by science and tech publication The Register reflected the inventor’s views that flash NAND memory would largely replace hard disk drives in all computing platforms by the end of this decade. Current flash memory developers are working on building 3D NAND chips with more than 32 gigabytes of data storage for smartphone platforms.

Speaking to reporters in Berlin, BMW senior vice president for autonomous driving Elmar Frickenstein said that the vehicle will have the ability to change between level 3, 4 and 5 self-driving, reports Autonews. “We are on the way to deliver a car in 2021 with Level 3, 4 and 5," he said. Mid-last year, BMW announced that it would work alongside Intel and Mobileye to deliver its first fully-autonomous vehicle. Creating a vehicle with level 3, 4 and 5 self-driving could prove a winner for the marque. Not only will it allow drivers the ability to take control if needed but it will be capable of driving itself with a driver inside without any human input. In level 5, it will have the ability to drive without a human on board, meaning owners could theoretically rent their vehicles out for automated ride-sharing or ride-hailing services to supplement their income.

But he sidestepped any blame for the White House decision to highlight an unverified report that Britain helped carry out the alleged surveillance. In brushing off the diplomatic row with perhaps America’s closest ally, Mr Trump also revived another – the Obama administration’s monitoring of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s calls. Angela Merkel and Donald Trump “At least we have something in common, perhaps,” Mr Trump quipped during a joint news conference with Merkel. Mrs Merkel, who was making her first visit to the White House since Mr Trump took office, looked surprised by the president’s comment. The Obama administration’s spying infuriated Germany at the time and risked damaging the US relationship with one of its most important European partners. Angela Merkel and Donald Trump Mr Trump’s unproven recent allegations against his predecessor have left him increasingly isolated, with fellow Republican as well as Democratic politicians saying they have seen nothing from intelligence agencies to support his claim. But Mr Trump, who rarely admits he is wrong, has been unmoved, leaving his advisers in the untenable position of defending the president without any credible evidence. JUST IN: Joint statement from Senate Intel Committee Chair Richard Burr & Vice Chair Mark Warner on lack of evidence for wiretapping claims pic.twitter.com/9X76tc0xWH— Gabby Morrongiello (@gabriellahope_) March 16, 2017 On Thursday, spokesman Sean Spicer turned to a Fox News analyst’s contention that GCHQ, the British electronic intelligence agency, had helped Mr Obama wiretap Mr Trump. Fox News anchor Shepard Smith said on Friday that the network could not independently verify the reports from Andrew Napolitano, a former judge and commentator who has met Mr Trump. The GCHQ vigorously denied the charges in a rare public statement, saying the report was “utterly ridiculous and should be ignored”. GCHQ According to a Western diplomat, Britain’s ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, had told the White House on Tuesday that Mr Napolitano’s assertions were not true. Still, it was among several news reports Mr Spicer referenced in his briefing on Thursday as part of an angry defence of the president’s claims. Mr Darroch and other British officials complained directly to White House officials after the episode, and Prime Minister Theresa May’s office said it had been assured the White House would not repeat the allegations. Sean Spicer Mr Spicer was very apologetic when confronted by Mr Darroch at a White House dinner on Thursday, the Western diplomat said. But Mr Trump himself offered no public apologies and suggested there was nothing wrong with the White House repeating what it had heard. “All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television,” Mr Trump said during Friday’s news conference. “You shouldn’t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox.” Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

(AP) — Just because President Trump may weaken U.S. fuel economy requirements, don’t expect gas guzzlers like the giant 13 mpg Hummer H1 to make a comeback. Executives from automakers and suppliers gathered at a conference said looser fuel economy standards might allow for sales of more trucks in areas where they’re popular. But otherwise, the pursuit of fuel-efficiency technologies would proceed unabated. ___ S&P 500 limps to the finish line in another winning week NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks limped into the weekend with mixed results on Friday, but the market nevertheless capped off yet another winning week.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index delivered its seventh week of gains in the last eight, following a big rally sparked by the Federal Reserve’s announcement on interest rates. ___ Wells Fargo CEO: Fixing fake accounts will take more time NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said the company could need several more months to resolve customer damage tied to its massive sales practices scandal. That includes figuring out if people had trouble getting approved for other loans because of the fake accounts bank employees opened. Speaking with The Associated Press, Sloan reiterated what he [auth] has said since becoming CEO in the wake of the scandal, that rebuilding trust with customers is the primary focus. ___ NEW YORK (AP) — Trumpism is slowly taking hold on your phone and computer, as the Federal Communications Commission starts chipping away at hard-fought protections on privacy and competition. These measures, put in place before President Donald Trump took office, had upset the phone and cable industries. The new regime says consumers win if businesses face less regulation and have more incentives to invest. ___ Wal-Mart buys online clothing seller ModCloth NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is buying trendy online clothing selling ModCloth. The company has been making a big push to pick up smaller online brands as it tries to make headway against Amazon. But winning over ModCloth’s customers, who are fans of its vintage-inspired patterned dresses and inclusive sizing, may be a challenge. ___ Slammer sale: Closed prisons are a tough sell, states find ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — States are having a hard time selling places where prisoners have done hard time. Developers say thick-walled cell blocks and dormitories at closed prisons tend to be too expensive to tear down, and too restrictive to turn into viable enterprises. In New York, a mountaintop site in the Adirondacks has sat on the market for a year despite stunning views and other amenities. ___ US, global partners wrestle over trade stance BADEN-BADEN, Germany (AP) — Top finance officials are debating what stance to take on free trade at a meeting that will help set the tone for the global economy. The gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads from the Group of 20 countries has focused on shifting attitudes toward trade, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose border taxes and rewrite free trade deals. ___ “Soda tax” stakes escalate in pivotal Philadelphia fight PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia has become a pivotal battleground in the beverage industry’s push to stop “soda taxes” from gaining momentum. Since a new tax on sweetened drinks went into effect Jan. 1, a coalition of businesses looking to overturn the tax say sales are down so much they need to cut jobs. Tax supporters question the announcements of layoffs so soon after the tax went into effect, and note beverage distributors and supermarkets aren’t required to pass on the entire cost of the tax to shoppers. ___ Israeli tech firms revving up engines for self-driving cars JERUSALEM (AP) — As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. ___ Dallas offers cautionary tale as it moves to fix 911 woes DALLAS (AP) — Dallas has been experiencing disruptions in its 911 service that began in October and at one point last week resulted in 360 calls being placed on hold. More dispatchers have been assigned to field 911 calls and technological glitches have been fixed, which should smooth operations, a city spokeswoman said Friday. But the problems plaguing Dallas can be found with other 911 systems that rely on increasingly obsolete networks that are incompatible with new technologies and protocols. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,914.62. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slipped 3.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,378.25. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.24 points, or 0.004 percent, to 5,901.00.
