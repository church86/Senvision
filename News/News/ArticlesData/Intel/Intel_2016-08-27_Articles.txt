The company has been keeping the lid tight on this product, but there are speculations that it may be launched during the last quarter of this year. Fortunately, the latest leak provided several details on the upcoming chip. Benchlife, a Chinese tech website, has published several slides that show different information on the processor. Laptops and 2-in-1 tablets equipped with the new Intel Core processor will reported be launched during the fourth quarter of 2016. These low-power-consuming chips use between 4.5 watts and 15 watts. The leak also shows that a 3.5 GHz Intel Core i7-7500U Kaby Lake processor will have an increase of up to 12 percent in terms of productivity and up to 19 percent web performance against a 3.1 GHz i7-6500U of the previous micro-architecture. However, this improvement will be at the cost of the device's battery life, unless Intel has worked something around the new chip that will improve its power efficiency. Techworm mentioned that the top-of-the-line i7-7700K desktop variant of the Kaby Lake processor will be so powerful that gamers will not be needing a separate video card in order to have a 4K output. A new graphics architecture on the upcoming chip gives visual performance a big boost, and it will even handle 3D graphics. The Intel Kaby Lake processor is also rumored to include native support for USB 3.1, HDCP 2.2, HEVC Main 10/10-bit and VP9 10 bit hardware video decoding. Meanwhile, a Kaby Lake desktop processor list also surfaced recently showing the three sub-categories it will have, which are based on power requirement or TDP (Thermal Design Power). They are Standard Power at 95 W, Low Power at 65W and Ultra Low Power at 35 W. All of these processors will be taking the existing LGA1151 package.

In a South by Southwest panel entitled “Who Owns Your Fans? Not You!,” an executive from computer chip-maker AMD told how he mobilized the company’s fans and used online video to spread brand and product awareness in an merging market. While AMD is a big name in chips, its sales fall far behind that of market-leader Intel. In marketing and advertising, Intel outspends AMD 60 to 1. That’s why, social media manger John Peters explained, he has to be clever to get more bang from his marketing dollar. In his address, Peters explained how he harnessed fans to further the company’s objectives in a campaign in India. Peters started his campaign to build awareness and increase laptop sales on Facebook, targeting ads to 18- to 35-year-old Indian gamers in. His company saw this as an emerging market ripe with potential due partly to the massively popularity of gaming and LAN parties in that country. Next, he identified early adopters through Facebook, gamers who felt strongly about AMD and wanted to spread its message. AMD created a point system to incentivize these adopters in non-monetary way. Fans were able to show their influence while accruing points, and could redeem points for goods. While Facebook is a great way to find fans, it’s not a great platform for working with them. That’s why AMD transitioned its fans and its point competition to a separate page that it created and ran. By hosting its own promotional page, AMD was able to share more media assets, including product videos, while still maintaining the contest point system. Fans were then able to upload their own original content. For example, one early adopter edited an online video game trailer and added AMD messaging and branding. Others could earn points by sharing that video. “Video content, we know, is extremely engaging these days,” said Peters. Working with Samsung, AMD gave away laptops and game codes to several participants. Peters made the decision not to delete negative comments from contest pages, since he wanted fans to know they were taking part in an open dialog. That decision wasn’t popular with management, Peters acknowledged, but he stuck by it. At the end of the campaign, Peters was highly satisfied with the results. Fan acquisition on Facebook cost $.81 per person. AMD saw revenue growth of $520,000 from the campaign, and enjoyed $600,000 of earned media. Fans generated over 1,000 pieces of original content, often working with AMD brand assets. When launching campaigns, Peters said marketers should define their program objectives, making sure those objectives align with company goals, and narrow the scope, if needed. After all, you’re not likely to further all of your company’s goals in one program. Start small and progress from there, he said. Remember that content is king, so supply fans with great assets, including original videos, to work with. Finally “measure, measure, measure,” so you know exactly where your campaign is working and by how much.

May Tap Intel Corporation for Future A-Series Chip Manufacturing Nikkei, citing comments from an industry analyst, reports that Intel could manufacture Apple's custom-designed A-series processors by 2018 or 2019. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 27, 2016 at 7:05PM Image source: Getty.  Just a few days ago, I penned a column speculating on whether smartphone giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would tap microprocessor specialist Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for the manufacture of iPhone-bound applications processors at some point in the future. According to a report from Nikkei, citing comments from Gartner analyst Samuel Wang, Intel has "begun to engage with Apple" for such foundry work. The analyst also believes that Intel "is likely to gain orders from Apple" by either 2018 or 2019. The foundry jackpot Until now, most of the contract chip manufacturing deals that Intel has made public have been ones with seemingly limited volume and revenue potential to Intel. However, winning a significant portion of Apple's A-series chip business would bring meaningful revenue to the company. It would also allow Intel to control an even greater portion of the industrywide unit volumes on cutting-edge chip manufacturing technology. If we assume that Apple pays around $22 per A-series processor (this is the estimate put out there by IHS Technology ), then at around 200 million units shipped per year, the revenue opportunity for the manufacture of these processors works out to roughly $4.4 billion per year. If Intel can get this deal done (something that, frankly, I'd have to see to believe), grabbing a piece of that pie would be a positive for the company and its stockholders. A potential positive for Apple Readers may remember a recent report from DIGITIMES claiming that Apple is trying to squeeze its suppliers for iPhone 7 component orders. That same report said that Apple wasn't going to try to squeeze Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) "simply because it is difficult for Apple to find alternative sources to replace TSMC." If Intel can become a credible second source to TSMC for A-series contract chip manufacturing, then Apple may be able to get better pricing on these chips. That better pricing could allow Apple to either expand its gross profit margins per device (even a few dollars saved across hundreds of millions of units adds up to a non-trivial amount of incremental gross profit) or it could allow Apple the freedom to pack even more features and functionality into its chips at roughly the same manufacturing cost. A potential negative for TSMC If Intel does, in fact, wind up winning some A-series processor orders from Apple, this would be a negative for TSMC. I wouldn't expect Intel to become the primary source for A-series chips in the event that Apple actually uses Intel, but going from 100% allocation to TSMC (as is widely expected for the upcoming A10 and the follow-on A11 chips) to, say, 60%-70% allocation would hurt year-over-year revenue comparisons. Additionally, with Intel in the mix, TSMC might have to price more aggressively, which would drive down average selling prices and, potentially, gross profit margins on the chips that Apple does buy from TSMC. That being said, I would be very careful about predicting gloom and doom for TSMC. The company's execution over the last several years has been nothing short of excellent, and I expect that the chip manufacturer will continue to very aggressively push technology development in a bid to try to keep all of Apple's orders (as well as orders from other top mobile customers) flowing through its factories.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Intel Lost Another Open-Source Driver Developer To Google Earlier This Summer Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 27 August 2016 at 09:35 AM EDT. 8 Comments There was another long-time Intel open-source Linux graphics driver developer that left the company earlier this summer and is now working at Google on the Chrome/Chromium OS graphics stack. Among the notable departures in the past few months from Intel's Open-Source Technology Center were Jesse Barnes, Wayland-founder Kristian Høgsberg, and Dirk Hohndel and apparently others that went under the radar or outside of our area of focus. Another graphics driver developer no longer at Intel is Chad Versace. Chad Versace had been at Intel since 2010 worked as Intel's representative to Khronos for two years, was one of the original Intel Vulkan driver developers, worked on various OpenGL driver features, and was also the founder of the Waffle project for making portable the OpenGL API version as well as the windowing system API to runtime. I only realized he was no longer at Intel this week when seeing a reviewed-by where he's now with a Chromium email address. Chad's CV confirms he is now at Google working on Chromium. His focus there is on the Chrome OS graphics stack with OpenGL, Vulkan, EGL and Mesa. This appears to be similar to Kristian also now at Google working working on the Chromium graphics stack. Chad apparently left Intel about two months ago. It should be interesting to see what further improvements Google will make to its Chrome graphics stack considering the new developers joining the crew. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 27, 2016 at 6:45AM Image source: Intel.  Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) seems to be getting more serious about becoming a contract chip manufacturer. At its recent developer forum, the company went into quite a bit of detail about its efforts in this space. Traditional contract chip manufacturers tend to service a very broad range of customers across many different industries, whereas Intel's focus appears to be more specialized, targeting two segments in particular. A new mobile strategy The first area Intel wants to target is the market for mobile-oriented processors. The company axed its entire pipeline of Intel-designed mobile applications processors earlier this year (though one Intel exec indicated that the company may eventually be back), so this looks to be Intel's workaround to win a piece of the mobile market. According to Intel, China-based smartphone chip manufacturer Spreadtrum "is designing on Intel's 14 [nanometer] foundry platform." Strategy Analytics says Spreadtrum ranked fifth in terms of worldwide smartphone applications shipments in 2015, though how much of Spreadtrum's volume can eventually move over to Intel remains to be seen. Additionally, Intel and smartphone manufacturer LG announced that the latter will be building a "world-class mobile platform" on the former's 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. It will be interesting to see how those partnerships play out (chips based on these partnerships have yet to ship) and whether Intel can secure additional, high-volume wins over time. Extending the company's networking efforts The second major segment Intel is targeting with its foundry efforts is the network infrastructure market. The company is going after this market organically with its Xeon and Atom-based networking processors, and according to CEO Brian Krzanich, it has grown its share of this market to "over 10%". In a presentation, Intel cited two examples of network infrastructure wins for its foundry efforts: an FPGA from Achronix Semiconductor and a networking chip from a company called Netronome. Both of these wins were on Intel's 22-nanometer manufacturing technology. Going forward, I don't see Intel manufacturing products that directly compete with its Xeon/Atom product lines in this market. However, products such as networking switches, chips targeted at wireless base stations, and others could potentially be fair game. Intel actually has offerings in many segments of the networking market, but it may be more open to manufacturing competing chips as these aren't major revenue or profit drivers for the company to begin with. A reasonable strategy, but will it pay off? At the end of the day, it makes sense for Intel to serve as a contract chip manufacturer for companies focused on areas where Intel doesn't offer its own products or has relatively low market share. Such work should allow Intel to capture incremental revenue and profit at reasonable margins -- Intel executives have indicated in the past that its foundry business will carry margins largely in-line with the corporate average -- an obvious positive for Intel and its stockholders. That being said, before investors go crazy about the potential opportunity, it's worth noting that Intel faces very intense competition here, mainly from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, as well as from Samsung, Global Foundries, and other players. In fact, TSMC is the largest player in this market by far and is expected to bring in more than $28 billion in revenue this year and more than $30 billion the following year. Its market share in 2015 was over 54%, according to market research firm Gartner .  The revenue opportunity in the contract chip manufacturing business is attractive, but in order for Intel to make meaningful headway, it's going to have to grab share from TSMC and maintain it -- something that other competitors have found to be quite challenging. With this in mind, it'll likely be a couple of years before we'll have a good idea of whether Intel is on track to build its foundry business out to be a significant revenue contributor, or if all of these announcements amount to not much more than PR fluff.

A technical preview of CrossOver Android was launched this week, which will allow you to run Windows apps on your Intel-based Chromebook or Android tablet. What's more, the new software is entirely free at this point, and you'll be able to run programs such as Steam and Office 2010. Related: iPhone 7 The new version of the program is still a work in progress, however, so if you're tempted to try it out, be warned that not all Windows apps are guaranteed to work. You'll also need to have an Intel-based device in order for CrossOver Android to work, which limits the choices somewhat. Due to the Intel requirement, CrossOver is limited to Chromebooks such as the Asus Flipbook, Acer Chromebook r11, and the Chromebook Pixel. But the software should also work with Intel-based Android tablets, and there are likely to be further updates which could see CrossOver extended to other devices. Using the program will allow you to run multiple apps simultaneously as you would in Windows, plus, you can use Windows apps alongside native Android apps. You can sign up for access by heading over to the Code Weavers site and entering your details. The preview is only available to those who registered for initial access, but signing up should get you access to the full beta when it's released.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud News iMac 2016 release date, news and rumors iMac 2016 release date, news and rumors By Ben Stinson PC   The latest all-in-one from Apple is (hopefully) about to drop Shares Although it may seem that the range has only recently seen an upgrade, the late 2015 iMac brought little more than a processor upgrade and a long-awaited bump to Retina screens across the board. With Apple's computing market share dipping to 7.2% in Q3 2016, you would expect the company to release a new round of iMacs in time for its October event. Unfortunately, for Mac desktop fans, it appears as though the press keynote will be focused on the introduction of new MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs. The biggest updates are likely to be seen with the guts of Apple's iMac range, with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors now ready for production. The latest AMD Polaris graphics chips should also be on-board for video editing and high-resolution gaming, though recent reports have suggested Apple is working with Nvidia this time around. Other improvements are being chattered about via the rumour mill in the expectedly feverish build up to the new iMac's release, with VR compatibility currently headlining the list of less attention-grabbing features. Keep on reading to find out more about the new developments we're expecting from the 2016 iMac refresh. Also check out: MacBook Pro 2016 release date, news and rumours Cut to the chase What is it? The latest generation of Apple's all-in-one desktop computer When is it out? Rumours suggest October 2016 What will it cost? Prices are expected to start at £899 ($1,099), as they do today iMac 2016 release date Unless Apple chooses to go big on VR at the next event, the reveal of a new iMac isn't necessarily a dead-cert. In the past, desktop Mac refreshes have been a couple of years apart, so the launch of an updated iMac could end up being delayed until WWDC 2017 in June. Still, there's plenty of new hardware for Apple to pack into its popular all-in-one PC, so it's best to stay optimistic that the Cupertino giant will unveil some other tasty new tech alongside the iPhone 7 at its special September event. Comments by AMD suggest that Apple is lined-up to launch some hardware featuring the latest Polaris graphics chipset in late 2016, but that's as close as we have to a real confirmation of an update to any of Apple's computer range. With the hiatus in improvements to Apple's Mac Pro and Mac mini, it's likely that Apple will want to keep its most popular desktop range regularly refreshed to try and claw back some of that lost market share. iMac 2016 price The existing range of iMacs starts at £899 ($1,099) for the 21.5-inch 1080p model, rising to £1,199 ($1,499) for the 4K model and £1,449 ($1,799) for the 27-inch variant. There's little doubt that Apple will stick to the existing pricing tiers, especially considering IBM's comments on the long-term affordability of Mac usage, which were introduced when the company first launched the 'cheaper' iMac back in June 2014. Will it be Intel's Kaby Lake or AMD Zen for iMac 2016? With the last iMac update, Apple skipped on Intel's Broadwell processors and went straight to the latest Skylake chips for the 2015 iteration. Intel is set to provide the latest Kaby Lake processors for the next range of iMacs, the last in Intel's 14nm processing line before the switch to Cannonlake's 10nm architecture later in 2017. Though it is likely Apple will stick with Intel's processors, there is a possibility that the new AMD Zen processor could make an appearance in the high-end 27-inch models. This very powerful new CPU features 8 cores and 16 threads that would provide users with a huge amount of processing power on tap. Of course, there's still a possibility that Apple could skip the latest array of processors and wait for the Cannonlake series before upgrading its full suite of iMacs, but this would push the launch back to sometime in the second half of next year. iMac 2016: AMD on-board with the VR-enabled future Although Apple's range of desktop PCs hasn't lagged behind rivals in the processing department, the lack of graphical grunt is more of a sore sticking point for some users, especially for those wanting to get their game on without having to switch to Windows. With VR rapidly gaining in popularity both on PC and console, it is likely that Apple will not want its loyal customer base to feel like they're being left behind. It's very realistic, then, to expect that the new range of iMacs will include AMD's Polaris graphics, which was unveiled at the beginning of 2016. Reports from WCCF Tech claim that AMD won the contract to produce two chipsets for Apple back in April, and will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". MacRumors thinks that Polaris 10 and 11 are the most likely fit for Apple's new range of Macs, which are built using 16nm or 14nm production processes – smaller and more power-efficient than AMD's 28nm chipsets found in existing 27-inch iMacs. The switch from Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics in the 21.5-inch models is also highly probable, as AMD has made great gains in offering highly competitive GPUs at a very reasonable price. All in all, Mac users will be looking for plenty of power to support exciting new VR devices such as the Oculus Rift, which Palmer Luckey already said wasn't an option at present due to the underpowered graphical capabilities of Apple's computers. New flash storage for iMac 2016? While the rumours are that Apple is planning on an increased storage capacity in the iPhone 7, we're also hoping that the company makes a major move to further push flash storage with iMacs. The hybrid Fusion Drive is currently standard in the 27-inch range of iMacs and an £80 (around $105) optional extra for 21.5-inch models, though we're hoping that Apple finally makes it standard across the board with all iMacs. Flash storage capacity of up to 512GB is already available in Apple's MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which helps them to perform noticeably faster than similarly specified iMacs. Although Apple is unlikely to go down the route of flash-only storage for iMacs, hybrid drives would be a particularly welcome upgrade. A plethora of ports for new iMacs? The last Apple MacBook refresh saw Apple eschew all other ports in favour of USB-C, and while it would be unlikely that Cupertino would reduce the connectivity in its iMacs, it's certainly plausible that the new port could make an appearance. Intel's new Kaby Lake processors offer support for USB 3.1 alongside Thunderbolt 3 and DisplayPort 1.2, which could mean that every single port on the new iMac gets a little boost.

This is worse, much worse. by Preston James   Statues of Zeus, Poseidon and Hades. It’s a good guess that the Greek and Roman Gods were based on legends from earlier times of lesser gods interacting with humans. [ Note: If you have no interest or knowledge of background in Secret Space War matters, the secret and almost completely hidden machinations of the Top Chieftains of the Khazarian Mafia (KM), or the incredibly dark, evil, etheric non-corporeal entities which they serve in order to get their power, you are probably wasting your time reading this article. For those interested, this is a long article and you can save time by reading the bold print and then the conclusion. Doing this you will get the most important points of this article. Thanks to a major world power shift that has occurred, the Khazarian Mafia (KM) has been significantly checkmated and is now being progressively and incrementally deconstructed. The KM’s biggest secrets have historically been protected by their Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) which refuses to publish the facts of their extreme evil because the KM Moguls that run it follow KM policy that has been set by the KM Top Chieftains. Instead of publishing the truth, the CMMM publishes KM big lies, false-narrative and USG propaganda, and by doing so has created a false social reality which makes the truth implausible to most. Since the KM assassinated JFK, this false reality has traditionally caused most Americans to view truth nuggets dispensed by the Internet’s Alternative Media as mere “conspiracy theory” by whacky “conspiracy theorists”. Gander Canada Arrow Air Flight from Egypt All secrecy is now ending, and there are so many breeches from all over the world that it cannot be stopped. Some new KM-mandated laws have slowed this process down somewhat, but those too are becoming quite ineffective. Even so, many of the most serious secrets are so obtuse, so deviant, so incredibly evil, few will be able to fit them into their heads, once told. The biggest secrets that the Top KM Chieftains live by and keep are so nasty and so esoteric that they are incredible to all but a very, very small group of those who have worked at their periphery and who have well-corroborated information and evidence they just can’t ignore. The most closely guarded secrets of the KM Chieftains and their powerful associates are their private intersections, associations, subordination, and operational “slavery” to the unimaginably evil, ethereal, non-corporeal world they have sold out to. Strangely, the KM Top Chieftains and their associates do not understand that they have lost their very souls and have become slaves of the the evil spirit guides (lesser gods) they serve, and that this path leads to only one thing — judgment and their final demise. In becoming slaves of the hidden realm to evil lesser gods (fallen ones), they have been granted the power to rule over evil on Planet Earth and have made serfs out of most of whom they rule over. Men who were lost that day on Gander Canada Arrow Air This three-part series of articles is dedicated to all who have been murdered on the orders of the KM Top Chieftains using evil subordinates who run their Intel Agencies, such as the CIA, the FBI’s Div. 5, MI-5&6, the Mossad, to mention a few. Their blood cries out from the ground for judgment against these KM Top Chieftains. Because of twisted, sick and demonic policies the KM Top Chieftains (due to their subordination to evil non-corporeal spirit entities), these notorious world’s worst criminal sociopaths have been producing all the illegal unconstitutional, unprovoked, undeclared wars of aggression and acquisition for the benefit of the KM and its associates. This article is also dedicated to all the Intel agents and federal whistle-blowers that have been “terminated with prejudice” by the secret notorious “signed findings”, and also members of Seal Team Six recently murdered by their own commanders to keep them from leaking the fact that the man they terminated, murdered by a secret “dead or alive” warrant, was actually a Colonel Tim Osman double, when the real Osama bin Laden died in late 2001 long before. McKee This article is also dedicated to the murdered US Special Forces soldiers of the Gander Canada Arrow Air Flight from Egypt, the murdered eleven US Special Forces “Spooky Teams” in South America, the murdered DIA Agent Tiny McKee and his four other team members on Pan Am 103 at Lockerbie Scotland returning to America to expose the massive CIA/Pan Am drug Trafficking pipeline into America, all murdered by orders from CIA commanders and their superiors in sinister “ends justifies the means” cover ups. The blood of all these fine American Soldiers cries out from the ground demanding justice be brought to those responsible for their murders. Anyone who would order the murder of a brother in arms is the worst kind of soulless traitor there is and deserves justice and final judgment to be delivered no matter what. And this is the typical kind of person that sits in the top Command positions inside the CIA and the Pentagon right now and continues to betray American Soldiers and Intel agents every single day. They violate their Oaths of Office and betray We The People. They deserve to be fully and publicly exposed and dealt with by federal RICO prosecutions, as well as prosecutions in International Courts for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the tortures and murders of innocent kidnapped teenagers at numerous black prison sites, including on the notorious black prison ships. PJ ] _____________ Demiurge represented by the lion-faced serpent The Plutocrats and Oligarchs who rule us do so by means of their secret, hidden associations and strong personal relationships with other Plutocrats and Oligarchs, but they share one thing in common. In order to obtain their status they have risen through specific occult-based initiation rituals which become increasingly evil. At some point when they near the highest initiation into the KM Hierarchy, they will be approached by non-corporeal entities in the hidden spirit world and will be asked to enter into a contract, selling their very souls in exchange for extreme power over others, incredible riches and high status in society. But they have to perform seriously deviant, criminal acts in secret against the masses in order to be so empowered and to maintain their level of power attained. These acts are parasitical and required by the lesser gods they serve. In so serving these lesser gods these Plutocrats and Oligarchs have been able to create a secret kingdom, an Establishment Hierarchy which they must maintain through covert political manipulations and exercises of their secret power that has been given them. Hollywood proudly promotes the Demiurge at every opportunity To protect this kingdom of power, wealth and status they have built up a pyramidal Establishment Hierarchy. This Establishment Hierarchy is the world’s largest organized crime syndicate, the Khazarian Mafia. These Plutocrats and oligarchs who are the Top Chieftains of this KM Establishment Hierarchy syndicate have created their own Intel agencies and used them to protect their Establishment Hierarchy. In addition they have also created numerous secret, top secret, above top secret, black, deep-black and beyond-black programs hidden in various defense contractors (usually as Intel proprietaries) to create even more tools to control society and pursue technological developments that will aid their cause. These Plutocrats and Oligarchs have hijacked the American State; formed close relationships, groups and associations; and routinely invoked the false-cloak of so-called “National Security” as cover for their evil, illegal and unconstitutional deeds, which are necessary to keep We The People under control. Some of the most hidden of their secret programs are deep-black and beyond-black “unacknowledged special access programs”, often not even known by the defense contractors in which they are embedded.   These deep-black and beyond-black programs, like so many covert operations of the KM’s Intel Agencies, are financed by “black money” raised through large corporate/state bust-outs, bailouts, corporate welfare schemes, international arms, and large scale narcotic trafficking and other illegal rackets. Some of these deep-black programs have gone rogue and become a major secret power to themselves, independent of the Top Chieftains of the KM who set them up or authorized them in the first place. Raising Black funding for black programs is a very big, well-protected business of the KM. The reason the country of Mexico is a narco state and a totally failed nation is because the CIA started and built up the Mexican drug Cartels and has used them them to raise immense amounts of black funding. When one cartel gets too big and too powerful, the CIA builds up a competitor, and then covertly provokes a drug war between them. This weakens them and keeps them in check and thins the herd by producing thousands of murders, many of innocent civilians. Meanwhile they keep using these cartels to provide illegal drug profits for their large wall street banks to launder for them. Just take a wild guess why casinos have been so popular with the CIA, the world’s largest narco-trafficker that is totally controlled by the Top Chieftains of the KM. Some deep-black and Beyond-black programs have developed a life of their own, gone into secret arrangements with Alien ET groups, and have gone rogue. And some of these beyond-black programs have spun out of control and developed a life of their own, running parallel to the Power Control Group that is supposed to control them, the world’s largest organized crime syndicate, the Khazarian Mafia (KM). At least one of these programs has been transformed into a faction actively working against the KM at many levels through very sophisticated psyops, covert ops and ultra high tech psychotronics, mimicking what the KM is doing to the American masses in secret, but likely much more proficiently. In some of these beyond-black special access, unacknowledged groups, those involved have been deeply mind-kontrolled and now serve as agents of these Alien ET leaders and are helping them attain their own agenda, which plans to make an end run around the Globalist NWO Agenda of the KM. It is not too hard to imagine all the trouble this is now causing the Top Chieftains of the KM. Stay tuned, because much more is on the way. Some of the slickest covert operations in history are going to be deployed against the KM. It would be great if this Alien ET Agenda were one supportive of We The People and the human race. But so far it looks to be something just the opposite. They appear to be doing some of the things We The People want, but with what overall goal in mind, that’s the rub, because they seem to have an endgame that is anti-human and may just be clearing the field of the major power players so they can move in their place and take over openly in some form, perhaps through new Cutouts. The agenda of this certain group of Alien ETs is substantially different than the Top Chieftains of the KM, whom this Alien ET group has been using as disposable cutouts to gain control over the nations and major institutions that run humanity. Once they have done that, then they plan to dispose of humans in three intermingled ways. They plan to deploy war and disease taking a toll of 90%. This was sold to the KM Top Chieftains as necessary chem-trail spraying, high tech eugenics in the food, and vaccination poisoned healthcare, and purposeful pollution and radiation spills and contaminations. They plan at some point to start deep-sixing all the KM Cutouts and Doofuses and useful idiots who sold out their fellow humans for temporary power, riches and status, as soon as they are no longer necessary and these spirit guides (lesser gods) have set up the necessary means to relate directly to the masses and elicit a world populism they control. They will manipulate the masses to become lemmings, while the eugenics and mass deaths from war take their intended toll. The Alien ET Agenda seem like the KM’s Globalist NWO Agenda, but is actually far worse and evil beyond the imagination of most. The Alien ET Agenda is actually a secret agenda of the lesser gods, the fallen ones that rebelled against the God Almighty and were cast down and quarantined upon Planet Earth and its surrounding space. A certain group of Alien ETs are well organized “spirit entities” (lesser gods–Dracos) and have an age-old plan to repopulate the earth with their own new race of strange creatures that are Alien ET/human hybridizations. They intend to genetically engineer these new creatures and enmesh A.I. computers and “machine components” in their genetic structures, which will be triple helix-based and thus self-healing. Their special new race will be the merger of “clay and iron” will be hived by quantum A.I. capabilities built into their genetically engineered CNS. These creatures are intended to have advanced psi-powers, IQ’s of 200 and over, and will serve the group mind, preventing deviance and rebellion (as well as free will) in this new race of hived man/machine/Alien ET hybrid. Obviously much of this subject would be either incomprehensible, unimaginable to those who are not up to speed on the history related to these subjects. But there are numerous vetted witnesses who have spoken out on the US Secret Space program, Alien ETs and relationships between deep-black unacknowledged, SCI proprietaries. Slowly but continually over the last 50 years significant reports and actual USG documents have leaked out and we have anecdotal reports of those at the fringes of the KM who have talked about the incredibly deviant initiation ceremonies of the KM’s Establishment Hierarchy. There is a group of vetted, highly trained ex-military and government witnesses who have come forth in unity and spoken out against their secrecy agreements, because these secrecy agreements are null and void because of criminal behavior of those who administer them. This is Steven Greer’ MD’s Disclosure Project. I don’t agree with all his conclusions, but the evidence his group presents is rock solid as are his “first-hand” witnesses. _________ Conclusion Because there is a major cosmic correction now on the way, this sinister plan is doomed to complete failure; but because these entities running this are soulless beasts driven by evil instincts, they cannot process the truth or stop themselves from heading toward judgment and destruction. The coming break point when the KM Top Chieftains and their KM are going to be dis-empowered and taken apart at the seams is now approaching. As these monsters who walk free are de-throned, they become confused and wonder what went wrong. In Part II, the powerful effects of the worldwide Internet in exposing the unimaginable evil of the Khazarian Mafia and their counter measures will be explored. _________ This can be a negative and depressing subject so I have included some great entertainment from the very best Blues man out there who has an uplifting back-story to share. Besides being the world’s top stage performer and top Blues Guitarist, Joe Bonamassa is a populist. His story is one of incredible success despite enormous odds against him. He refused to sell out to the music industry and started his own company after deciding to create his own following and his own business. He deals directly with blues lovers and has a very big following because he shares so much personal information and so much great music. Joe has overcome almost impossible odds and risen to the top independently outside the mainstream corporate music industry, a feat that almost never occurs anymore. Joe has his own website, tells his full story openly and provides lots of his best music for free to those that can’t buy his excellent DVDs and CDs and cannot attend his shows. He has the best video and audio techs, records everything now in HD and has the best sound engineering and video production possible. He has made several videos on his life story and those he works with which are very interesting. Joe has the very best in his band. He doesn’t care what their age, race or sex is, he will play with them if they are the best. His music is ever expanding and some of his new work is amazing. Joe started out as a guitar prodigy and after extensive voice lessons by the best, he has progressed to the very top. What he has done is almost impossible but early on he decided to always pick quality people to work with. If you look closely you will notice Joe is playing a guitar previously owned by the great Albert King. When Joe performs it is obviously he puts out 100%, everything he’s got, and this man is oozing with raw pure talent. His popularity is growing by the day and his following who frequent his website is international in scope now. He has just recently reached top superstar status by dealing directly with the people, having the best performances anywhere and recording and selling his own videos in HD without the big recording corporations being involved. He never seems to run out of great new material and each performance seems even better, harder hitting than before. This incredible artist deserves all the success he has now attained. He worked very hard for every bit of it and its taken 25 years of hard work and dedication to attain this success which has placed him at the very top. Here is one of his new recordings from his new DVD Live at the Greek Theater, and it is pretty amazing. _______________ Related Posts: Subjects and Serfs of the Lesser Gods (Part II) Subjects and Serfs of the Lesser Gods (Part III) Unfathomable Hypocrisy of the USG and its Network News Kingpins and Cutouts, Aliens and Hybrids Where were You When the Anti-Christ Came?

I have come to several conclusions in the last year as I have sought to connect the dots found over the last 50 years. The American Military is sadly the Hessians of the NWO. This observation is not critical in any way of our patriots who serve in the military. They do not know the traitors in our government such as Henry Kissinger and his ilk are wrongfully wasting their lives and efforts. The Khazars are tares planted in the wheat by satan to rob the true descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob of their promised land and standing with God. The “Christian’ church is unbelievably stupid and ignorant. It has been totally duped into accepting the Ashkenazi converts to Judaism as Hebrews. Anti Zionism is not anti Semitism. The Ashkenazi is not Semitic- not a drop of Jacob’s blood in them! There is a lot of money involved in the support of Israel (Khazarland)- don’t know how that greed could be overcome. The grand design of satan is to dilute if not remove the bloodline of Jacob sufficient that there is no Jew for the fulfillment of the end time prophecies. I’ve read the end of the Book and satan gets his ass kicked along with all of his following. The jerk knows this but is simply looking to take as many as he can with him. I pray our LORD and Savior returns soon to take away the misery of this world. Log in to Reply jonnbrown  August 28, 2016 at 12:02 pm AWESOME, Sir. Thank you.

Can’t offer any definitive opinion other than to say that what is supposedly being done is far, far, far beyond my skill set. As Dr. James and others learn more and share insight and connect whatever dots to our Khazarian Mafia-driven bizarre reality, I will be motivated to read and learn. By the way, really terrific blues music Dr. James shared in this his latest VT article. Thanks. Log in to Reply concernedvet5  August 28, 2016 at 12:33 am Thanks again Dr. James for another awesome article on this very difficult to deal with subject. Svali was an Illuminati whistleblower who was introduced on the scene several years ago. She spoke of a time where the “elite” or Illuminati would present themselves to the public as their hidden leaders and “creators”. She called it the “revealing”. It was supposedly slated for around 2020 or 2025, but it appears their plans may have been thwarted. Is this conflict you mention above perhaps a part of this planned turn of events? Log in to Reply concernedvet5  August 28, 2016 at 12:25 am Heard from a few sources including UK’s Simon Parkes that there was an attempt to use the technology at Cern to open a portal. It was to be used by the reptilian species in question for further needed supplies and equipment. Supposedly the last few “tests” have been unsuccessful and the portal has remained closed and non-functional. The act of a human sacrifice has a similar effect, in that it is meant to open portals to allow these dark energies to cross over and work here…so I would not be to quick to call the video in the news from a week ago a fake.

Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  August 28, 2016 at 10:51 am Jordan Maxwell has discovered some quite interesting esoteric based practices of the secret rulers. Where we differ is that he seems beat down, defeated, seems to have little hope. I have lots of hope. I believe there is a God Almighty that will intervene as He has so many times in the past. Every time the secret rulers try to take over the whole world, judgment falls and they are pushed back. Those who love God, then love their neighbors as themselves(treat them the way they want to be treated) will come through this okay and will have an exciting future to look forward to in a future existence that has complete peace, health and justice. taylormoore  August 29, 2016 at 11:00 am Quoting our good man, Dr. Preston James: “Those who love God, then love their neighbors as themselves(treat them the way they want to be treated) will come through this okay and will have an exciting future to look forward to in a future existence that has complete peace, health and justice.” Sure hope he turns out right! Have to admit that all of this has me nearly beat down to a pulp. I most definitely can feel Jordan’s despondency and demoralization. It is a huge step in the right direction when VT through Gordon and Mike publicly shared the term “Khazarian Mafia”. With that laser beam definition, now many of us can place our finger on the face of the true enemy. How far do the Khazarian Mafia’s tentacles reach? Virtually every secret and notoriously nefarious organization? Or, are there other cunning, diabolical earthly forces outside the sphere of the KM? Ir order to win (and wouldn’t that be great!), it is first necessary to understand precisely who the enemy is. One thing that appears quite certain: it, the enemy, sure as hell ain’t Putin! jensingr  August 30, 2016 at 1:24 pm @taylormoore: “So shall it be at the end of the world, the angels shall come forth, and SEVER the wicked from among the just.” There can not be a world full of lab created alien hybrids, nano-robots, supersoldiers or demonically possessed humans without Divine Intervention! It is the Law of Nature and Creation. darrelld  August 27, 2016 at 7:14 pm Excellent article, but I think it best if you stick with talking about the evil spirits and not talk about E.T. Aliens as if they are independent of the former. All the evidence points to the truth that the latter are but physical manifestations of evil spirits/demons, and they tend to make people disbelieve in demons and the existence of hell. Here is a powerful and efficacious prayer that Pope Leo XIII composed after having a vision of what the devil, i.e., Satan and his fallen cohorts planned to do in the 20th and 21st Centuries: St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen. All priests said this prayer after celebrating Mass from the time of Leo XIII (d. 1903) to after Vatican II (1962-1965), when it was eliminated from the new Mass which got tragically imposed on the Church with disastrous results. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  August 28, 2016 at 8:18 pm You have a fairly large number of Christian believers that support your view and you may be correct. Some folks believe the Alien ETs certain deep-black Intel groups have entered into working arrangements with are of two types, evil and good. I only have personal and direct knowledge some the evil ones. I have also heard the idea the the good ones are deceptive and playing out a script to con folks and mind-kontrol them into going along with their own secret agenda and are thus actually not good at all. We shall have to wait and see. Someday all truth with be shouted from the rooftops. The Internet is the beginning of this strong trend toward the end of all secrecy and is too far advanced now to ever be stopped, so stay tuned. This is going to get very interesting fast. jensingr  August 30, 2016 at 1:45 pm @darrelid The prayer to Michael the Archangel works against all evil beings including their master Satan. I found out how powerful it is because in the actual true case that the movie “The Exorcist” was made from, that prayer and a small statue of Michael the Archangel was what finally worked to remove Satan from the 13 year old boy, after dauntimg months of performing the Rite of Exorcism. It took only 3 minutes. The boy was uplifted off the bed by unseen hands and held up while a battle ensued inside. They could hear the commotion between Michael and Satan. After 3 minutes, the boy went limp and fell on the bed completely fine. You can find the detailed notes that were written by the two Priests that were involved. Of course, the satanic hollyweird perverted version of the story changed it to a 13 year old girl and directed her to do disgusting things and speak vile insults with a old man’s voice. And they left out the most important part that Michael the Archangel has ultimate power over Satan! MileHighLife  August 27, 2016 at 3:33 pm As usual, Dr. James, I appreciate your efforts toward awakening humanity to the horrors that have kept humanity in slavery for centuries, if not from our very beginnings. For years I’ve researched everything David Icke, Phillip Schneider (Dulce Wars) to David Wilcock, Corey Good, Dr. Michael Salla, Vatican crimes, Sitchen, VT etc. in my own pursuit of Truth. Not saying I buy everything sold, all I know is there’s a helluva lot more to human His-story, this planet, universe, and the life in it than We have been taught — which leads to only One conclusion: “They” are hiding something they’re very much afraid for humanity to learn. The question then becomes…WTF is it? Log in to Reply Celsiusrising  August 27, 2016 at 1:31 pm There certainly are discarnate entities throughout this world, of all stripes. It boils down to this; there are 3 possible stances for such entities.(1) spiritual beings that will help if consciously sought after. (2)Those that are indifferent and pursuing their own agenda. (3) Those that are malicious and anti-human. The last two, may be difficult to discern any difference between them. Log in to Reply jensingr  August 30, 2016 at 2:04 pm Some entities ARE malicious and anti-human but there are physical differences: ET’s are flesh and blood. Demons have never had physical form but crave to take over a body and then destroy it from within.

Or the Indian statute at Cern Shiva which allegedly can symbolize destruction and death. Like the new EU tunnel opening ceremony with strange dancers at the Swiss Gothard tunnel, another obvious ritual. It could just be harmless esoteric rituals by secret society folks, or it could be much much more. Until we have vetted reports of insiders who defect psychologically, we cannot know for certain what Cern is all about as far as these esoteric displays go. But if it turns out that Cern is concerned with more than just colliding atomic particles that would not surprise me.

Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  August 27, 2016 at 2:32 am Comparable ancient hellenic and roman Gods were introduced during the Dorian wanderings from the North-East. Zeus is a sound shift from Ziu-Tiu. You still find it in “Tuesday”. Teutonics, Deutsche means the tribes of Ziu. The church used without exception all heathen feast- or holidays and tried to exchange the meanings. Some of those attempts did not reach the goal. The names of the Month’ were exchanged in Roman names. But in the daynames they failed fortunately. The morpegs like World of Warcraft are memories of our ancient life, when we had the sensebility to be aware of magic levels. We lost this ability. “Magic spells” are in reality more subtile but the modern human needs a visualization to get it. Already in ancient times of Rome and Hellas the ability to be aware was gone. The humanization of Gods led to useless monotheism.

I reasoned that our problems just had to be from an off world or inter-dimensional nature. This or these entities new what they were doing, to me their intentions were to get the human race to turn on its self, to self destruct with wars and greed (for us to do their work for them). They stay hidden, manipulating and directing events and all the time worming deeper into society ready to take complete control. The worst thing is most humans would not realize they had been invaded and taken over so subtle is this entity. I know I may not be right in all I say, but when I read your work it was refreshing to know I was on the right track. Please keep up the good work.

Asciimation I'd rather live in a world full of eccentric thinkers than one full of unthinking consumers Home About WPG2 CNC Electronics. August 28th, 2016 This weekend I worked some more on the CNC machine. It’s really meant to be for laser cutting but seems to have become more of a 3D printer. Mainly since there is more involved in getting that to work. It is easier to stick a laser on a 3D printer than stick a 3D print head on a laser cutter! During the week my electronics and extra linear bearings arrived. I spent a bit of free time on Friday getting the RAMPS board fired up.  It took me a little while to get things actually working, mainly due to a string of silly but easy to make mistakes. First I needed to get the firmware on the board. I am using the latest stable version of Marlin (1.0.2-1 at time of writing). Marlin needs configuring before you install it and the way this is done is by changing #defines in a couple of header files. Being an old computer geek this isn’t too hard. Where I did go wonky though was when the code wouldn’t build.  That turned out to be and error in one of the header files, dogm_font_marlin.h. Inside there the include path to the library used by the LCD I have was wrong. It should read #include <clib/u8g.h> but the path was originally wrong. The thing that threw me was for some reason that include is in the file twice, once at the top and again half way down. I had changed it in one place and not the other. The IDE was telling me why it wasn’t building, I just wasn’t reading the error carefully enough and assumed I had fixed it! Most people probably won’t know what I am on about there. It’s probably enough to say if you are building a machine yourself there are quite a few fiddly little things you need to do to get everything working. There is documentation out there but it is all over the place. It takes a bit of digging to figure out what is the best way to do things sometimes. With the software building and uploaded to the Arduino Mega I finally got the screen and controller working. But with the motors connected I couldn’t get anything to move. One issue was when I plugged the RAMPS board onto the Arduino Mega some of the pins were misaligned and they didn’t go into the sockets correctly. I removed the board, straightened the pins and reconnected everything. Still the motors wouldn’t work. Then I realised I had made a truly daft mistake. I had followed some instructions I had found online for plugging in the stepper driver boards. I am using the DRV8825 stepper driver boards (well Chinese copies anyway). The instructions I found showed an earlier type of driver board so when I plugged mine in I plugged them in the same was as in those instructions. I should have actually looked at the boards and worked out which pin was which. Of course I had them in backwards! Luckily this didn’t damage anything. With them installed the right way around I finally got stepper motors stepping. So far so good. In the weekend I spent Saturday morning finally organising the computer wing. It’s been bugging me it was still as it was when I moved in and now I actually want to be doing electronics and making things in here so it needed a tidy up. I was also looking for some things I knew I had for the CNC machine at the same time. After organising things I find what I was looking for. An old ATX power supply out an old PC. I knew I had one floating about but couldn’t remember if it worked. It didn’t. But then I remembered I had another in an old working PC. So I pulled that apart. Some people reading this might recognise the old Intel Home PC from way back in the day when Intel decided every employee should be given a free computer! It’s the original box (was a nice HP machine with a great modular case) but had long since had the motherboard, drives, power supply, etc upgraded before finally being retired to the cupboard’o’crap in my spare room. I pulled out the supply (and also a 120Gb drive and 1GB of RAM I didn’t know it had in it) as well as the CPU and case fans. It’s an old 450W ATX supply. Not exactly a well known brand I think but it worked fine in my old machine so it should be good. The RAMPS boards needs a 12 volt supply at quite high current, 5A for the motors and extruder and 11A for the heated bed. All of this is explained (not very clearly) here. An ATX supply can easily supply the right current. There are some traps though. Some ATX supplies won’t supply a well regulated 12 volt line unless there is some load on the 5 volt line. There are tons of sites about talking about this, it’s called ATX balancing, so I won’t repeat it here. My supply seems to work ok so far but I will see when things are actually running. Converting an ATX power supply is also well documented out there. I will briefly mention what I did. First I opened it up.   I gave it a good clean as these things are always dust magnets. Then I unsoldered all the wires after taking note of which colours when where. Black wires are grounds, red are +5 volts, yellows are +12 volts. There are three other wires I was interested in, the green PS_ON, the purple +5VSB and the grey PWR_OK. The green wire is used to turn the supply on and off. If you short this to ground the power supply will turn on. The purple wire supplies 5 volts all the time (when the mains switch is on) even if the green wire hasn’t been grounded. The grey wire will show 5 volts when the power supply has turned on after the green wire has been grounded. I left two yellow 12 volt wires and grounds for the two 12 volt inputs into the RAMPS board. I also pulled out a red +5 volt wire and ground wire in case I need it (perhaps for balancing later or to run 5 volt fans). I connected the grey PWR_ON lead to a 220R resistor and a red LED to provide a visual indicator that the power supply is on. I also added a toggle switch to the PS_ON line. The switch either connects the wire straight to ground, turning the supply on, or to an external green wire so the RAMPS board itself can control it. The switch let me test everything was working with some load, in my case two old car headlights.   The next bit about how you get RAMPS to control the switching all gets a bit confusing and the documentation isn’t very clear. How I understand it works is this. The Arduino is powered either from the 12 volt supply feed into the RAMPS board or via the USB connection to the computer. The ATX supply can supply 12 volts and can be controlled via the green PS_ON green. So you can plug this wire into the RAMPS board on the provided connector and switch the 12 volt supply on and off as needed (there is an M code to do this). This works fine if the Arduino is connected via USB and getting it’s power via that. Then you can switch the 12 volt lines from the ATX supply on and off easily. The problem is if you don’t have the USB connected. If the Arduino is being powered via the 12 volt in this of course this won’t work. The ATX won’t switch on unless the Arduino tells it to but the Arduino won’t be running until the ATX supply is turned on! So we’re deadlocked. The way around this is to use the purple +5VSB wire. Since this is powered all the time we can use that to power the Arduino and then that can turn on the main 12 volt supply when needed. The RAMPS board provides a connector for this. What you need to do is wire the +5VSB from the supply into the VCC pin on the header near the RAMPS reset button. That is the top pin. The green PS_ON wire goes into the bottom pin. The middle 5 volt pin is left unconnected. That is only there to power the servo headers to the right of the reset switch. The one other VERY important thing to do is remove diode D1. This diode is what feeds 12 volt power to the Arduino. We don’t need that as we are now supplying the Arduino with 5 volt directly via that VCC pin above. It is bad to try to do both at the same time. So we disconnect D1. This is a little tricky as it is hard to reach. The tweezers point to where it was on my board. So now we have the Arduino powered directly by the 5 volt stand by signal from the supply which means it can turn on and start up. It can then tell the ATX supply when to turn on and off the main 12 volt supply. All this works with no USB connection which is handy since my controller also has an SD card slot so it can run without a PC at all. With this working I was able to hook up the supply, motors, extruder, extruder thermocouple and heatbed and test it out. Unfortunately the heated bed that came in my kit didn’t have a thermistor! I have ordered one separately but until that comes I can’t test the heated bed. I was able to test the stepper motors and that the extruder heats up and the temperature reading of that works. I haven’t actually tried melting plastic yet though as I only went up to 60 degrees C. One thing I do need to do is provide wiring for the extruder fan and for fans to cool the electronics (using one of the case fans I pulled from the old PC). So, having gone as far as I could with that, I then went out to the garage to work on the X axis gantry. This was more simple metalwork. I used my laser cut templates to mark where to drill the holes for the mounting points. I ran out of time so haven’t actually bolted everything together yet but it is coming together.    I can do more on that tomorrow evening I hope. The whole thing is rather heavy. I am not even sure it will work as a 3D printer at all. It might be too slow although I think slow isn’t a problem except it means printing anything will take forever! The problem isn’t the speed but accelerating everything up to that speed. It’s going to be interesting to see! Posted in CNC Machine | | Top Of Page Comments are closed.

Java Webcams and DVB IBus Linuxulator Wine Browser Plugins Virtualization Skype ISO-8601 Upgrade Notes 9.x to 10.0 10.0 to 10.1 History FreeBSD is a fast, secure, modern Unix-like operating system with a fantastic community, great documentation, and powerful technologies like ZFS and LLVM. It’s my operating system of choice for everything from my beefy i7-2600k desktop to my home router to my ARM plug computer jukebox. Though famed for its uptime in the datacenter the same OS is just as suited to desktop or laptop computing with a little work. Why use FreeBSD? Maybe I’m just getting old, but it’s nice to use an operating system that didn’t spawn a billion-dollar anti-malware industry through frequent security failings, where you can choose the interface you like and reasonably expect it to stay that way instead of being forced into the design fad du jour, where you don’t have to argue about the init system being replaced two times in the same decade, and whose key organizations don’t collectively kowtow to Microsoft when convenient. I’ve used many operating systems and have yet to find one more consistent and cohesive yet as well-supported as the BSD family, and FreeBSD is the one with the biggest community and most available drivers for things like graphics cards. “FreeBSD on the server, Linux on the desktop” is an oft-seen sentiment among some FreeBSD enthusiasts, and it’s sort of understandable considering the conservative out-of-the-box FreeBSD installation. Despite that, FreeBSD is just a few settings away from being an easy, powerful Desktop OS rivaling Linux, complete with the same software ecosystem available through the Ports collection. Unlike Linux where everything including the kernel is a package, FreeBSD is developed in a single source tree and released on a set schedule – twice a year – as a complete operating system on top of which you can install third-party software. The Release Engineering page tracks the release history and schedule. Two major branches see releases in parallel, and major branches tend to live for two years (four minor versions) after their x.0 release. FreeBSD 10.x is currently the newest release branch with 9.x in maintenance mode and major development happening on 11.x. This guide attempts to show users with various hardware configurations the best way to configure a usable modern workstation running FreeBSD based on my own experience with Emi, my FreeBSD workstation. There are projects such as PC-BSD and GhostBSD that can give you a good out-of-the-box desktop FreeBSD experience, but I find them disconnected from the underlying operating systems because they dump you into KDE or XFCE and attempt to hide as much of FreeBSD as possible behind graphical configuration. That’s not a bad thing, and I’m glad those projects exist, but this guide gets there in the other direction. You will install FreeBSD, learn how it works, and configure it into a great desktop. Compare this guide to something like Linux From Scratch or a Gentoo installation and you’ll see what a breeze this really is. Let’s do it! New Installations The Getting FreeBSD page has links to ISOs for the six tier 1 architectures. This guide focuses on amd64/i386 PCs though is broadly applicable to them all. The ISOs are available in bootonly, CD, DVD, and memstick. I usually grab the nearest >1GB USB drive and dd the newest memstick image to it. The larger DVD images are available complete with Ports distribution files for those doing fully-offline installations. Starting with 10.1 you also have the choice of uefi images, that being the first release to ship with the EFI version of the loader. Give it a shot if you have a computer with UEFI instead of an old-school BIOS, but be warned it is new and still sensitive to UEFI implementations that are incomplete or deviate from the standard. Booting it on my Macbook, for example, leaves me with a useless black screen console despite everything running correctly in the background (Bug 193745), but Apple are well-known for their shoddy UEFI implementation. Boot the chosen installation media via whatever means your computer can (EFI boot menu, BIOS setting, fallback) and get ready to install. FreeBSD will boot to bsdinstall and offer to Install, load an interactive rescue shell, or just boot normally off the installation disk. Choose Install, choose the keyboard mapping appropriate for your computer, and enter a hostname for your machine. When asked to choose system components I recommend selecting all of them. doc is useful to have locally if your Internet connection isn’t working, and system src is needed for some Ports to build and install. Disks On the next screen, Partitioning, select either the Auto (ZFS) option or the Auto (UFS) option. UFS is the traditional Unix file system and is usable on any machine. It is fragile in the case of power loss or crashes unless journaled. ZFS, on the other hand, is both a volume (pool) manager and a great filesystem. I strongly recommend ZFS for modern computers due to its resilience and rich feature set that makes it very practical for desktop use. It checksums your data constantly to ensure integrity and prevent silent corruption on-disk, and its copy-on-write model never overwrites blocks, eliminating the RAID-5 write hole. It supports snapshots, allowing you to snapshot a filesystem at an arbitrary point in time and roll back to it at will, like Apple’s Time Machine, and snapshots can be sent seamlessly across a network for incremental backups. It supports SSD cache devices to speed up reads and writes of pools backed by magnetic hard drives. It can deduplicate files, reducing the on-disk space for files that are significantly identical at the cost of lots of RAM. Achieving these features makes ZFS very memory-hungry. Plan to have 1GiB of physical memory for every 1TB of space in a zpool and much more if deduplication is used. ZFS can be tuned for tighter memory limitations, but very limited systems should use UFS instead. Most modern machines should not need to tune ZFS at all. It will use the memory available to it but also respond to memory pressure when other processes need RAM. Assuming you choose ZFS, set up your zpool. The pool can be a single disk (still called stripe but just striped with itself), a mirror, or any combination of disks in RAID-Z. Name the pool something. I usually name boot pools after the hostname of the machine and then data pools by function. The other ZFS options are dictated by your hardware. If you have an Advanced Format hard disk (any made in the last few years) or an SSD you should force 4k sectors. If your computer has a recent Intel or AMD CPU supporting AES instruction set there is very little downside to encrypting your pool. I recommend it for any pool that doesn’t need to automatically mount at boot, i.e. I use encryption on my workstation but not on my FreeBSD router. Encrypting multiple physical devices with the same key will only require the passphrase once. You will be prompted for the passphrase while the kernel has loaded and is detecting hardware. On my system the passphrase prompt usually gets buried under my USB devices as the kernel enumerates them, so if you find yourself stuck there at boot hit a few keys and Enter to make the passphrase prompt reappear. Use GUID Partition Table (GPT) if your computer uses EFI. PCs with BIOS most likely need to use a legacy MBR. GPT is a requirement to use disks over 2TB in size because MBR can address a maximum of 232 x 512 bytes, just larger than 2TB. The amount of swap space you use if any is dictated by the amount of memory in your computer and the loads you plan to place on it. Conventional wisdom says to use a swap size double the amount of physical memory in the machine, but I find that to apply less and less when you get up into double-digit gigabytes of RAM. My computer has 16GiB or physical memory and 8GiB of swap space defined. On some systems I don’t touch swap at all, but I recommend having at least some. You can enlarge it later. Finish Once your disks are set up the installer will copy files and prompt you for the base configuration of things such root password, time zone, and network options. It will ask you to add at least one non-root user. When creating your personal user account be sure to invite it to the wheel and operator user groups. wheel membership is necessary to gain root privileges for administration tasks, and you will assign operator device permissions later in this guide. When prompted you can remove the install disk and reboot into your new system! Upgrading Are you running a previous version already? The upgrade process is covered in full in Chapter 24 of the Handbook, but assuming you are running the stock GENERIC kernel the process is very simple using freebsd-update. Check my upgrade notes section for specific version instructions. First, fetch the new system using freebsd-update install by specifying the -r argument. Without -r it will just fetch security and errata updates for your current minor version. You can upgrade to a new minor version in your current major or to a new major version entirely. If you’re upgrading to a new major version, go to the .0 release first. Don’t upgrade from, say, 8.4-RELEASE to 9.3-RELEASE, but to 9.0-RELEASE first and then to 9.3. freebsd-update upgrade -r 10.1-RELEASE upgrade is interactive and will ask you to confirm the system components it thinks you have installed. Once it fetches the updated system files you can begin the installation process. freebsd-update install This will install the new kernel but not any non-kernel OS components like userland executables. Reboot via shutdown -r now, reboot, or a swift kick to the power switch. When the system comes up, log in as root and install the new userland by re-running the install command. freebsd-update install At this point your OS itself is ready to go but your Ports need to be updated to run on the new major version via your preferred method, such as pkg update && pkg upgrade, portupgrade, or portmaster. It is alternatively possible to maintain ABI compatibility with an older major version of FreeBSD by installing a compatibility library package such as misc/compat9x, but you shouldn’t unless you need it for a particular binary that isn’t available as source to build for the new version. Once that’s done you can run freebsd-update install one last time to chean out the shared libraries from the previous version. Reboot once more to your final updated system. First Boot Log in as root with the password you configured in the installer. Congratulations! You are now a FreeBSD user! The FreeBSD base system is a fully-featured operating system but as you can see does not contain a graphical environment or any third-party software like your typical Linux distribution. Before installing any of that you should configure your new system to be a better desktop. FreeBSD’s roots are in academia and the datacenter, so its default configuration is very conservative. The desktop or laptop computer you are most likely using is vastly more powerful than some of the configurations that will run FreeBSD, so there is room to grow without being unreasonable. You will need a text editor to edit configuration files. The base system ships with vi (not vim!) but for most users I would recommend ee. It’s part of the base system and is a simple but fully-featured editor like nano from the Linux world. If you aren’t happy with ee there are plenty of great editors you can install from Ports, like editors/vim, but let’s continue. If you aren’t entirely comfortable with editing config files you can re-access the graphical configuration screen from the installer by running bsdconfig as root, but I don’t think you’d be reading this page if that’s the case :) UTF-8 The LANG=xx_YY.ZZZZ environment variable sets the system locale to language code xx, country code YY, and character encoding ZZZZ. Language and country code affect default application language, number formatting, date and time formatting, string collation, currency settings, and more. By enabling a locale using UTF-8 character encoding, the system can understand and display each of the 1112064 characters in the Unicode character set, instead of just US ASCII as is default with LANG=C. Check locale -a | grep UTF-8 for a list of every available UTF-8 locale on your computer. As an American anglophone, I use en_US.UTF-8.

Here are a few you should consider before getting started installing things. The Qt toolkit has some options that can be set via any combination of the following knobs. If you change the QT4_OPTIONS after Qt is installed you will need to rebuild devel/qt4-corelib and x11-toolkits/qt4-gui. QGtkStyle is a selectable theme engine that lets Qt applications integrate more closely with GTK+ environments and can be enabled with the QGTKSTYLE Qt4 option. You should enable this option if you plan to use a GTK+-based desktop environment like MATE or XFCE. Once built you can select the GTK+ visual style in qt4-qtconfig. CUPS is the standard printing engine on Free Unix-like systems. Support for it in Qt can be enabled with the CUPS Qt4 option. Network Audio System is a network transparent client/server audio transport system and can be enabled in Qt applications by setting the NAS Qt4 option. echo "QT4_OPTIONS= CUPS QGTKSTYLE NAS" >> /etc/make.conf Tuning and drivers Change a few sysctl variables to enhance the experience of FreeBSD on the desktop, including expanding the amount of shared memory, tuning the process scheduler for desktop use, and increasing the limit of simultaneously-open files to something sensible. /etc/sysctl.conf # Enhance shared memory X11 interface kern.ipc.shmmax=67108864 kern.ipc.shmall=32768 # Enhance desktop responsiveness under high CPU use (200/224) kern.sched.preempt_thresh=224 # Bump up maximum number of open files kern.maxfiles=200000 # Disable PC Speaker hw.syscons.bell=0 # Shared memory for Chromium kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1 Some knobs can only be set at boot by the loader by setting them in /boot/loader.conf.

The FreeBSD equivalent is sysctl, but you can mount /proc too if you plan to use software requiring it. Some special filesystems like fdescfs must be mounted late on ZFS-rooted systems since the location of their mountpoint won’t exist until late in the boot process. /etc/fstab proc /proc procfs rw 0 0 fdesc /dev/fd fdescfs rw,auto,late 0 0 Toggle the sysctl that lets users mount disks. /etc/sysctl.conf # Allow users to mount disks vfs.usermount=1 If you neglected to add your personal user account to the wheel and operator groups at creation, now is a good time to do so. wheel membership lets you use su to become root, and operator membership is required for device permissions in this configuration. In this example my user is nicole. Substitute it for yours. pw usermod nicole -G wheel pw usermod nicole -G operator Device Permissions Relax default permissions on the device filesystem to allow normal users access to a variety of disks and input/output devices. Permissions for devices existing at boot time are set in devfs.conf. Each line defines a full device path and octal permission value. /etc/devfs.conf # Allow all users to access optical media perm /dev/acd0 0666 perm /dev/acd1 0666 perm /dev/cd0 0666 perm /dev/cd1 0666 # Allow all USB Devices to be mounted perm /dev/da0 0666 perm /dev/da1 0666 perm /dev/da2 0666 perm /dev/da3 0666 perm /dev/da4 0666 perm /dev/da5 0666 # Misc other devices perm /dev/pass0 0666 perm /dev/xpt0 0666 perm /dev/uscanner0 0666 perm /dev/video0 0666 perm /dev/tuner0 0666 perm /dev/dvb/adapter0/demux0 0666 perm /dev/dvb/adapter0/dvr 0666 perm /dev/dvb/adapter0/frontend0 0666 For devices that may be connected post-boot, we add an entry to a devfs.rules ruleset. Rulesets must have a unique name and number, and their rules are composed of a path or quoted path glob and octal permission value. /etc/devfs.rules [devfsrules_common=7] add path 'ad[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'ada[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'da[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'acd[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'cd[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'mmcsd[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'pass[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'xpt[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'ugen[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'usbctl' mode 666 add path 'usb/\*' mode 666 add path 'lpt[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'ulpt[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'unlpt[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'fd[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'uscan[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'video[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'tuner[0-9]*' mode 666 add path 'dvb/\*' mode 666 add path 'cx88*' mode 0660 add path 'cx23885*' mode 0660 # CX23885-family stream configuration device add path 'iicdev*' mode 0660 add path 'uvisor[0-9]*' mode 0660 Enable our new ruleset. /etc/rc.conf devfs_system_ruleset="devfsrules_common" Sound Enable sound support at boot in loader.conf, and load it immediately with kldload snd_driver. echo 'snd_driver_load="YES"' >> /boot/loader.conf Then, cat /dev/sndstat to see your available devices. cat /dev/sndstat FreeBSD Audio Driver (newpcm: 64bit 2009061500/amd64) Installed devices: pcm0: <HDA NVidia (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> (play) pcm1: <HDA NVidia (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> (play) pcm2: <HDA NVidia (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> (play) pcm3: <HDA NVidia (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> (play) pcm4: <HDA Realtek ALC892 PCM #0 Analog> (play/rec) pcm5: <HDA Realtek ALC892 PCM #1 Analog> (play/rec) pcm6: <HDA Realtek ALC892 PCM #2 Digital> (play) pcm7: <HDA Realtek ALC892 PCM #3 Digital> (play) pcm8: <USB audio> (play) default pcm9: <USB audio> (rec) The hw.snd.default_unit sysctl variable controls the default audio output. I want to use the S/PDIF output of my onboard Realtek audio, pcm6, so I set hw.snd.default_unit to 6. Enabling the hw.snd.default_auto boolean will automatically assign hw.snd.default_unit to newly-attached devices. /etc/sysctl.conf # S/PDIF out on my MSI board hw.snd.default_unit=6 # Don't automatically use new sound devices hw.snd.default_auto=0 Networking If you didn’t enable networking during the install process now is a good time to do so. Here as an example is my computer, emi, a desktop with a wired network. I have a Realtek interface, re0. The name of your interface may vary based on the driver it uses. Most drivers are built into the GENERIC kernel, so your interface should be visible by running ifconfig. Common drivers you may see include if_em for Intel PRO interfaces, if_re for Realtek interfaces, and if_en for Midway interfaces. Read more about network configuration in the Handbook to learn about other possible configurations. Wired You can use DHCP and SLAAC auto-discovery on most home networks: /etc/rc.conf hostname="emi.aloe.cooltrainer.org" # Enable DHCP for re0 and don't let dhclient block background_dhclient="YES" ifconfig_re0="DHCP" ifconfig_re0_ipv6="inet6 accept_rtadv" You can bring up the interface and get a DHCP address immediately by issuing ifconfig re0 up and dhclient re0, again substituting the name of your own interface. Alternatively, you can supply static network addresses for your computer and default router: /etc/rc.conf hostname="emi.aloe.cooltrainer.org" ifconfig_re0="inet 172.16.0.40 netmask 255.240.0.0 broadcast 172.31.255.255" defaultrouter="172.16.0.1" ifconfig_re0_ipv6="inet6 2001:370:10f5:806::40 prefixlen 64" ipv6_defaultrouter="2001:370:10f5:806::1" Wireless For WiFi configuration, see the wireless networking section of the Handbook. I sometimes tether my desktop to my Android phone using a run B/G USB interface. It’s as simple as defining a new virtual wlan interface on run0, configuring wpa_supplicant for the WPA pre-shared key, and specifying the SSID and encryption standard (WPA). /etc/rc.conf wlans_run0="wlan0" ifconfig_wlan0="ssid Doubleshot WPA DHCP" /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf network={ ssid="Doubleshot" psk="pantsupantsu" } IPv6 My configuration examples cover both IPv4 and IPv6 because I have a dual-stacked network. Depending on your network you may prefer to enable and prefer IPv6 like me, enable it but prefer IPv4, or not enable it at all. This can be done in rc.conf: /etc/rc.conf ipv6_activate_all_interfaces="YES" ip6addrctl_policy="ipv6_prefer" /etc/sysctl.conf # Accept IPv6 router advertisements net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv=1 Firewall You should run a firewall. Windows, OS X, and many Linux distributions ship with a default firewall ruleset. FreeBSD does not, because there is no one-size-fits-all firewall configuration, but it does include one of the best software firewalls in the world, PF, courtesy of the OpenBSD project. Configuring a firewall can be a very complex topic. There are entire books on the matter. Shown here is the ruleset from my computer. It has rules for a single network interface defined at the top of the file in the ext_if macro. Change it to the name of your computer’s interface as seen in ifconfig. The macros on the next few lines define the TCP and UDP ports on which this ruleset will allow incoming connections. My computer runs an SSH server on the default port, runs www/subsonic on port 443 (HTTPS), and has control ports for net/mosh in the 60000 range. You can open ports for additional services by defining them in those macros. The named services like ssh are defined in /etc/services. /etc/pf.conf # The name of our network interface as seen in `ifconfig` ext_if="re0" # Macros to define the set of TCP and UDP ports to open. # Add additional ports or ranges separated by commas. # UDP 60000-60010 is mosh control http://mosh.mit.edu/ tcp_services = "{ssh, https}" udp_services = "{60000:60010}" # If you block all ICMP requests you will break things like path MTU # discovery. These macros define allowed ICMP types. The additional # ICMPv6 types are for neighbor discovery (RFC 4861) icmp_types = "{echoreq, unreach}" icmp6_types="{echoreq, unreach, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137}" # Modulate the initial sequence number of TCP packets. # Broken operating systems sometimes don't randomize this number, # making it guessable. tcp_state="flags S/SA keep state" udp_state="keep state" # Don't send rejections.

It will abort if your ruleset contains an error unlike service pf restart which will stop, fail to start due to the error, and leave you locked out of SSH. Ask me how I know this will happen. pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf Installing Software FreeBSD is historically famous for its Ports Collection, a directory skeleton of Makefiles and patches describing how to programmatically build packages of third-party software for your computer. Each port contains the metadata for that piece of software including the filename of the source archive, sha256 hash of the files, what other software dependencies it requires, what compile-time options are available, what files it installs, and any patches necessary to work around non-portable code or fix issues that can’t be upstreamed to the projects themselves. Every port has a maintainer whose job it is to keep the port up to date and respond to issues if they arise with newer versions of the operating system. For example, check out the ports I maintain! When you make a port in the Ports Collection it downloads the upstream source archive, patches it, configures it, builds a customized binary package, and uses FreeBSD’s underlying binary package manager to install it. Third-party software installed through the package manager ends up in /usr/local where it mirrors the hierarchy of /usr. It might seem confusing to have them in two places, but it gives a fairly clean separation of the base system from the packages. For example, /usr/local/bin is where you will find firefox after installing www/firefox, but /usr/bin is where you will find ee or sed. As you have experienced, configuration for the operating system is done in /etc. Configuration files for your ports will usually be in /usr/local/etc. Check the hier manual for the full layout. As of FreeBSD 10 there is a new binary package manager, known as pkgng or just pkg. It replaces the old suite of pkg_ tools such as pkg_add and pkg_delete and contains many advanced features that have been missing from FreeBSD for years. Compared to the old package manager, pkgng supports safe upgrades (meaning it saves a copy of the previous-version package to roll back in case of failure), multiple repositories, package staging before install, a more modern binary package format, a more robust sqlite-based package registration database, and most importantly remote binary package upgrades. Thanks to pkgng it is now possible to add multiple remote binary package repositories and get updates from them without relying on building Ports at all. I still prefer building from Ports to using the binary packages because there are many useful non-default options on many useful ports and many ports unavailable as binary packages on the default repository. FreeBSD Ports’ options are as conservative as the base system, so options that pull in optional shared libraries or enable non-Free features will be off by default, and binary packages from the official package repository will reflect those defaults. Examples of non-default options you as a desktop user will probably want include support for most of the codecs in multimedia/mplayer and multimedia/vlc, PAM support in net/samba36, USB printer support in print/cups, and many others. It is possible to mix and match binary packages and building certain packages from Ports using pkgng’s lock and unlock, but that gets more advanced and more annoying than is appropriate for this guide. I build my ports on one of my computers using poudriere then use that computer as a binary package repository for the other FreeBSD computers on my network. A new user with just one computer should stick with one or the other until they are more familiar with the OS. I use and recommend Ports for users in this guide for the customizability, but the names are equivalent. For example, when I say “Change directory to /usr/ports/www/firefox and make install” you can also use pkg install firefox to get the already-compiled package from the official default repo with default options. No matter the route you choose, you should begin by updating your pkg repository or your Ports tree. pkg update will fetch an updated index from every PACKAGESITE defined in that environment variable or in /usr/local/etc/pkg.conf. For Ports, portsnap fetch extract will retrieve a new full ports tree. You should read pkg for the list of commands supported by pkg and read ports for the list of available make targets in Ports, but in general you will use pkg install <portname> or cd /usr/ports/<category>/<portname> && make install to install software. The first things I usually install are sysutils/tmux and shells/zsh because I prefer it to the venerable default tcsh. You might be more comfortable with shells/bash. Once installed, changing your user’s default shell is as simple as chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh. Staying Up To Date Before updating your Ports tree or pkg catalogue I suggest checking out UPDATING. This file – also found at /usr/ports/UPDATING – tracks breaking changes in packages and the steps necessary to to fix them. It will tell you when configuration file syntax has changed, how to fix dependencies when ports split or merge, when default versions of packages change, and more. You can update your already-extracted Ports tree to the newest revision with portsnap fetch update. There are two common tools for programmatically upgrading your ports, ports-mgmt/portupgrade and ports-mgmt/portmaster. I prefer portupgrade because portmaster stubbornly aborts the entire upgrade on any error, but you might like it. The common portmaster usage is portmaster -a to upgrade installed ports. I usually update with portupgrade -rac, with -r -a to recursively update all installed ports and -c to preemptively show new port options so they won’t interrupt the build. If you are using binary packages you can update the package repository catalog with pkg update and upgrade your installed packages with pkg upgrade. The Handbook has a more detailed chapter on using Ports that includes upgrading and other tasks. Going Graphical I’m sure you’re eager to get out of the text-only console. To do so you need to install the X.org distribution of the X Window System. Change directory to /usr/ports/x11/xorg. Since Xorg is comprised of many modular Ports it takes a while to build and contains many port options (displayed to you as a blue dialog prompt.) Run make config-recursive in x11/xorg to set these port options in advance so they don’t continually interrupt the build. Read over the options as they are presented, but generally don’t toggle an option if you don’t know what it does. The defaults are default for a reason :) Once you’ve chosen all the options, run make config-recursive again, since it’s likely for a dependency enabled the first time to have options of its own. When no further port options are displayed run make install to compile and install X.org. X.org by default uses FreeBSD’s devd for hardware detection and D-Bus for interprocess communication. HAL used to be the default hardware detection mechanism but is in the process of deprecation, so you may not need it unless you plan to use a desktop environment that still depends on it. Check the dependencies for sysutils/hal for a list of software still requiring it. /etc/rc.conf hald_enable="YES" dbus_enable="YES" With Radeon, Intel, or otherwise This section explains how you should configure X for systems using an AMD Radeon and the radeon driver, an Intel grahpics chip with the intel driver, virtualized graphics cards like emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions’s vboxvideo, or any other generic framebuffer device supported by the default vesa driver. As root, run X -configure. It will spit out a new X.org configuration file in /root/xorg.conf.new based on your detected hardware. Copy this file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf, then pull it up in a text editor for a few modifications. Add an “Extensions” section and enable the Composite extension. Section "Extensions" Option "Composite" "Enable" EndSection Add one line to the ServerLayout section to enable AIGLX. Section "ServerLayout" Identifier "X.org Configured" Screen 0 "Screen0" 0 0 InputDevice "Mouse0" "CorePointer" InputDevice "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard" Option "AIGLX" "true" EndSection I usually enable the EXA AccelMethod and DRI by adding their respective lines to the Device section. If you have a Radeon card ensure your Driver is configured as radeon, not radeonhd! radeonhd is an older, Novell-sponsored, defunct driver for Radeon HD hardware, but -configure likes to pick it by default if it’s installed. You should use radeon instead. Otherwise X -configure should pick the best driver. Section "Device" Option "AccelMethod" "EXA" Option "DRI" "true" Identifier "Card0" Driver "radeon" VendorName "Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI" BoardName "RV770 [Radeon HD 4850]" BusID "PCI:1:0:0" EndSection Enable the freetype, bitmap, and type1 X font modules by adding them to the Module section. According to the manual, “[t]he extmod, dbe, dri, dri2, glx, and record extension modules are loaded automatically if they are present”, but I like to go for the explicit configuration and define them anyway. Section "Module" Load "dbe" Load "dri" Load "dri2" Load "extmod" Load "record" Load "freetype" Load "bitmap" Load "type1" Load "glx" EndSection With NVIDIA Skip this section if you don’t use an NVIDIA graphics card. The binary x11/nvidia-driver is the only proprietary software on my system. As much as I’d prefer a free and open solution, I’ve found that neither Nouveau nor the free Radeon or Intel driver compare to the speed and feature support of Nvidia’s official driver. Install the driver itself, x11/nvidia-settings, and x11/nvidia-xconfig. To load the nvidia kernel module at boot, enable it in /boot/loader.conf. echo 'nvidia_load="YES"' >> /boot/loader.conf Run nvidia-xconfig to get a base xorg.conf in /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Pull it up in your favourite text editor and add the Module section to enable the freetype2, glx, type1 extensions. /etc/X11/xorg.conf Section "Module" Load "freetype" Load "bitmap" Load "type1" Load "glx" EndSection Later on, once you’re booted into the graphical environment, you can use nvidia-settings to configure TwinView and any other settings. Install fonts X.org doesn’t include many attractive typefaces by default. Luckily, there are plenty available in Ports. Here are a few I use, including many from non-Roman languages for better Unicode coverage. Arphicttf and font-std for Chinese coverage. Culmus and El-Mar for Hebrew language coverage. IPA, IPA UIGothic, IPAex, Kochi, MigMix, Migu, Mona, MOTOYA, M+, Sazanami, Shinonome, Takao, UmeFont, VLGothic, Hanazono Mincho, and Mika-chan for Japanese language coverage. A-Lee fonts, Nanum, and Un fonts for Korean language coverage. Anonymous Pro, artwiz-aleczapka, DejaVu, Inconsolata, and Terminus for terminals and editors. Cantarell, Droid, Doulos SIL, and Ubuntu for general Roman alphabet language coverage. Telugu for Telugu language. Isabella, Ecofont, and Junicode as novelty typefaces. KhmerOS for Khmer language coverage. Padauk for Myanmar language coverage. STIX and Computer Modern for technical and mathematic symbols. Charis, URW, KOI8, Geminifonts, CYR-RFX, and ParaType for Cyrillic and Eastern European language coverage. x11-fonts/webfonts is a special case. It includes the Microsoft Core Fonts for the Web such as Andale and Verdana. If you own a valid Microsoft Windows license you can get Tahoma as well by adding to /etc/make.conf first. /etc/make.conf # Enable Tahoma in x11-fonts/webfonts if you have a Windows license # You show me yours and I'll show you mine ;) .if ${.CURDIR:M*/x11-fonts/webfonts} WITH_MSWINDOWS_LICENSE=yes .endif Now that those fonts are installed you need to tell Xorg about them using a FontPath in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf so they can be used. Unfortunately the font paths in Ports are not entirely standardized. Most of them end up in /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts, some end up in /usr/local/share/fonts/, and some in just /usr/local/share/. Here’s the relevant section from my xorg.conf. Yours should look similar.

You can re-scan the configured FontPaths by running fc-cache -vf and can list all installed fonts with fc-list to check that they all appear. For example, I have a fairly large local font repository in my ~/.fonts/ directory and have 2313 fonts available on my system as of this writing according to fc-list | wc -l. Desktop Environments The best part of the X Window System ecosystem is the variety of environments available. You might prefer the configurability of KDE, the sparse cleanliness of MATE, something minimal like Window Maker, or even tiling like i3. This isn’t xwinman, but I’ve included screenshots and descriptions for some of the most popular environments to give you an idea what’s out there. KDE 4 KDE is the largest and most fully-featured Free Software desktop environment, based on the Qt toolkit. Its configuration options are dizzyingly numerous and it has excellent support for modern technologies like high-DPI displays. It has a modern compositing window manager, KWin, the web and file browser Konqueror that famously spawned the KHTML engine that became WebKit, and a family of other Qt applications like the excellent Clementine. The KDE4 meta-port is available at x11/kde4. You can start KDE with exec startkde in your .xinitrc, but KDE also includes its own graphical login manager, KDM which you can optionally enable in rc.conf and start as a service. echo 'kdm4_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf service kdm4 start MATE née GNOME 2 GNOME 2 was a venerable desktop environment made famous as the Ubuntu default around 2008, and MATE is the community fork of GNOME 2 after the GNOME team lost their collective minds. GNOME 2 is still available in Ports at x11/gnome2 but I can’t recommend using it since version 2.32 in 2010 is the last of its lineage. If you have a major GNOME craving check out the MATE Desktop Environment instead. It’s a well-maintained fork of 2.32 by an awesome team who lack GNOME’s utter contempt for their users. The MATE meta-port is available at x11/mate. MATE and GNOME users should configure PolicyKit to allow normal users to mount removable media automatically. /usr/local/etc/PolicyKit/PolicyKit.conf <config version="0.1"> <match action="org.freedesktop.hal.storage.mount-removable"> <return result="yes"/> </match> <match action="org.freedesktop.hal.storage.mount-fixed"> <return result="yes"/> </match> <match user="root"> <return result="yes"/> </match> <define_admin_auth group="wheel"/> </config> MATE doesn’t include a GDM alternative, so start it with exec mate-session in your .xinitrc. Compiz is a popular alternative window manager with MATE and GNOME 2 users. It gives you those fancy wobbly windows, 3d cubes, and all kinds of flashy stuff. You can install Compiz-Fusion from x11-wm/compiz-fusion. Be sure to disable the obsolete and unmaintained window decorator Emerald, a leftover from the Beryl project, when prompted on the port configuration screen. With Emerald disabled, compiz will default to gtk-window-decorator and will take on your normal GTK theme appearance but with more transparency and garish animation. Once installed, open Settings > Preferences > CompizConfig Settings Manager. You’ll probably want to enable the following plugins at minimum: General: Gnome Compatibility Desktop: Desktop Cube, Rotate Cube Effects: Animations, Window Decoration, Wobbly Windows Window Management: Application Switcher, Move Window, Place Windows, Resize Window Open the “Run” box with Alt+F2 and execute compiz-manager. compiz-manager is a script for detecting and using the proper compiz options for your video hardware. Your screen will flash while Compiz and gtk-window-decorator initialize and replace Marco, MATE’s default window manager. If your windows are missing titlebars, double-check you’ve enabled “Window Decoration” in ccsm. If all seems well, add compiz-manager as a new startup application (in Settings > Preferences > Startup Applications), then change MATE’s window manager preference in DConf: gsettings set org.mate.session.required-components windowmanager compiz To switch back, use the same command with the argument marco. Window Maker It isn’t as popular or well-known as the others here, but Window Maker is my favorite and longest-used window manager. It is based on the look and feel of the NEXTSTEP operating system, the OS that became Rhapsody and then Mac OS X and iOS. Unlike the extremely limited one-dimensional Mac OS X dock, Window Maker offers a main dock as well as a “clip” dock that is unique to each virtual desktop. Docks can hold normal launchers and “dockapps”, small self-contained dock accessories. You can install Window Maker from x11-wm/windowmaker and start it with exec wmaker in your .xinitrc. In addition, I also show x11-clocks/wmclock, sysutils/wmcpuload, net/wmnd, audio/wmix, x11/sakura, and x11-fm/rox-filer. The first time you start Window Maker you should run wmaker.inst to install the starter configuration to your ~/GNUstep directory. Enlightenment Enlightenment was the original eye-candy desktop before modern compositors were even a thing. Version 0.17 is the ambitious rewrite release that almost never came out until e17releasemanager got it out the door. It contains an eye-catching desktop built on the project’s own Enlightenment Foundation Libraries. E17 is shiny, bouncy, extendable, and very configurable. You can install it from x11-wm/enlightenment and run it with exec enlightenment_start in your .xinitrc. XFCE XFCE descends, like KDE, from the design of the once-proprietary Common Desktop Environment. As of XFCE 4.0, however, the desktop has become more of a GNOME-lite, the “other” GTK+ desktop environment. I don’t have much to say about it, but it is a very functional and lightweight desktop with panels, a window manager, a great file manager (Thunar), and some other lightweight applications like a terminal. You can start XFCE with exec startxfce4 in your .xinitrc. Cinnamon Cinnamon is a GTK 3 desktop environment from the Linux Mint project. It began as a fork of the GNOME 3 Shell into a more traditional panels and menus UI since many were dissatisfied with the drastic redesign of a beloved environment. It’s come into its own as a modern DE and offers everything you would expect from GNOME 2 or MATE with a cohesive feel and forks of several of the GNOME core apps. The only reasons I strongly prefer MATE to Cinnamon are the dearth of great GTK+ 3.x themes and Cinnamon’s inability to have more than a single panel in a multiple-monitor setup, issue #130, but the latter looks to be getting some traction as of late 2014. You can install Cinnamon from x11/cinnamon and start it with exec cinnamon-session in your .xinitrc. There is also a fallback software-rendering mode that can be started with exec cinnamon-session-cinnamon2d instead. No screenshots of this one since it won’t run in VirtualBox with any combination I can find of 3D/cinnamon2d and vboxvideo/vesa. Shoot me an email if you know how to make it behave otherwise check out screenshots of Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition on their screenshots page. GNOME 3 GNOME 3, available on Linux since 3.0 in the spring of 2011, is finally available in the official FreeBSD tree as of November 2014. The three and a half year delay is thanks to the upstream GNOME project’s years-long fight against any operating system that doesn’t have a penguin for a mascot. It took several years and a vastly waning userbase, then suddenly they care about portability again. Sure, okay. Either way, it’s here and you can install it from x11/gnome3. We weren’t missing much in the delay, since the GNOME team tossed out everything great about their once-ubiquitous DE and turned it into a shiny but unconfigurable iOS imitator where basic features and options are either not available at all, buried inside a settings registry more reminiscent of Windows 98 than BSD, or relegated to extensions that will break with every new minor version thanks to the lack of any stable extensions API and whose very existence are opposed by many of the main project contributors. Take a look at the GNOME Shell Extensions page with me and be amused that you need an extension to use a theme, categorize the Applications menu, remove the otherwise-omnipresent accessibility menu from the status bar, or even power off your computer without knowing about the magic Alt-button toggle. If you want a great GTK-based desktop environment maintained by a team that doesn’t hate you, check out MATE, XFCE, or Cinnamon. All three are excellent. I guess I can thank the GNOME project’s self-destruction for getting me back into Window Maker. Theming Finding Clearlooks too drab and blue? You can find a world of themes and icons for MATE over on GNOME-Look, for KDE at KDE-Look, for XFCE at XFCE-Look, for E17 at E17-Stuff, and for several lightweight window managers at Box-Look. There are several attractive and usable themes buried among the OS X Aqua clones, Vista Aero clones, and black-as-my-soul darkness-fests that are standard on any theming website. You can change theme settings for Qt4 applications with qt4-qtconfig and for KDE Qt applications (like Clementine) in the KDE System Settings. GTK+ is selectable in many window managers’ appearance preferences, and you can also install x11-themes/lxappearance for a light GTK theme switcher. Starting X The shell script .xinitrc in your home directory is the script that is executed for the lifecycle of your X session. .xinitrc is used to run startup applications and then run your window manager. When you finally end your X session your window manager will exit, .xinitrc will return, and the X server will stop. ~/.xinitrc xscreensaver -no-splash & xdg-user-dirs-update & redshift & compton & exec wmaker In my example .xinitrc I use Window Maker and start x11/xscreensaver, xdg-user-dirs, accessibility/redshift, and the lightweight compositor x11-wm/compton. This example script takes an argument to allow a choice of window managers. You can start an X session with startx or xinit <windowmanager> to supply the argument to .xinitrc. Starting your graphical session after logging in on a TTY is the traditional way, but I like to use a graphical login manager, x11/slim. It is like KDM or GDM but with no dependency on a particular desktop environment. After installing it you can configure the sessiondir directive in the SLiM configuration file to define the path to desktop entries installed by your ports, usually /usr/local/share/xsessions. Use exec $1 instead of a particular executable name in your .xinitrc to run the command from SLiM passed in as an argument. You can switch session with the F1 key on the login screen. /usr/local/etc/slim.conf sessiondir /usr/local/share/xsessions/ echo 'slim_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf service slim start The X session will use one of the virtual ttys. Once started, you can switch to a different virtual TTY with CTRL-ATL-F#. You can switch back to the graphical TTY with CTRL-ATL-F9. You may need to create a desktop entry for your window manager of choice if the port maintainer doesn’t ship one. Here’s an example. /usr/local/share/xsessions/wmaker.desktop [Desktop Entry] Encoding=UTF-8 Name=Window Maker Exec=/usr/local/bin/wmaker Comment=This session logs you into Window Maker Type=Application Extras and Miscellany Printing CUPS is the standard for printing on Free Unix-like systems and can be installed from Ports along with any needed filters. Install the CUPS meta-port at print/cups. Install HPLIP in print/hplip for HP printer drivers (and my Brother HL-2170W, for some reason). Install the Foomatic filter collection in print/foomatic-filters and its database and engine in print/foomatic-db and print/foomatic-db-engine, respectively. I find the CUPS-PDF virtual printer in print/cups-pdf very useful as well. Enable CUPS once installed: /etc/rc.conf # Disable line printer daemon since we have CUPS lpd_enable="NO" # Enable CUPS cupsd_enable="YES" Add local users to the cups group if you want them to be able to print. pw usermod root -G cups pw usermod nicole -G cups Start the CUPS service with service cupsd start and you should be able to access its web configuration UI at http://localhost:631/ in your web browser. It may prompt you for your root password to write the config files in /usr/local/etc/cups. Most full desktop environments include a GUI to control CUPS and add printers, but the web interface is available in any of them. The web interfaces’ built-in documentation can help you configure different models of printer, specifically the Network Protocols Supported by CUPS and Common Network Printer URIs sections. S.M.R.T. sysutils/smartmontools installs smartd and smartctl, a daemon and utility for checking the S.M.A.R.T. status of your local disks. Enable the sample smartd.conf. It contains one directive, DEVICESCAN, that causes smartd to scan all attached drives. cp /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf.sample /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf echo 'smartd_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf service smartd start You can check the S.M.A.R.T. status of a drive directly with smartctl as root. The -H flag will show basic pass or fail health status, and the -a flag will show everything. smartctl -H /dev/ada0 smartctl 6.2 2014-02-18 r3874 [FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE-p2 amd64] (local build) Copyright (C) 2002-13, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, www.smartmontools.org === START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION === SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED Java FreeBSD has several available Java providers, including OpenJDK and Sun's Oracle’s JDK. I recommend the newest OpenJDK for most people. It’s far easier to install than the binary Oracle JRE which requires logging in to a web page, agreeing to the license, and manually downloading the distfile for Ports. At the time of this writing the newest OpenJDK is java/openjdk8. OpenJDK 6 and 7 are available as well if you have software that doesn’t run on Java 8. If you need a Java browser plugin you can build and install java/icedtea-web once a Java provider is available. Webcams and DVB Most USB webcams and many DVB tuners are supported by multimedia/webcamd, and webcamd depends on the userland character device driver in multimedia/cuse4bsd-kmod. Install them, then enable them in rc.conf and loader.conf. /etc/rc.conf # Webcam daemon webcamd_enable="YES" /boot/loader.conf # Userland character device driver for webcams cuse4bsd_load="YES" You can use your camera device with pwcview available in multimedia/pwcview or with Cheese in multimedia/cheese. Cheese provides a nice interface similar to Apple’s Photobooth on OS X, but it has a heavy GNOME library dependency some may not want on their systems. IBus IBus is a modern IME for Unix-like systems, allowing one to input CJK languages. Install the main IME from textproc/ibus as well as QT application support from textproc/ibus-qt. You’ll need one or more input methods once the IME itself is installed. Ports of interest: chinese/ibus-chewing - Chewing engine for IBus chinese/ibus-pinyin - The PinYin input method japanese/ibus-anthy - Anthy engine for IBus japanese/ibus-mozc - Mozc engine for IBus japanese/ibus-skk - SKK engine for IBus korean/ibus-hangul - Hangul engine for IBus textproc/ibus-kmfl - KMFL IMEngine for IBus framework textproc/ibus-m17n - The m17n IMEngine for IBus framework textproc/ibus-table - Table based IM framework for IBus Heavyweight desktop environments like GNOME or KDE will let you configure the input method graphically. In GNOME 2 and MATE, for example, you can open the IBus preferences from the Settings > Preferences menu. KDE/Qt users can enable it as the default IME in qtconfig-qt4. Lightweight window manager users like me can start it in .xinitrc: ~/.xinitrc export XMODIFIERS="@im=ibus" export GTK_IM_MODULE="ibus" export QT_IM_MODULE="ibus" exec ibus-daemon -d -x & Now run any GTK or QT application, press your keyboard shortcut to switch input methods, and test it out. Linuxulator FreeBSD’s Linuxulator allows it to run Linux application binaries using system call translation. Desktop users will find it useful for running the handful of proprietary but necessary programs that are available for Linux but not for FreeBSD, such as Adobe Flash Player. Install the Linux base distribution from Ports. As I write this the default base distribution is emulators/linux_base-c6, based on CentOS 6, replacing the old Fedora 10 based emulators/linux_base-f10. Unless you need to use a particular f10-only application (like Skype) you should prefer the modern base, overriding the default in make.conf and switching to the necessary kernel version in sysctl.conf before doing the installation: /etc/make.conf OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=c6 OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=c6 echo 'compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18' >> /etc/sysctl.conf sysctl -f /etc/sysctl.conf Once your chosen linux_base installed, tell your system to load the linux kernel module at boot. echo 'linux_load="YES"' >> /boot/loader.conf Mount the linprocfs virtual filesystems for compatibility with GNOME and other programs requiring them. /etc/fstab linproc /compat/linux/proc linprocfs,auto,late rw 0 0 Besides proprietary garbageware like Flash Player I also use Linuxulator along with the Loki compatibility library package to run Loki Software’s Linux ports of some of the best PC games ever made, like Simcity 3000 Unlimited. Wine Wine is a free implementation of the Win32 API capable of running real Windows applications on Unix-like systems. It’s available from emulators/wine or emulators/wine-devel, containing the latest stable and unstable versions respectively. The optional Gecko support is an mshtml.dll replacement that will allow Windows programs to embed web pages using the Mozilla engine. The optional Mono will let Wine run Windows programs written in versions 1.x or 2.0 of the .NET Framework without using the proprietary .NET runtime. You can also download winetricks, a script containing Wine installation recipes for popular software, and you may find a Wine GUI such as emulators/swine useful for maintaining separate Wine prefixes. FreeBSD currently lacks the ability to install 32-bit ports on a 64-bit system, normally precluding an amd64 user from installing a 32-bit Wine capable of running 32-bit Windows applications. As a workaround, David Naylor maintains Wine32 packages for FreeBSD amd64. You can install them from emulators/i386-wine or emulators/i386-wine-devel. If you plan to use Wine to run browser plugins, use the compholio-patched version of wine in emulators/wine-compholio or emulators/i386-wine-compholio instead. Wine is very impressively-compatible these days. I use it to run a lot of games from Humble Store and GOG so I don’t have to fire up a Windows computer or VM. Wine is so good it is used to create the Linux versions of many of these titles, such as Freedom Planet, and in that case it’s a lot easier to run the same executable in FreeBSD Wine than to try and get the Linux Wine binaries running via Linuxulator. If every wine command fails with ELF interpreter /libexec/ld-elf.so.1 not found your 64-bit system is missing the 32-bit libraries necessary for Wine. You’ll need to install them. From the releases FTP, grab the lib32.txz matching your version of the OS and extract it either as root or with sudo to the root of your filesystem to install. The archive contains a full directory hierarchy so all the files will end up in the right place. fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/10.1-RELEASE/lib32.txz tar xfp lib32.txz -C / Browser Plugins Adobe Flash Player is not released for FreeBSD but is usable on FreeBSD i386 and amd64 through your choice of two wrappers. The 32-bit Linux version of the Flash plugin can be installed via www/linux-c6-flashplugin11 or www/linux-f10-flashplugin11, executed through Linuxulator, and adapted to 32-bit or 64-bit native browsers with www/nspluginwrapper, though it is important to note Adobe dropped support for the NPAPI Linux version of Flash with version 11.2 back in 2012. They left development up to Google who only release a PPAPI version as part of their proprietary Chrome browser bundle, something that isn’t even available for FreeBSD. Even Chromium will be unable to use NPAPI Flash after 2014 as Google deprecates and removes NPAPI support from Chromium and Chrome starting in version 32. For now you can still use it in Firefox and other NPAPI browsers, but I think it’s just time to say goodbye to this old version or to Flash in general if you can help it. To use nspluginwrapper, make sure linprocfs is mounted and execute nspluginwrapper -v -a -i as your normal user to locate and enable the Linux Flash plugin. -a automatically finds available plugins and -i installs them. It’s important to remember it makes a copy of the Flash library in your home directory when you do this, so every time you update the version of Flash installed through Ports you need to remove your local cory with nspluginwrapper -v -a -r and install the new one with nspluginwrapper -v -a -i. Adobe promised security updates for the NPAPI Flash Player through 2017, and if history is any indication you’re going to need them. A newer and arguably better solution is emulators/pipelight, a Wine-based wrapper for Windows browsers plugins. It supports the very newest version of Flash, freeing us from the limitations of 11.2, and also supports Shockwave, Silverlight, Unity, and more. It requires a special patched version of Wine, emulators/wine-compholio or emulators/i386-wine-compholio. Once installed, activate plugins as root. pipelight-plugin --create-mozilla-plugins pipelight-plugin --enable flash Silverlight is available as well and can allow you to watch DRMed NetFlix content via your browser on FreeBSD. I have no experience using it since I don’t buy DRMed streaming media subscriptions, but it can be installed the same way. pipelight-plugin --enable silverlight5.1 Heed www/pipelight’s pkg-message warning about Silverlight DRM if you have a ZFS-based system: For users running with ZFS on root, watching DRM protected content requires extensive xattr support. If you run into issues with DRM failing, you can use the “pipelight-mkufs” command to create a UFS formatted ZVOL mounted on your users ~/.wine-pipelight directory. Other plugins are enabled the same way, and the list of available plugins can be seen in pipelight-plugin --help. Virtualization It’s pretty common to virtualize another operating system on your computer, possibly to run a proprietary program or access a proprietary office groupware system. Whatever the reason, it’s easy to accomplish on FreeBSD. FreeBSD 10 has a new built-in hypervisor known as bhyve capable of running FreeBSD natively and other operating systems via sysutils/grub2-bhyve. At the moment it only implements a serial console to access the guest systems which is fine for a server OS but probably not what you want. Alternatively, VirtualBox open source edition is available at emulators/virtualbox-ose. Build it with Guest Additions enabled for the best experience virtualizing Windows and Linux. Once it’s installed, configure loader.conf to load the VirtualBox kernel module and configure rc.conf to start VirtualBox bridged networking. /boot/loader.conf vboxdrv_load="YES" /etc/rc.conf vboxnet_enable="YES" /etc/devfs.conf # Allow VirtualBox network access own vboxnetctl root:vboxusers perm vboxnetctl 0660 pw usermod nicole -G vboxusers Skype Skype is bad, proprietary software that doesn’t value your freedom. Use audio/mumble or net-im/ekiga instead if you can. If you still wish to use Skype, make sure you have Linuxulator enabled and install net-im/skype. Version 2.1 of Skype’s Linux client dropped support for OSS, found in FreeBSD as the default sound API. Thanks to this, Skype 2.0 persisted for years as the version in Ports. With the introduction of an ALSA compatibility shim in FreeBSD 8.3 and 9.0 and audio/linux-f10-alsa-plugins-oss, we can use the newer ALSA-only Skype client. There is a newer Skype client available as net-im/skype4 that supports the CentOS 6 linux_base, but that version is not usable on FreeBSD 10.x due to missing syscalls in that branch’s Linuxulator. The ALSA client, unlike the old OSS client, requires some explicit configuration to use our sound devices. They must be defined manually in /compat/linux/etc/alsa/pcm/pcm-oss.conf, the configuration file of alsa-plugins-oss. In this example, I enable pcm6/dsp6 for audio output, and pcm8/dsp8, a USB webcam, as a microphone source. /compat/linux/etc/alsa/pcm/pcm-oss.conf pcm.oss8 { type oss device /dev/dsp8 hint { description "Open Sound System - Webcam" } } ctl.oss8 { type oss device /dev/mixer8 hint { description "Open Sound System - Webcam" } } pcm.oss6 { type oss device /dev/dsp6 hint { description "Open Sound System - S/PDIF" } } ctl.oss6 { type oss device /dev/mixer6 hint { description "Open Sound System - S/PDIF" } } The microphone volume can be controlled by invoking the mixer of your chosen recording device. Let’s raise the microphone volume now from 0% to 75%. mixer -f /dev/mixer8 mic 75 ISO-8601 This is personal preference, but I also set my LC_TIME environment variable to the en_DK faux-locale for ISO-8601 date formats instead of the ridiculous American standard. Quick, what date is 6/5/12? Oh, it’s 2012-06-05, of course. The locale isn’t included with the FreeBSD base system as it is in many Linux distributions, but it’s available from Ivan Voras’ blog. tar -C /usr/share/locale -zxf /path/to/your/en_DK.UTF-8.tgz Enable it in the login database and /etc/profile. /etc/login.conf @@ -46,7 +46,8 @@ \:ignoretime@:\ \:umask=022:\ \:charset=UTF-8:\ - \:lang=en_US.UTF-8: + \:lang=en_US.UTF-8:\ + \:setenv=LC_TIME=en_DK.UTF-8: cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf /etc/profile LC_TIME=en_DK.UTF-8; export LC_TIME Upgrade Notes This guide assumes you will track the newest STABLE branch, upgrading to new stable branches at the initial .0 release. That’s not a thing I would ever recommend with OS X, but I haven’t been burned by a new major FreeBSD version yet. This section notes things you need to know to keep your system in top shape when upgrading. 9.x to 10.0 If you are updating from 9.x to 10.0 or higher, run pkg2ng after rebooting into the new OS. This conversion script will convert the list of installed packages from the format used by the old pkg_ tools to the format used by pkgng, the new binary package manager.

DELL XPS CNF:3705-6 Ultrabook Intel Core i5 2.70 GHz 256 GB SSD Intel HD Graphics Shared memory 13.3" Touchscreen Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A The DELL XPS 13 sets a new standard for 13" laptops with excellent performance, an attractive design and premium build in a sleek, elegant compact package. It is the world's smallest 13" laptop, by featuring a 13" display in a dimension of an 11" laptop. You'll love the screen at first sight, with a virtually border-less design, IPS panel technology and Full HD (1920x1080) resolution. The high frequency Intel Core processor delivers performance and capability needed for everyday tasks, like surfing, movies, office documents, home budget, and multitasking. Its backlit keyboard allows error-free typing in dim environments. The improved touch pad lets you scroll, pinch, zoom and point with speed and accuracy. You'll also appreciate its Corning Gorilla Glass for screen protection, extended battery life, fast SSD storage and an array of the latest connectivity options like USB 3.0, mini DisplayPort, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Best of all, with a stylish, durable and lightweight machined aluminum casing, the XPS 13 is a great companion that keeps you productive and entertained whenever you need it. The Smallest 13-Inch on the Planet with the World’s First InfinityEdge Display Large screen, small laptop: The virtually borderless infinityEdge display cleverly fits a 13-inch display into the size of an 11-inch laptop. Impressive screen size: The thin bezel frees up the screen space in this innovative design. The three-sided, virtually borderless infinity display measures a miniscule 5.2mm border: the thinnest frame on a notebook. With a slim bezel of less than 2% of the total display, you have more screen area to love. Thin build: Not only is the XPS 13 small, it's also stunningly thin to make it an ideal mobile companion. At only 9-15mm thick and starting at only 2.6 pounds (1.18kg), it is easy to stick in your purse or bag while you are on the go. Stunning View Easy to share: See content clearly from almost any angle with an IGZO2 IPS panel, providing a wide viewing angle of up to 170°. Enjoy the vibrant screen together with your friends. Brighten your day: The screen is brilliant enough to watch movies in sunlight without missing the details. At 400-nit, it’s up to 100% brighter than a typical panel (200-nit) for a great view even outside. With a high color gamut of 72% and a high contrast ratio of 1000:1, more colors are represented so you can see the brightest whites and the darkest darks. Small Size. Big Performance Start faster: Enjoy the speed, clarity and improved graphics with the new 5th Generation Intel Core processors. Stay powered longer: With up to 11 hours (for reference only) of run time on the QHD+ display, it’s leading the industry in battery life. Paired with the Dell Power Companion, you get up to 22 hours and the freedom to power all of your bonus devices. Speedy startup: The XPS 13 boots and resumes in seconds thanks to a standard solid state drive and Intel Rapid Start Technology. Improved Usability Pinch, zoom and click with precision: The improved touch pad delivers the exact action you intend, every time, so no more jumping or floating cursors. It delivers fluid panning, pinching and zooming, for an experience that’s touch screen-smooth and quick, and similar to the gestures you are used to on screen. And with Accidental Activation Prevention, there are no more mis-clicks when your palm hits the touch pad. See what you’ve been missing: This standard backlit keyboard lights up your keys and your ideas. No need to squint in low-light or no-light rooms while typing. Once you experience this added feature, you won’t be able to live without it. Premium Materials for a Stunning Design and Durability Tough stuff: Machined aluminum construction means the XPS 13 is precision-cut from a single block of aluminum for a sturdy, durable chassis. Cool under pressure: XPS products use carbon fiber that is similar to what is used for some of the world’s high performance cars and racing bikes for a stellar combination of lightweight and strength. The palm rest is strong and thin like aluminum, but lighter and cooler to the touch. Resists life’s “oops” moments: The Corning Gorilla Glass NBT QHD+ display is up to 10 times more scratch resistant than soda lime glass, so it helps prevent scuffs caused by handling, cleaning or wiping. Greenest XPS Laptop Ever Power-efficient: It’s more power-efficient than ever, enough to be ENERGY STAR 6.0 certified. Smarter materials: Built with the environment in mind, the XPS 13 is free of concerning materials like lead, mercury and some phthalates. The greenest XPS laptop ever, it’s also EPEAT Gold registered and BFR/PVC-free. Recycle-friendly: The rapidly renewable bamboo trays are 100% recyclable, so you won’t worry about your environmental footprint. And an impressive 90% of the laptop’s parts can be easily recycled or reused.

Depending on the market segment the drives are aimed at, these new SSDs use either MLC or TLC NAND, and come in form factors that include M.2 and 2.5-inch. The SSD line that is of most interest is the SSD 600p, which is targeting consumer applications. Using TLC NAND in an M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 form factor, SSD 600p drives feature sequential read and write speeds up to 1800 MB/s and 560 MB/s respectively. Random performance is rated at 155k IOPS reads and 128k IOPS writes. Pricing for these drives is decent considering their performance and capacity. Here's a quick breakdown: 128 GB M.2 - $69 256 GB M.2 - $104 512 GB M.2 - $189 1024 GB M.2 - $359 Intel has also launched the Pro 6000p line, which is very similar to the 600p except for remote secure erasure support, which adds $10 to the price at any capacity. The other SSD lines featuring 3D NAND target IoT and data center applications. The M.2 PCIe E 6000p line brings slightly reduced performance compared to the 600p for embedded systems, while the E 5420s takes a further performance hit in 2.5" and M.2 SATA form factors. The new enterprise drives are the DC S3520 and DC P3520, the former of which is a mid-range line of 2.5" or M.2 SATA drives, and the latter brings high levels of performance to U.2 and PCIe x4 HHHL form factors. The majority of the new drives will be available starting next week, although some 1 TB capacities will go on sale in Q4 2016.

By Shawn Knight on Aug 26, 2016, 6:30 PM 112 comments TechSpot AMD hasn’t offered Intel much in the way of competition in the CPU market for about a decade now. The chipmaker, now under new leadership, has spent the last four years developing an all-new microarchitecture that’ll be making its way to the market sometime next year. As an AMD faithful for many years (I was a broke teenager back then), I grew up in an era where AMD and Intel were duking it out for supremacy and would love nothing more than to see that happen once again (competition benefits us all). With this week’s open forum, we’re curious as to whether or not you think Zen will put AMD back on the right track. I know it’s tough to answer without performance specs and pricing, but would you be willing to jump ship if AMD plays its cards right or has Intel gained too much of a lead to be caught in one generation? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below! Related Reads Weekend Open Forum: AMD or Nvidia?

Monday January 2, 2017 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE Microsoft Surface Pro 5 news and release date: Launch of Kaby Lake processors hints at device's release Catherine Salvador 28 August, 2016 9:26 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Microsoft/Surface Pro 4)The hybrid tablet "Surface Pro 4" of Microsoft was released October 2015. Microsoft fanatics surely remember that the Surface Pro 4 was released in October, which is why they are expecting that a new model will arrive this year, in the same month. However, September will arrive in a couple of days and no one has yet to hear anything about the arrival of the Surface Pro 5. Reports claim that the Surface Pro 5 will come with the latest Intel processor, the Kaby Lake, which is set to launch in the last quarter of this year. Fresh news about the processor surfaced a few days ago, including how it is 12 percent more improved than the Skylake processors, which the current models of the Surface Pro run on. Other than that, the incoming processor is believed to prolong battery life, have larger RAM and deliver a 4K display. Microsoft has been quiet about the Pro 5's release date and specs but tech enthusiasts say that the company may not be in a rush to release the device as the Surface Pro 4 is still performing well in the market. In an article by HNGN, the company is selling millions of Surface Pro units every quarter so there is no need to immediately launch a new model. Microsoft, however, may still decide to launch the device due to the alleged rumors surrounding the Kaby Lake processor. In fact, recent leaks suggest that it will be installed to a hundred of hybrid devices before the year ends. In fact, Asus already posted an announcement on Twitter about the arrival of their own Transformer Tablet 3, which supposedly has the imminent processor. Tech enthusiasts believe that the Kaby Lake will boast of HDMI 2 support and Gen 9 graphics and will be launched alongside the processors for hybrid gadgets and slimmer-model laptops with 4.5 watts to 15 watts power consumption. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich previously announced that samples of the Kaby Lake have already been distributed to the company's OEM partners, igniting news that it will be released sometime in December.

Linus Torvalds Announces Linux Kernel 4.8 RC4 with Skylake Power Management Fix GO Linux 4.8-rc4 is now ready for public testing Aug 28, 2016 22:48 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  It's Sunday evening, so guess what you'll be doing in the next few hours? Yes, that's right, Linus Torvalds has just announced the fourth RC (Release Candidate) version of the upcoming Linux 4.8 kernel branch. The development of Linux kernel 4.8 continues today with the Release Candidate 4 (RC4) snapshot, and according to Linus Torvalds, things are looking quite normal at this stage. At the same time, it also seems that this is the smallest RC to date, the biggest new feature being a fix for an Intel Skylake power management bug. However, there are also the usual updated drivers, arch improvements, and some KVM changes. "Everything looks normal, and it's been a bit quieter than rc3 too, so hopefully we're well into the 'it's calming down' phase. Although with the usual timing-related fluctuation (different maintainers stagger their pulls differently), it's hard to tell a trend yet," says Linus Torvalds in today's announcement. "Regardless, it all looks pretty small." Final Linux kernel 4.8 release to land at the end of September Now that we're able to take the fourth Release Candidate build of the Linux 4.8 kernel for a test drive on our PCs, its development cycle will continue, and next week, we will get our hands on the RC5 milestone. After that, there should be only two RCs left, RC6 and RC7, until the final Linux kernel 4.8 release hits the streets, which should happen at the end of September. Until then, we invite you to download the Linux kernel 4.8 Release Candidate 4 sources right now via our website or directly from kernel.org and report any bugs you might encounter. We should also warn you not to replace your stable kernel with this one, nor install it on a production-ready operating system. This is a pre-release build intended for testing purposes only. #Linux 4.8-rc4#Linux kernel 4.8 RC4#Linux kernel 4.8 Release Candidate 4#Linux 4.8#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Debian-Based Q4OS 1.6 "Orion" Linux Distro Launches with Trinity Desktop 14.0.3 Geary 0.11.2 Email Client Improves Showing of Right-To-Left (RTL) Messages Linux Kernel 3.10.103 LTS Has Lots of MIPS Improvements, Updated Radeon Drivers ConnochaetOS 14.2 Officially Released, Based on Slackware 14.2 and Salix Linux New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Linux kernel 4.8 RC4 released New Linux Apps Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Otter Browser: An Internet browser software that tries to recreate the classic Opera UI using the Qt toolkit Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Reader comments Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository more on: Ubuntu 17.04 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

It would take two years for this operating system to be developed and released in December 1987. During this period, one Paul Maritz, would join Microsoft. It is said that he would later suggest to Microsoft to continue to develop their own operating system and desist from engaging IBM. In 1990 Microsoft cut ties with IBM and released Windows 3.0. Microsoft would go on to sell billions of dollars worth of the operating system. Paul Maritz later resigned from Microsoft in 2000 and found his own company, Pi Corporation that got bought bought by EMC. In recognision of his efforts to the computing world, Business Journal accorded him the Executive of the Year award for 2011. Paul Maritz was born and raised in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). His family later moved to South Africa where he was schooled atHighbury Preparatory School and Hilton College. He received a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Natal, and a B.Sc. (Hons) degree, also in Computer Science, from the University of Cape Town in 1977. After finishing his graduate studies, Maritz had a programming job with Burroughs Corporation and later became a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, before moving to Silicon Valley in 1981 to join Intel. He worked for Intel for five years, including developing early tools to help developers write software for the then-new x86 platform, before joining Microsoft in 1986. From 1986 to 2000 he worked at Microsoft, becoming executive vice president of the Platforms Strategy and Developer Group and part of the 5-person executive management team. He was often said to be the third-ranking executive, behind Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. He was responsible for essentially all of Microsoft’s desktop and server software, including such major initiatives as the development of Windows 95, Windows NT, and Internet Explorer. He was the highest-ranking executive to testify at the antitrust trial of Microsoft in 1999. While at Microsoft, Maritz was credited for originating the term “eating your own dogfood” also known as dogfooding. In July 1999 he announced he would have a reduced role at Microsoft, and resigned in September 2000 around the announcement of Windows ME. According to Steve Ballmer Maritz was “truly a leader among leaders”. Bill Gates stated that “Paul’s vision and technological insight has had a major impact not only on Microsoft but on the entire computer industry.” He then co-founded, and was CEO of Pi Corporation, a company backed by Warburg Pincus, which developed software for Linux with development in Bangalore, India. When Pi was acquired by EMC in February 2008, Maritz briefly became president and general manager of EMC Corporation‘s cloud computing division. On July 8, 2008 he was appointed CEO of VMware (a public company majority-owned by EMC), replacing co-founder and CEO Diane Greene. He was succeeded as CEO by Pat Gelsinger on September 1, 2012. In April 2013 he was announced as the CEO of GoPivotal, Inc. (Pivotal), a venture funded by General Electric (GE), EMC and VMware. In October 2013 he was reported to again be under consideration to become chief executive of Microsoft, succeeding Ballmer.[10] He was an angel investor in Apture. He sponsors third-world development projects and is the chairman of the board of the Grameen Foundation.

Collabora's Devs to Bring Performance Improvements to Emulated NVMe Devices GO These patches will be implemented in Linux kernel 4.8 Aug 28, 2016 21:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  We reported earlier this month that Collabora's developers contributed patches to the upcoming Linux 4.8 kernel to bring the open source Intel graphics driver on par with its Windows equivalent. And now Softpedia has been informed by Mark Filion about some other interesting patches contributed by Collabora's developers to the upcoming Linux 4.8 kernel. These patches promise to add huge performance improvements to emulated NVMe devices. According to Collabora's Helen Fornazier, it would appear that it's currently possible to attach a local SSD (Solid State Drive) disk drive to a virtual machine in Google Cloud Engine (GCE) via an NVMe interface, but you won't get a good number of IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second). To achieve that, one needs to instantiate a virtual machine using the nvme-backports-debian-7-wheezy image based on the Debian GNU/Linux 7 "Wheezy" operating system, of course. It would also appear that this will only work with the Debian 7 Linux OS, as other distributions available in Google Cloud Engine won't support so many IOPS. Custom NVMe command allows for up to four times more IOPS Helen Fornazier has discovered and tested that Google's Virtual Machine Monitor, which now includes a custom NVMe command that could increase the number of IOPS up to five times faster. "This is from what I've tested so far, but it seems to be possible to get up to 5 times faster according to the original commit message; check the Technical Details sessions to see how this is possible," says Fornazier in a blog post. However, it looks like this command has to be present in the kernel you use, and there's no such support in the mainline Linux kernel. And this is where Collabora's developers will make their contributions noticed, as they have made the patch available online for anyone interested in using it. Unfortunately, since this is an unofficial (third-party) NVMe command, it will not land in the mainline Linux kernel anytime soon. But Collabora will try its best to help the NVMe workgroup implement an official extension to standardize it, as this brings considerable performance increasements to emulated NVMe devices. #Collabora#NVMe#emulated NVMe#Linux kernel#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Another Set of Updated Fedora 24 Linux Live ISO Images Are Now Ready to Download LinuxConsole 2.5 Gaming Distro Out Now with Minecraft, SuperTux, and Many Games Calibre 2.65.1 eBook Viewer Adds Driver for Kobo Aura One and Aura 2 Readers Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 Beta 1 Released with GNOME 3.20 and GNOME 3.22 Beta Apps New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Collabora brings NVMe improvements to Linux kernel New Linux Apps Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Otter Browser: An Internet browser software that tries to recreate the classic Opera UI using the Qt toolkit Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Reader comments Opera Celebrates 20 Years of Activity, Opera 42 Adds Built-In Currency Converter more on: Opera 42 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Home > News By Company > Market Reports Center Tweet   Research Report on China Integrated Circuit market, 2010-2019 - market overview, size, outlook, growth and development Ever since its entry into WTO, China has become one of the regions where integrated circuit industry grows fast. In 2014, integrated circuit industry in China reported sales revenue of CNY 267.2 billion with a year-on-year growth of 11.2% and a profit of   (EMAILWIRE.COM, August 27, 2016 ) Although China integrated circuit industry has made many progresses, the gap between it and advanced integrated enterprises must be envisaged. Leading international companies are 1-2 generations beyond Chinas chip manufacturing in advanced technology. And their packaging &testing technology is more advanced too. Besides, IC design in China is just a start-up with single product. High-end integrated circuit relies on import. To secure their technological advantages, international giants has increased R&D investment. For example, the big five semiconductor companies Intel, Qualcomm, TSMC, Quatek and Hynix have reported a R&D cost of 15.9% that is close to a five-year high. While local enterprises like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation has reported an input less than 10% despite the fast growth in R&D investment. The experience of integrated circuit development has shown that inefficient investment in R&D might further widen the gap in severe competition. Request sample at : https://marketreportscenter.com/request-sample/133471 In 2014, USD 217.6 billion of integrated circuit was imported with a year-on-year decrease of 5.9% while only USD 60.9 billion was exported, decreasing 30.6%. And integrated circuit remained the largest import. Trade deficit continues to grow to USD 156.7 billion with a year-on-year increase of 9%, which shows the overall strength of integrated circuit is still weak. Governments at all levels have issued plenty of policies supporting the development of integrated circuit. In Feb.2014, the State Council of the Peoples Republic of China issued the Outline of Promoting the Development of Integrated Circuit Industry which will serve as a guideline on the development of integrated circuit industry. Later investment funds for integrated circuit industry were issued and increased from CNY 100 billion to CNY 120 billion, improving market participants expectation and the attention paid to the industry. Meanwhile, local governments have issued supporting policies for integrated circuit. Mobile communications has entered 4G era with over 80 million out of 1.28 billion users are 4G users. As 4G spreads faster than expected, the competition in domestic low-end market will become very fierce in the coming year. Against the short supply of phone chips, local integrated circuit manufacturers will take a share of the market too. The internet of things has developed fast in China and the demand for smart city, smart transport and industrial monitoring have kept increasing. According to CRIs research, the market size of the internet of things has already exceeded CNY 600 billion and lead to a rising demand for sensors. According to the Peoples Bank of China, bank card with magnetic stripe will gradually be replaced by financial IC card. Currently, all commercial banks in China have begun to replace magnetic stripe card with financial IC card. And the number of financial IC card to be put into use is estimated to reach billions in the next few years in China. As China boasts of the largest consumer group of electronic terminal, the largest manufacturing base of electronic products as well as the largest consumer market of integrated circuit, there will be many development opportunities for integrated circuit industry in future.

Jennifer Jolly for USA TODAY Columnist Jennifer Jolly trying out tech gadgets for college students. (Photo: Roddy Blelloch for USA TODAY) Heading off to college is equal parts exciting and nerve-wracking. Just because our teens can’t wait to fly the coop, doesn’t mean they won’t want to land in a dorm room that still has all the comforts of home. Here are some high-tech, fairly low-cost ways to make their new college living space more comfy, cozy, productive, and fun. Like home, but with no annoying parents. Amazon it When I geared up for this story, the first thing I did was go to Amazon’s Off To College store. It’s quick, easy, provides checklists on the essentials, and can save tons of money on everything from Amazon's rental textbook program to it’s $50 Fire tablets. Plus, you can shop in your jammies and have stuff delivered directly to your doorstep or dorm room. Amazon’s suite of handy devices stand out this year too—for being super affordable and a great fit for dorms. Chief among them is the Fire TV Stick ($39.99); a tiny HDMI dongle that turns even the most basic HDTV into a smart entertainment hub with support for Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Amazon Video, and a ton of other apps and games. The Amazon Tap ($129.99), a portable Bluetooth speaker with the Alexa virtual assistant built right in, keeps the podcasts and music flowing during those long study sessions. Alexa’s handy voice commands also let students look up information, get the latest weather reports, or even order a pizza — just by asking for it. And with Amazon Prime Student, which your kids can try for six months before paying ($49.99 per year — half of what grown-ups have to pay), students get access to even bigger bargains, free two-day shipping, and might even be able to pick their order at one of the new Amazon Campus stores. Pocket-sized PCs Space is at a premium in any college dorm room, so a full-sized desktop computer is out of the question. Intel’s ridiculously cool Compute Sticks pack the power of a traditional desktop into a tiny HDMI stick that plugs right into any compatible computer monitor. These pint-sized PCs come with Wi-Fi built in, as well as expandable storage, integrated graphics, and a whole host of other features. There are several models to choose from, including sticks that come with Windows 10 pre-installed for less than $90. “Free” smartphone I know a lot of parents are shopping for smartphones with their college-bound students right now. If budget is key, take a look at T-Mobile's latest promotions, like getting free Samsung Galaxy On5 or J7 smartphones with family plans that include 6 gigs of data at a wallet-friendly $30 per line. The real boon here though might be the Binge On unlimited streaming feature. College kids addicted to Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, HBO Go, and dozens of others services can enjoy as much as they want without racking up data costs. That means you won’t get slammed with a surprising overage fee just because a boring lecture turned into an impromptu Game Of Thrones marathon.

The Privacy Pop bed tent (starting at $129.99) is a cool, affordable way to get a little alone time without having to actually leave the room. It’s just like a real tent, complete with mesh sides and a double-sided zipper, and it comes in any size from twin to queen.

Jennifer Jolly for USA TODAY Columnist Jennifer Jolly trying out tech gadgets for college students. (Photo: Roddy Blelloch for USA TODAY) Heading off to college is equal parts exciting and nerve-wracking. Just because our teens can’t wait to fly the coop, doesn’t mean they won’t want to land in a dorm room that still has all the comforts of home. Here are some high-tech, fairly low-cost ways to make their new college living space more comfy, cozy, productive, and fun. Like home, but with no annoying parents. Amazon it When I geared up for this story, the first thing I did was go to Amazon’s Off To College store. It’s quick, easy, provides checklists on the essentials, and can save tons of money on everything from Amazon's rental textbook program to it’s $50 Fire tablets. Plus, you can shop in your jammies and have stuff delivered directly to your doorstep or dorm room. Amazon’s suite of handy devices stand out this year too—for being super affordable and a great fit for dorms. Chief among them is the Fire TV Stick ($39.99); a tiny HDMI dongle that turns even the most basic HDTV into a smart entertainment hub with support for Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Amazon Video, and a ton of other apps and games. The Amazon Tap ($129.99), a portable Bluetooth speaker with the Alexa virtual assistant built right in, keeps the podcasts and music flowing during those long study sessions. Alexa’s handy voice commands also let students look up information, get the latest weather reports, or even order a pizza — just by asking for it. And with Amazon Prime Student, which your kids can try for six months before paying ($49.99 per year — half of what grown-ups have to pay), students get access to even bigger bargains, free two-day shipping, and might even be able to pick their order at one of the new Amazon Campus stores. Pocket-sized PCs Space is at a premium in any college dorm room, so a full-sized desktop computer is out of the question. Intel’s ridiculously cool Compute Sticks pack the power of a traditional desktop into a tiny HDMI stick that plugs right into any compatible computer monitor. These pint-sized PCs come with Wi-Fi built in, as well as expandable storage, integrated graphics, and a whole host of other features. There are several models to choose from, including sticks that come with Windows 10 pre-installed for less than $90. “Free” smartphone I know a lot of parents are shopping for smartphones with their college-bound students right now. If budget is key, take a look at T-Mobile's latest promotions, like getting free Samsung Galaxy On5 or J7 smartphones with family plans that include 6 gigs of data at a wallet-friendly $30 per line. The real boon here though might be the Binge On unlimited streaming feature. College kids addicted to Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, HBO Go, and dozens of others services can enjoy as much as they want without racking up data costs. That means you won’t get slammed with a surprising overage fee just because a boring lecture turned into an impromptu Game Of Thrones marathon.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides iPhone 8 Nintendo Switch Samsung Galaxy S8 MacBook Pro CES 2017 iOS 10.2 Reviews Overclockers UK Titan Hadron review Overclockers UK Titan Hadron review By Kane Fulton PC & Mac desktops  A classy-looking micro machine with 1440p muscle Shares Recommended Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict Games look fantastic and run smooth on the Titan Hadron at 1440p, thanks to Nvidia's GTX 1060 inside. Its classy-looking case hides top-tier components, including a nippy SSD and overclockable Intel processor. For Overclockable processor Primed for VR and 1440p gaming Nippy SSD storage Attractive design Against Can get a stronger GPU for less Not cut out for 4K gaming Nvidia hasn't so much shaken up mobile gaming with its desktop-grade Pascal notebook GPUs as turned it completely on its head. The company's GTX 10-series graphics card have also made a mark in the desktop space, providing an opportunity for system builders to come up with powerful, single-GPU configurations capable of running the best VR games and demanding 4K setups. Called the Titan Hadron, the latest machine from Stoke, UK-based system builders Overclockers UK promises oodles of gaming grunt, courtesy of Nvidia's GTX 1060 GPU. But, as we now know, there's no such thing as a cheap Pascal card. Even at the mid-range, Nvidia's card pushes up the Hadron's price to £1,091/US$1,4453/AUS$1,894, with an offer currently shaving £30/$US40/AUS$52 from the price. However, it's important to note that the cost includes a number of enviable features. Among them are an SSD along with a capacious HDD, an overclockable, top-tier Intel processor and, of course, one of the beefiest graphics cards around. Micro machine One of the more interesting aspects of the Titan Hadron is its design. Overclockers has gone for Fractal Design's Node 804 Micro-ATX case, which separates warmer running components from cooler ones while allowing for unrestricted airflow to the Asus Z170M motherboard and sixth-generation Intel Core i5-6600K processor inside. We're a fan of the case's unassuming appearance. Black materials dominate without appearing bland, in part thanks to a brushed aluminum finish on the front panel that contrasts with a plastic mesh along the bottom. Viewed head-on, it looks like a high-end subwoofer that's part of an expensive speaker set-up. Rotate the Titan Hadron on its side, and the mask slips, revealing a view that's more typical to PC gamers. A transparent side panel provides a view of the various components inside, which are bathed in a green light that emanates from the top of the case's roof. Spec sheet Here is the Overclockers UK Titan Hadron configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 3.5GHz Intel Core i5-6600K (Quad core, 6M Cache, up to 3.9GHz using Turbo Boost) Graphics: Gainward GeForce GTX 1060 Dual (6GB GDDR5) RAM: 8GB DDR4 (2,400MHz) Storage: 240GB SSD; 1TB HDD (7,200 rpm) Ports: 1 x USB 3.1 (Type-C), 3 x HDMI, 2 X DisplayPort, 2 x DVI-D, 3 x USB 3.0, 2 x USB 2.0, 1 x VGA, headphone/microphone ports, Ethernet Size: 12.09 x 13.54 x 15.31 inches (H x W x D) Weight: 13.22 pounds (6kg) Don't be fooled by its name – the Titan Hadron isn't powered by Nvidia's wallet-intimidating Titan X; nor does it fire tiny particles around super quickly, for that matter. It actually opts for a more sensible choice of card in Gainward's GeForce GTX 1060, which sports 6GB of GDDR5 memory. Compared with Nvidia's newer GTX 1060 that has half the video memory at 3GB, the version on offer here is much more suited to 1440p gaming, much less 1080p. The Intel's 6600K Skylake processor is more than capable of matching the Nvidia part, the 'K' denoting that it can be overclocked to provide horsepower for gaming. It's more than up to the task out of the box, but overclocking is a welcome option to have for enthusiast users who can get their hands dirty in MSI Afterburner or another tool of choice. You won't get caught short for ports, as there's an abundance of I/O around the back. That includes a USB 3.1 Type-C port for speedily transferring data to an external hard disk or hooking up a compatible peripheral. There are two more USB 2.0 ports on the right hand side of the case, located alongside headphone and microphone ports, the power button and slot loading CD drive. These can be fiddly to access if the machine is facing a direction that hides them out of view, forcing you to run your hand along the edge to find them. Relocating them to the top of the case wouldn't have been a bad move. Benchmarks Here's how the Overclockers UK Titan Hadron performed in our suite of benchmark tests: 3DMark: Cloud Gate: 19,409 ; Sky Diver: 23,179 ; Fire Strike: 10,072 Cinebench CPU: 599 points; Graphics: 126 fps GeekBench: 3,980 (single-core); 11,498 (multi-core) PCMark 8 (Home Test): 4,568 points GTA V (1080p, Ultra): 43 fps; (1080p, Low): 163 fps; (4K, Ultra): 14 fps The Division: (1080p, Ultra): 60 fps; (1080p, Low): 150 fps Steam VR Bench: Ready Nvidia says that the GTX 1060 is good for GTX 980-grade frame rates, and our benchmarks show that to be true. The Titan Hadron scored 10,072 in PCMark 8's Fire Strike benchmark, compared to the 9,284 achieved by the 980-powered Asus GX700. Overclockers' machine also scored higher in Cinebench R15's graphics test (126.3 fps versus the GX700's 101.26 fps), and more than double in our demanding GTA V 1080p Ultra settings benchmark (43.3 fps versus 21 fps). With the exception of extremely demanding games, like GTA V, the GTX 1060 is capable of maxing out games at 1080p; it's also a solid performer at 1440p. We played Doom at that resolution on Ultra settings and got a consistent 55 - 70 fps, depending on which environment we were in. As expected, it struggled at 4K, straining to reach around 30 - 45 fps at 4K on Ultra and frequently dipping to as low as 25 fps. It almost goes without saying that the GTX 1060 isn't as powerful as the GTX 1070, losing out in every GPU benchmark compared to the StormForce Tornado that we recently reviewed. At £899/US$1,180/AUS$1,540 the Tornado also costs less despite having the more powerful GPU. On the other hand, it only comes with a weaker (and not overclockable) Core i5-6500 CPU and misses out on an SSD, both of which are major scoring points in favor of the Titan Hadron. Final verdict There's a lot to like about the Titan Hadron. We found favor with its minimal, no-nonsense case that provides easy access to components and makes a refreshing change from conventional tower PCs. Nvidia's GTX 1060 has proven itself to be a great option for 1440p gaming, striking a balance between cost and performance, and the version with 6GB of video memory on offer here leaves you confident you can whack up the graphics options to hit that magic 60 fps mark. Its SSD provides nippy loading of files, and that overclockable CPU provides an avenue for more advanced gamers to eke out even more power. On the other hand, the machine is simply not up to the task of fluid 4K gaming on Ultra, or even High settings, depending on the title – you're going to need a machine like the StormForce Tornado with a GTX 1070 for that. And, considering the Titan Hadron costs more than a grand, that might be a deal-breaker for some.

So how does it fare? Here is our review. Rating: 3.5 out of 5 Written by Karthekayan Iyer | Updated: August 28, 2016 2:24 pm At Rs 27,999, Asus Zenfone 3 is taking on the likes of OnePlus 3 and Xiaomi Mi 5. So how does it fare? Here is our review. Asus surprised the entire tech fraternity when it announced Zenfone 3 Deluxe with Snapdragon 821 at Rs 62,999. While Asus has complete independence when it comes to choosing a price point, this price seemed to go against the concept of Zenfone as people had come to understand. The Zenfone was introduced in the wake of growing popularity of budget devices that offered great value for the money. The first generation Zenfone 5 and second generation Zenfone 2 paired great hardware, beautiful design with low cost. Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe, on the other hand, comes at a premium. Asus Zenfone 3 The latest Zenfone 3 stays true to its name – offers serious value for money hardware specifications and a really stunning design. Asus being Asus announced multiple variants of Zenfone 3, which looks confusing at first and becomes more complex later. Asus Zenfone 3 is also different in number of ways this time. The first generation Zenfone series and Zenfone 2 were launched with Intel chipsets while the Zenfone 3 favours an all new Qualcomm SoC. At Rs 27,999, Asus Zenfone 3 is taking on the likes of OnePlus 3 and Xiaomi Mi 5. So how does it fare? Here is our review. Specs: 5.5-inch (1080x1920p, ~401 ppi) IPS LCD display | Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor | 4GB RAM | 32/64GB storage | 16MP rear camera + 8MP front | Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery | Android Marshmallow OS Price: Rs 27,999 What is good? If you are buying the Zenfone 3 then it has to be for its battery. Agreed, reviews don’t start with battery part, but this review is different. With Zenfone 3, Asus has somewhat mastered the art of tying software and hardware together, which ensures better battery performance. Asus Zenfone 3 lasted me nearly a day and a half despite the relatively small 3,000mAh battery. Watch Video On a very busy day when I was tweeting from an event, writing a copy on my phone and clicking some random pictures with 4G on, I managed a screen on time of 5 hours 27 minutes, which puts Asus Zenfone 3 right on top in terms of battery backup. Most smartphone OEMs have failed miserably when it comes to delivering on battery life and have often resorted to options like Quick Charging to compensate. Asus Zenfone 3 also supports quick charge 2.0, but I found myself charging this phone only once in two days which isn’t bad at all. I believe Asus Zenfone 3’s USP is its battery, but design is an equally strong point. The smartphone is built with metal and glass and looks very similar to Samsung’s 2016 Galaxy lineups. The rear of Zenfone 3 features metal reinforced with glass which is a serious fingerprint magnet (keep those wet wipes handy). Asus Zenfone 3 is wide, but not tall making it easier to hold in one hand. This is definitely one of the best designed smartphone of this year. Asus Zenfone 3’s USP is its battery, but design is an equally strong point. This is definitely one of the best designed smartphone of this year. A good smartphone’s primary component is the display, that’s how we interact with the device. Asus Zenfone 3 features a 5.5-inch Full HD display and it’s adequately bright. The auto brightness setting works accurately and the display is viewable even under the harsh sunlight of Delhi. But is this the best in the price range? Certainly not. Asus Zenfone 3 also comes with a very decent camera. It is not extremely capable like Huawei P9 or colour accurate like the OnePlus 3, it rather turns out to be a fast and potent smartphone camera. It comes with a variety of modes and tweaks, but I was mostly shooting in auto mode. Also the camera shoots in 12MP resolution with an aspect ratio of 16:9. Asus Zenfone 3 also comes with a very decent camera. In the case of a leaf or flower, we found Zenfone 3 handling highlights well, but failed with the edges. (Sample shot from Asus Zenfone 3) (Image resized for web) Asus Zenfone 3’s HDR Pro offers greater detail while shooting the sky. (Sample shot from Asus Zenfone 3) (Image resized for web) We were not really impressed with the low light mode or the super resolution mode. (Sample shot from Asus Zenfone 3) (Image resized for web) I was not really impressed with the low light mode or the super resolution mode but I did end up using HDR Pro which offered greater detail while shooting the sky. In the case of a leaf or flower, I found Zenfone 3 handling highlights well, but failed with the edges. For Rs 27,999, this is one smartphone camera I can easily count on. Asus Zenfone 3 is powered by a relatively new Snapdragon 625 chipset and it is pretty fast. Things like opening and closing apps, multitasking work extremely well. It easily manages basic games like Crossy Road and Dots, but graphics were smooth even with heavy games like Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8: Airborne. Asus Zenfone 3 may not have the high-end Snapdragon 820 chip, but it holds its ground really well with performance. What is not good? Asus Zenfone 3’s display is bright but not very accurate with colour saturation and contrast. Since it is LCD, the blacks mirror grey tone at times. If display is your priority, OnePlus 3 is your best bet. Asus Zenfone 3 features a rear fingerprint scanner which is really odd in terms of design. It has a really small area and it’s not easy to rest your finger completely. Asus Zenfone 3, in my opinion, is just full of bloatware. The moment I set up the device, there were several Asus branded apps updating in the background – some of them you will never even open in your lifetime. Asus Zenfone 3 comes with Chrome browser out of the box but also has another browser called Puffin. Yes, you read that right – Puffin is a browser. There is Asus branded app replacement for ShareIt, Weather, Do It Later. There is also a handy tool to speed up the phone. I am not convinced about this UI, which takes up nearly 12GB out of the 64GB storage. Asus Zenfone 3 is just full of bloatware. When we started the device, there were several Asus branded apps updating in the background – some of them you will never even open in your lifetime. Asus could streamline its Android UI by following on the leads of Samsung and HTC, both known for significantly heavy Android skin. The simplest step could be to get rid of duplicate apps. Asus Zenfone 3 features a rear fingerprint scanner which is really odd in terms of design. It has a really small area and it’s not easy to rest your finger completely. It supports 360 degree recognition but the results are mixed. Should you buy? Any smartphone’s five basic pillars include design and display, performance, battery life, camera and software. Asus Zenfone 3 does well in three of those department while it’s camera is a passable one. It’s UI is something which may not appeal to everyone, especially if you have used a stock Android or Moto product. Asus Zenfone 3’s biggest competition is the OnePlus 3, which is an excellent smartphone in its own respect. OnePlus 3 offers great display and an extremely speedy processor, Zenfone 3 makes up for it with a beautiful design and strong battery life. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

Lenovo's Thinkpad X1 Yoga will make you want OLED everywhere Engadget 28/08/2016 Devindra Hardawar © Provided by Engadget The dream of large OLED screens has, for the past few years, seemed perpetually on the horizon. LG has had OLED TVs on the market for a while, but they're still far more expensive than comparable LCDs. If you've wanted to get your OLED fix recently, you'd have to get it on a smaller phone or tablet screen. Now, the technology is finally making its way to laptops from the likes of Dell's Alienware, HP and Lenovo. So you can bet that I jumped at the opportunity to test out the new OLED-equipped Thinkpad X1 Yoga as soon as review units appeared. For the most part, it's a pretty typical Thinkpad convertible PC, but its screen is truly a thing of wonder.   Hardware The Thinkpad X1 Yoga doesn't offer up many surprises design-wise. It sports a black matte case, clean lines and it's built out of some sturdy material (a combination of a carbon fiber cover and magnesium alloy elsewhere). Its understated aesthetic befits its purpose: it's here to do work, not game or be an entertainment powerhouse. That doesn't mean it's ugly, it just resembles very traditional PC laptops, much like its sibling the X1 Tablet. Really, the X1 Yoga doesn't need any design flourishes, as it ensures the 14-inch OLED touchscreen is the real star of the show. (More on that below.) While it's built like a workhouse -- there's no flex to the case, and it feels like it could survive some major tumbles -- the X1 Yoga is also impressively portable, at 2.8 pounds and 0.67-inches thin. That's about on-par with most other Ultrabooks (and it's even 0.2-pounds lighter than the 13-inch MacBook Air). It's not as razor-thin as HP's stunning new Spectre, but because of that it's surprisingly versatile, with three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI and miniDisplayPort connectors, and a microSD card slot. There's also a proprietary OneLink+ port for connecting to Lenovo's docks, as well as a fingerprint sensor to the right of the trackpad. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget Being a Yoga device, the X1's screen can bend a full 360-degrees around the case, effectively turning it into a very large tablet. (In that mode the keyboard also recesses into the case, to prevent stray strokes and key damage.) You can also fold the screen over at an angle in a "tent" formation. That's ideal for standing it up on a table, or on your lap in bed. Lenovo designed a new double hinge for this device, and it's one of their smoothest implementations yet. The screen is easy to move around, but it also feels secure once you set it in place. Lenovo also tucked a stylus into the side of the X1 Yoga, which is useful for drawing or quickly jotting down notes. It's powered by super capacitor technology, which charges it whenever it's sitting inside the case. Display and pen input The X1 Yoga's OLED display doesn't waste any time impressing you. The red border around Lenovo's logo has an almost electric feel upon boot-up, and that carries over to everything in Windows. OLED displays are known for their bold colors and deep black levels, and this one doesn't disappoint. Watching videos and perusing photos is a revelatory experience. OLED adds an enormous amount of depth to images that makes them seem almost three-dimensional. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget With a resolution of 2,560 by 1,440 (1440p/2K), the X1 Yoga's OLED screen is significantly sharper than a 1080p display, though it's not quite 4K. That's just fine, though, as Windows 10 still isn't well suited to 4K, and the benefits of such a high resolution are wasted on laptop screens. The X1 Yoga might not look like an ideal media machine from afar, but it ended up being one of my favorite ways to watch Netflix in bed. Mostly, that was due to sheer immersiveness of the screen. Its speakers sit right below the screen, and as is usual with Lenovo's gadgets, they were merely adequate. If you really want to get into a movie or TV show, bring along a good pair of headphones. The laptop's ability to flip around in a variety of different orientations also made it very useful. When I needed help in the kitchen, the tent formation was perfect on my countertop for watching videos and references recipes. And when I wanted to dive into the NYT, Comixology or a digital magazine app, the tablet mode was immensely convenient. It also worked well in direct sunlight, but be prepared to deal with some reflectivity depending on how it's oriented. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget While the built-in stylus was convenient for jotting down quick notes, it's also too light and flimsy to use for a very long time. It doesn't feel as substantial as Microsoft's Surface Pen or Apple's Pencil, instead it's like trying to write with an incredibly skinny pen. If you're really looking forward to handwriting on the X1 Yoga, though, you're probably better off investing in something that won't cramp your hand after a few minutes. On the plus side, the stylus is pressure sensitive, which could be useful for artists.  Typing and trackpad experience If there's one thing you can be guaranteed to find on a Thinkpad, it's a solid keyboard. That's been true of the line since IBM debuted it decades ago, and it's something Lenovo has maintained ever since it took over Big Blue's computer arm. The X1 Yoga's backlit chiclet keyboard is one of the most comfortable I've used in an Ultrabook. I had no trouble quickly typing up notes and reports from Intel's Developer Conference, or banging out most of this review. The keys are sloped inward slightly, which feels comfortable as you're resting your fingers on them, and they have a satisfying amount of depth. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget Basically, the X1 Yoga's keyboard feels like a balance of traditional Thinkpad typing with the modern chiclet style. I wish Lenovo included some media keys among its second functions though. Even the ability to start and stop music would be helpful (and being able to move between tracks would be even better). Lenovo used to offer some media keys on the X1 Carbon's capacitive touch strip, so hopefully we'll see those return eventually. The Thinkpad's trackpad is incredibly smooth, though it's not as roomy as the MacBook Air's or those found on other Ultrabooks. And if you're a Thinkpad diehard, you'll be pleased to learn there's also red Trackpoint nub among the keys, as well as mechanical mouse buttons right below the keyboard. For the most part, I relied on the X1 Yoga's trackpad, which was accurate for mousing, though it sometimes got confused between left and right clicks. I'm not a huge Trackpoint fan, but it was admittedly helpful while I was cramped in a middle airplane seat. In situations like that, being able to mouse with just your finger, and without moving your elbows, is immensely helpful.  Performance and battery life PCMark 7 PCMark 8 (Creative Accelerated) 3DMark 11 3DMark (Sky Diver) ATTO (top reads/writes) Lenovo Thinkpad X1 OLED (2.6GHz Intel Core i7-6600U, Intel HD 520) 4,892 4,186 E2,609 / P1,419 3,577 2.2 GB/s / 1.3 GB/s HP Spectre 13 (2.5GHz Intel Core i7-6500U, Intel HD 520) 5,046 3,747 E2,790 / P1,630 / X375 3,810 1.61 GB/s / 307 MB/s Huawei MateBook (1.1 GHz Core M3, Intel HD 515) 3,592 2,867 E1,490 / P887 2,454 538 MB/s / 268 MB/s Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet (1.2 GHz Core M7-6Y75, Intel HD 515) 4,951 3,433 E1,866 / P1,112 2,462 545 MB/s / 298 MB/s Dell XPS 13 (2.3GHz Core i5-6200U, Intel Graphics 520) 4,954 3,499 E2,610 / P1,531 3,335 1.6GB/s / 307 MB/s Razer Blade Stealth (2.5GHz Intel Core i7-6500U, Intel HD 520) 5,131 3,445 E2,788 / P1,599 / X426 3,442 1.5 GB/s / 307 MB/s Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (2.4GHz Core i5-6300U, Intel HD 520) 5,403 3,602 E2,697/ P1,556/ X422 3,614 1.6 GB/s / 529 MB/s Lenovo Yoga 900 (2.5GHz Core i7-6500U, Intel HD 520) 5,368 3,448 E2,707 / P1,581 3,161 556 MB/s / 511 MB/s On the hardware front, the Thinkpad X1 Yoga offers everything you'd expect from an Ultrabook today. It starts with an Intel Core i5-6200U, 8GB of DDR3 RAM and 128GB SSD. The model we reviewed is a bit beefier, with a Core i7 6600U, 16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget It tackled just about every productivity task I threw at it: My daily workflow typically consists of having several browsers open with dozens of tabs, Slack, Spotify, and photo editing software running all at once. The Thinkpad handled video streaming from Netflix and Hulu just fine, and it processed dozens of large photos without any issues. It was about as fast as other recent ultraportables, like the new HP Spectre, when it comes to benchmarks. Tough, since it's sporting Intel HD 520 graphics, it can only tackle basic games. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the Thinkpad X1's battery life. It lasted only around 4.5 hours during typical usage, and I always had to recharge it in the afternoons. In our battery test, which involves playing an HD video continuously at 50 percent brightness, it lasted 8.5 hours. It's likely just far more efficient at handling video than a plethora of different programs running at once.  Configuration options and the competition As always, expect to pay dearly for the privilege of using OLED. This Thinkpad X1 Yoga model starts at $1,682, while the standard LCD version starts at $1,400. Its hardware starts with the specs I've mentioned above, but it would cost you $2,168 to upgrade to all of the specs from our review model. Still, the premium is likely worth it if you've been hankering for some OLED goodness. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget While there's plenty of ultraportable competition on the market, there are few alternatives that pack an OLED screens. HP recently revamped its Spectre x360 convertible with the technology, which starts at a more reasonable $1,499. And Alienware's gaming-ready OLED models come in at $1,800. It might be worth sticking with the Thinkpad if you want OLED with the best productivity build quality, but if you're a gamer, Alienware's option is worth a look too. Wrap-up It'll likely be a while before OLED becomes the norm on laptops, but the Thinkpad X1 Yoga is a fine example of why we'd want it in all of our devices. Yes, even in a laptop that looks like it belongs in a boring corporate cubicle. That could also be appealing to some buyers: it looks like a dull Thinkpad on the surface, but it'll blow your mind when you actually turn it on. © Provided by Engadget The Thinkpad X1 Yoga is a reminder that OLED isn't just bright and bold, it's a transformative display technology.

(Photo: AFP Relaxnews) Israeli technology firm Mobileye and UK-based auto equipment maker Delphi said that they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle makers in 2019. A joint statement by the two companies said that Mobileye's vision and sensor systems would combine with Delphi's automated driving software to create what it called "the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution." The US-based Society of Automotive Engineers defines level 4 as "High Automation" in all but the most adverse driving conditions and level 5 as "Full Automation" "under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver." Last month, German car maker BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and US computer chip giant Intel on a self-drive project, also for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021.

But on July 1, US electric car company Tesla announced that a driver was killed in a car crash in Florida in May while using the "autopilot" self-driving mechanism on one of its models. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had opened a "preliminary evaluation" into the performance of the autopilot function in the wake of the crash. A major study released earlier this month said the looming arrival of self-driving vehicles is likely to vastly reduce traffic fatalities, but also poses difficult moral dilemmas. Scientists said autonomous driving systems will require programmers to develop algorithms to make critical decisions that are based more on ethics than technology, such as whether to sacrifice a driver or passenger rather than pedestrians. delphi mobileye self-drive car smart car From Our Network Sasikala as the new Tamil Nadu Chief Minister: Does BJP have a Plan B?- FirstPost Queen Elizabeth continues to suffer from 'heavy cold', misses New Year's Day church service- FirstPost Remembering Samar Sen: Frontier editor's dignity, courage a beacon in today's times- FirstPost Recommended For You TOP BOSSES OUTSupreme Court Removes Anurag Thakur as BCCI President Love is in the airKoffee With Karan: Shahid, Mira's Episode Was a Mushy Take on Arranged Marriages Angel ReturnsTaher Shah Is At It Again, Spreads 'Humanity Love' With His Latest Single cricket cleansingSupreme Court Tells Cricket Administrators Above 70 to Vacate Post Pro Wrestling LeaguePWL 2: Haryana Hammers Overpower Mumbai Maharathis About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Actress Slammed for Taking Selfie With Ailing Grandma Miley Cyrus Raises Speculations About Her Marriage With Liam Hemsworth Fog disrupts Rail, Air Traffic; 6 Trains, 2 Domestic Flights cancelled Over 100 Migrants Rescued By Charity Ship in Mediterranean Extremely Fond of Katrina, Anushka Professionally and Personally: Deepika Padukone Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Tech companies have tried everything to boost the low numbers of women in their ranks. Massive grants aimed at high-tech scholarships for girls and students of color. Longer parental leave perks for new moms and dads. Even benefits that pay for women who want to delay childbearing to freeze their eggs. Now, a growing number of both large and small tech companies are borrowing an idea from Wall Street banks: The “returnship,” which brings in mid-career women (and men) who've taken time out of the workplace to care for family, offering them a path back to the office. Recently, a nonprofit called Path Forward announced that six San Francisco-based tech companies, including domain registrar GoDaddy, customer service software maker Zendesk and grocery delivery outfit Instacart, will offer 18-week internships for about 20 mid-career professionals starting in October. While the program is open to men who have spent at least two years out of the workplace as a caregiver, it is expected to be filled largely by women. It is aimed at helping interns confront the stigma they face about time away. Also, tech companies get a chance to improve their reputation as places that too many women leave. “If you're wanting more women at the senior level, this is a way to jump-start that,” said Tami Forman, the executive director of Path Forward. Forman said there's been enough interest from other companies that she plans to start two to three more groups of these untraditional interns (who, yes, are paid) in several cities early next year, each with six to 10 tech companies. The nonprofit was spun out of the New York-based email software firm Return Path, which started its own mid-career internship program last year — Forman is a former marketing vice president there — and now helps bring that program, which includes training and networking opportunities for the group of interns to other tech companies. Path Forward's announcement follows another recent effort by seven technology and engineering companies — including IBM, Intel and General Motors — to run internships designed for women who've taken time away. The programs at these companies began this year and are part of an effort launched by the Society for Women Engineers and iRelaunch, a “career reentry firm” that runs a conference on returning to work sponsored by finance companies that have similar programs, such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. The latter firm kicked off the trend back in 2008 and even trademarked the phrase “returnship.” Carol Fishman Cohen, iReLaunch's CEO, said her conference acts as something of a recruiting hub for those existing programs, and “it occurred to us we should take the concept to another sector.” She approached the Society of Women Engineers to establish a task force last year that would try and “replicate what we saw in financial services.” In tech, she says, “there's a lack of women at every level of the organization and they're looking for more ways to hire more of them and fill that pipeline.” Cohen said men are eligible to apply, but most applicants for the established programs have tended to be women in their 40s or even 50s who've left the workforce to be a caregiver. Some tech companies have long offered flexible leave policies or extended sabbaticals that help their own employees return after a break. But these newer mid-career internships, says Laura Sherbin, director of research for the think tank Center for Talent Innovation (CTI), offer certain advantages. For one, it exposes employers to outside talent. And in an industry like tech, where the pace of change is faster and more disruptive than in others, the low-risk bet on hiring an intern for 12 or 18 weeks can help erase the bias many managers have about people whose resumes have glaring holes on them. “There's a huge stigma to time off in the tech industry,” Sherbin said. “There's a perception that tech passes us by even on a maternity leave, and if you've had time out of the workforce you're hugely behind. Tie that in with the bias you do see about tech workers who have a little bit of gray hair,” and it's an industry particularly primed for managers who might look past candidates — even skilled ones — who have been out of the workforce. Steven Aldrich, chief product officer of GoDaddy, said that's one thing that attracted his company to the idea. “The company has a chance to try the employee, in a way, and see their fit with the company, and it's a win for the working parent coming back into the workforce to come in and get experience,” he said. “Those things are really challenging (when someone) comes straight back in.” The tech industry is trying to plug an especially leaky pipeline. According to 2008 data from the CTI, 52 percent of women with experience in the science, engineering or tech fields chose to leave their fields over time. Another 2013 study, meanwhile, compared women in multiple professions and found that after the first 12 years of their careers, 50 percent of women in science, engineering and tech were working in other occupations, while only about 20 percent of the other women switched industries over their entire careers. Running internships for returning parents could also help send a message to younger workers. With these programs, Cohen says, “what companies are signaling to their youngest employees and the people in their 20s is that they understand that employees may take a career break -- and we want to welcome you back.” If hiring rates are any test, such “returnships” appear successful. At Goldman Sachs, almost half of the 150 people who have gone through its program since 2008 were hired for full-time jobs; Cohen says that hire rates tend to be between 50 and 90 percent in established programs, and at the high end of that range for the tech firms so far. A spokeswoman for PayPal, which ran a program for nine interns in the U.S. called “Recharge,” with the help of Forman's group earlier this year, said that seven of the nine were offered jobs. And all six of the “Tech Re-Entry” interns working in analytics at IBM this spring, who had been out of the workforce for anywhere from two to 10 years, were recommended for full-time employment. Five have accepted jobs and the sixth is in final interviews at the technology giant. “We're increasingly looking for creative ways to bring women back to the workforce who we know are incredibly competitive,” said Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, IBM's chief diversity officer. She said the company is looking to expand the program. Still, while success rates for participants tend to be high, the effect such programs will have on moving the needle — either for the number of mid-career women in tech or the number of parents wanting to get back to work after child rearing — could be limited. In those industries where they could help bring in a few more women, warns CTI's Sherbin, hiring them only goes so far. Even programs that hire every mid-career intern they bring in won't make much progress on diversity if they don't also work to improve “bro” cultures that are hostile or toxic to anyone who's different. “You may get them in,” she says, “but they're going to be very very short hires.” More Business From food to fashion to toys, what's expected to sell big in 2017 Macy's and Sears may invite other retailers to take their spaces Ask Brianna: How can I refresh my finances for the new year?

Imperial Valley News Heart of the Matter White House Announces New Commitments to the Equal Pay Pledge Print Email Details Written by White House Category: National News Published: 27 August 2016 Washington, DC - Friday, on Women’s Equality Day, we are announcing new signatories to the White House Equal Pay Pledge. This pledge was launched at the first-ever United State of Women Summit, encouraging companies from across the American economy to take action to advance equal pay. These 29 newly-committed employers bring the total number to more than fifty companies and organizations that collectively employ millions of Americans. The new commitments are from a diverse range of employers, including Apple, CVS, Facebook, Target, and Visa. Equal Pay has been an Administration priority since President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law as his first piece of legislation. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses to attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy. As noted in the President’s Proclamation on Women’s Equality Day, this day commemorates the 1920 certification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, granting women the right to vote. It is also the day that we observe the continued work towards gender equity for all women and girls. View the additional commitments and statements from signatories below, and learn more about President Obama's record on empowering women and girls. By signing the Equal Pay Pledge, these employers are: Acknowledging the critical role businesses must play in reducing the national pay gap. Committing to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations. Reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers. Embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives. Pledging to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers. Companies and organizations interested in signing are encouraged to take the Equal Pay Pledge here. WHITE HOUSE EQUAL PAY PLEDGE The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first piece of legislation President Obama signed into law. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the gender pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy. Yet, the typical woman working full-time all year in the United States only earns 79 percent of what a typical man working full-time all year earns. While the gap has narrowed slightly over the past few years, there is much more work to be done to ensure fair pay for all. Building on the Administration’s numerous actions to close the national pay gap, the White House challenged businesses to take the Equal Pay Pledge. Several U.S. private sector companies have come together in support of advancing equal pay. We applaud the growing number of countries that have already made significant progress in closing their gender wage gap. Despite passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which requires equal pay for equal work, the gender pay gap in the United States persists. Women working full-time earn only 79 percent of men’s wages, and we are committed to taking action individually and collectively to reduce that national pay gap. We believe that businesses must play a critical role in reducing the national pay gap. Towards that end, we commit to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations; reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers; and embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives. We pledge to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers. We received a very positive response to the pledge and welcome our new signatories, including the employers below. These signatories put forth their pledges as follows: A.T. Kearney: A.T. Kearney is passionate about and committed to diversity and inclusion.  We provide our employees with equal opportunities to contribute, develop, and succeed irrespective of gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. Diversity enables us to achieve immediate impact and growing advantage – for our clients, our people and the communities in which we work and live. We believe that equal pay to promote diversity and inclusion is a business imperative. Our approach to diversity and inclusion has and will continue to evolve with the changing needs of our business and our people. We offer global programs that create an inclusive environment and culture, ensuring all employees feel comfortable bringing their best selves to work each day. We enable our employees to achieve their personal and professional aspirations. A.T. Kearney is proud to collaborate with the White House and enthusiastically adds our name to the Equal Pay Pledge. Akamai Technologies: Akamai Technologies is pleased to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. This pledge aligns with the expectations we have of ourselves to lead with a sense of transparency, while embracing diversity and respect for all employees. At Akamai, we seek to ensure every employee can work in an environment where they are valued and able to work at their best. We believe in fair and equitable pay for all our employees, and we are committed to monitoring our pay practices regularly and to making adjustments if necessary to deliver on this pledge. Anheuser-Busch: Anheuser-Busch is proud to sign the Equal Pay Pledge. We value equality throughout all levels of our organization, and believe diversity enriches our workforce. This commitment to inclusivity begins with our mission - to be the best beer company, bringing people together for a better world - and extends to our meritocracy-based compensation practices. At Anheuser-Busch, we believe in equal pay for equal work. We use a rigorous and gender-blind compensation process that was developed and validated by independent experts. We recognize that there is still much work to do to create a truly equal playing field in the workforce. It is our ambition to lead the change and create more opportunities for women in the beer industry. Today, six of our 12 U.S. breweries are led by female head brewmasters, and women now represent the majority (51 percent) of our marketing organization. In support of our workforce and their families, this year we introduced a new parental leave policy that offers 100% paid Parental Bonding leave for all parents, on top of paid Maternity Leave for a birth mother. Apple: Equal work deserves equal pay. This past year, Apple looked at the total compensation for U.S. employees and closed the gaps we found. We’ve achieved pay equity in the United States for similar roles and performance. Women employees at Apple earn one dollar for every dollar male employees earn. We’re now analyzing the salaries, bonuses, and annual stock grants of all our employees worldwide. If a gap exists, we’ll address it. And we’ll continue our work to make sure we maintain pay equity. Chobani: Since day one, diversity and inclusiveness have been at the core of Chobani. We’re proud to stand with other leading businesses to give one voice to a simple, common sense principle: women deserve equal pay for equal work. We were founded with the belief that everyone on our team deserves the same chance to achieve their dreams and live up to their full potential. By joining the White House in taking this important pledge, we’re committing to continuously reviewing our practices to ensure that, as we grow, we never stray from our founding principles – and that our hiring, promotion and compensation practices and procedures stick to our deeply-held belief that women deserve equal opportunity. The Coca-Cola Company: The Coca-Cola Company values and celebrates diversity. This includes a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity that spans our employment practices and development of existing employees. There is overwhelming evidence that achieving equality and empowerment for women has both immediate impacts that benefit them directly and broader ripple effects that are good for society. We have made meaningful strides as a company in our equal opportunity efforts. Still, we recognize there is more we can learn by building upon best practices across the U.S. private sector.  We are pleased, therefore, to join the Equal Pay Pledge and work with the Administration and other partners towards reducing the national gender pay gap. CVS Health: At CVS Health, we are committed to fulfilling our company’s purpose of helping people on their path to better health by living our values, including integrity, accountability, caring, collaboration and innovation. By living our values, we embrace a dedication to paying our colleagues equitably regardless of their gender. We take a purposeful and systematic approach to evaluate compensation to ensure we are accountable to our pay equity commitment. We actively work to seek out, listen to and leverage the voices of our diverse colleagues, customers, clients, and communities. For our company, diversity and innovation go hand in hand and we strive to model best practices to promote and develop diverse talent.  Our CEO serves as the executive sponsor of CVS Health’s Women’s Success Network, one of our largest Colleague Resource Groups.  And we have been recognized as a best practice company by the 20/20 Women on Boards Initiative.  We value the contributions of all of our colleagues and we are proud to join other leading employers in signing this pledge and making a commitment to this important issue. Delta Air Lines: At Delta Air Lines, the very nature of our business is bringing people together. We rely on a worldwide family of Delta Air Lines people 80,000 strong to care for our customers and ensure they get where they’re going promptly and safely, regardless of the origin or destination. Our success is built on diversity, where our differences make us stronger and all people are welcomed, supported and – above all – treated equally. We’re proud to join the White House in signing the Equal Pay Pledge and voicing our commitment to fairness and diversity in the workplace, which is reflective of our long-standing commitment of pay equality among all Delta Air Lines employees. Dropbox: Dropbox is honored to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and join the other companies who have taken a stand on this issue. Gender equality and equal pay are priorities for us, and they are part of our deep commitment to creating an equitable workplace that includes and supports employees of every background and identity. Our products are used around the globe by millions of people from all cultures and backgrounds, and our team needs to reflect the world we’re building for. At Dropbox we review all of our hiring and HR processes for potential bias, including a gender impact analysis at every compensation and promotion cycle. Additionally, we've built inclusive leadership into our framework for managers, and all of our senior leadership and nearly all of our employees have participated in unconscious bias training. While we are proud of our track record of compensating our employees fairly and equitably — from our most junior team members to our senior leaders — we know there is more work to be done in order to create a world in which both men and women have the same opportunities and choices. Dunkin’ Brands: Dunkin' Brands is committed to gender pay equity, and we are honored to join the White House in the Equal Pay Pledge.  At Dunkin' Brands we regularly review our pay practices to ensure pay equity and strongly believe that a corporate culture in which each person is valued, respected and earns equal pay for equal work, delivers better business results. EY: EY is committed to pay equity and a culture of inclusion. Equity in opportunities, advancement, and compensation is a business imperative, and we work hard to promote fair practices for all of our women and men. EY’s leadership is actively engaged in fostering gender equality at EY and in the marketplace. Facebook: At Facebook we value those who bring varying perspectives, for many reasons including background, community, culture, race, ethnicity - and gender. We call this cognitive diversity, and we want more of it. It propels our mission: to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. Facebook is a longtime supporter of equal pay. We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure pay equity, and have done so for many years. We complete thorough statistical analyses to compare the compensation of men and women performing similar work. As such, we are proud to share that at Facebook, men and women earn the same.  We encourage efforts to establish methods to close the wage gaps around the world. General Motors: General Motors is pleased to sign The White House Equal Pay Pledge. We believe strongly in gender equity, and we are dedicated to having a diverse and welcoming workplace that values the contributions of all employees. We know that a diverse workforce promotes fresh, innovative thinking that translates into both a competitive advantage for GM and winning products for our customers. To this end, among other efforts, GM has employee resource groups, whose mission is to attract, engage, develop and retain a diverse mix of talented employees to positively affect GM’s performance, through networking and professional development opportunities. GM is supporting this pledge because it reflects our shared belief that employees’ gender should not factor into compensation decisions. We believe that fair and equitable pay should be an essential element of any successful business model and are proud to stand with other companies that share this same value. The Hartford: At The Hartford, gender equality is a top business priority.  The Hartford prides itself on its diverse workforce and inclusive culture, and its commitment to equality for ALL employees. The Hartford, recently named as one of twenty-six firms on Bloomberg Financial Services Gender-Equality Index for demonstrating strong commitment to gender equality, is proud to take the next step in signing the White House’s Equal Pay Pledge.   The Hershey Company: At The Hershey Company, diversity and inclusion is a commitment that is embedded in who we are.  It’s about advancing our vision, our culture, and our environment, so everyone can bring a meaningful contribution.  As part of this commitment, we believe that discrimination has no place in our workforce, which is why we have a no-tolerance policy. Our policy is to extend opportunities and terms and conditions of employment to qualified applicants and employees on an equal basis regardless of an individual’s race, color, gender, age, national origin, religion, citizenship status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, physical or mental disability, protected veteran status, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other categories protected by applicable law.  For wages, this includes equal pay for equal work. Hilton: At Hilton, we are proud of our long history of supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our goal is clear - we strive for an inclusive work environment that allows all of our Team Members to be comfortable bringing their entire selves to work every day.   Simply put, our culture is a reflection of the backgrounds, passions and perspectives of all of our Team Members around the world. To be the most hospitable company in the world, we must also represent the many different cultures, backgrounds and viewpoints of our guests, which includes supporting and empowering women at every level of our organization.  In fact, women make up more than 50 percent of our global workforce. In this regard, we are honored to join the White House in signing the Equal Pay Pledge.  We are committed to advancing our efforts in ensuring equity not only in our pay practices, but also across recruitment, learning and development, benefits, and our overall Team Member value proposition. In doing so, we continue to deliver on our promise of a great environment, great careers and great rewards for all of our Team Members. Supporting women in the workplace is part of who we are. In fact, we provide a wide-range of opportunities for women such as our Women’s Team Member Resource Group, Women’s Executive Networking Program, and Women in Leadership Excellence Program in partnership with the University of Virginia. Most recently, we were honored to be selected by DiversityInc as one of the Top 50 Companies for Diversity, the Human Rights Campaign rated us at 100 percent on their Corporate Equality Index, and Professional Woman’s Magazine named us as a Top Diversity Employer of Women. We were also chosen by the Pax Ellevate Global Women's Index Fund for being one of the highest-rated companies in the world for advancing women leadership. Additionally, we are committed to offering family-focused benefits across our hotels and offices, including our industry-leading maternity leave policy, flexible working environments, 10-day advanced scheduling, paid time off, and educational assistance. IBM: In 1935, IBM founder Thomas J. Watson Sr. said, "Men and women will do the same kind of work for equal pay. They will have the same treatment, the same responsibilities and the same opportunities for advancement." IBM established a broad equal opportunity policy more than a decade before the Civil Rights Act, and we have maintained and continually improved a formal pay analysis and adjustment process for women and minority employees for 40 years. And now, in IBM’s second century as a company, we remain firmly dedicated to providing fair pay based on job responsibilities and performance, which is critical to meeting today’s evolving business and technology challenges. IBM is proud to sign the White House’s Equal Pay pledge as another step in our long history of fostering fairness, diversity and inclusion in the workplace. IKEA US: IKEA is a values-driven company, and our approach to diversity and inclusion is grounded in our values. We believe in people and see each individual as a talent. We treat each other fairly and provide our co-workers with equal opportunities, regardless of their gender identity, age, sexual orientation, physical ability, ethnicity, race, nationality, or any other dimension of their identity. We know that each individual adds value to the team, and we are committed to creating an inclusive work environment that encourages our diverse and competent co-workers to be themselves, to apply their unique perspectives at work, and to assume responsibility for our growth. In addition to being the right thing to do, creating this environment also improves our business results and strengthens our competitiveness. Several years ago, IKEA launched a proactive global effort to increase the diversity of our workforce at all levels. As part of this, we took – and will continue to take – a hard look at all areas of gender equality, including workforce representation, hiring, career development, succession planning, promotion rates, and pay equity. Over the coming years, we will maintain a comprehensive approach to diversity and inclusion across the entire organization, including pay equality. We are proud to take the Equal Pay Pledge to ensure fairness for all our co-workers, and to join the many companies contributing to a better society by leading on this issue. Intel: Signing the Equal Pay Pledge for Intel is a natural extension of our longstanding commitment to paying our employees fairly and equitably at all levels of the organization. We hold ourselves accountable with data by conducting an annual, comprehensive audit of pay in the U.S. to analyze our employees' pay by gender and ethnicity. In 2015 we conducted a comprehensive compensation analysis examining gender pay parity for U.S. employees across job types and levels. The report showed a net result of 100% pay parity, and we're incredibly proud of this result. Our commitment to diversity comes from our conviction that reaching a critical mass of women and underrepresented minorities in our industry brings ample benefits to many. The Libra Group: The Libra Group heartily supports the Equal Pay Pledge. As an employer we are age, sex, orientation, race and religion blind. Yet we are acutely aware that the wage gap is very often a symptom of a broader opportunity gap that may affect some population groups more than others, notably women. So wage parity begins with opportunity parity, which is why so many of our group’s social responsibility programs focus on groups who are experiencing disproportionate lack of educational and career opportunity. In many cases this means providing work experience, or equipping under-served communities with the advice, mentoring, training and support they need to acquire leadership skills or get a new business off the ground. For the fortunate few we are able to break the cycle of disadvantage and give a helping hand – but there is still more to be done. In our experience tomorrow’s leaders emerge from the most unlikely places. Thus we believe that narrowing the pay gap depends on two things: a culture of equal opportunity and equal treatment within the work environment, combined with selective positive action and intervention to lift people out of endemic disadvantage and give them the chance they deserve. LinkedIn: LinkedIn's vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. We are committed to ensuring all of our employees have equal opportunities to succeed and be recognized for their accomplishments. At the core of economic opportunity is equal pay for equal work. We believe it is basic good business to ensure this is true within your own organization, and we regularly review and evaluate our pay practices to ensure our employees are compensated fairly. In addition, our ongoing focus on improving the gender diversity of our employee base continues to have meaningful impact with gains in women's representation in both technical and leadership roles over the last several years. The Women’s Initiative (WIN) within our Global Sales team and the Women in Technology initiative (WIT) within our Engineering and Product organizations have built a framework to successfully hire, retain, develop and advance women. We are committed to continuing to create diverse teams in an inclusive work environment where every person feels they truly belong and are paid fairly. MailChimp: Equal pay is an essential part of MailChimp’s culture of inclusion, and we’re grateful for the opportunity to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. We conduct annual pay and benefits analyses, in addition to focusing on fair hiring and interviewing practices, generous family leave policies, flexible work schedules, employee-led resource groups, leadership development opportunities for employees at every level, and meaningful corporate citizenship programs. It is unacceptable that women working full-time earn only 79 percent of what men earn, and unacceptable that the gap is even greater for women of color. MailChimp promises to do our part to close that gap. We are committed to empowering all of our employees and helping them succeed both within our organization and out in the world. Microsoft: Microsoft is proud to join others in the effort to drive greater pay equality among men and women, which is a critical component of social progress.  When women are fully engaged in our workforce and communities, society at large benefits from the great ideas and innovation that flourishes.  Our commitment to equal pay gives us the opportunity to attract and hire from a broader talent pool of the best employees, managers and leaders—while gaining important insights into consumers’ needs. In addition to gender pay equality, we are also committed to ensuring that all employees have equal opportunity. MuleSoft: MuleSoft has signed the Equal Pay Pledge as a testament to our continued commitment to creating a great place to work for everyone. MuleSoft has a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity, and we believe people should be paid equally for equal work and experience. We conduct an annual audit of our compensation, which we readily use to influence changes in our policies. Ensuring that we all have the same platform for opportunities, growth, and compensation is core to our ethos and success. We’re committed to providing a workplace where everyone is supported and inspired by the opportunity to build a successful company where we can do what we love and thrive. Nike: Today, we are proud to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. At Nike, diversity is about acknowledging and valuing our differences and appreciating that everyone brings unique experiences, perspectives and ideas to the team. Investing in our employees to unleash their potential translates into a pipeline of new ideas, methods, and products that drive the future of sport. In keeping with our culture and what we stand for as an organization, we remain committed to equitable pay and rewarding performance across all roles, for all Nike team members. By signing the White House Equal Pay Pledge, we’re adding our voice to a movement that we hope will inspire positive change. Patagonia: Since they founded Patagonia in a small Tin Shed more than 40 years ago, Yvon and Malinda Chouinard have worked hard to build a culture where women and families thrive. Today, Patagonia continues to value and honor our working women with equal pay and opportunity. We believe women shouldn’t have to make the unnecessary choice between family and career and they can grow a career at the same pace as a family. At Patagonia, thanks to onsite child care, nursing moms are a few feet away from their babies versus miles apart. New moms and dads take paid time off to bond with and care for infants and families can eat breakfast and lunch together daily. We have an equal number of women and men at every level of the company, including among executive positions and the boardroom. Women and men are paid equally for comparable work. All of these things amount to a work environment where 100 percent of women return to work from maternity leave, 100 percent of dads take paid time off from work to bond with their new babies, and the business thrives as a result of the working families we support in our business. We also believe that there is so much more to be done to reinforce the true drivers of pay equality – such as paid maternity and paternity leave, quality on-site childcare, and a family-supportive work environment – which allow working moms and dads to continue to grow their family, career and income with equal opportunity. Patagonia commits to continuing to build on the progress we’ve made and supporting working families through every avenue possible as we continue to grow our business in line with the values we were founded on. “Women will never be able to effectively “lean in” without the proper economic, social and community support for the most critical work of all: raising children.” -Rose Marcario – CEO, Patagonia Target: At Target, we believe diversity and inclusivity make teams and Target better. We work to create a diverse and inclusive working environment and cultivate an inclusive guest experience, building a better Target for our team members and guests – and a better society for all. Target is honored to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and affirm our commitment to making pay equitable for everyone at Target, including women in the workplace. To achieve our goal of pay equity, we’ve implemented meaningful business practices, including continued leadership training designed, in part, to reduce the likelihood that leaders’ decisions are improperly influenced by bias or stereotyping.  We also use other internal measures, such as a comprehensive annual pay audit process, to ensure compensation is fair and equitable across the organization. Additionally, earlier this year, Target CEO Brian Cornell joined PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi to co-chair the Network of Executive Women’s Future Fund – an industry-wide campaign aimed at achieving 50/50 gender parity in the workforce. We’ve also earned a spot on the list for the Top Companies for Executive Women from the National Association for Female Executives for the past four years. We are proud of our internal initiatives and external partnerships, and we remain committed to improving pay processes and policies that ensure equality and fairness for all. Unilever: At Unilever, we strive to create a bright future and believe business has a critical part to play in closing the national gender gap. As part of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan - which is our blueprint to grow our business, while decoupling our environmental footprint from our growth and increasing our positive social impact - we have the ambition to empower the lives of five million women by 2020. Unilever is in a strong position to help empower women around the world: over 70% of our consumers are women and they play essential roles in our value chain. Unilever is proud to take the Equal Pay Pledge and confirm our commitment to gender equality. We consider the advancement of women’s economic inclusion a business priority and by promoting the formal and active participation of women in the economy—we aim to transform lives, families, communities and economies and in turn, have the opportunity to grow our markets, brands and business. Over the past six years, Unilever has been in the process of making sure we have gender balance throughout our business. We are currently at 49% gender balance for managers and above in North America and continue to strive to foster an environment where each individual feels uniquely valued and has equal opportunities.  Unilever is committed to creating a working environment that promotes diversity and equal opportunity. We are proud to have developed an inclusive culture and respect the contribution of all employees regardless of gender, age, race, disability or sexual orientation.  Visa: Universal acceptance for everyone, everywhere is not only our brand promise, it’s the foundation of our company culture. Diversity and inclusion is a strategic imperative at Visa, and it requires equal pay for equal work. We regularly review our compensation practices and conduct thorough analyses to ensure pay equity. An inclusive workplace enhances and enriches our environment, successfully drives business results and leads to improved leadership effectiveness and employee engagement. We will continue to take meaningful steps to make progress in this important journey. And we’re proud to sign this pledge as way of affirming our commitment to pay equity for our female employees in the U.S. Prev Next You are here:   Home News National News White House Announces New Commitments to the Equal Pay Pledge Main Menu Imperial Valley News News Latest News Imperial Valley News California News National News Health News Sporting News Living and Lifestyle Career News World News Spanish - Espanol About Us Copyright Infringements Privacy Policy Contact Us Sitemap Web Links Latest News Women's Wellness: Having a heart attack The link between diabetes and pancreatic cancer Principles of healthy eating Functional fitness training: Is it right for you?

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple, Facebook and other tech giants sign White House pledge to pay women equally to men By Ethan Baron / August 26, 2016 at 5:51 PM Some of Silicon Valley’s biggest tech players have signed onto a pledge to pay women equally to men, the White House announced today. Apple, Facebook, Intel, LinkedIn, Dropbox and Akamai Technologies have put their names to the White House Equal Pay Pledge. Airbnb, Pinterest and Salesforce had signed on previously. “The typical woman working full-time all year in the United States only earns 79 percent of what a typical man working full-time all year earns,” the White House said. “While the gap has narrowed slightly over the past few years, there is much more work to be done to ensure fair pay for all.” In the White House press release, Apple said it had achieved gender equity in pay in the U.S. and was analyzing compensation of employees outside the country. Facebook said it pays men and women equally; Intel said the same. The other Silicon Valley firms that just signed the pledge said they reviewed the issue regularly. However, with women making up only about 30 percent of the workforce in major tech companies, achieving equal pay is only half the battle.   Photo: Apple CEO Tim Cook at Apple headquarters in Cupertino.

Ecumenical News ecunews.com Home U.S. world Church Culture Belief Humanitarian Analysis Lifestyle Pope Francis Christmas message Korean Peninsula Fighting Fake News Middle East Christians Climate Change Jan 02, 2017, Updated at 21:40 PM EST Home General Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date, specs rumors: Signs point to a late 2017 release for the new tablet John Paul Sunico |Monday, August 29 2016 Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it (Microsoft Store)The follow-up to the Surface Pro 4 (shown), the Surface Pro 5, is not expected to arrive anytime soon October is just weeks away and Microsoft's Surface Pro 5 should consistently be in the headlines right now, but it isn't, and that likely means people will be waiting a while for the new tablet. After Microsoft introduced the public to the Surface Pro 4 in October of last year, the hope heading into 2016 was that its follow-up would arrive around the same time. Unfortunately, the way things are going right now, it would be quite the surprise if the Surface Pro 5 suddenly showed up by the time October rolled around. It's not just the lack of headlines regarding the rumored tablet that should be a cause of concern for those expecting the device to make its debut this year. At this point, so much about what the tablet will be like is still up in the air, and all the uncertainty is likely an indicator that even industry insiders have not heard much about this particular Microsoft offering. Furthermore, the features that people do expect to see in the Surface Pro 5 may also be indicators that it won't be coming out anytime soon. As an earlier report from ZD Net's Mary Jo Foley alluded to, new Surface devices using Intel's Kaby Lake processors – as the Surface Pro 5 is expected to do – may go on sale until next year's holiday season. The new tablet is also expected to run the Redstone 2 version of the Windows 10 operating system (OS) right out of the box, and that piece of software is not expected to arrive until next spring. October 2016 will, in all likelihood, pass by without Microsoft's new tablet being introduced and folks waiting to see it may be better served to recalibrate their expectations as they settle in for an extended wait. More news about Microsoft's Surface Pro 5 should be made available in the near future.

Home About Directory Programs Attractive Chaos Just another WordPress.com weblog Feeds: Posts Comments « Converting PDF to EPS Optimizing Matrix Multiplication August 28, 2016 by attractivechaos Vector and matrix arithmetic (e.g. vector dot and matrix multiplication) are the basic to linear algebra and are also widely used in other fields such as deep learning. It is easy to implement vector/matrix arithmetic, but when performance is needed, we often resort to a highly optimized BLAS implementation, such as ATLAS and OpenBLAS. Are these libraries much faster than our own implementations? Is it worth introducing a dependency to BLAS if you only need basic vector/matrix arithmetic? The following post may give you some hints. Results In this github repository, I implemented matrix multiplication in seven different ways, including a naive implementation, several optimized implementations with cache miss reduction, SSE and loop blocking, and two implementations on top of OpenBLAS. The following table shows the timing of multiplying two 2000×2000 or 4000×4000 random matrices on my personal Mac laptop and a remote linux server (please see the source code repo for details): Implementation -a Linux,-n2000 Linux,-n4000 Mac,-n2000 Naive 0 7.53 sec 188.85 sec 77.45 sec Transposed 1 6.66 sec 55.48 sec 9.73 sec sdot w/o hints 4 6.66 sec 55.04 sec 9.70 sec sdot with hints 3 2.41 sec 29.47 sec 2.92 sec SSE sdot 2 1.36 sec 21.79 sec 2.92 sec SSE+tiling sdot 7 1.11 sec 10.84 sec 1.90 sec OpenBLAS sdot 5 2.69 sec 28.87 sec 5.61 sec OpenBLAS sgemm 6 0.63 sec 4.91 sec 0.86 sec uBLAS 7.43 sec 165.74 sec Eigen 0.61 sec 4.76 sec You can see that a naive implementation of matrix multiplication is quite slow. Simply transposing the second matrix may greatly improve the performance when the second matrix does not fit to the CPU cache (the linux server has a 35MB cache, which can hold a 2000×2000 float matrix in cache, but not a 4000×4000 matrix). Transpose also enables vectorization of the inner loop. This leads to significant performance boost (SSE sdot vs Transposed). Loop blocking further reduces cache misses and timing for large matrices. However, OpenBLAS’ matrix multiplication (sgemm) is still the king of performance, twice as fast as my best hand-written implementation and tens of times faster than a naive implementation. OpenBLAS is fast mostly due to its advanced techniques to minimize cache misses. As side notes, “sdot with hints” partially unrolls the inner loop. It gives a hint to the compiler that the loop may be vectorized. Clang on Mac can fully vectorize this loop, achieving the same speed of explicit vectorization. Gcc-4.4 seems not as good. The Intel compiler vectorizes the loop even without this hint (see the full table in README). Interestingly, the OpenBLAS sdot implementation is slower than my explicit vectorization on both Linux and Mac. I haven’t figured out the reason. I speculate that it may be related to cache optimization. As to C++ libraries, Eigen has similar performance to OpenBLAS. The native uBLAS implementation in Boost is quite primitive, nearly as slow as the most naive implementation. Boost should ditch uBLAS. Even in the old days, it was badly implemented. Conclusions For multiplying two large matrices, sophisticated BLAS libraries, such as OpenBLAS, are tens of times faster than the most naive implementation. With transposing, SSE (x86 only) and loop blocking, we can achieve half of the speed of OpenBLAS’ sgemm while still maintaining relatively simple code. If you want to avoid a BLAS dependency, this is the way to go. For BLAS level-1 routines (vector arithmetic), an implementation with SSE vectorization may match or sometimes exceeds the performance of OpenBLAS. If you prefer a C++ interface and are serious about performance, don’t use uBLAS; use Eigen instead. Like this: Like Loading...

Do you have any theories why OpenBLAS and Eigen is so much better? Are they using threading or maybe AVX? on August 28, 2016 at 8:17 pm | Reply attractivechaos Have a look at the “matrix multiplication algorithm” wiki page and you will get some hints. I guess they are faster mostly because they are better at minimizing cache misses by splitting and reordering the computation block by block. As to other possible explanations – I have intentionally disabled multithreading; although the linux server supports AVX, gcc doesn’t and I explicitly tells OpenBLAS not to use AVX. on August 29, 2016 at 2:19 pm | Reply BLAS Pascal For GotoBLAS, from which OpenBLAS was forked, you might want to read the paper https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/pingali/CS378/2008sp/papers/gotoPaper.pdf on August 28, 2016 at 9:49 pm | Reply zhanxwzhanxw I like Eigen a lot. It can use Intel MKL backend, and that has good performances besides matrix multiplication. on August 28, 2016 at 10:44 pm | Reply rurban What about the new gather-scatter vector intrinsics, esp. the 512 bit ones? Is this included in SSE? I guess not, as it needs AVX or Knights Landing/Phi. on August 29, 2016 at 8:56 am | Reply 2# This is one very interesting ecample where you could use some multy threading in order to acchieve faster multiplication. on October 14, 2016 at 1:45 pm | Reply Paweł I do recomend including also implementation with instruction reordering(eliminates cache-misisng) and openmp directives for parallization Comments RSS Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Macbook Pro 2016 Release Date and Latest Rumors: Touchscreen, Touch ID and USB 3.1 Coming with New Apple Laptop; Price and Specs Details By Neal A. Lasta Aug 28, 2016 | 9:33 AM We are learning more and more about the Macbook Pro 2016 as days progress and more leaks find their way into mainstream media. For example, the leaked macOS Sierra Code reveals a lot of information about the product's enhanced capabilities and new features. Let's take a look at some of these newly discovered features of the Macbook Pro 2016. Touchscreen 9T05Mac reports that the Macbook Pro 2016 will no longer have physical function keys. Instead, this part of the keyboard will be replaced by an OLED display touch bar. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Touch ID Capability The new macOS Sierra comes along with it several developer-oriented changes, including Touch ID support. The macOS Sierra code hints that the Macbook Pro 2016 will have devices specifically for biometric input. The Touch ID capability is one feature connected to the device's new touchscreen. Aside from the Touch ID, the touchscreen will also give way for utilization of third-party apps. USB 3.1 Connectivity According to the International Business Times, the MacBook Pro 2016 will likely support USB 3.1, which is a super-fast 2nd generation port. This was concluded after analyzing macOS Sierra beta code. From what we've learned from Apple, the company has always been quick to incorporate the latest USB and Thunderbolt port technologies to maximize the performances of their Mac products. The USB 3.1 variant expected to be used in the MacBook Pro 2016 is one that supports a speed of 10GB/s. Currently, Mac devices only support 5 Gb/s. New GPU Apple Insider believes that "the high-end 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro will have a new AMD "Polaris" GPU, while lower-end 15-inch models and all 13-inch models will feature Intel integrated graphics." Other rumors point to the Cupertino-based company's use of 6th gen Skylake processors from Intel for the MacBook Pro 2016. Display MacBook Pro 2016 is rumored to feature 5K Apple Display, with a screen resolution of 5,120 pixels by 2,880 pixels. The device will probably also support features for Augmented Reality. There will be two variants in terms of screen size: 13-inch and 15-inch. Graphics will be supported by AMD Polaris. Price Start saving now. The MacBook Pro 2016 will be priced anywhere between $1,299 to $1,499. Release Date For now, there is no mention of any specific date whatsoever to the release of the latest MacBook Pro. In fact, even the mere actuality of this product hasn't been confirmed by Apple. The most recent rumors point to a 2016 MacBook Pro release sometime in October this year, or maybe even November.

By Benjamin Glaser, Dealnews.com August 28, 2016 Save for later Saved Shoppers walk around to explore a mall in west London. Lefteris Pitarakis/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of September is an exciting month for bargain hunters. Not only does it bring us one step closer to the holiday season — which is the best time of year for many big-ticket items — but this month is also a great time to stock up on a variety of items, thanks to a small overlap in Labor Day, summer clearance, and back-to-school sales. So while the end of summer may be upon us, the best deals of the year are only now just beginning. Check out our guide below for tips on the best things to buy in September. For more deals every single day of the month, consider signing up for the DealNews Select Newsletter to get the best deals of the day delivered to your inbox. 9 Things to Buy Now Labor Day Sales on Summer Apparel Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer. That means all summer-related goods will be at or near their lowest prices of the year, as stores try to clear out summer inventories ahead of the holidays. Expect to see sales from major retailers like Gap, Banana Republic, and Forever 21 offering 50% to 70% off. Last year Amazon discounted a wide range of men's, women's, and children's apparel; though it was a modest 20% off, that might be worth it for Prime members. Recommended: Can you manage your money? A personal finance quiz. Outdoorsy goods were also popular last year. We saw strong discounts from stores like REI, L.L. Bean, Eddie Bauer, and Nautica, and expect the same this year. Also be on the lookout for an influx of deals on designer clothes. Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, and Calvin Klein (at 6pm) all saw discounts of up to 80% off last year. Test your knowledge Can you manage your money? A personal finance quiz. Photos of the Day Our best photos of the year 2016 Grills September offers the best deals on grills and BBQ-related utensils. Although grills are generally associated with the summer, the less humid autumn weather may actually provide a more ideal climate for your backyard soirees, so rest assured that any investment you make this month can still be put to use in the coming weeks. Sears was the grill king last year, supplying over a third of the grill deals we saw in September. That included a broad 25% off sale with stackable coupons. Walmart also had several good discounts. Patio Furniture Similar to grills, patio furniture sees some of its lowest prices of the year at the end of outdoor season. We recommended patio furniture purchases last month, too, with August providing six times as many Editors' Choice deals as June and July. And September has twice the percentage of Editors' Choice patio furniture deals as August! Look to Target and Sears for discounts of around 40% off. Freebies on National Coffee Day Coffee is one of the most beloved morning beverages, so it's no surprise that it has its own holiday. September 29 is National Coffee Day and to celebrate, food chains across the country will offer free or discounted cups of joe to their customers. Last year, we saw freebies (no purchase required) from Dunkin' Donuts, Krispy Kreme, Flying J, Pilot, and LaMar's. One notable exception: Starbucks did not offer a freebie; instead the chain chose to kick off a charity initiative on Coffee Day last year. 32" TVs, or Big-Screens September is traditionally a stellar month for deals on 32" 1080p HDTVs. Not only will deals be abundant for this category, but they'll be at the lowest prices of the year. Last year, they hit an astounding $110, though $150 is a more realistic bet. These small screens are perfect for a dorm room or first apartment. Outside of 32" TVs, the other end of the size spectrum is hot for deals in September. During Labor Day weekend in 2015, a full quarter of the TV deals we listed that were 55" or larger were at an Editors' Choice price. Otherwise, if you can't find a low price on the set you want, we recommend waiting until November for TV purchases. Mattresses Mattress deals are generally at their best during the months of April and May, when retailers add stackable coupons to their already-existing sales. However, Labor Day has become a mattress event itself. US-Mattress, Sam's Club, and Sears in particular had noteworthy sales taking 50% off select mattresses with an extra 10% to 40% off via a stackable coupon. That's on par with the best mattress deals we see in April and May. Laptops If you're in the market for a new laptop, make your purchase early in the month to take advantage of lingering back-to-school sales. Last year, 75% of the Editors' Choice laptop deals we saw were in September. Look for deals on 15" laptops with current-generation Intel Skylake processors from Cowboom, Dell Home, Newegg, Lenovo, and more. For Apple users, we recommend bypassing the Apple Store's back-to-school sale, which this year (like last year) offers a free pair of Beats Solo2 On-Ear headphones to qualifying students. Instead, look for Mac deals at Best Buy, eBay, and Micro Center. There you'll find the 2015 MacBook Air 11" Laptop for around $700, and the 13" for around $750 — a better value than a full-price laptop with headphones. Textbooks Many students will head to college for the first time this September, and while it may be too late to apply for new scholarships, there are still many ways you can reduce your college expenses. For instance, these days students can find cheap college textbooks online, by either comparison shopping or using social media to trade/borrow books from other students in their college. The earlier you begin your search, the greater your chances of scoring a deal. Previous-Generation iPhones September wouldn't be the same without Apple's fall keynote, where we're expecting the debut of the iPhone 7. Look for sales that discount the previous-generation iPhone — since that's where you'll find the deepest price cuts — rather than the just-released model. For instance, on the day of the keynote, Apple will shave $100 off the subsidized cost of an iPhone 6s. But it won't stop there. In the weeks that follow, you can expect retailers (such as eBay, Walmart, and Best Buy) to offer iPhone 6s deals with prices around $50 (with a 2-year contract). For unlocked models, you'll find the best deals on eBay where prices for an unlocked iPhone 6 could hit $500 (it's been around $610 all summer). Remember, you can always sell your old iPhone to help offset the cost of a new unlocked model. 3 Things to Wait to But Newly Announced iPhones While September will be a great month to buy an iPhone 6s, it's not the best time to score a deal on the soon-to-be-announced iPhone 7. We don't expect to see deals on that model until November. And even then, we'll likely only see modest discounts that take $10 off the full price of the phone, or discounts that bundle a free $50 Apple Gift Card with the purchase of an unlocked iPhone 7 at full price. iPads For those waiting for a new iPad, you might have to wait longer. Fans have expected an iPad Air 3 for over a year, but the introduction of the 10" iPad Pro last spring could suggest an entirely different direction for this product line; there might be no iPad Air 3 at all as Apple shifts focus to the Pro line. If there is an iPad Air 3 coming, it certainly doesn't seem like it will arrive this fall. That means your best bet for now for iPad deals is still Black Friday. Walmart is definitely a leader in deals on the Apple Tablet, as well as usual suspects like eBay and Micro Center. Appliances Labor Day tends to offer excellent deals on large appliances, with sales that take up to 54% off items such as dishwashers and refrigerators. However, if you can wait until November, Black Friday will offer better sales, with discounts that take up to 75% off the same items. On average, about 35% of Black Friday appliance deals are marked Editors' Choice — only 15% of deals see that distinction throughout the rest of the year.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Articles PC Digital Foundry: Let's build a 1080p60 gaming PC New consoles are targeting 4K gaming - but what if we want higher frame-rates instead? By Richard Leadbetter Published 28/08/2016 It's been a while since we put one of these together but on the prelude of a new console generation, perhaps it's time. A while back, we asked the question - are ever-higher resolutions truly the best use for next-gen console technology? The response from you was emphatic - no, you'd prefer to stick to 1080p and improve frame-rates and visual fidelity. And that's why we've put together a PC gaming build specifically designed to deliver excellent 1080p60 performance. First up, let's be clear about the parameters here. We're looking to double console performance, bringing us up from 30fps to 60fps and while improved visual quality is nice, we consider that a bonus. What you shouldn't expect is a machine to offer a 60fps lock with everything ramped up to ultra - in many cases, this will result in depressed performance. The truth is, you're sacrificing frame-rate for a very limited return. It's nice if you can run those settings, but the reality is that 'one notch down' generally tends to look superb, matching or indeed exceeding console-level presets. We've been planning this feature for a while, but the timing is right now in the wake of Nvidia's unveiling of the three gig version of the GTX 1060. This marks the final potential card that should be assessed for a build of this nature. And this is important as the arrival of FinFET technology means great things for GPU performance. But the thing is, those older GPUs don't suddenly become obsolete overnight. They still perform well, they still offer excellent 1080p60 gameplay and maybe - just maybe - you'll find them aggressively discounted too. And assessing a wide range of GPU tech forms a crucial part of this feature - whether it's old or new cards, you're spoilt for choice. However, elsewhere in the build, choices are fundamentally limited. In the here and now, with AMD's Zen CPUs still months away from release, virtually all non-GPU aspects of our build are essentially no-brainers. With no effective competition on the market, you're looking at an Intel-based system, with a K chip the best option for future-proofing. If you want an overclockable processor (and you do), choices are further limited as a motherboard based on the Z170 chipset is essential. A complete video journal showing the build process of the Digital Foundry 1080p60 gaming PC. Modern PC are very easy to construct and it's very hard to make a kit-breaking mistake. Beyond that, choices for surrounding components are basically up to you - though we do recommend investing a little more money in faster DDR4 memory - it does help in CPU-bound scenarios, and helps to get the most out of your overclock in bandwidth-intensive games. Here's a breakdown of the components we chose, and why: The core: MSI Z170A Gaming Pro Carbon, Core i5 6600K, 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 Out of the box, the Intel Core i5 6600K [?] is fast. It may lack the hyper-threading of the i7, but a 4.4-4.5GHz overclock should be sustainable, as long as you can keep temperatures down. Bumping all cores up to 4GHz is a walk in the park and shouldn't impact your thermals. The i7 is faster and a minority of games will benefit in certain areas, but for hitting 60fps on most titles, the i5 will do just fine and it should have the legs to keep you future-proofed for a long while. If there's one piece of advice we have for ensuring longevity on a gaming PC build, it's not to skimp on the motherboard. We've opted for a MSI Z170A Gaming Pro Carbon [?] board here. Most, if not all, Z170 boards enable a healthy overclock for your K chip and will operate overclockable RAM at their rated speeds. Our build is going to have a clear side-panel, so it doesn't hurt to have a good-looking board with customisable RGB lighting. M.2 SSD support and USB 3.1 Type-C and Type-A functionality is helpful, along with CrossFire and SLI support. It might sound a little nuts, but we really like MSI's LED lighting for rear ports. In terms of memory, we'd recommend spending a little extra on fast DDR4. In CPU-bound scenarios, the faster your memory, the less constricted your processor is. This goes against the conventional wisdom that 'any RAM will do' but you can see the evidence in the Core i5 2500K video embedded further down in this piece. The 3000MHz-rated Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 [?] is fast enough but overclocks to 3200MHz with laughable ease. Beyond that, additional DDR4 bandwidth offers limited returns based on our testing. Eight gigs of DDR4 will do for now, but 16GB is the more future-proof option. Pro-tip: don't forget to enable XMP in the BIOS to actually enable your faster RAM. The core of our system is an overclockable Skylake i5 paired with a motherboard using the Z170 chipset. We're using fast DDR4 here, and we're managing CPU temperatures with a closed loop water cooler. Cooling, power, storage - and the case It's no secret at this point that a good mid-range heatsink and fan offers comparable results to a closed loop water coolers. However, we like the Corsair H60 [?] for its aesthetics here; the internals look clean and it's very quiet. We stuck with the same firm for our power supply, opting for a Corsair CX600M [?]. It's semi-modular, so the only cables coming out are the main power input for the motherboard and CPU power. This allows you to add further cables as you need them. Modern CPUs and GPUs are very power-efficient: our final build draws just 220W at max gaming load (even with a 4GHz overclock in place on the i5!) so we have plenty of capacity here. In terms of storage, by all means add a mechanical drive as a secondary backup, but with SSD prices collapsing, we highly recommend a decent-sized solid state solution for gaming. It's not just frame-rates and quality settings we can improve here - loading times are a major bugbear on consoles and they're much reduced on PC. We're using an OCZ Trion 150 SSD [?] in our build and it performs well, but most cheap 480/500/512GB SSDs work great for gaming and have capacity for a reasonable bunch of games. And finally, we've opted for the Corsair Carbide 400C [?] for our case - it's beautifully designed with a full-size side window, great cooling and some really nice touches - we particularly liked the SSD bays under the motherboard for hiding your storage - just slide them in and you're good to go. Cable management is a breeze here and we also liked the cut-away beneath the CPU socket for easily installing custom coolers that utilise bespoke mounting brackets. A look at the final build. The 400C has highly generous storage areas behind the motherboard - great for hiding away untidy cables. Three SSD bays are also located at the rear of the case, tucked away from view - a lovely feature. Which graphics card should you buy for 1080p60 gameplay? When we started to plan this article, the selection of graphics cards we wanted to test was limited - and obvious. MSI supplied us with GTX 970, GTX 980, R9 390 and R9 390X. Generally speaking, the GTX 970 and R9 390 provided the best bang for the buck, while the GTX 980 and 390X offered a relatively small boost for a larger amount of cash (much larger in the case of the GTX 980 - prices fell nicely on the 390X). However, what's clear is that the colossal success of the GTX 970 has resulted in many, many more products to replace it, with the arrival of the next generation of GPUs. These undercut it in terms of both price and often exceed it in performance. AMD has three products: RX 470 4GB and two RX 480s (4GB/8GB), while Nvidia has two GTX 1060s (3GB/6GB). All of these cards represent a significant leap over the current-gen consoles, to the point where the Polaris 10 chip in the AMD cards is the core GPU component of the PlayStation Neo's new processor. Prices start at $180/£180 for the RX 470, reaching $250/£240 for the six gig GTX 1060. There are no GTX 980 and R9 390X equivalents now (GTX 1070 is on a completely different level really) - everything is slotted into a very tight price range. So here's a look at how the benchmarks for each of them stack up. To be frank, there's not much in it, but generally speaking, it's the GTX 1060 that is the faster card. If you have an existing PC and are looking to upgrade on a tight budget, the RX 470 and the cheaper 480 and 1060 may have merit, but when building a PC from scratch, it just makes sense to spend the extra $50 on the cards with more VRAM. The GTX 1060 in three gig form takes on RX 470 and RX 480, plus its six gig sibling, in our video benchmarks above. 1920x1080 (1080p) GTX 1060 3GB GTX 1060 6GB RX 480 4GB RX 480 8GB RX 470 4GB Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 55.2 58.2 50.4 50.8 48.8 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 46.8 45.9 45.9 47.7 45.2 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 74.8 78.7 68.8 70.1 68.0 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 54.3 56.6 53.6 54.8 51.3 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 63.1 65.6 54.7 57.1 58.7 Hitman, Ultra, SMAA, DX12 57.7 65.8 71.4 73.2 68.6 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 74.2 75.1 65.4 66.0 64.1 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post AA, No HairWorks 64.7 68.4 60.5 61.2 57.9 There's one thing to point out with regards to benchmarks - they are not representative of the gameplay experience. All of these titles are running at ultra settings or equivalent, but they are tested fully unlocked, with results that present as averages. Their purpose is in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the hardware by judging relative performance. During actual gameplay, your aim should be to target 1080p60 for the vast majority of gameplay and that requires making trades in terms of quality levels. Those compromises needn't impact the quality of your experience unduly, and they stabilise performance - which is of more importance. Generally speaking, 60fps console titles can run at 1080p60 on these cards with ultra settings (think: Star Wars Battlefront, Doom 2016, Mirror's Edge Catalyst etc) or close to it but 30fps games tend to require dropping down to high presets and often a degree of further tweaking is required. For example, running The Witcher 3 at 1080p60 involves dropping the most taxing settings down to high and turning off the wasteful HairWorks feature. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided? It's a classic case of simply dropping down to high and letting the GPU do its thing. We'd be quite happy with either the Radeon RX 480 8GB [?] or GeForce GTX 1060 6GB [?] for our build, but titles such as No Man's Sky do still seem to suggest that AMD's single-threaded OpenGL and DX11 drivers can still hold back the generally excellent hardware in certain titles. Combine Nvidia's driver advantage here with its small speed bump and right now, we'd be opting for the higher-specced GTX 1060 as the GPU of choice. So how do the latest and greatest mainstream AMD and Nvidia cards stack up against their predecessors? What if an older card is available at a temptingly low price? The table below should give you an outlook on relative performance if you spot a bargain. Stacking up the old with the new. In this video, the GTX 1060 6GB and RX 480 8GB take on the outgoing GTX 970 and GTX 980. 1920x1080 (1080p) GTX 1060 6GB RX 480 8GB GTX 970 4GB GTX 980 4GB R9 390 8GB R9 390X 8GB Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 58.2 50.8 51.3 58.7 48.6 52.7 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 45.9 47.7 40.5 48.3 52.1 55.8 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 78.7 70.1 72.5 83.7 75.4 81.4 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 56.6 54.8 50.2 57.8 49.8 53.5 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 65.6 57.1 56.2 63.3 65.1 67.8 Hitman, Ultra, SMAA, DX12 65.8 73.2 59.0 66.9 75.6 81.9 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 75.1 66.0 69.7 80.4 66.6 71.7 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post AA, No HairWorks 68.4 61.2 60.7 65.6 55.6 60.2 Overall, there's not really a massive amount in it. The GTX 980 remains a highly potent force and overclocks significantly beyond GTX 1060, but the more modern Nvidia card offers a generally equivalent experience at stock in most cases and has an additional two gigs of VRAM. On top of that, the simultaneous multi-projection tech in Nvidia's Pascal line could offer a big, big boost to VR performance, assuming developer support. Generally speaking, the GTX 970 is out-performed by the GTX 1060 - but it can still do the job required in delivering 1080p60 gameplay, and it overclocks like a demon - but we'd only recommend one if you can find it at a seriously good price. On the AMD side, the RX 480 can beat its predecessor - the R9 390 - in several titles, but it's actually a touch slower in some cases. However, in terms of form factor and power efficiency, the new Polaris card is light years ahead of its predecessors. The R9 390 was a great performer for its time, and its eight gigs of VRAM was always 'nice to have', but the lack of power efficiency and the resultant heat generation was a real issue that always made us feel a little concerned. The R9 390X was actually hotter and thirstier still, so we find it hard to recommend these when much more refined designs are available. Our conclusions here are pretty straightforward - both Nvidia and AMD have worked hard to bring GTX 970/980 performance to a mainstream price-point. The old guard were great for their time and still hold up well today (particularly the GTX 980) but for a new PC, a modern GPU with more VRAM and more focused driver support makes more sense. Hands-on testing: does our system meet expectations? The first order of business on any higher-end gaming system is to enter the BIOS and turn on XMP - a process that enables your overclockable RAM to operate at its rated speed. It's remarkable how many people buy premium RAM but forget to actually run it beyond stock speeds. We also jump into the MSI overclocking menu and change 'CPU ratio' from Auto to 40. This locks our 6600K to 4.0GHz on all four cores, significantly faster than any locked i5 on the market. The 6600K should overclock significantly higher, but pushing harder involves voltage increases that may impact processor longevity owing to much greater heat generation. That said, once we get going, we find that CPU temperatures barely break 40 degrees Celsius, even when the CPU is under heavy gaming load - the Corsair H60 water-cooler is doing a great job here, even in a room with 27 degree ambient temperatures. As you can see in the hands-on video below, we achieve some sterling results from our Core i5/GTX 1060 combo. Turning off HairWorks and cutting a couple of settings down from ultra to high gives us a 1080p60 lock in The Witcher 3. Both Star Wars Battlefront and Mirror's Edge Catalyst also stick doggedly to 1080p60 on ultra settings (and on the latter, we have the VRAM available to invoke hyper quality textures). Doom 2016 didn't waver in our testing, even with all settings pushed to the limit. We could push beyond ultra here with 16x anisotropic filtering and nightmare-level texture paging. We spent a good part of a day running a bunch of games and tweaking settings in order to produce the locked 1080p60 experience that is so rare on the current-gen consoles. Grand Theft Auto 5 - leaving aside the advanced graphics settings for a moment, 1080p60 with all standard settings bar MSAA maxed gave a completely locked experience, even with the challenging grass setting pushed up to ultra. However, Io Interactive's Hitman dipped to a meagre 36-38fps in its taxing Paris stage. The console version operates at medium quality levels with high textures. We locked to 60fps by following that template, though we found that we could raise level of detail up to the high level. Even with these compromises, the game still looks great and silky smooth gameplay is clearly preferable to visual improvements that are only relatively minor in nature. The Core i5 6600K is a great chip, but we did find some scenarios where an i7 would improve performance. Crysis 3 on very high settings (shadows dropped to high) could still stutter below 60fps in the jungle areas, or when heavy alpha and intense physics were deployed. Even with the i5 at 4.0GHz, the vintage 2013 title still causes issues for modern hardware. We've played this game a lot, and even older generation i7s hand in smoother performance on the very high preset. We also noted that the village stage in Rise of the Tomb Raider could max out the i5, causing stutter (a touch reduced in DX12), while galloping through Novigrad City could also tap out the i5 to its limits (though the 60fps lock remained intact). The big question: how long will this PC last? The aim with this build isn't to skimp on quality, we want to produce a PC with plenty of longevity here - and realistically we should expect to see several GPU upgrades before we touch anything else in the system. In terms of just how long-lived this PC could be, check out our article on whether it's time for existing PC owners to upgrade from the classic Core i5 2500K - a vintage 2011 processor still widely in use today and still performing fairly well. This is a frankly remarkable state of affairs bearing in mind that virtually every other five-year-old PC component is now virtually obsolete. The reality is that buying a K chip and an overclock-capable board to run it is the gateway for keeping your PC viable for years to come, via extra performance gleaned by combining CPU overclocking with faster memory. In the case of the 2500K, overclocking it to 4.6GHz and pairing it with 2133MHz DDR3 gives performance in the same ballpark as a modern Core i5 6500 running at 3.2GHz in tandem with 2666MHz DDR4. Obviously it's nowhere near as power efficient, but it's certainly more economical than junking an entire system. Careful parts selection in the here and now can future-proof your PC for years to come, as we demonstrate here by re-evaluating the Core i5 2500K up against contemporary gaming PC set-ups running the same, modern GPU. It holds up remarkably well considering that it's five years old! Helping to prolong the life of PCs past, present and future is the fact that current - and indeed, future - consoles are based on relatively weak AMD CPU cores designed primarily for mobile applications. PlayStation Neo features the exact same CPU set-up, albeit with a 31 per cent clock-speed increase. We feel fairly confident that an i5 6600K can keep up for a good few years yet. On top of that, the Z170 board should be compatible with the future Intel Kaby Lake CPUs, plus you can upgrade from an i5 to an i7 for further gaming performance. Again, that's something we covered for 2500K owners, who can conceivably upgrade to an i7 3770K from the next Intel generation - Ivy Bridge. It's Overwatch story time We digest the lore for you. In short, the core of this PC should have plenty of longevity. However, what's clear - and we'll stress it once again - is that the key to a long-lived system is investing in that all-important K chip and an overclock compatible board. Clearly, this does add significantly to the initial build cost. However, it's fair to say that we've been fairly lavish with some of the kit we've put together here - and in terms of the motherboard, chassis and cooler in particular, there are significantly cheaper options. However, the overclockable nature of the CPU and the all-important Z170 chipset motherboard are non-negotiable. The core component you should expect to upgrade every couple of years will be the graphics card - realistically, you can look towards the GeForce GTX 1070 to get an idea of what next year's sub-£200/$200 GPU will offer and towards the epic Titan X Pascal for a similar preview for mainstream graphics power a couple of years from now. If the future is indeed 4K in nature, as Sony and Microsoft believe, the good news is that this PC is one upgrade away from supporting that at 60fps too.

Turns out Blizzard is pushing Blizzard Streaming to “the Americas, Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand”. Currently, Facebook is the only platform that you can stream to, and Blizzard hasn't announced bringing it to others, but the settings area is clearly a vertical list of horizontal widgets, so that suggests they intend to add more than one at some point. As for the application, itself, this could be useful (especially if other services are added) for users who only stream Blizzard titles, and who want something designed a bit more mainstream than OBS. That said, Raptr and GeForce Experience both fall under this category. Moreover, Blizzard doesn't clarify whether or not the stream will make use of NVIDIA's NVENC, Intel's Quick Sync, or AMD's VCE, all three of which are supported on OBS Studio. Granted, Blizzard titles tend to be easy to compute, but it is hard to beat encoding on an idle, integrated GPU, if you should have one. That said, choices are good, and you now have another. Source: Blizzard (via YouTube) Comments Post a comment August 26, 2016 | 11:19 PM - Posted by Penteract (not verified) No Facebook stuff for me - I immediately went into the Battle.net settings and unchecked the streaming. If I'm going to stream it's going to be to Twitch. Using Shadowplay or OBS. Some people are having serious crashes after the update that installed this "feature". Not only does my second computer crash trying to launch WoW, it crashes trying to launch Borderlands games. Sometimes it locks up the computer entirely. I've re-installed the Nvidia drivers and tried rolling back to the previous version as well as a couple of other things. No improvement. reply August 27, 2016 | 03:06 AM - Posted by quest4glory It may not be for everyone, but for people with a lot of Facebook friends, that's a built-in audience of potential viewership. The big accounts - that's where the real benefit comes in. reply August 27, 2016 | 01:06 AM - Posted by phillychuck Another useless streaming service. If anyone had a shot it would have been You Tube gaming, but that thing is terrible. I've avoided Facebook for almost 2 years now, just have a dummy account for looking at links people send me. reply August 27, 2016 | 03:11 AM - Posted by Branthog No. Not facebook. reply August 27, 2016 | 01:53 PM - Posted by NamelessTed I guess its good to see Blizzard putting some amount of effort into streaming. It shows that they are at least aware of it and are doing something to cater towards it. But Facebook? Really? I guess its better to do something different than try to implement half the features that OBS or Xsplit already has. People streaming on Twitch using real streaming software are just going to continue using that. Blizzard just can't compete with all of those features. The big wonder is whether somebody could continue doing their Twitch stream and just add Facebook if it doesn't take many more resources, but upload speed would be a major factor in that. reply August 29, 2016 | 12:50 AM - Posted by quest4glory Facebook is probably paying them. reply August 29, 2016 | 03:59 AM - Posted by Nev (not verified) Scott please ease up on the "That said" throw away line. It adds precious little to anything and you use it way too often. reply Post new comment Your name: * E-mail: * The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 28 August 2016 Hongkongers are living large in tiny homes Tiny home: In Hong Kong, it’s common to have tiny apartments that are among the smallest in the world in terms of living space per occupant. — South Morning China Post MOST Hongkongers live in tiny apartments that are among the smallest in the world in terms of living space per occupant. All praise to the shoebox dwellers. We’ve learned to be creative with regards to our domestic arrangements ­– and even those who have, by choice, downsized into more compact digs are reaping the benefits. A couple for whom Hong Kong architectural firm LAAB Architecture redesigned a tiny Central flat say they are as snug as a bug in a rug in their 309 sq ft (28 sq metres) microhome ­ – dubbed Small Home Smart Home. They can live comfortably, entertain and even accommodate a family of “fur” children (their three cats), and the occasional overnight guest. Otto Ng, LAAB’s design director, says that with 50% of the world’s population living in cities, people are beginning to appreciate the advantages of living closely together – such as more job opportunities, a better social life, and the convenience of travelling shorter distances to work and places of interest. “Not until you’ve moved into a small apartment do you realise that you do not need to live in a giant house, because you own the city as your living room,” Ng says. Every detail of Small Home Smart Home was bespoke to fit the owners’ lifestyle, he adds. Its layout is convertible, adapting to the needs of the moment. A second tier of seating acts as a home cinema when groups of friends arrive; a bathtub “disappears” behind a screen; and the floor conceals handy storage compartments. The home even incorporates a full-sized kitchen. And it’s thoroughly organised, which the designer says is critical for keeping a space the size of a hotel room looking fresh and tidy. Ng considers the “smart home” a term for the new living culture, which entails “living smarter in a compact space, living greener in a comfortable environment, and living together in a shared home”, he says. Small but cosy: Hongkongers have become really creative in making tiny spaces ‘big’. — South Morning China Post  Smart technologies have a role, too. The design of the Small Home Smart Home incorporates a range of app-controlled smart-home technologies, such as Philips Hue light bulbs, which slowly brighten to gently rouse the sleeping couple each morning, and an August smart-door lock, which makes it possible for an electronic key to be sent, for example, to the cat-carer’s smartphone, allowing access to the home while the owners are away. Indeed, especially in a small home, technology is your friend. Intel created the Smart Tiny House to show what this might look like. A microapartment of just 24.5 sq metres, it allows the resident to control all of the home’s systems remotely from a single tablet app: just swipe to adjust the thermostat, change the colour and brightness of the lighting, and open the door for a repairman while you’re away. There’s facial recognition security at the door and sensors which can detect and alert you to maintenance issues. All this is achieved wirelessly, with cables neatly concealed in the walls. Various websites and blogs extol the virtues of living with less. According to Living Well Spending Less, the money saved on household running costs frees up cash to spend on things that you really want. Housework is halved, and it’s easier to do small jobs, such as painting, yourself. On Zero Waste Home, blogger Bea Johnson reveals that her family’s bonds are closer since they moved from an American mansion to a home half the size. She’s also proud of the fact that, by using fewer resources, the family is treading more lightly on the planet. As Shrink That Footprint points out, living small lowers heating and cooling usage, needs fewer furnishings, takes less time to maintain and requires less work to fund. — South China Morning Post Tags / Keywords: small apartments hong kong You May Be Interested Man uses fake gun in mahjong parlour robbery, hoping to evade a debt by going to jail Chinese firemen pose for fiery photo calendar Doubles 'goddess' Goh is now single Another viral video of another Ipoh 'daredevil' Traffic crawl along major highways Quality homes below RM400k Others Also Read Bubu waiting to greet travellers during Visit Sibu Year Analysts negative on Felda deal Fund Managers' pick advertisement Latest News Floods worsen in Kelantan, number of evacuees rises to 3,774 At least 50 killed in Brazil prison riot - Globo Four rivers in Terengganu exceed alert level U.S. House Republicans weaken ethics body as they return to Congress South Korea pushes for extradition of daughter of President Park's friend Most Viewed in News Eight-year courtship ends for Goh Terror ride for Grab driver Doubles 'goddess' Goh is now single A loan with just one phone call Malay boy only Year One pupil in Tamil school Man falls to his death at UMMC How gruesome photos on a memory stick revealed identity of killer who died days after victim Traffic crawl along major highways Two married women among 30 held for khalwat Tourists burned by Thai full moon party pyrotechnics Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

An estimated one million workers were unemployed in the second quarter, up 16,400 against the previous quarter, the highest unemployment level in recent years, said Dao Quang Vinh from the Ministry of Labour. Mr Vinh, who heads up The Institute of Labour Science and Social Affairs, noted incomes also deteriorated for the quarter with the average monthly wages falling by US$10 (VND230,000) to US$210 (VND4.85 million). The drop in jobs and wages comes as the country’s economy has started to show signs of slipping, with the Ministry of Planning and Investment saying that GDP growth could come in at 6.27% for 2016 after a first half at around 5.5%. That slip reflects in part, said Mr Vinh, a sluggish mining industry, which covers offshore fossil fuel exploration. The government is now eyeing a boost in exploration for crude oil and natural gas, volumes of which fell in the first half of the year due to falling crude oil prices. Mining overall lost 2.2% in growth in the first half of 2016. Vietnam with its 91.7 million people strong population has built economic growth, which reached a seven-year high of 6.7% in 2015, said Mr Vinh, mainly on opening of the gates to export manufacturing. Factories have been invested by tech high-giants such as Hon Hai Precision, Intel and Samsung who have joined with more traditional plants pumping out fabrics, furniture and auto parts. These factories are hardly going away, he said, as its pretty much understood by everyone that the economy in general and manufacturing in particular is on a sound and sustainable future. As jobs move from agriculture to manufacturing, a slowdown is fully expected, but the slowdown (growth and jobs) in mining and farming dwarf in their contribution to the economy when compared to manufacturing. Dao Quang Vinh said the rising unemployment figures are attributable to a skills mismatch between training and market demand – excessive numbers in some areas such as business management and economics, but a shortage in technological and technical engineers. The figures showed 39% of those unemployed in the second quarter were well-educated, with over half of them possessing either junior college or full university degrees. The number of unemployed young living in metropolitan areas was 11.3% of the total, while in rural areas it was 5.24%. Long-term unemployed – those registered as out of work for more than a year – stood at 22.6%. We expect the labour market to deteriorate further with unemployment rising another 2% during the late months of the year, said Mr Vinh, which is fully to be expected and no cause for alarm as the economy shifts to a more industrial base.      related news Labour demand grows in HCM City Unemployment rate increases slightly in first three months Who is to blame for the high rate of unemployed university graduates?

However, since the new software is already the seventh beta, it is not expected to come with new features or anything big for that matter. According to Cult of Mac, Apple rolled out two new beta software this Friday — the eighth beta of iOS 10 and the seventh beta of tvOS 10. The site noted that though both betas do not have release notes yet, it is unlikely for both to “add anything big” to the previously revealed features of the full updates that have been leaked by the previous betas. Apple’s upcoming OS for its Apple TV is said to come with major upgrades, like the introduction of Dark Mode and the inclusion of Single Sign-on, HomeKit, an enhanced Siri and a new UI for the Music Apple Music, among others. The new Dark Mode settings option is said to offer an enhanced visual experience in darker rooms, while Single Sign-on enables users to sign in once to authenticate cable credentials of all cable-supported apps, as per MacRumors. Related Stories Why Apple Is 'Likely' To Use Intel Chips In Future iOS Devices HomeKit, which is Apple's application for home automation, is said to have been enhanced with more options, so users can manage more HomeKit accessories. In addition, Siri will get more language support and its topic-based search capabilities have been expanded. As for the new implementations within the Music app, 9To5Mac has learned that the Apple Music is getting a new user interface and a Library view that is inspired by the iPod Classic’s UI. To install the new tvOS 10 beta, first-time users are advised to look for the software on Apple’s Developer Center. On the other hand, developers and testers who are already enrolled in the beta testing program can get the update by just clicking on their devices’ Software Update section. It is also worth noting that the installation of the seventh tvOS 10 beta requires the connection of the Apple TV to a computer using a USB-C to USB-A cable. The upcoming tvOS 10 was announced in June at the 2016 Worldwide Developers Conference, and it is slated to be released sometime this fall.

Unfortunately, some users are complaining about an error that would not allow them to access the new beta software. On Friday,  the Cupertino giant released the eighth beta of iOS 10 to developers and the seventh beta of the new mobile OS to public beta testers. The new build for developers is identified as 14A5346a, while the build for public testers is named 14T5329a. Unlike the previous beta releases, however, the newest iOS 10 beta seems to have a shaky rollout, with Apple Insider reporting that the update was met with complaints from users — possibly both developers and public beta testers — claiming that the software could not be found and that their devices alerted them that they were “Unable to Check for Update.” Related Stories Why Apple Is 'Likely' To Use Intel Chips In Future iOS Devices It isn’t clear if the issue has already been addressed as of writing. Nonetheless, Friday’s release is expected to fix certain bugs and issues found in the previous beta versions released by Apple — the same thing that the seventh developer beta came with. The release of the new iOS 10 beta actually hints at the imminent release of the official mobile OS this fall. Per MacRumors, the iOS 10 is a major OS update that should come with new features, like 3D Touch-enabled notifications, a new widgets screen, an overhauled Messages app, an enhanced Photos app and a redesigned Control Center, among many others. MacRumors also stated that the eighth beta of iOS 10 could be the final beta version prior the planned announcement of the iOS 10 this fall. The golden master of iOS 10 is expected to be launched the same day as the public unveiling of Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple is also scheduled to launch and release the watchOS 3, macOS Sierra and tvOS 10 sometime this fall. Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

That's some serious value there! Almost half price of other equivalent capacity NVME SSD's. The write could been a bit better but oh well. I would love that 1TB version.

For the 128 GB is understandable, but the same for a 1 TB model, that is bad... That's a good catch. They also have full capacity, which means that there is not secret space (like 120GB/240GB SSDs have), where you get more write redundancy.     PrMinisterGR View Public Profile Find all posts by PrMinisterGR   (#12) sykozis Ancient Guru     Videocard: XFX RX 470 Processor: Core i5 6600K Mainboard: MSI Z170A Gaming Pro Memory: Corsair DDR4-2666 Soundcard: Creative SB-Z PSU: Corsair CX750M 08-27-2016, 05:39 | posts: 19,702 | Location: US East Coast The write speeds aren't impressive at all....     sykozis View Public Profile Find all posts by sykozis   (#13) sverek Maha Guru     Videocard: MSI GTX970 4G Processor: i5 2500k Mainboard: P8Z68-V Memory: Corsair Ven. 8GB Soundcard: XonarDG+HD595 PSU: Corsair HX850 08-27-2016, 07:55 | posts: 2,275 | Location: Chiba, Japan Quote: Originally Posted by sykozis The write speeds aren't impressive at all....

If true, it would mean if you have a miserly 50W to spare on your power supply you could hypothetically run 500 1 TB drives active as in reading and writing simultaenously and still be okay.     thatguy91 View Public Profile Find all posts by thatguy91   (#18) Koniakki Maha Guru     Videocard: Palit GTX 1080 GameRock Processor: Intel i7 6700k@4.7G's Mainboard: ASUS ROG Maximus 8 Hero Memory: GSkill TRDZ 3733CL15 32GB Soundcard: MB SPDIF-OUT PSU: CORSAIR RMx 750W GOLD 08-27-2016, 11:35 | posts: 2,095 | Location: Inside My Thoughts.. Quote: Originally Posted by fry178 @Pictus most long term use will see chips failing first, because of age, not write cycles. even for cheap consumer ssds... True. My Sammy 950 is about 6-7 months old and used as my main drive and I have written just 3.07TB so far. I haven't of course been doing anything taxing so I assume others should be higher but still that's like 10-12 years for that 72TBW based on my usage. So for "normal" use that Intel's TBW seems good enough. Still a catch tho compared to the other drivers but not a bad one.     Koniakki View Public Profile Find all posts by Koniakki Is it possible to do RAID 0 with 2 x 600p NVMe SSDs   (#19) dfsdfs1112 Newbie   Videocard: 480 Processor: AMD Phenom Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: good Is it possible to do RAID 0 with 2 x 600p NVMe SSDs - 08-27-2016, 14:21 | posts: 6 Is it possible to do RAID 0 with 2 x 600p NVMe SSDs     dfsdfs1112 View Public Profile Find all posts by dfsdfs1112   (#20) Anarion Ancient Guru     Videocard: EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 ACX Processor: Intel Core i7 3770K Mainboard: ASUS P8Z77-V Memory: G.SKILL RipjawsX 16 GB Soundcard: Sound Blaster Zx + HD 595 PSU: Corsair AX760 08-27-2016, 14:31 | posts: 12,666 | Location: Finland Quote: Originally Posted by Koniakki True.

The drive will be obsolete long before it fails due to write cycles. I'd venture to say the average consumer is writing less than 5TB per year.....giving this drive a 14.4 year life span. How many people keep a drive that long? Most of us don't keep a harddrive longer than 5 years. There's a higher risk of circuit failure than there is NAND failure during it's usable life span.     sykozis View Public Profile Find all posts by sykozis   (#23) Pictus Newbie     Videocard: R9 280x 3GB Processor: i5-750 Mainboard: Gigabyte P55a-UD3 Memory: 16 GB Soundcard: PSU: Corsair 750 08-28-2016, 00:09 | posts: 44 Quote: Originally Posted by slyphnier from where you get those rated endurance ?

You have to think. I have an Intel X25-M 160GB drive that I bought new in 2009 for $550 and it's seen daily use. I'd call it average use, no video or photo editing. I have 18.3TB lifetime host writes on the drive. 72TB is more than enough for the average Joe Shmoe on this site that plays games and browses the internet. It would only be a concern if your job entails video/photo/3D editing. Speeds are good too, removing the SATA bottleneck is big. Writing that 1TB drive 72 times over to completion just won't happen, it will probably die first and I'd be surprised if its lifespan is as long as this X25-M. This drive is a no brainer for everyone except heavy content creators who do it for their day job.
