By: Steven Bassiri | Touchscreen Laptops in Laptops | Posted: 4 days, 9 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 94%Manufacturer: Lenovo Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Physical Overview] Page 3 [Physical Overview Continued] Page 4 [Software and BIOS] Page 5 [System Performance Benchmarks] Page 6 [System IO and Battery Performance] Page 7 [Thermal Performance] Page 8 [What's Hot, What's Not & Final Thoughts] Introduction     Just like the Dell XPS 13 I reviewed a week ago, the Lenovo Yoga 910 is a 13-inch laptop equipped with the latest Intel mobile processor series; Kaby Lake. Both devices use the same i7-7500U CPU, but apart from that, they are much different devices. The latest Intel microarchitecture brings to the table many enhancements in the CPU's integrated graphics core; one of those is much better 4K support. Lenovo offers the Yoga 910 with both 1080p and 4K panels and is one of the first notebooks capable of streaming Netflix in 4K. The Yoga 910 is also a 2-in-1 notebook, meaning it can act as a laptop, flip 360 degrees into tablet mode, or even sit up like a tent.     Kaby Lake might be up in the air when it comes to desktop level improvements, but in the mobile arena, it does bring in bigger integrated graphics muscle. If you suffer from FOBO (fear of better options), I would say it is safe to upgrade your mobile device now to one with an Intel 7th Generation Core processor. Luckily, almost all major vendors are on board with refreshed models, and competition is fierce.   Let's see what the Yoga 910 has to offer.     Specifications     Our configuration uses an i7-7500U, 8GB of DDR4, Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A 2x2 Wireless AC/BT 4.1, a 13.9" 1920x1080 300-nit IPS display, Samsung PM951 256GB M.2 NVMe SSD, 720p 1MP camera, fingerprint sensor, and a 78Wh battery. It weighs in at 3.04lbs and is 12.72x8.84x0.56" WxDxH. It has one of the biggest batteries in its class and a screen that is almost 14".   Regarding connectivity, you get one USB 3.0 type-A (normal) port, a USB 3.0 type-C port (that supports DisplayPort functionality), and a USB 2.0 type-C port that acts as a charging port. It doesn't have Thunderbolt 3 support, which should lower its price tag.     The i7-7500U has a base frequency of 2.7GHz with a 3.5GHz Turbo and operates at a 15W TDP which can be configured up or down by the vendor (Lenovo). While Dell used slightly faster DDR3 memory, Lenovo opted to use DDR4, which offers higher density and increased power savings.   The difference in performance should be negligible between the XPS 13 and Yoga 910 in real life, but benchmarks will show how the RAM choices, power limitations, and screen selection will affect scores and battery life.     Pricing   The Yoga 910 starts at $1,179.99; our configuration is the base configuration.

McIntyre December 29, 2016 7:35 am EST Print Email Tweet Most of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average have risen by double-digit percentages this year. Five are up over 30%. These double-digit stocks have helped push the Dow up almost 13% this year to 19,833. However, these five stocks will keep it from topping 20,000. Pfizer Even though the huge pharmaceutical company raised its dividend by 7%, it has disappointed investors with three quarters of poor guidance. In its most recently reported quarter, at $0.61 per share, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) missed Wall Street earnings estimates by two cents. Looking forward, management was more pessimistic than expected. Pfizer chopped its earnings forecast for the year from a range of $2.38 to $2.48 per share to a new range of $2.38 to $2.43. Whatever rally the Dow stages, Pfizer will be a boat anchor. Investors have no reason to believe its prospects will improve until early next year, if at all. Coca-Cola Coke’s old CEO is out and another Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) executive is in. That probably has little to do with Coke’s major problems, which will not be easy to solve. The first is a relentless drum beat from health experts about the dangers of sugar. As obesity and diabetes grow across most of the developed world, the old snacks are being replaced by healthier foods. In the emerging markets, slowing economies may undermine consumer spending. Coke has few large markets to turn to for growth. Intel This huge chip company restructured early this year. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) plans to fire 12,000 people, which is over 10% of its global workforce. More recently, it let go the employees from its wearable division. Intel has shrinking opportunities as it moves away from the low-end PC chip market and toward mobile and server markets, which are already awash in competition from firms that have been in those businesses for years. Note that chip maker and rival NVIDIA is among the S&P 500 stocks that are up the most so far this year. Apple Between fights with the European Union over billions of dollars in taxes and worry that the iPhone 7 will not have a holiday home run, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has reached a near-term cap. In addition, its offshore manufacturing has been a perfect target for President-elect Trump’s plans to punish American companies with workforces or supplier workforces that are largely overseas. There is also a growing body of evidence that Apple is struggling in China, largely because of competition from local mobile companies Huawei, OPPO and Xiaomi. CEO Tim Cook says Apple’s success hinges on sales in China. General Electric The world’s largest conglomerate has failed at a series of reinventions, one of the biggest of which is a recent plan to move away from the financial services business that nearly swamped General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) during the financial crisis. Management recently backed its guidance for the year ahead. And the company plans to sell its water business and part of its industrial division. GE’s aviation business worries investors as the market for large commercial planes slows. GE’s mining and drilling infrastructure operations have a limited future, unless oil exploration and commodities metals prices have a large bounce back.

In the first nine months of the year Israeli high-tech companies raised a total of $4 billion in 510 deals, 27 percent above the $3.15 billion raised in 491 deals in the first nine months of 2015, and only 7% below 2015’s record of $4.3 billion, data provided by IVC Research shows. Fifty-seven percent of these deals included at least one foreign VC investor. And while the IPO market stalled this year as fewer companies sought to raise money on the financial markets, merger and acquisition deals abounded, with investors buying Israeli companies and Israeli companies buying local and foreign companies. The election of Donald Trump has injected a degree of uncertainty into the market’s prospects, and there are some concerns that his policies may give “less tailwind to globalization,” making investments by US funds and corporations in foreign markets less attractive, according to PwC’s Liat Enzel Aviel. It is clear, however, that Israel’s tech industry will continue to be on the global map — both for local R&D activity and company acquisitions, to help multinationals stay ahead of the competitive game. A delegation of Chinese CEOs and businesspeople visiting Israel. November 22, 2016. (Courtesy) Chinese investors, who flocked to Israel in 2016 to snap up technologies and learn about the startup ecosystem, will continue to play a key role, with the pace of Chinese investment rising next year as well, said Haggai Ravid, CEO of Cukierman Investment House. And even if there are some new restrictions on money transfers and on the purchase price Chinese companies can pay, “it is unclear at this stage whether these regulations will slow the flow of investments.” Ran Senderovitz, Vice President, General Manager- Intel Israel Development Centers (Courtesy Intel) In the past four years alone Chinese investors have invested over $15 billion in Israeli companies, data provided by the Catalyst Fund Research 2016 shows. The cloud, increased connectivity, “smart” items, cybersecurity and self-driving cars will continue to dominate Israel’s high tech scene in 2017, said Ran Senderovitz, vice president, general manager at Intel Israel Development Centers. “We are moving fast to a world where everything connects — and a big amount of data is moving to the cloud,” he said in an email. “This trend of an uber-connected world — with all of its challenges and opportunities, is going to continue to positively disrupt the way we experience the world.” An Intel drone (Courtesy Intel) In this world where everything computes and connects, Israel can leverage three key talent pools, he said, to stay ahead of the game: its computing power, for example in Intel’s Israeli teams; its communication engineers, grown out of the universities and the army; and its proven prowess in cybersecurity. Cybersecurity and security, fintech, the Internet of Things (IoT) and automotive technologies will be among the trends that will lead Israeli industry going forward, Yoram Yaacovi, the general manager of Microsoft Israel R&D Center, recently told the IATI’s annual multinational R&D Centers conference in Tel Aviv. All of Microsoft’s cyber work is done in Israel, he said, with some 20% of global investments in the security sector flowing into the country. “Microsoft wants to invest in areas in which Israel is strong,” he said. As vehicles go high-tech, Israel, which has expertise in security, communications, machine learning and IoT, can be in the driver seat, enjoying “unparalleled dominance” in a field it played no part in until recently, Yaacovi said. There are around 150 startups and research groups active today in Israel in the automotive ecosystem, he said, up 100% from 2013. As vehicles go high-tech, Israel can be in the driver seat. Image of a self-driving car (Courtesy Intel) “Every industry is going through the digital transformation. It changes our economies, society and environment,” said Orna Kleinmann, managing director of SAP Labs Israel, in an email message. Three-dimensional printing will continue to disrupt manufacturing and product development; bots, smart personal assistants and augmented and virtual reality are changing the user experience; and cybersecurity threats are growing, leading to smarter solutions led by big data and machine learning advances, she said. Orna Kleinmann, managing director of SAP Labs Israel (Courtesy) “Israel is well positioned for these trends, taking the lead in security, machine learning and natural language processing,” she said, alongside its leadership in big data technologies and IoT. But greater digitalization also means greater challenges, leading to the need for more safety and collaborations. “How do we protect our digital lives, how do we mobilize the huge amount of data to the cloud?” asked Intel’s Senderovitz. “The markets are driving for economy of scale — and it is harder to be a single point of technology in this space — companies need to collaborate more than ever.” Start innovators young One of the greatest hurdles that faces Israel’s high tech scene is its shortage of skilled manpower, Senderovitz and SAP’s Kleinmann said. “We definitely see a challenge here. There is growing competition for top talent, and candidates have more demands — and more options,” said Kleinmann. “It is very clear that we are now lacking more qualified engineers — and with the flow of innovation and exploration taking place, this is going to impair the ability of Israel to grow its impact,” Senderovitz said. The government must improve science and math education, and help the universities increase their capacity. Yuval Matalon – eBay Israel General Manager (Courtesy) “If we don’t do a good job investing in the Z generation now and drive them to select technology majors and become our future innovators, researchers and engineers, we will find that the lack of talent will grow and hinder us from advancing as fast as we need to,” said Yuval Matalon, eBay Israel general manager. “There needs to be more investment in good teachers for the young grades who are able to encourage and drive kids that have a technical orientation to choose science and math as they grow, and motivate them to become entrepreneurs and innovators at a young age.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Israeli startups,  Intel Israel,  eBay,  Orna Kleinmann,  SAP Labs Israel,  PWC 2016 M&A report,  IVC Research Center,  Haggai Ravid,  Ran Senderovitz,  Cukierman & Co More in Israel Inside Immigration to Israel slumps as French influx tapers off Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Start-Up Israel Current top stories Israel’s Behalf uses algorithms to vet for credit By Shoshanna Solomon   Israeli biotechnology startup Nurami Medical raises NIS 2.5m By Luke Tress   US-Israel citizens in a tizz over new kids’ savings plan By Shoshanna Solomon   ‘Virtual breathalyzer’ lets you check if you’re over the limit By Times of Israel staff   Israel M&A activity surged 34% to $16.8b in 2016 — PwC By Shoshanna Solomon   Start-Up Israel Blogs January 2, 2017, 12:38 pm Israel Up and Down Two pieces of economic news came out of Israel recently showing both the ups and downs of......

The Top GNU News Of 2016: Hurd, Libreboot, GCC, GRUB Written by Michael Larabel in GNU on 29 December 2016 at 06:30 AM EST. Add A Comment Continuing in our various annual recaps this week as we end out 2016, here is a look at the most popular GNU/FSF news of the year. This year saw updates to GNU Hurd, the successful GCC 6 release, the GNU Compiler Collection 7 marching along for its release in a few months, the drama over Libreboot, Glibc updates, and over one hundred new GNU program updates/releases. Here's a look at the GNU happenings that topped 2016 by popularity on Phoronix: Libreboot Leaves The GNU, The Free Software Foundation Denounced It was only in May that Libreboot became an official GNU project but now this free software Coreboot downstream has parted ways. FSF, RMS Issue Statements Over Libreboot's Accusations Thursday night we wrote about Libreboot leaving the GNU and denouncing the GNU and FSF with rather harsh words. That thread generated more than 120 comments with differing views while now the Free Software Foundation issued a statement as well as Richard M Stallman. GCC Might Finally Drop The GNU Compiler For Java (GCJ) The GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) while made a lot of progress in its early years as a free software Java compiler, in recent years it's basically been in maintenance mode and might now be removed entirely from GCC. FSF Issues Fresh Statement Over ZFS On Linux With GPL Enforcement The Free Software Foundation has issued a fresh statement today concerning the recent ZFS file-system efforts on Linux, driven in large part by Canonical's plans for shipping ZFS support in Ubuntu 16.04. Developer Warns Of "Uncorrectable Freedom & Security Issues" For x86 A developer long involved in Coreboot/Libreboot development is trying to call attention to "uncorrectable freedom and security issues" on x86 platforms with nearly all post-2009 Intel systems and post-2013 AMD systems. FSF Issues Statement Against Intel's Management Engine (ME) The Free Software Foundation is a bit late to the party, but have finally come out publicly against Intel's Management Engine (ME). GNU Taler 0.0.0 Released: GNU Tries To Get Into Electronic Payments GNU Taler "v0.0.0" was announced today as the initial alpha release of this project aiming to be a free software electronic payment system but so far just fits alongside some of the other obscure or early-on GNU projects. GNU Hurd Is Working On Sound Support, Still Lacks 64-bit & Good USB Support One year ago was a status update on GNU Hurd where it was mentioned that GNU Hurd lacks 64-bit, audio, and USB support among other features for this micro-kernel free software project alternative to the Linux kernel. Sound support for Hurd is now in the works, but other features remain missing. GCC Compiler Finishes Nuking Java Support (GCJ) The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is finishing up the removal of Java / GCJ support ahead of next year's GCC 7 release. There Are Many Features Coming For GRUB 2.02 After writing yesterday about F2FS support being worked on for GRUB2, I decided to explore what features are coming for their GRUB 2.02 release. GNU Bash 4.4 Released With Wide Variety Of Changes GNU Bash 4.4 was released today with a wide variety of new features and changes. Libgcrypt 1.7 Adds New Algorithms, Performance Improvements Werner Koch announced the release today of libgcrypt 1.7, a major update to this general cryptographic library. GNU Rates GitHub & SourceForge With "F" Ratings The Free Software Foundation today announced their evaluations of major code repository-hosting services per the standards of the GNU Ethical Criteria for Code Repositories. The Free Software Foundation Is Trying To Figure Out Its Future The Free Software Foundation is more than 30 years old now and in charting a potential new course for the organization, they are looking for your help by filling out a survey. Gneural Network: GNU Gets Into Programmable Neural Networks The inaugural release of Gneural Network is now available, a new GNU Project to implement programmable neural networks. Libgcrypt/GnuPG Hit By Critical Security Problem Since 1998 Werner Koch today publicly announced that Libgcrypt and GnuPG have a "critical security problem" with all versions released prior to today and it affects all platforms. Recapping The New Features Of GCC 6: OpenMP 4.5, HSA, C++14, AMD Zen & More As GCC 6 should be officially released soon, here's a quick overview of the improvements and new features for this yearly free software compiler update. Libreboot, Coreboot Downstream, Becomes A GNU Project Libreboot, the downstream of Coreboot that doesn't permit any closed-source microcode/firmware blobs as part of the hardware initialization process for this alternative to proprietary BIOS/UEFI, has become an official GNU project. GNU C Library 2.24 Released Glibc 2.24 was released today as the newest version of the GNU C Library. GCC 5.4 Compiler Released, Fixed 147+ Bugs Version 5.4 of the GNU Compiler Collection is now available.

Credit: Lenovo More like this The next MacBook Pro could sport Intel's new 3D XPoint SSD Intel claims storage supremacy with swift 3D XPoint Optane drives, 1-petabyte... 10 key things to know about Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs Video Container Explainer Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 is a loaded laptop that boasts a range of whiz-bang technologies, but the ability to run Intel's secretive Optane memory stands out. When it ships in March, the T570 will be ready to run Intel's Optane, a new class of memory and storage that promises to be significantly faster than today's SSDs and DRAM. The T570 is the first laptop announced with support for Optane. Intel has not said when it will ship Optane memory, but the T570 has the hooks to support the technology. [ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] The T570 also can be configured with a 4K touch display, Nvidia's GeForce 940MX discrete graphics and up to 32GB of DRAM. The laptop is targeted at business users, but it could be a dream machine for enthusiasts. The 15.6-inch laptop will be available starting at $909 in March. It will have Intel's latest 7th Generation Core chips, code-named Kaby Lake. Intel will sell Optane -- which is based on technology called 3D Xpoint -- in the form of SSDs and DRAM modules. Intel has shown Optane SSDs running 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. But Optane isn't yet ready for prime time, as indicated by a closer look into the specification sheet for the T570 provided by Lenovo. It will serve mainly as secondary storage and for caching in the laptop. The Optane PCIe M.2 2242-S3 memory, which will be optional in the T570, will have a capacity of just 16GB; it will not act as primary storage, but as temporary storage to speed up applications and games. Windows 10 PCs with Optane could boot up at lightning-fast speeds. In a way, the early Optane memory could reflect the way SSDs, which are faster than hard drives, were first used for caching in laptops. The SSDs had low storage capacity, and served as temporary storage to speed up PC boot and application load times.  Optane could be useful in gaming, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said last year. Parts of  games can be preloaded on Optane, and that could provide for a much faster gaming experience. The T570 can also be configured with a 2TB hard-drive or 1TB SSD storage. The ThinkPad T570 will weigh about 2.04 kilograms. It will have Thunderbolt 3 and HDMI ports, in addition to two USB 3.0 slots. It will have 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and can be configured with Qualcomm's Snapdragon LTE modem. To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter.

Moreover, some models will now be offered with up to 16GB of lightning-quick Intel Optane 3D drives.

Now speculated for a possible Q1 2017 launch instead, Microsoft would have a couple more months to polish up and work out all the kinks in its upcoming enterprise-grade hybrid device before its release. Considering that the Surface Pro 5 will be entering the market a bit later than expected, it would need to have a number of notable features to make it truly stand out from the competition. Fortunately, this seems to be the case. The enterprise-grade hybrid device market has been quite saturated lately, especially with the launch of Apple’s most recent powerhouse machine, the revamped 2016 MacBook Pro, as well as the upcoming release of its own hybrid device, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2. From what could be determined from recent Surface Pro 5 rumors, however, it appears like Microsoft has a few aces up its sleeve. Here are some killer features that have the capability to make the Surface Pro 5 into the hybrid device to beat in 2017. Intel Kaby Lake Processor By moving the Surface Pro 5’s release date to Q1 2017, Microsoft has managed to ensure that its next enterprise-grade hybrid device would be equipped with Intel’s most advanced and most powerful processor on the market. Being Intel’s last 14nm chip, Kaby Lake processors provide a significant performance boost over its 6th generation Skylake chips, according to Tech Radar. So far, Apple’s most powerful and updated laptops, the MacBook Pro 2016, are equipped with 6th-gen Intel Skylake processors. This means that once the Surface Pro 5 enters the market, it would inherently have a more powerful chipset than one of its biggest rivals. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] The Surface line has managed to make a reputation for itself by being hybrid devices that offer uncompromising performance to its users. This is one of the main reasons why the Surface Pro 4, the Pro 5’s predecessor, became such a huge hit. While the machine was sleek and extremely portable, it was nonetheless a powerhouse device capable of performing desktop-grade tasks without any problems. With the Surface Pro 5, Microsoft could easily do this again, and if it does, the SP5 would surely be one of the devices to beat in 2017, at least in terms of raw power. eSIM Technology/LTE Connectivity One thing that the Surface line of devices has always lagged in is cellular connectivity. While Surface devices are extremely potent when connected to the internet, the fact that they are unable to take advantage of mobile data computing is something that has always been an Achilles Heel of the entire line. In fact, LTE connectivity is exactly where the Surface Pro line has lagged against its competition, such as the iPad Pro and even Google’s marginally successful Pixel C tablet. If rumors are to be believed, however, the Surface Pro 5 is set to change all of this. Popular German Microsoft blog Dr. Windows recently published a report stating that the Surface Pro 5 might be the tech giant’s fist hybrid device to feature eSIM technology. This means that for the first time since the Surface line was introduced, it would finally have a device that is capable of connecting to the internet on its own without being dependent on Wi-Fi or mobile hotspots. Unsurprisingly, the idea of the Surface Pro 5 having LTE connectivity has been welcomed very warmly by Microsoft fans, with many stating that cellular capabilities might very well be the upcoming device’s true killer feature. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] Free And Improved Accessories Hybrid devices such as the Surface Pro 5 are capable of optimum performance once linked to their respective accessories. For the Surface line, these come in the form of a dedicated Surface Pen and a keyboard case. With these accessories, the hybrid device becomes what it really is designed to be – a portable powerhouse machine capable of desktop-grade computing. While these accessories are great, however, the fact that they do not come with the initial product is something that is extremely inconvenient for users. Thus, with the Surface Pro 5, Microsoft would have the chance to fully address this issue. While unconfirmed, speculations have emerged over the last few months stating that the Surface Pro 5 might come with a higher price than its predecessors. Apart from this, rumors have also stated that that upcoming hybrid device would come with the Surface Pen and the keyboard cover out of the box. Doing so would raise the price of the Surface Pro 5 significantly, but considering what consumers would be getting, most users would likely deem the additional price for the device worth it. The Surface Pro 5 is Microsoft’s chance to establish itself as a leader in the enterprise-grade hybrid device market. Though the competition is fierce, the momentum the built up by the Surface Pro 4 and its predecessors has established a pretty good starting point for the upcoming power device. If Microsoft plays its cards just right and equips the hybrid machine with these rumored killer features, the Surface Pro 5 might very be hailed as the machine to beat in 2017, despite strong competition from rivals in the enterprise-grade mobile industry.

Business Home LBoard DAP: Fuel price hike shows BN confident of election win Richard T.W. Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US South Korea fines Qualcomm $854 million for violating competition laws Reuters | December 29, 2016 "We investigated and decided on these actions because Qualcomm's actions limit overall competition," Shin said, adding that the ruling was not about protecting domestic companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS). SEOUL: South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales, a decision the U.S. chipmaker said it will challenge in court. The fine, the largest ever levied in South Korea, marks the latest antitrust setback for Qualcomm’s most profitable business of licensing wireless patents to the mobile industry, at a time when the business is facing headwinds from a cooling smartphone market. Shares in Qualcomm fell 1.7 percent on Nasdaq. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled on Wednesday Qualcomm abused its dominant market position and forced handset makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips. Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chipmakers such as Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and MediaTek Inc (2454.TW), the regulator said, hindering their sales and leaving their products vulnerable to lawsuits. The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers if requested — measures that would affect the U.S. firm’s dealings with major tech companies including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Intel, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] if upheld. The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm’s practices in 2014 following complaints from industry participants, but did not name specific companies. Foreign companies including Apple, Intel, MediaTek and Huawei expressed their views during the regulator’s deliberation process, KFTC Secretary General Shin Young-son told a media briefing in the country’s administrative capital. “We investigated and decided on these actions because Qualcomm’s actions limit overall competition,” Shin said, adding that the ruling was not about protecting domestic companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS). Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it. “Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision,” it said in a statement. The decision in Seoul could mean lower costs for mobile phone makers and others in the tech supply chain who source Qualcomm chips, said a Taiwanese industry executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. IN REGULATORY CROSSHAIRS The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC’s orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker. A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones. The dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts, he said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips, which were then used in handsets made by Samsung and LG. Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them. “Korea’s decision will serve as an important reference point for us,” Chiu Yung-ho, vice chairman and spokesman for Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters. He gave no timeline on when Taiwan’s own year-long investigation would be concluded. Even if the Korean decision sets a precedent for regulatory proceedings in other countries, Qualcomm’s move to purchase chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) for $38 billion cuts its reliance on mobile phones, said Bill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones. NXP takes Qualcomm into the fast-growing market for automotive chips and puts it into the chip manufacturing business. “The strategy of diversifying the company’s business lines may prove to be the most prudent strategy of all,” Kreher said. “Since Qualcomm has moved its dependence from royalties, further decisions from other countries such as the U.S. in the future would not impact the company much, relative to in the past.” Shares of Qualcomm were down $1.16 to $66.09 in early afternoon trade.

The three men, identified as Iat Hong, Bo Zheng and Chin Hung, are accused of targeting law firms that specialized in mergers and acquisitions and hacking their email servers to siphon off insider trading scoops. The three had targeted seven law firms in New York, and successfully breached two unnamed firms, Preet Bharara, the US district attorney for New York, said in a statement on Tuesday. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: You are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," Bharara said in the statement. The hackers were able to buy shares for cheap before anyone else knew how much they would shoot up in value from the acquisition, investigators said. Hong, Zheng and Hung looked to hack the lawyers who were helping these deals go through, according to the district attorney's office. That's how they were able to make $1.4 million off of Intel's $16.7 billion merger with Altera in March 2015, officials said. Hong, Zheng and Hung had accessed one of the law firm's web server as early as July 2014 through illegally obtained credentials of one of its employees and installed malware on the server, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The trio had a list of 11 partners at the law firm who could provide the most valuable information. The malware helped the three men allegedly steal about 2.8 gigabytes of insider trading information, including an email on January 29, 2015 that included the deal terms and the proposed price Altera would be purchased for by the chipmaker. On 26 occasions, the alleged thieves purchased shares of Altera stock, netting more than 210,000 shares before selling it for a $1.4 million profit. After Intel's acquisition, Altera's share price had jumped by $9, 26 percent more than what they bought it for. Between August 1 and August 9, 2014, the three men also stole more than 50 gigabytes of confidential details from that law firm's email server, prompting them to buy 18,000 shares of Intermune stock before the drug maker was sold to Roche AG -- netting the accused hackers $380,000 in profit. They did the same for another New York law firm, targeting the firm's mergers and acquisitions partners, and installing malware on the servers. They allegedly made $841,000 off Borderfree, an e-commerce company, after it was acquired by Pitney Bowes in 2015. The US district attorney's office said this happened on at least 10 other deals, all using information the three hackers allegedly stole from the two law firms. While they weren't successful in hacking into the other five law firms, the three are accused of attempting to breach the servers on more than 100,000 occasions. The three are also accused of hacking into rival robotics companies and stealing confidential designs from their email servers between April 2014 and late 2015. Zheng, Hong and Hung were involved in a start-up robotics company, according to the affidavit (PDF). The three face at least 50 years in prison for their 13 charges and are awaiting extradition for an appearance in January.

Lenovo has four new ThinkPad T-Series models in the pipeline – the T470, T470p, T470s and the T570 – as well as the budget-minded L470 / L570, the ThinkPad Yoga 370, the ThinkPad 13 and the ThinkPad X270. All new ThinkPads will be offered with Intel’s new Kaby Lake family of Core processors and Windows 10 pre-loaded with a Microsoft Signature Image that ensures a bloatware-free start right out of the box. Each system will also support Microsoft’s Windows Precision touchpad drivers which should enable a consistent experience across all ThinkPad devices. Select models like the ThinkPad T470 and the T570 can be configured with an Optane drive utilizing Intel’s highly anticipated XPoint technology. Easily the most intriguing aspect of the new machines, the Optane drives Lenovo is using feature a capacity of just 16GB. Looking back at a leaked Intel roadmap, we see that these drives are likely codenamed Stony Beach which Intel described as a system acceleration product. In other words, the first wave of Optane drives like the ones Lenovo is using will likely be used as a cache for slower yet larger storage devices. As the technology matures and prices come down, 3D XPoint-based drives will probably replace traditional SSDs, assuming of course that the tech is able to deliver on its performance promises and gains a large enough following. Other noteworthy features on select systems include touch fingerprint readers and IR cameras to enable Windows Hello login as well as USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 3. Design-conscious consumers will also appreciate the fact that Lenovo has added a new silver color option on select models. Pricing and availability are as follows: ThinkPad Yoga 370 – starts at $1,264 – available from March 2017 ThinkPad T470 – starts at $914 – available from February 2017 ThinkPad T570 – starts at $909 – available from March 2017 ThinkPad T470s – starts at $1,099 – available from February 2017 ThinkPad T470p – starts at $1,049 – available from March 2017 ThinkPad 13 – starts at $647 – available from January 2017 ThinkPad L470 – starts at $799 – available from March 2017 ThinkPad L570 – starts at $809 – available from March 2017 ThinkPad X270 – starts at $909 – available from March 2017 Lenovo also announced a new USB Type-C dock ($199.99 starting in January) and a Thunderbolt 3 dock ($279.99 come February) as well as a pair of new ThinkVision monitors, the ThinkVision P24h and the ThinkVision P27h priced at $259 and $329, respectively. Both will be available starting in March 2017. Expect to see more from Lenovo in the lead-up to CES 2017 next week.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll focus on 3-4 broad areas of interest. We will work with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Products e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics Emerging Technologies e.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access People e.g. teamwork & collaboration; community-building; communications Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from general “TED”-like inspirational talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: Currently a senior advisor to Google, from 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Hashtag: #mozSS September 1: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 1 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015). She’s been honored to receive significant recognition of her work, including the Gordon Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the National Olympus Innovation Award, the SVForum Visionary Award, and several university teaching awards.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Hashtag: #mozSS #theinevitable April 27, 2016: When Change is the Only Constant, with Kirsten Wolberg, PayPal Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, April 27 @ Mozilla SF - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: When Change is the Only Constant, Org Structure Doesn’t Matter While it may be true in tech that “change is the only constant,” some changes are bigger than others. Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services. Kirsten holds a BS degree in Finance from USC and an MBA from J.L. Kellogg School of Management. Host: David Slater Questions: Submit questions for Kirsten during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe. And while she used to write code (and sometimes writes term sheets as an angel investor), her first love is building and leading product teams and working with engineers and designers to build and launch great products that people want to use.

Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos.

Hashtag: #brantina December 3, 2015: Optimizing for Uncertainty with Mike Arauz, August Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, December 3 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Optimizing for Uncertainty: Deciding and Moving Quickly The web is increasingly complex and dynamic. How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement. Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News. Host: Doug Turner Deck Questions: Submit questions for Deanna during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. August 13, 2015: Build, Measure, Learn: Being a Growth Organization with Hiten Shah, KISSMetrics Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, August 13 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Hiten Shah will share his ideas and experience with growth hacking, a scrappy marketing technique developed by technology startups, and how it specifically applies to Mozilla. Larger companies that embrace this approach (examples include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Airbnb and Dropbox) use creativity, analytical thinking, and social metrics to gain product exposure and grow their market share quickly. Speaker: Hiten Shah is cofounder and president of analytics companies KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg; he also advises startups. Host: Jascha Kaykas-Wolff Deck Questions: Submit your questions for Hiten in advance here, or during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. July 23, 2015: Rapid Prototyping with Tom Chi, GoogleX Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, July 23 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Tom Chi has worked in disciplines ranging from astrophysical research to Fortune 500 consulting to developing new hardware and software (web & client) products and services. He’s worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo! Answers from 0 to 90 million users). He also co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge projects including the autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons in the stratosphere that provide Internet access. Topic: Tom will talk about his approach to rapid prototyping using 'native' materials like paper and foam core to create and test experiences. Using this method, he has led teams to work more effectively and quickly, building state of the art (see above for examples) products as part of an ongoing innovation process. Host: Josh Carpenter Deck Workshop adapted from Tom's talk, from Mozilla Learning Network Questions: Submit your questions for Tom in advance here. May 21, 2015: Onboarding and Team Debt with Kate Heddleston Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 21 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Kate Heddleston, a software engineer in San Francisco, does a lot of speaking on the people-dimensions of software development and engineering management best practices. Her focus is on how software gets made, as well as on what it does. Topic: Kate shares her thoughts on the topic of onboarding new hires - what it takes to do that well, particularly in an engineering environment - and the 'team debt' that results when we do it poorly.

The most essential element of a custom PC build is buying the best gaming computer processor on the market today.  You know, the little piece of hardware that drives every application you’ll run, every game you’ll play, and everything else you can do on your PC. Moreover, building your own gaming PC is always the best route to go when you’re looking to get the best bang for your buck. Sure, you could go to some big box retailer, pick something off of the shelf, go home and play most games. But, the problem with doing that is that you’re spending a great deal more compared to if you were to build your own rig. So with that in mind, don’t spare too little expense on a best gaming computer processor. With computer hardware, it’s typically true that you get what you pay for. Here are Gadget Review’s top picks for the best gaming computer processors currently available. Best Gaming Computer Processor 2016 #1 Pick  Intel Core i7-6700K The Intel Core i7-6700K is the top-of-the-line option. Price: $344.99 | Speed: 4 GHz WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Instant on technology, highest performing Intel i7 processor Intel’s 6th Generation Intel Core processors have finally arrived, and the Intel Core i7-6700K is the top-notch option for those who want to spare no expense. It offers blazing fast speeds and comes packed with useful features that will take your PC gaming to the next level. Not only will it play any high-end game you throw at it, it’ll also run any 3D game in the highest resolution available, offering better details and faster frame rates. In fact, Intel claims it’s 30X better 3D graphics than a five year old PC. What’s more, the card features Instant On technology that allows your PC to resume full functionality in under 0.5 seconds. It has 4 cores, and it supports up to 64GB of memory. The processor also has 8MB Intel Smart Cache. It runs quietly and it’s easily cooled, so you don’t have to worry about having a loud PC or frame rate drops. I’ll note that this processor can be overclocked easily to 4.5 GHz if you’ve got the proper power supply to do so, although Intel recommends going no higher than 4.2GHz. Still, it’s the best gaming Intel processor available, which is why three out of our five best gaming PCs 2016 use the i7-6700K. View on Amazon #2 Pick  AMD Octa-core FX 9590 Price: $228.76 | Speed: 4.7GHz WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: AMD’s most powerful card can be overclocked to a whopping 5.0GHz. The AMD Octa-core FX-9590 is AMD’s best option, so if you plan on building an AMD build — which I personally have, myself — you won’t find a better option than this. In fact, when I’m looking for the best gaming computer parts, I typically start with AMD because of their significant savings. Without any overclocking or tweaks, the FX-9590 pushes out an impressive 4.7 GHz, and it comes in at under $250 ($228 at the time of writing this). If there were an official measurement of cost/speed, the 9590 would be the best option. Most notably, you can push this card to 5.0GHz using AMD’s own tools, and you can likely take it a step further if you’re feeling risky (although, I have not personally tried). Unfortunately, AMD gets a bad wrap in the gaming computer, and is often looked down upon by elitists, so great AMD options often get overlooked. But, the FX-9590 is getting rave reviews, with many praising the speed you’re getting for the cost. It offers a full eight cores to deliver impressive performance by the most demanding games, allowing for those who seek ultra-high resolutions to achieve their goal with ease (and without breaking the bank). Note: AMD has a compatible list of motherboards that will work with this powerful gaming processor, and for now, it’s relatively short when compared to a high-end Intel card. Before purchasing, make sure you can get a motherboard that works with it (as you should always do when building your own rig). View on Amazon #3 Pick  Intel Core i5-6500 You won’t beat an i5-6500 for $200. Price: $199.99 | Speed: 3.20GHz WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Best gaming CPU under $200. If you are planning to go the budget route, the Intel Core i5-6500 is the best gaming computer processor under $200 on the market. It runs cooler than the previous generation of i5 processors, and it consumes less power. Admittedly, you’re not gaining a major performance boost if you already own a previous generation i5 processor, but you don’t really need one (and there is a slight boost in power). It has a 3.2GHz processing speed out of the box, and it can be boosted to up to 3.6GHz safely, without worrying about damaging your PC. It has four cores, and it automatically allocates processor power to the applications that need it the most, making it incredibly efficient in its use of those four cores. It has a 6MB Intel Smart Cache. View on Amazon #4 Pick  AMD FX-8320 Black Edition Don’t let AMD’s past dictate your opinion; their 8 core processors are incredible, and much cheaper than Intel counterparts. Price: $131 | Speed: 3.5GHz WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Best processor under $150. Can be overclocked to 4.0GHz, and you can buy it with a 256GB SSD for just $75 more. Need power and not too much cost? The AMD FX-8320 Black Edition is a great choice if you’re building an AMD-based build. It uses 125W of power, but it uses that power well. What makes it so appealing is its price. At under $150, it’s a price that any PC builder on a budget can swallow. It can handle running numerous apps at one time, and your multitasking could certainly use a powerful processor like this one. With a full eight cores (that’s right, eight cores for under $150), you can reach up to 4.0GHz safely (although, I’ve read reports of those overclocking to 4.2GHz without any issues). I will note that the stock cooling “solutions” that come with it aren’t really up to par, and you should probably pick up a better CPU cooler if you want this thing to run as best as possible. View on Amazon – $199 #5 Pick  Intel Core i7-4790 Price: $305 | Speed: 3.6GHz WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: A great i7 option that comes in at $40 cheaper than its successors. If you’re looking to save a buck or two on an Intel i7 CPU, your best option is the Intel Core i7-4790. Sure, you’re not getting all of the bells and whistles that the 6700K has, but you’re still getting a high-end gaming computer processor that can stand up to most everything you throw at it. You can’t overclock it, at least there aren’t any tools offered by Intel, themselves, to overclock it. So if you’re looking to really push your PC to the limits, you might want to consider the 6700K above. But if price is more important to you than squeezing out every last ounce of speed, the i7-4790 is a good choice. It’s compatible with Z87 and Z97 motherboards. View on Amazon – $305 Key Factors and Features to a Good Gaming Computer Processor Price: One of the most important factors to consider when buying a gaming computer processor are its price. For price, you’re going to want to consider what is included versus what isn’t included, whether you’re going to need a different cooling option or if the stock one works well enough.  To that end, if a processor has exceeded its typical refresh cycle, you might be best to wait as pricing will go down for that model or a new one will appear. Games You Plan to Play: If you plan to play games like Hearthstone or CS:Go or League of Legends, you’re definitely not going to need to purchase the top-notch, best-of-the-best gaming processor. Instead, you’re going to want to go for the budget option that might not be as fast, but it’ll still run those games at full speed. Conversely, if you plan to play Battlefield 1 on ultra settings when it comes out, or The Witcher 3 without sacrificing graphical fidelity, you’re going to want to purchase the absolute best. Motherboard Cost: When you buy a CPU, you also need to buy a motherboard that will allow you to use that specific CPU (and the newer the CPU, the harder the time you’ll have finding a motherboard to match it). More importantly, if you don’t already have a motherboard that will allow you to use the CPU you want, you’ll have to buy a motherboard with it. So even if the CPU you want is a great price, how much is a motherboard to go along with it? Mistakes to Avoid Avoiding AMD: Avoiding AMD would be a grave mistake. PC gamers tend to shy away from AMD based on its initial run of high-end processors, but they’ve come a long way over the past five years, and they’re now a much more formidable foe for Intel. Cheaping Out: Paying more now might save you in the long run. CPUs are a fast-evolving technology, and new processors are introduced every couple of years, at least. So if you buy a top-notch CPU right now, you won’t need to upgrade again for a few years. However, if you buy a middling CPU, you’re going to have to pay again to upgrade sooner. Which Gaming Processor is Right For You This list includes a fairly wide spectrum of prices. For some, it’ll come down to price per power. It all depends on what you have in your PC already, or if you’re building a fresh new build and will need to purchase other things to go along with it (like a better cooler, a completely new motherboard, etc). There are other factors to consider when looking to speed up your PC so that it will run the latest games, but you should always start with the processor and motherboard combination that best fits your budget and the types of games you intend to play.

Credit: Lenovo More like this Intel's silence on Optane SSDs raises questions about launch and focus Lenovo's popular ThinkPads speed up with Intel's Kaby Lake chips The top 10 PC technologies and trends to watch in 2017 Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 is a loaded laptop that boasts a range of whiz-bang technologies, but the ability to run Intel's secretive Optane memory stands out. When it ships in March, the T570 will be ready to run Intel's Optane, a new class of memory and storage that promises to be significantly faster than today's SSDs and DRAM. The T570 is the first laptop announced with support for Optane. Intel has not said when it will ship Optane memory, but the T570 has the hooks to support the technology. The T570 also can be configured with a 4K touch display, Nvidia's GeForce 940MX discrete graphics and up to 32GB of DRAM. The laptop is targeted at business users, but it could be a dream machine for enthusiasts. The 15.6-inch laptop will be available starting at $909 in March. It will have Intel's latest 7th Generation Core chips, code-named Kaby Lake. Intel will sell Optane -- which is based on technology called 3D Xpoint -- in the form of SSDs and DRAM modules. Intel has shown Optane SSDs running 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. But Optane isn't yet ready for prime time, as indicated by a closer look into the specification sheet for the T570 provided by Lenovo. It will serve mainly as secondary storage and for caching in the laptop. The Optane PCIe M.2 2242-S3 memory, which will be optional in the T570, will have a capacity of just 16GB. It will not act as primary storage, but as temporary storage to speed up applications and games. Windows 10 PCs with Optane could boot up at lightning-fast speeds. In a way, the early Optane memory could reflect the way SSDs, which are faster than hard drives, were first used for caching in laptops. The SSDs had low storage capacity, and served as temporary storage to speed up PC boot and application load times.  Optane could be useful in gaming, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said last year. Parts of games can be preloaded on Optane, and that could provide for a much faster gaming experience. The T570 can also be configured with a 2TB hard-drive or 1TB SSD storage. The ThinkPad T570 will weigh about 2.04 kilograms. It will have Thunderbolt 3 and HDMI ports, in addition to two USB 3.0 slots. It will have 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and can be configured with Qualcomm's Snapdragon LTE modem.

The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled on Wednesday Qualcomm abused its dominant market position and forced handset makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips. Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chipmakers such as Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and MediaTek Inc (2454.TW), the regulator said, hindering their sales and leaving their products vulnerable to lawsuits.The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers if requested - measures that would affect the U.S. firm's dealings with major tech companies including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Intel, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] if upheld.The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm's practices in 2014 following complaints from industry participants, but did not name specific companies.Foreign companies including Apple, Intel, MediaTek and Huawei expressed their views during the regulator's deliberation process, KFTC Secretary General Shin Young-son told a media briefing in the country's administrative capital. "We investigated and decided on these actions because Qualcomm's actions limit overall competition," Shin said, adding that the ruling was not about protecting domestic companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS) but about improving market competition for all players.Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it. "Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision," it said in a statement.The decision in Seoul could mean lower costs for mobile phone makers and others in the tech supply chain who source Qualcomm chips, said a Taiwanese industry executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. IN REGULATORY CROSSHAIRS The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC's orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker. A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones."How can they force you to license to a competitor? That's what I never understood. I guarantee Qualcomm won’t want to do that," he said, adding that the dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts. The KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips, which were then used in handsets made by Samsung and LG. Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them."Korea’s decision will serve as an important reference point for us,” Chiu Yung-ho, vice chairman and spokesman for Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters. He gave no timeline on when Taiwan’s own year-long investigation would be concluded. (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Additional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in SEOUL, J.R.

Lenovo's popular ThinkPads speed up with Intel's Kaby Lake chips Lenovo introduces ThinkPad Yoga 370, upgrades workhorse T-series, L-series and X-series laptops to Intel's Kaby Lake chips Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 28 December, 2016 16:25 0 - - - - print email Lenovo is starting its CES party a bit early, announcing new and upgraded ThinkPad laptops and a 2-in-1 with Intel's new Kaby Lake chips and a slew of new features. The new ThinkPads are getting better screens, faster DDR4 memory and more storage capacity. Features like USB-C ports, optional LTE connectivity, precision touchpads and optional infrared cameras for Windows Hello are being offered across the ThinkPad X, L and T series. Lenovo also introduced the ThinkPad Yoga 370 2-in-1, which is the first model in the brand with a 13.3-inch HD screen and a Thunderbolt 3 port. The upgraded products are mainly workhorse ThinkPads, but Lenovo is also expected to separately announce flashier laptops and 2-in-1s at CES. Lenovo doesn't mess around with the design of mainstream ThinkPads, which have a strong following, but you can expect thinner and lighter laptops with longer battery life. The ThinkPad Yoga 370, which weighs 1.37 kilograms, will be available starting at $1,264 in March. The device turns into a tablet when you rotate the screen 360 degrees. It will include up to 1TB of SSD storage and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. In addition to Thunderbolt 3, it has two USB 3.0 ports, a MicroSD slot and an HDMI port. A cheaper option with a 13.3-inch screen is the ThinkPad 13, which comes with an HD screen and NVMe SSD storage. It will be available this month starting at $674. One upgrade in the popular X200 series is the ThinkPad X270, which has a 12.5-inch screen, and the same look and feel as its X260 predecessor, which has Skylake. The laptop has up to 16GB of DDR4 memory and up to 1TB of SSD or 2GB of hard-drive storage. It also has USB-C, HDMI, two USB 3.0, SD card and a SIM slot. It will be available in March starting at $909 with a 1366 x 768 pixel non-touch screen. The powerful ThinkPad T-series, which is a favorite among business buyers, stands out for its sleeker look. The screens have thinner borders and the laptops are smaller and lighter as a result.  The ThinkPad T470 (starting at $914, available in February) is available with or without an HD screen, while the T470p (starting at $1,049, available in March) and T470s (starting at $1,099, available in February) are available with screen resolutions up to 2560 x 1440 pixels. The laptops have a wide range of storage and memory options, but only the T470 has a Thunderbolt 3 port. For those who don't want integrated graphics, the T470p can be configured with Nvidia's N16S-GTR discrete graphics card, which is mainly designed for laptop workstations.. Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 is the most loaded laptop of the bunch, and can be configured with a 4K 15.6-inch touch display, Intel's superfast Optane memory, Nvidia's GeForce 940MX discrete graphics and up to 32GB of DRAM. It will be available in March starting at $909. It will weigh 2.04 kilograms, and can also be configured with a Snapdragon LTE modem. It will also include an HDMI slot, three USB 3.0 ports and one Thunderbolt 3 connector. Top 10 Things to Love about Surface Pro 4 More from Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 Join the PC World newsletter!

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing New leaked benchmarks show AMD’s Ryzen going toe-to-toe with Intel’s Core i7 New leaked benchmarks show AMD’s Ryzen going toe-to-toe with Intel’s Core i7 By Joel Hruska on December 27, 2016 at 2:24 pm Comment There’s a new leaked benchmark for AMD’s Ryzen (née Zen), and it shows a CPU core that’s capable of slugging it out with the upper-end of Intel’s product line in a way that no AMD chip has in nearly five years. This is the closest we’ve come to third-party metrics for how Zen will perform — past leaks have either focused on single tests like Ashes of the Singularity or have been official, carefully controlled demos of the chip by AMD itself. This data comes from French tech magazine Canard PC, which managed to test an engineering sample CPU with a base clock of 3.15GHz and a boost clock of 3.3GHz. That’s below the 3.4GHz base clock that AMD has promised for top-end Ryzen cores, so if we assume a modest boost clock of 3.6GHz it means final test results should be somewhat higher than what we see below. Since the text is in French, we asked our (non-native) French speaker Jessica Hall to help with the translation, with one paragraph for each result. The first graph is based on 3D rendering and video encoding performance in a number of applications. The ES Ryzen chip with all eight cores active wins past Intel’s six-core Core i7-6800K and is bested only by the eight-core Core i7-6900K, with its much higher boost clock of 3.7GHz. The French reads: Performance – brute/front-facing/dumb calculations. [this is a straight-up number crunching test]. With its eight true cores, Zen achieves prowess despite its limited frequency [“clock speed?”] of 3.3gHz. It’s getting dangerously close – for intel – to the Core i7 6900K by offering performances comparable to the Core i7 5960X at the same frequency. AMD’s story from a few months ago seems to be well verified in practice, and this is excellent news. Compared to the FX-8370, there’s a performance gain of about 35% at the same frequency, which is also in line with the manufacturer’s forecasts. Next up, we’ve got an overview of game performance, as calculated using Far Cry 4, Grid: Autosport, BF4, Arma III, X3: TC, The Witcher 3, and Anno 2070. Game performance isn’t literally a single-thread test anymore — most games can take advantage of four or so cores — but only a handful of titles can reliably benefit from more than that. This is particularly true where Intel chips are concerned, since Intel CPUs have offered vastly better single-thread performance than their AMD counterparts. Of the two sets of benchmarks, this is going to be less friendly to AMD than its counterpart above. The French translation is: “If the results seem much more disappointing across the average of video games tested, keep in mind that the prototype tested was an 8-core with a fairly low frequency (particularly in Turbo mode). However, the games remain very sensitive to frequency and still struggle to exploit more than four cores. Difficult in these conditions to compare it with a core i7 whose frequency exceeds 4GHz. Still, the Zen architecture shows an efficiency that we have not seen in AMD for a long time.” Closing to within 3% of the Core i5-6500K is a significant achievement for Ryzen, since we expect clock speeds to be at least modestly higher on shipping hardware. It’s also a vast improvement over previous generation cores based on Excavator or Piledriver. For the first time, if these leaks are accurate, AMD can credibly say it’s offering some competition to Intel in gaming. Finally, there’s power consumption. The text states: “The power consumption measurement of the Zen CPU was taken from the amperemeter[multimeter? voltmeter/ammeter?] clamp on the ATX 12V connector at full load. Although it is less accurate than the oscilloscope we usually use, it gives a good idea of the performance of the 14nm LPP process of Global Foundries. After removing the VRM losses from the motherboard, it can be estimated that the CPU consumes just under 90W, a value very close to that of a 6900K. Auspicious results for the future.” Again, very strong results here from AMD. Ryzen at 93W is significantly below the FX-8370, yet much faster than that core. In absolute terms, Intel’s performance-per-watt is likely higher, though this will need to be checked benchmark-by-benchmark. What’s changed is that AMD can, once again, credibly claim to be offering competitive performance. It’s a huge leap forward for the smaller CPU firm. As always, these test results should be taken with a grain of salt. They aren’t official, they aren’t run on final hardware, and they can’t be verified at this point. But, importantly, these test results do generally match what I’ve personally been expecting Zen would offer. It’s never been reasonable to think AMD would, in one fell swoop, leap from farther behind Intel than it ever was during the Bad Old Days when the P4 was cleaning the Athlon XP’s clock. What AMD needs Zen / Ryzen to do is prove that it can build a chip that’s competitive with Intel, at solid price points, with a core it can scale and improve over the next few years. If these benchmarks are accurate, with a little more oomph from clock speed and a little adjustment for the whims of any specific single test, it’s done that overall.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple now investigating Consumer Reports MacBook Pro battery life results Apple now investigating Consumer Reports MacBook Pro battery life results By Joel Hruska on December 27, 2016 at 9:52 am Comment Apple has announced, via Twitter, that it’s working with Consumer Reports to nail down what happened to its MacBook and MacBook Pro hardware. The announcement came from Phil Schiller, who reports the company is “Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.” There’s a great deal of smoke around this issue (everyone being off for the holidays probably hasn’t helped), but not much in the way of new data just yet. What we know is that some Apple buyers have reported abnormally low battery life ever since the new MacBooks launched. At first, these issues seemed like they might be limited to the 15-inch MacBook Pros, which use AMD discrete GPUs, but later testing has shown this is not the case. Consumer Reports is not the only publication to report that Apple’s battery life: 9to5 Mac reported relatively low figures for their own tests (6-8 hours). There are several intersecting issues that, I think, are collectively feeding the issue here. First, there’s the fact that Apple’s battery life estimates are typically extremely good. No manufacturer is 100% accurate, because use models change so much between people, but Apple has a reputation for delivering most of what it promises. For Apple systems to be dropping so dramatically (and even 8 hours when Apple says 10 hours isn’t good), it implies that something else is going on here. Second, there’s the sheer erratic nature of Consumer Reports’ results. If Apple or Dell says that a laptop should get 10 hours of battery life and you regularly get 6, it implies that the company’s battery estimate methodology is poor. If your laptop lasts two hours in one test and 9 hours the next, all while you’re performing exactly the same amount of work, it implies something altogether different. Third, there’s the fact that modern power management has gotten exceedingly complex. Some of you likely remember when Intel’s SpeedStep technology debuted. The idea of a CPU that could self-adjust its clock in response to workloads and the need to conserve battery life was a huge boost for laptop manufacturers and consumers. Over time, power management technology has advanced considerably; AMD’s implementation of Adaptive Voltage and Frequency Scaling (AVFS) system uses hundreds of sensors embedded around the SoC to gather real-time information about the SoC’s temperature and power states, and adjusts the chip accordingly. Intel hasn’t adopted AVFS for its own chips, but it has added new technologies like SpeedShift to allow its CPUs to move in and out of idle states more quickly and to adjust clock speed dynamically. But all of these changes and technologies come with their own complexities. Some are entirely transparent to the operating system, while others require explicit OS support. Fourth, as CPU improvements have largely stalled, software, not process node improvements, is increasingly responsible for power savings. This, in turn, makes it more likely that software can screw up. If Intel releases a new CPU that uses 30% less power than the previous generation, that gain should show up in every test case. Now, imagine that Intel uses a combination of better codec offload, GPU processing, and more aggressive CPU frequency scaling to cut power consumption. Suddenly, gains that were previously due to improvements to underlying technology are highly dependent on what the end-user is doing. If you compare battery life in video decode scenarios, the results may look great. Switch to a CPU-centric workload that doesn’t give the chip any time to drop into a lower power-state, and they suddenly show no improvement at all. In fact, the newer CPU may use even more power than the old one if it has a higher max clock. There are a number of odd things about the Consumer Reports’ results. The variation is extremely strange. The fact that Chrome is reported as returning much better results than Safari is strange. It’s possible that this issue is related to an extremely specific bug or errata that causes a problem in Safari that results in the CPU sometimes not dropping into sleep states properly, or pegs GPU usage where it shouldn’t, or that some particular issue related to GPU acceleration in web pages is causing problems. Apple’s decision to remove the “Time Remaining” metric from its laptops could be evidence that the company knows it has a problem and wants to reduce consumer complaints while it deals with it — or it could be completely unrelated. Right now, it’s all a bit of a muddle and rather unclear.

Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 will have Intel's superfast Optane storage The laptop will be one of the first PCs to run Intel's mysterious Optane memory Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 28 December, 2016 16:01 0 - - - - print email Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 is a loaded laptop that boasts a range of whiz-bang technologies, but the ability to run Intel's secretive Optane memory stands out. When it ships in March, the T570 will be ready to run Intel's Optane, a new class of memory and storage that promises to be significantly faster than today's SSDs and DRAM. The T570 is the first laptop announced with support for Optane. Intel has not said when it will ship Optane memory, but the T570 has the hooks to support the technology. The T570 also can be configured with a 4K touch display, Nvidia's GeForce 940MX discrete graphics and up to 32GB of DRAM. The laptop is targeted at business users, but it could be a dream machine for enthusiasts. The 15.6-inch laptop will be available starting at $909 in March. It will have Intel's latest 7th Generation Core chips, code-named Kaby Lake. Intel will sell Optane -- which is based on technology called 3D Xpoint -- in the form of SSDs and DRAM modules. Intel has shown Optane SSDs running 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. But Optane isn't yet ready for prime time, as indicated by a closer look into the specification sheet for the T570 provided by Lenovo. It will serve mainly as secondary storage and for caching in the laptop. The Optane PCIe M.2 2242-S3 memory, which will be optional in the T570, will have a capacity of just 16GB, and it act as primary storage, but as temporary storage to speed up applications and games. Windows 10 PCs with Optane could boot up at lightning-fast speeds. In a way, the early Optane memory could reflect the way SSDs, which are faster than hard drives, were first used for caching in laptops. The SSDs had low storage capacity, and served as temporary storage to speed up PC boot and application load times.  Optane could be useful in gaming, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said last year. Parts of  games can be preloaded on Optane, and that could provide for a much faster gaming experience. The T570 can also be configured with a 2TB hard-drive or 1TB SSD storage. The ThinkPad T570 will weigh about 2.04 kilograms. It will have Thunderbolt 3 and HDMI ports, in addition to two USB 3.0 slots. It will have 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and can be configured with Qualcomm's Snapdragon LTE modem.

Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

They make use of the new 3D Xpoint memory that Intel and Micron have developed together. The SSDs have a capacity of 16GB and are used for caching and are combined with a regular HDD. The Optane SSDs should speed up some of Lenovo’s upcoming ThinkPad laptops, according to AnandTech.  The Kaby Lake CPU powered laptops are scheduled for January and February next year, but it’s unclear if the Optane SSDs are also available at launch. It’s likely that Lenovo uses the Optane Memory 8000p module of which the first information became available in October this year. This module is available in capacities of 16GB and 32GB in either a M2. 2280 or M.2 2242 formfactor. To make sure it can utilize the speed offered by the Optane drives, it uses the PCIe 3.0 x2 interface. The speed offered by that interface is certainly required, as 3D Xpoint should, in theory, be 1000x faster than NAND memory, according to the developers, Micron and Intel. The idea behind the memory is to combine the speed of RAM memory with the storage capacity and price of NAND flash memory. The drawback appears to be the price, according to Micron it’s currently 4-5x more expensive than NAND. which is probably also why today’s announced Lenovo laptops come with a relatively small Optane SSD.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Microsoft's new Surface Studio Desktop Sales for the Quarter were Really Surprising | Main | The False Narrative that Apple's Supply Chain in Taiwan won't move to the U.S. under any Circumstances » December 28, 2016 Korea's Antitrust Agency Hits Qualcomm with Record $865 Million Fine for Excessive Licensing Fees to Phone Makers   Korea's antitrust agency imposed a record US$865 million fine on Qualcomm, accusing the U.S. chipmaker of monopolistic behavior and abusing its leading status in the market, the Fair Trade Commission said Wednesday. The agency accused Qualcomm of coercing mobile phone makers, including South Korea's Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics as well as Apple of U.S., to pay excessive licensing fees under unfair conditions set by the company. The FTC said that Samsung, LG, Apple, Intel, MediaTek, China's Huawei Technologies, and Ericsson of Sweden, participated in its investigation of Qualcomm.   The FTC said that Qualcomm rejected or set limitations for providing its standard essential patents to rival modem chipset makers, such as Intel of the U.S. and Taiwan's MediaTek. The patents are critical for the production and sale of chipsets.   "It is the first time that the FTC corrects Qualcomm's unfair business model," said the agency in a statement. "We want to implement fair competition in the mobile telecommunication industry by changing it to [an] open ecosystem in which any participant can enjoy incentives from its innovations."   This latest censure follows similar action from China taken against the San Diego-based chipmaker. In February 2015, China's National Development and Reform Commission levied a fine of 6 billion yuan ($975 million) on Qualcomm for charging excessive royalties for its third- and fourth-generation telecommunication technology patents.   Qualcomm enjoys a monopoly in the licensing and modem chipset markets in the mobile telecommunication industry, according to the FTC. It owns the largest number of standard essential patents in the second-, third- and fourth-generation technologies in the industry. The South Korean market accounted for 16% of Qualcomm's total revenues last year, which reached $25.1 billion, the agency said.   Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel at Qualcomm stated that "We are pleased that our appeal will be to the Seoul High Court, which is known to rigorously analyze evidence and apply sound antitrust principles."   On December 21, Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Files a Major Antitrust Case against Acacia Research Corporation Pointing to a Conspiracy with Nokia Corporation." Apple see's Nokia and their silent partners for the same kind of antitrust behaving in gouging smartphone OEM beyond FRAND licencing. In their filing with the court Apple stated the following:   "Apple Inc. ("Apple") brings this action to remedy a continuing anticompetitive scheme. Acacia Research Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Acacia") and Conversant Intellectual Property Management Inc. ("Conversant") and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Conversant") have respectively colluded with Nokia Corporation (itself and through its affiliates Nokia Solutions and Networks Oy and Nokia Technologies Oy (collectively "Nokia")) to obtain from Nokia thousands of patents as part of a plan to extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly and anticompetitively from Apple and other innovative suppliers of cell phones, and ultimately from the consumers of those products.   This conduct is all the more pernicious because it unfairly and anticompetitively evades binding commitments that Nokia made to license declared standard essential patents ("SEPs") on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory ("FRAND") terms. Nokia positioned itself to claim that its patents cover technologies included in telecommunications standards by repeatedly assuring standard-setting organizations that it would license its patents fairly. Yet Acacia and Conversant are now conspiring with Nokia in a scheme to diffuse and abuse such patents and, as the PAEs and Nokia fully intended, monetize those false promises by extracting exorbitant non-FRAND royalties in ways Nokia could not."   At some point in time it would be great to see the US or other Antitrust agencies around the world take up this same fight against Nokia as they are now with Qualcomm. The EU Commission threatened Nokia back in 2013 that they would open an antitrust case against Nokia if they acted as patent trolls as they now have with Apple and yet have failed to take a stand against this European company. How convenient.   The good news in this is that if China and Korea have found Qualcomm guilty of charging excessive licensing fees to smartphone makers then perhaps Nokia will be be next in line.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News South Korea fines Qualcomm $854 million for violating competition laws South Korea fines Qualcomm $854 million for violating competition laws Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. By: Reuters | Published:December 28, 2016 6:45 pm Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm Inc 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales, a decision the US chipmaker said it will challenge in court. The fine, the largest ever levied in South Korea, marks the latest antitrust setback for Qualcomm’s most profitable business of licensing wireless patents to the mobile industry, at a time when the business is facing headwinds from a cooling smartphone market. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled on Wednesday Qualcomm abused its dominant market position and forced handset makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips. Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chipmakers such as Intel Corp, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and MediaTek Inc, the regulator said, hindering their sales and leaving their products vulnerable to lawsuits. The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers if requested – measures that would affect the US firm’s dealings with major tech companies including Apple Inc, Intel, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd if upheld. The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm’s practices in 2014 following complaints from industry participants, but did not name specific companies. Foreign companies including Apple, Intel, MediaTek and Huawei expressed their views during the regulator’s deliberation process, KFTC Secretary General Shin Young-son told a media briefing in the country’s administrative capital. “We investigated and decided on these actions because Qualcomm’s actions limit overall competition,” Shin said, adding that the ruling was not about protecting domestic companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics Inc but about improving market competition for all players. Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it. “Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision,” it said in a statement. The decision in Seoul could mean lower costs for mobile phone makers and others in the tech supply chain who source Qualcomm chips, said a Taiwanese industry executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. IN REGULATORY CROSSHAIRS The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC’s orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker. A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones. “How can they force you to license to a competitor? That’s what I never understood. I guarantee Qualcomm won’t want to do that,” he said, adding that the dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts. The KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips, which were then used in handsets made by Samsung and LG. Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them. “Korea’s decision will serve as an important reference point for us,” Chiu Yung-ho, vice chairman and spokesman for Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters. He gave no timeline on when Taiwan’s own year-long investigation would be concluded.

But if you're not fussed about those accessories, and you'd prefer a good ol' fashioned discount instead, you're in luck. Buyers in the UK can now get up to 10% off the Surface Book from Amazon.co.uk, depending on the model they intend to purchase: Intel Core i5 / 8GB RAM / 128GB SSD | usually £1,299 | now £1,169 (save £130 / 10%) Intel Core i5 / 8GB RAM / 256GB SSD | usually £1,599 | now £1,483.04 (save £116 / 7%) Intel Core i7 / 8GB RAM / 256GB SSD | usually £1,799 | now £1,619 (save £180 / 10%) Intel Core i7 / 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD | usually £2,249 | now £2,199 (save £50 / 2%) Intel Core i7 / 16GB RAM / 1TB SSD | usually £2,699 | now £2,452.76 (save £196.24 / 7%) The discounts listed above refer to prices for purchases from Amazon itself; if you're willing to purchase from a third-party Amazon Marketplace seller, you may be able to get the same models at even lower prices. Curiously, Amazon's listing refers to the Intel Core i5 / 8GB RAM / 256GB SSD model as having "Integrated Intel 520 Graphics", rather than the discrete Nvidia GeForce GPU listed in the specs on the Microsoft Store. Indeed, Microsoft doesn't appear to offer that model without the dGPU in the UK, although it is listed on its US store.

The devices are all part of the X70 series (X varying from 2-5 depending on the model. The larger models in the series, the T470, T470p, T570, L470, L570 will have Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake CPUs and up to 16GB of Intel’s ultra-fast Optane SSD memory. The laptops will ship with Thunderbolt 3 support, Microsoft’s Precision TrackPads and protection from bad USB-C cables. The Thunderbolt 3 standard offers 40Gbps of bandwidth and support for the DisplayPort 1.2, which means that you can easily drive multiple 4K/UHD displays at 60Hz. Since Thunderbolt 3 can handle a lot of power, Lenovo will be integrating a protective circuit around the USB-C ports to prevent any damage due to faulty cables. The ThinkPad Yoga T370 is a 2-in-1 device with a 13.3 inch screen, a weight of 1.45kg and 10-hour battery life, according to Lenovo. This device will ship in March. To go with these devices, Lenovo has announced two docks, one with Thunderbolt 3 and the other with USB-C gen 2. The Thunderbolt dock will cost $280 (around Rs 19,000) and add support for up to 3 displays. In fact, you’ll be able to drive 2 displays at UHD and 30Hz resolution alongside a single display at UHD and 60Hz. Or, you can drive two UHD displays at 60Hz. The dock also includes an HDMI port, a VGA port, five USB 3.0 ports, a gigabit Ethernet port and audio. A 135W power adapter will power the dock, but 65W of this power can be transferred to the laptop itself to charge it via a Thunderbolt 3 pass-through. The other dock will only connect via USB-C Gen.2, which is slower and less capable. It’s also cheaper at $200 (around Rs 13,600). This dock will offer two DIsplayPorts, three USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, audio and Gigabit Ethernet. Since it’s USB 3.0, it’ll only be able to drive a single UHD display at 30Hz or two Full HD displays at 60Hz. On the display front, Lenovo unveiled two new displays. Both displays will be available in QHD resolutions and connect via Thunderbolt 3/USB-C. Both will come with four USB 3.0 ports, two HDMI inputs, one DisplayPort in, one DisplayPort out (for daisy-chaining) and will be able to charge a connected laptop with up to 45W of power. The displays only vary in resolution and price, with a 23.8 inch display (the ThinkVision P24h) priced at $259 (around Rs 17,700) and a 27-inch (the ThinkVision P27h) unit going for $329 (around Rs 22,500). Both units will be available in March and will be factory calibrated to sRGB standards.

Lenovo has a slew of ThinkPad laptops and peripherals for the new year, including updates to the T- and L-Series lines, as well as a wholly fresh hybrid system, the ThinkPad Yoga 370. All new ThinkPad laptops will boast Intel's latest Core i Kaby Lake processors, MilSpec certification for durability, discrete TPM 2.0 for security, and Microsoft Signature Image for a clean system with no bloatware. Aimed at either business or personal use, the Yoga 370 is a 13-inch convertible laptop featuring Lenovo's signature 360-degree hinge for full screen rotation. Also present is the same flattening keyboard we've seen on their high-end business systems like the ThinkPad X1 Yoga, which locks the keys down flat as you fold the screen back for protection and a more comfortable grip. The 370 includes a full HD touch display, Thunderbolt 3 support, and can be configured with up to 1TB of solid-state storage. There are some other useful extras in the 370, like protection against malfunctioning USB-C power supplies damaging your system and an anti-reflective screen finish. With a claimed 10 hours of battery life and weighing just over three pounds, the 370 is built to be travel friendly. It will be available in February 2017 starting at $1,149. The ThinkPad T-Series has four new laptops: The T570, T470, T470s, and T470p. The T570 is a 15-inch business laptop with customizable storage, discrete graphics, and optional additional batteries; it arrives in February, starting at $949. The T470 is the mainline 14-inch workhorse in Lenovo's proverbial stable, now slightly thinner and lighter at 20mm thick and 3.49 pounds. It features discrete Nvidia GeForce 940MX graphics, Thunderbolt 3 support, and a fingerprint reader. The T470s and T470p are specialized versions of that laptop, focusing more on portability and performance, respectively. The T470s is an ultraportable that weighs just under 3 pounds and does not offer a discrete graphics option. The T470p isn't quite as slim, but offers greater connectivity options, discrete graphics, and more memory. All three will be available in January 2017, with the T470 starting at $949, the T470s at $1,149, and the T470p at $1,099. On the value side, the L-Series business laptops get refreshed with the L470 and the L570. The L470 is a 14-inch system rated at 12 hours of battery life, switchable integrated and discrete AMD graphics, and a full HD display with In-Plane Switching technology. The L570 is a 15-inch model available with integrated graphics and a 720p or 1080p display. It weighs 5.25 pounds and can include up 1TB of storage with 512GB of solid-state storage. Both will launch in February, with the L470 starting at $799 and the L570 at $949. Outside those lines, the ThinkPad X270 will add its 12.5-inch form factor and potential 20 hours of battery life to the family. The ThinkPad 13, meanwhile, is a budget option that still offers the shared ThinkPad features. It includes a 13.3-inch full HD touch display, integrated graphics, and up to 512GB of storage. Both will launch in January, with the X270 starting at $949 and the ThinkPad 13 at $699. Lenovo is also launching separate USB-C- and Thunderbolt 3-centric docks. The former will be available in January for $199, and the latter in February for $279. Two new 24-inch and 27-inch QHD ThinkVision displays will be coming in March, with pricing yet to be announced.

[x] Countdown to 2017 with HEXUS and ARM [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Laptop System Builders News 0 Lenovo announces Windows 10 Signature Kaby Lake laptops by Mark Tyson on 28 December 2016, 10:01 Tags: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadcmf Add to My Vault: Just ahead of CES Lenovo has announced nine new Microsoft Windows 10 Signature Series laptops. With Lenovo getting some bad press in recent months over bloatware, malware, rootkits and so on, the reassurance of a Microsoft WIndows 10 Signature experience might be an attractive prospect to those who might otherwise not consider the Lenovo brand for a new PC. Lenovo's new and refreshed devices predictably come packing Intel's latest and greatest processors: the 7th generation or Kaby Lake Core-i series of processors. Some of the higher end models also have the option of Intel Optane 3D storage. New and refreshed models for CES 2017 include; the completely new ThinkPad Yoga 370 2-in-1 convertible, refreshed T-Series (T470, T570, T470s, and T470p) and L-Series (L470 and L570) models, the new X270, and an updated version of the ThinkPad 13. Lenovo bullet pointed a list of improvements that are delivered by its new laptops: Microsoft Signature: All ThinkPads comes loaded out of the box with the Microsoft Signature Image (clean install, no bloatware). Precision TouchPad: Microsoft’s PTP standard supported across all devices. USB-C 'Anti-Fry' Protection: Systems with USB-C have equipped with protection circuit to protect from improperly designed/malfunctioning USB-C power supplies. dTPM 2.0 security support: Universal implementation of discrete TPM 2.0. ThinkPad Intelligent diagnostic codes: Intelligent Diagnostics with musical tones from notebook interpreted by companion smartphone app. Intel Optane Performance: Non-volatile storage medium in the PCIe M.2 format for significant improvements in endurance, performance, and power consumption. Among the nine new devices the ThinkPad Yoga 370 2-in-1 stands out as a completely new model, and it will sit nicely between the existing 200- and 400-Series Yogas. This 13.3-inch 1.45Kg machine, pictured above, offers a Yoga-flexible 1080p screen and 10 hour battery life. Furthermore, it employs Thunderbolt 3 to connect with Lenovo's new docks and displays. (Most of the new T-Series also feature Thunderbolt 3). The Yoga 370 will be priced around $1250 and ship in March.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:10 PM, December 28, 2016 Updated: 6:10 AM, December 29, 2016 SEJONG, South Korea/SAN FRANCISCO - South Korea's antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm Inc <QCOM.O> 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales, a decision the U.S. chipmaker said it will challenge in court. The fine, the largest ever levied in South Korea, marks the latest antitrust setback for Qualcomm's most profitable business of licensing wireless patents to the mobile industry, at a time when the business is facing headwinds from a cooling smartphone market. Shares in Qualcomm fell 1.7 percent on Nasdaq. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled on Wednesday Qualcomm abused its dominant market position and forced handset makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips. Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chipmakers such as Intel Corp <INTC.O>, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> and MediaTek Inc <2454.TW>, the regulator said, hindering their sales and leaving their products vulnerable to lawsuits. The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers if requested -- measures that would affect the U.S. firm's dealings with major tech companies including Apple Inc <AAPL.O>, Intel, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] if upheld. The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm's practices in 2014 following complaints from industry participants, but did not name specific companies. Foreign companies including Apple, Intel, MediaTek and Huawei expressed their views during the regulator's deliberation process, KFTC Secretary General Shin Young-son told a media briefing in the country's administrative capital. "We investigated and decided on these actions because Qualcomm's actions limit overall competition," Shin said, adding that the ruling was not about protecting domestic companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics Inc <066570.KS>. Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it. "Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision," it said in a statement. The decision in Seoul could mean lower costs for mobile phone makers and others in the tech supply chain who source Qualcomm chips, said a Taiwanese industry executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. IN REGULATORY CROSSHAIRS The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC's orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker. A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones. The dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts, he said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips, which were then used in handsets made by Samsung and LG. Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them. "Korea’s decision will serve as an important reference point for us,” Chiu Yung-ho, vice chairman and spokesman for Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters. He gave no timeline on when Taiwan’s own year-long investigation would be concluded. Even if the Korean decision sets a precedent for regulatory proceedings in other countries, Qualcomm's move to purchase chipmaker NXP Semiconductors <NXPI.O> for $38 billion cuts its reliance on mobile phones, said Bill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones. NXP takes Qualcomm into the fast-growing market for automotive chips and puts it into the chip manufacturing business. "The strategy of diversifying the company's business lines may prove to be the most prudent strategy of all," Kreher said. "Since Qualcomm has moved its dependence from royalties, further decisions from other countries such as the U.S. in the future would not impact the company much, relative to in the past." Shares of Qualcomm were down $1.16 to $66.09 in early afternoon trade.

In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals.   Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC’s orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker.   A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones.   “How can they force you to license to a competitor? That’s what I never understood. I guarantee Qualcomm won’t want to do that,” he said, adding that the dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts.   The KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips, which were then used in handsets made by Samsung and LG.   Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them.   “Korea’s decision will serve as an important reference point for us,” Chiu Yung-ho, vice chairman and spokesman for Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters. He gave no timeline on when Taiwan’s own year-long investigation would be concluded.   Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Banks slash rates in New Year gift; SBI leads and PNB, Union Bank follow Fact check: PM Modi just extended old schemes in New Year announcement Infosys' Rs 5.9 cr severance pay to Kennedy bid to play safe with Trump Black money chase: Don't panic if you receive a tax notice Flipkart's largest unit posts hefty revenue growth, cuts losses More From Current Affairs European shares hit highs as PMI data comes as New Year's gift Iran certifies 29 international companies to bid for oil, gas projects Global Markets - New Year, new high for euro zone stock markets Bitcoin jumps above $1,000 for first time in three years India's infrastructure output growth slows to 4.9 percent in November - govt [ more ] Top Stories At least 60 dead in Brazil prison riot Google helping mobile publishing?

The fine, the largest ever levied in South Korea, marks the latest antitrust setback for Qualcomm's most profitable business of licensing wireless patents to the mobile industry, at a time when the business is facing headwinds from a cooling smartphone market. Shares in Qualcomm fell 1.7 percent on Nasdaq. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled on Wednesday Qualcomm abused its dominant market position and forced handset makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips. Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chipmakers such as Intel Corp, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and MediaTek Inc, the regulator said, hindering their sales and leaving their products vulnerable to lawsuits. The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers if requested -- measures that would affect the U.S. firm's dealings with major tech companies including Apple Inc, Intel, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd if upheld. The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm's practices in 2014 following complaints from industry participants, but did not name specific companies. Foreign companies including Apple, Intel, MediaTek and Huawei expressed their views during the regulator's deliberation process, KFTC Secretary General Shin Young-son told a media briefing in the country's administrative capital. "We investigated and decided on these actions because Qualcomm's actions limit overall competition," Shin said, adding that the ruling was not about protecting domestic companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics Inc. Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it. "Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC's announced decision," it said in a statement. The decision in Seoul could mean lower costs for mobile phone makers and others in the tech supply chain who source Qualcomm chips, said a Taiwanese industry executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. IN REGULATORY CROSSHAIRS The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC's orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker. A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones. The dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts, he said.

Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them. "Korea's decision will serve as an important reference point for us," Chiu Yung-ho, vice chairman and spokesman for Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters. He gave no timeline on when Taiwan's own year-long investigation would be concluded. Even if the Korean decision sets a precedent for regulatory proceedings in other countries, Qualcomm's move to purchase chipmaker NXP Semiconductors for $38 billion cuts its reliance on mobile phones, said Bill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones. NXP takes Qualcomm into the fast-growing market for automotive chips and puts it into the chip manufacturing business. "The strategy of diversifying the company's business lines may prove to be the most prudent strategy of all," Kreher said. "Since Qualcomm has moved its dependence from royalties, further decisions from other countries such as the U.S. in the future would not impact the company much, relative to in the past." Shares of Qualcomm were down $1.16 to $66.09 in early afternoon trade. ($1 = 1,206.4700 won) (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Additional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in SEOUL, J.R.

The new ThinkPads are getting better screens, faster DDR4 memory and more storage capacity. Features like USB-C ports, optional LTE connectivity, precision touchpads and optional infrared cameras for Windows Hello are being offered across the ThinkPad X, L and T series. Lenovo also introduced the ThinkPad Yoga 370 2-in-1, which is the first model in the brand with a 13.3-inch HD screen and a Thunderbolt 3 port. The upgraded products are mainly workhorse ThinkPads, but Lenovo is also expected to separately announce flashier laptops and 2-in-1s at CES. Lenovo doesn't mess around with the design of mainstream ThinkPads, which have a strong following, but you can expect thinner and lighter laptops with longer battery life. The ThinkPad Yoga 370, which weighs 1.37 kilograms, will be available starting at $1,264 in March. The device turns into a tablet when you rotate the screen 360 degrees. It will include up to 1TB of SSD storage and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. In addition to Thunderbolt 3, it has two USB 3.0 ports, a MicroSD slot and an HDMI port. A cheaper option with a 13.3-inch screen is the ThinkPad 13, which comes with an HD screen and NVMe SSD storage. It will be available this month starting at $674. One upgrade in the popular X200 series is the ThinkPad X270, which has a 12.5-inch screen, and the same look and feel as its X260 predecessor, which has Skylake. The laptop has up to 16GB of DDR4 memory and up to 1TB of SSD or 2GB of hard-drive storage. It also has USB-C, HDMI, two USB 3.0, SD card and a SIM slot. It will be available in March starting at $909 with a 1366 x 768 pixel non-touch screen. The powerful ThinkPad T-series, which is a favorite among business buyers, stands out for its sleeker look. The screens have thinner borders and the laptops are smaller and lighter as a result.  The ThinkPad T470 (starting at $914, available in February) is available with or without an HD screen, while the T470p (starting at $1,049, available in March) and T470s (starting at $1,099, available in February) are available with screen resolutions up to 2560 x 1440 pixels. The laptops have a wide range of storage and memory options, but only the T470 has a Thunderbolt 3 port. For those who don't want integrated graphics, the T470p can be configured with Nvidia's N16S-GTR discrete graphics card, which is mainly designed for laptop workstations.. Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 is the most loaded laptop of the bunch, and can be configured with a 4K 15.6-inch touch display, Intel's superfast Optane memory, Nvidia's GeForce 940MX discrete graphics and up to 32GB of DRAM. It will be available in March starting at $909. It will weigh 2.04 kilograms, and can also be configured with a Snapdragon LTE modem. It will also include an HDMI slot, three USB 3.0 ports and one Thunderbolt 3 connector.

When it ships in March, the T570 will be ready to run Intel's Optane, a new class of memory and storage that promises to be significantly faster than today's SSDs and DRAM. The T570 is the first laptop announced with support for Optane. Intel has not said when it will ship Optane memory, but the T570 has the hooks to support the technology. The T570 also can be configured with a 4K touch display, Nvidia's GeForce 940MX discrete graphics and up to 32GB of DRAM. The laptop is targeted at business users, but it could be a dream machine for enthusiasts. The 15.6-inch laptop will be available starting at $909 in March. It will have Intel's latest 7th Generation Core chips, code-named Kaby Lake. Intel will sell Optane -- which is based on technology called 3D Xpoint -- in the form of SSDs and DRAM modules. Intel has shown Optane SSDs running 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. But Optane isn't yet ready for prime time, as indicated by a closer look into the specification sheet for the T570 provided by Lenovo. It will serve mainly as secondary storage and for caching in the laptop. The Optane PCIe M.2 2242-S3 memory, which will be optional in the T570, will have a capacity of just 16GB, and it act as primary storage, but as temporary storage to speed up applications and games. Windows 10 PCs with Optane could boot up at lightning-fast speeds. In a way, the early Optane memory could reflect the way SSDs, which are faster than hard drives, were first used for caching in laptops. The SSDs had low storage capacity, and served as temporary storage to speed up PC boot and application load times.  Optane could be useful in gaming, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said last year. Parts of  games can be preloaded on Optane, and that could provide for a much faster gaming experience. The T570 can also be configured with a 2TB hard-drive or 1TB SSD storage. The ThinkPad T570 will weigh about 2.04 kilograms. It will have Thunderbolt 3 and HDMI ports, in addition to two USB 3.0 slots. It will have 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and can be configured with Qualcomm's Snapdragon LTE modem. HP Elite Slice More from Dicker Data Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

Lenovo doesn't mess around with the design of mainstream ThinkPads, which have a strong following, but you can expect thinner and lighter laptops with longer battery life. The ThinkPad Yoga 370, which weighs 1.37 kilograms, will be available starting at $1,264 in March. The device turns into a tablet when you rotate the screen 360 degrees. It will include up to 1TB of SSD storage and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. In addition to Thunderbolt 3, it has two USB 3.0 ports, a MicroSD slot and an HDMI port. A cheaper option with a 13.3-inch screen is the ThinkPad 13, which comes with an HD screen and NVMe SSD storage. It will be available this month starting at $674. One upgrade in the popular X200 series is the ThinkPad X270, which has a 12.5-inch screen, and the same look and feel as its X260 predecessor, which has Skylake. The laptop has up to 16GB of DDR4 memory and up to 1TB of SSD or 2GB of hard-drive storage. It also has USB-C, HDMI, two USB 3.0, SD card and a SIM slot. It will be available in March starting at $909 with a 1366 x 768 pixel non-touch screen. The powerful ThinkPad T-series, which is a favorite among business buyers, stands out for its sleeker look. The screens have thinner borders and the laptops are smaller and lighter as a result.  The ThinkPad T470 (starting at $914, available in February) is available with or without an HD screen, while the T470p (starting at $1,049, available in March) and T470s (starting at $1,099, available in February) are available with screen resolutions up to 2560 x 1440 pixels. The laptops have a wide range of storage and memory options, but only the T470 has a Thunderbolt 3 port. For those who don't want integrated graphics, the T470p can be configured with Nvidia's N16S-GTR discrete graphics card, which is mainly designed for laptop workstations.. Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 is the most loaded laptop of the bunch, and can be configured with a 4K 15.6-inch touch display, Intel's superfast Optane memory, Nvidia's GeForce 940MX discrete graphics and up to 32GB of DRAM. It will be available in March starting at $909. It will weigh 2.04 kilograms, and can also be configured with a Snapdragon LTE modem. It will also include an HDMI slot, three USB 3.0 ports and one Thunderbolt 3 connector. The Continuum from Building to Buying your infrastructure More from Dell EMC Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Twitter Facebook Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 will have Intel's superfast Optane storage The laptop will be one of the first PCs to run Intel's mysterious Optane memory Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 28 December, 2016 16:01 - - - - print email Comments Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 is a loaded laptop that boasts a range of whiz-bang technologies, but the ability to run Intel's secretive Optane memory stands out. When it ships in March, the T570 will be ready to run Intel's Optane, a new class of memory and storage that promises to be significantly faster than today's SSDs and DRAM. The T570 is the first laptop announced with support for Optane. Intel has not said when it will ship Optane memory, but the T570 has the hooks to support the technology. The T570 also can be configured with a 4K touch display, Nvidia's GeForce 940MX discrete graphics and up to 32GB of DRAM. The laptop is targeted at business users, but it could be a dream machine for enthusiasts. The 15.6-inch laptop will be available starting at $909 in March. It will have Intel's latest 7th Generation Core chips, code-named Kaby Lake. Intel will sell Optane -- which is based on technology called 3D Xpoint -- in the form of SSDs and DRAM modules. Intel has shown Optane SSDs running 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. But Optane isn't yet ready for prime time, as indicated by a closer look into the specification sheet for the T570 provided by Lenovo. It will serve mainly as secondary storage and for caching in the laptop. The Optane PCIe M.2 2242-S3 memory, which will be optional in the T570, will have a capacity of just 16GB, and it act as primary storage, but as temporary storage to speed up applications and games. Windows 10 PCs with Optane could boot up at lightning-fast speeds. In a way, the early Optane memory could reflect the way SSDs, which are faster than hard drives, were first used for caching in laptops. The SSDs had low storage capacity, and served as temporary storage to speed up PC boot and application load times.  Optane could be useful in gaming, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said last year. Parts of  games can be preloaded on Optane, and that could provide for a much faster gaming experience. The T570 can also be configured with a 2TB hard-drive or 1TB SSD storage. The ThinkPad T570 will weigh about 2.04 kilograms. It will have Thunderbolt 3 and HDMI ports, in addition to two USB 3.0 slots. It will have 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and can be configured with Qualcomm's Snapdragon LTE modem.

Since most of the lineup is just being refreshed, we’ll go over what’s new on a holistic level. Lenovo’s ThinkPad lineup is one of the most well known lineup of laptops around. They’ve been the business focused lineup in Lenovo’s laptop arsenal for some time, and the ThinkPad is a staple in many businesses and enterprises. For 2017, Lenovo has done a gentle retouch of most of the product lineup, brining about some new technology and other changes. The first big announcement is that Lenovo is launching Intel Optane caching drives on select ThinkPad models. We’ve followed the development of this new non-volatile storage solution for some time, and please check out the full write-up on this announcement of shipping 3D XPoint here. Due to the small storage capacity, these initial Optane M.2 drives will be used for HDD caching on several ThinkPad models, including the ThinkPad T470p, L470, L570, T470, and T570. Lenovo is also switching to the Microsoft Precision TouchPad drivers, for a more consistent experience across devices. This is certainly a welcome change, and it’s great to see more companies leverage this. Precision TouchPad is continuously being updated by Microsoft as well. The software side is only half of the story of course, but it’s a big part of the experience. Still on the software side, Lenovo is also switching the entire ThinkPad lineup for 2017 to a Windows 10 Signature Edition image. This is excellent news not only for the home user, who won’t have to deal with gratuitous software which was not always needed or welcome, but for business users this should allow for faster deployment as well, since a custom image may not be required at all. After some of the news stories over the last couple of years, it is excellent to see a company shipping Signature Edition images right out of the box for an entire product lineup, and we can only hope this expands to the rest of Lenovo’s laptops. On the hardware front, other than Optane, Lenovo is making a big push for USB-C and especially Thunderbolt 3. With the addition of this port, Lenovo is able to offer some new accessories to provide an easier docking solution than the traditional docking station. ThinkPads have shipped with fingerprint readers for some time, and Lenovo is also supplementing the T470 and T570 with Windows Hello cameras, for facial recognition. This doesn’t replace the fingerprint, but gives another option for end users. Possibly the most interesting news of all is that Lenovo is going to be offering some ThinkPad models in a new silver color, alongside the traditional matte black. Although this could be blasphemy to some, the new color looks great in the images provided, and hopefully we’ll be able to get some hands-on time with them at CES and see how it looks in person. ThinkPad Yoga 370 As far as new models, Lenovo is launching the ThinkPad Yoga 370, which is a 13.3-inch FHD version of their ThinkPad Yoga lineup, which previously consisted of the 12.5-inch Yoga 260 and 14-inch Yoga 460. The ThinkPad Yoga 370 offers an integrated pen which docks inside the laptop, as well as Thunderbolt 3, and it will be offered in black or silver with availability in March 2017, starting from $1264. ThinkPad T470 The T470 is one of the new models to feature an optional Intel Optane 16 GB cache drive, and it also will have a touch fingerprint reader and Windows Hello camera option. Thunderbolt 3 is also here on the 14-inch laptop, along with a GeForce 940MX GPU and up to 32 GB of DDR4. It continues to feature the split battery, with a 23 Wh in the front and a removable 48 Wh or 73 Wh battery in the rear. It will be available in February starting at $914 ThinkPad T570 The 15.6-inch T series is similar to the T470 in that it will offer Thunderbolt 3, fingerprint, IR camera, and Intel Optane caching, and it also keeps the dGPU with the GeForce 940MX, but the larger model can also be had with a UHD display (3840x2160) in addition to the standard FHD (1920x1080) version. It will be available in March starting at $909. ThinkPad T470s The ThinkPad T470s continues to get slimmer and lighter. What was once a slightly lighter T series is now a 14-inch notebook that is under three pounds, with the latest version just 2.9 lbs. It can be had with up to 24 GB of memory, with 8 GB soldered on and a single DIMM available for another 16 GB. It still features Ethernet, along with Thunderbolt 3 and up to 1 TB of PCIe SSD. The thinner T series is also available in silver, with availability in February starting at $1099. ThinkPad T470p The p model is for performance, with 45-Watt CPUs instead of the U series found in the slimmer and lighter notebooks. This is combined with the GeForce 940MX, and up to 32 GB of DDR4. The T470p is also available with the 16 GB Intel Optane caching drive, and split batteries with up to 12 hours of battery life with the larger 72 Wh battery in the rear. The T470p will be available in March starting at $1049. ThinkPad 13 The ThinkPad 13 is Lenovo’s value offering, and it will be available in January for a starting price of $674. For less than $700, it will feature Intel Kaby Lake processors, with up to 32 GB of DDR4 with 2 DIMM slots, and up to 512 GB of PCIe storage. The display is a FHD 1920x1080 touch version, and it features 3 USB 3.0 ports, USB-C which doubles as a charging port, dTPM 2.0, and a SD card reader. It’s 19.1mm thick and weighs 3.17 lbs. It will also be offered in black or silver. ThinkPad L470 The L series is positioned as the mainstream business value lineup, and they slot in for a bit less money than the T series. The L470 is a 14-inch FHD IPS model, and it also features optional Intel Optane caching, and 2 DIMMS for up to 32 GB of RAM. It keeps the split batteries as well, offering up to 95.5 Wh of battery capacity. In addition, it adds a discrete GPU in the Radeon R5 M430. It will be available in March starting from $799. ThinkPad L570 This 15.6-inch laptop is quite a bit different than the similarly named L470, in that it doesn’t have the split battery, or discrete graphics. It has a single 48 Wh battery, along with optional Intel Optane caching or SSD drives. The base model is a 1366x768 TN display, so be careful, although there is a FHD IPS offering as well. It features a dedicated number pad and optical drive, and it can be had with up to 32 GB of DDR4 with the 2 DIMM slots, and will be available in March starting at $809. ThinkPad X270 This 12.5-inch ThinkPad has been around for quite a while now, and the latest version adds USB-C for power, display, and data. RAM options are 4 to 16 GB of DDR4, and storage is up to 2 TB of HDD or 512 GB PCIe SSD. It offers the ThinkPad split battery with 23 Wh in the front and 48 or 72 Wh in the rear. With the largest battery, Lenovo claims up to 21.4 hours of battery life. It comes in at 2.9 lbs, with availability in March from $909 Gallery: ThinkPad Refresh 2017 Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 47 Comments View All Comments jsntech - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link While nice in and of itself (and I wish every vendor would follow suit), the Signature Edition tactic is probably a necessity to get me to consider Lenovo again after Superfish-gate. Reply mmrezaie - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link I agree and Linux for the rescue! Lenovo needed to do something to fix the lost trust, but they didn't. Investing in Coreboot could be an option for them but no, that just could have been too good for a company. Although I wonder what would be the Optain's support in Linux? Reply Murloc - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link they did, signature edition is a guarantee it won't happen again. Reply goatfajitas - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link Linux is great and all for geeks, but these are kind of the "business standard". The problem with Linux is you cant take it to work and get anything done. Reply corn13read - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link What kind of ignorant statement is this? Just because you can't get anything done in Linux doesn't mean the rest of us geeks can't. My job requires Linux, and shockingly, I get work done. Reply goatfajitas - Thursday, December 29, 2016 - link Key words "business standard". If your job requires Linux, you dont need a "business standard" laptop. If you think you can take Linux or any Linux dist. into most normal companies and get anything done you are mistaken. In some companies with certain needs yes, but just like Mac, it is never going to take off in the enterprise sector. Reply barleyguy - Thursday, December 29, 2016 - link Seriously? I've worked in large enterprise companies for 20 years, and all of them use Linux as the standard OS in their datacenters. Windows is just a way to run Outlook. At my current company the first thing they asked me two days before I started, was "would you like Mac or Windows on your laptop?". And on Windows we run Linux inside Vagrant, and connect to the datacenters that way. At my previous company, many of the developers put Linux on their laptops, and when they needed to get to Windows (to run Outlook) they would just RDP to a Windows machine. So in short, I could have Linux on my laptop and get work done just fine, as could most people at enterprise tech companies. Reply goatfajitas - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link LOL, yes seriously. What part of "business standard" notebooks are you not getting? It is not for Datacenters, it is for normal non tech office workers. Accountants, AR, AP, admins, VP's etc etc. They need Windows and windows compatible apps. Reply barleyguy - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link "Normal non-tech office workers" need whatever it is they've been trained on, which is whatever the company decides to train them on. Yes, that is currently Windows. That's not at all a technical requirement though. It's just because they lack the technical skills to use something else. So saying they "couldn't use Linux and get any work done" is just another way of saying "they lack the technical skills to use Linux and get any work done". I have a different perspective than you do, because I have generally worked at companies (or at least campuses) where there were hundreds of engineers, whereas Accountants, AR, AP, and VPs were a little alcove off in a corner of building two somewhere. Reply goatfajitas - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link Not quite... It's not about what they are trained on, it is about what exists that has the software that businesses run on. It's pretty much Windows and only Windows. It's not that Mac or Linux aren't "capable" they certainly are, it's that the software doesn't exist. MS has owned enterprise for 20+ years and nearly everything revolves around it. If Mac or Linux (or anything else for that matter) wants a piece of that pie they could do it, but to get to that goal, they would need to start and so far, no-one is even attempting it. It's a virtual stranglehold.

Lenovo's new ThinkPads and competing high-end Kaby Lake systems will likely be the first appearance of 3D XPoint memory in the consumer PC market. Several of Lenovo's newly announced ThinkPads will offer 16GB Optane SSDs in M.2 2242 form factor paired with hard drives as an alternative to a using a single NVMe SSD with NAND flash memory (usually TLC NAND, with a portion used as SLC cache). The new Intel Optane devices mentioned by Lenovo are most likely the codenamed Stony Beach NVMe PCIe 3 x2 drives that were featured in roadmap leaked back in July. More recent leaks have indicated that these will be branded as the Intel Optane Memory 8000p series, with a 32GB capacity in addition to the 16GB Lenovo will be using. Since Intel's 3D XPoint memory is being manufactured as a two-layer 128Gb (16GB) die, these Optane products will require just one or two dies and will have no trouble fitting on to a short M.2 2242 card alongside a controller chip. The new generation of ThinkPads will be hitting the market in January and February 2017, but Lenovo and Intel haven't indicated when the configurations with Optane will be available. Other sources in the industry are telling us that Optane is still suffering from delays, so while we hope to see a working demo at CES, the Optane-equipped notebooks may not actually launch until much later in the year. We also expect the bulk of the initial supply of 3D XPoint memory to go to the enterprise market, just like virtually all of Intel and Micron's 3D MLC NAND output has been used for enterprise SSDs so far. Support for Intel Optane branded devices based on 3D XPoint memory technology has long been bandied about as a new feature of the Kaby Lake generation of CPUs and chipsets, but Intel has not officially clarified what that means. The plan of record has always been for the first Optane products to be NVMe SSDs, but NVMe is already thoroughly supported by current platforms and software. Because Optane SSDs will have a significantly higher price per GB than NAND flash based SSDs, the natural role for Optane SSDs is to act as a small cache device for larger and slower storage devices. The "Optane support" that Kaby Lake brings is almost certainly just the addition of the ability to use NVMe SSDs (including Optane SSDs) as cache devices. At a high level, using Optane SSDs as a cache for hard drives is no different from the SSD caching Intel first introduced in 2011 with the Z68 chipset for Sandy Bridge processors and the Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) driver version 10.5. Branded by Intel as Smart Response Technology (SRT), their SSD caching implementation built on the existing RAID capabilities of RST to use a SSD as a block-level cache of a hard drive, operating as a write-back or write-through cache depending on the user's preference. For SATA devices, no hardware features were required but booting from RST RAID or cache volumes requires support in the motherboard firmware, and Intel's drivers have used RAID and SRT SSD caching to provide product segmentation between different chipsets. With the release of Skylake processors and the 100-series chipsets, Intel brought support for NVMe RAID to RST version 15. This was not as straightforward to implement as RAID and SRT for SATA drives, owing to the fact that the SATA drives in a RST RAID or SRT volume are all conveniently connected through Intel's own SATA controller and managed by the same driver. NVMe SSDs by contrast each connect to the system through general-purpose PCIe lanes and can use either the operating system's NVMe driver or a driver provided by the SSD manufacturer. In order to bring NVMe devices under the purview of Intel's RST driver, 100-series chipsets have an unusual trick: when the SATA controller is put in RAID mode instead of plain AHCI mode, NVMe devices that are connected to the PCH have their PCI registers re-mapped to appear within the AHCI controller's register space and the NVMe devices are no longer detectable as PCIe devices in their own right. This makes the NVMe SSDs inaccessible to any driver other than Intel's RST. Intel has provided very little public documentation of this feature and its operation is usually very poorly described by the UEFI configuration interfaces on supporting machines. This has caused quite a few tech support headaches for machines that enable this feature by default as it is seldom obvious how to put the machine back into a mode where standard NVMe drivers can be used. Worse, some machines such as the Lenovo Yoga 900 and IdeaPad 710 shipped with the chipset locked in RAID mode despite only having a single SSD. After public outcry from would-be Linux users, Lenovo released firmware updates that added the option of using the standard AHCI mode that leaves NVMe devices alone. (excerpt from Intel 100-series chipset datasheet) In spite of the limitations and rough edges, Intel's solution does ensure reliable operation in RAID mode, free of interference from third-party drivers. It's certainly less work than the alternative of writing a more general-purpose software RAID and caching system for Windows that can handle a variety of underlying drivers. It also lays the groundwork for adding support for NVMe cache devices to Intel's SRT caching system. Intel's SRT already has caching algorithms tuned for 16GB to 64GB caches in front of hard drives, so now that they have a solution for mediating access to NVMe SSDs it is simple to enable using both features simultaneously. The changes do need to be added to both the RST driver and to the motherboard firmware if booting from a cached volume is to be supported. Backporting and deploying the firmware changes to Skylake motherboards should be possible but is unlikely to happen. In the years since Intel introduced SRT caching, another form of tiered storage has taken over: TLC NAND SSDs with SLC caching. NAND flash suffers from write times that are much longer than read times, and storing multiple bits per cell requires multiple passes of writes. To alleviate this, most TLC NAND-based SSDs for client PC usage treat a portion of their flash as SLC, storing just one bit per cell instead of three. This SLC is used as a cache to absorb bursts of writes, which are consolidated into TLC NAND when the drive is idle (or when the SLC cache fills up). Even TLC NAND has reasonably high read performance, so there is little need to use SLC to cache read operations. By contrast, Intel's Smart Response Technology has to cache access to hard drives, where both read and write latencies are painfully high. This means SRT has to balance keeping frequently-read data in the cache against making room for a burst of writes. Having a lot of static data hanging around on the cache device will cause significant write amplification to result from any wear leveling, but SRT already reduces the write load by having sequential writes bypass the cache. Taking into account that 3D XPoint memory can handle millions of write operations per cell, even a small 16GB cache device should have no trouble with endurance.

POST A COMMENT 54 Comments View All Comments Kakti - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link So this is what scares me about Optane aka 3d Xpoint...they seem on par or weaker than current NAND drives due to PCI-E lanes. The drives in this article say they are PC-E 3.0 x2 drives...that's a max of ~2gig/sec, already outclassed by Samsung's newest drives (and others?). Previously they showed I believe a 3.0 x4 drive that had similar numbers, somewhat below the top end NAND drives. Has anything been published that 3d-Xpoint aka Optane can use a ton of lanes or something? Five years ago the numbers these drives put out would have looked great, I don't think anyone expected Samsung to basically saturate the x4 line so fast. Unless Optane can basically run a ton of lines in parallel I think they might be beat for what the presumed asking price is. I hope Micron and Intel can pull something out of this tech! *disclosure:I own Micron stock and have lost my ass over the years (but improving this year!). Everything above is my opinion only. Reply patrickjp93 - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link Are you joking? Intel's Optane drives kick the snot out of existing SSDs. Look at the QD1/2/4 numbers for the 960Pro and Intel's Optane options. Intel is the clear winner by a mile and a half. No one gets close to QD32, no one. Intel's solution will feel faster even if the peak numbers don't look so hot on 1 and 2-die solutions. Reply Kakti - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link Yeah it's supposed to have much better access/seek times (in the 120-140k IOPs range?) but whether that translates to any meaningful increase for a regular user remains to be seen. It seems like IOPS really matter on big databases and not necessarily a regular PC or most workstations. I dunno, I just feel this is too little to late with the small size of the new "cache/RAM drive" compared to just rolling a straight top end m.2 drive and 32gb+ of RAM. Anyone can make a 50gb+ ramdisk already on their workstation for a couple hundred bucks if they really need it. So you get 32gb of RAM and either a PCI-E x4 NVME drive or an m.2 x4 NVME drive with 500gb+...where does that leave this octane drive? High end users have too much ram/fast SSD to cover it. On the low end (4gb-8gb ram) it would probably shine the most but I don't know if they'll be offered in this class of products It seems like servers and databases these will do very well, so that may be the main market. I'm very curious to see some very detailed *cough* reviews once these hit the street. Reply beginner99 - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link 3D XPoint is more like RAM so yes it's random performance (access times) will beat any SSD easily. And let's not forget that it was exactly this (latency) that made the biggest difference from SSD to HDD and not the sequential read/write speeds. So I can easily see that a 16 GB optane cache can make a system even with SSD much more responsive. And lets not forget that compared to a RAM-disk it is non-volatile. So all the cached OS files and applications are there so you will probably get a CPU limited boot and application load times! It sounds pretty cool on paper. Realistically even for an enthusiasts it will almost certainly not be worth it if you don't run high access databases or do some other niche level stuff. I'm somewhat undecided about price. The solution must obviously be cheaper than just going with an SSD. On the other hand I fear it will always be cheaper to get a faster SSD instead of adding a cache drive. Eg. if the 32 gb cache drive cost about the same as the difference between a average SSD and a 960 pro, I would choose the later, Reply iwod - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link But meaningful performance difference? SSD, at latency and certain I/O is 1000x faster then HDD. The same cant be said about Xpoint and SSD. And we surely reach a point where performance isn't in the I/O. i.E Starting your App from RamDisk isn't that much faster then SSD. What i really want to see though, is QLC, 3D stacked NAND as Storage and Xpoint as main drive. Even a 64GB main drive is good enough for me. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link Until I see optane in action I call BS. So far it looks like it will mostly have much better caching and much larger cache buffers, which will be enough to improve the IOPS regardless of the actual bulk storage medium.. They claim "bit addressable" for optane, but that's BS too, even RAM is NOT bit addressable, not even CPU registers. RAM is BYTE addressable. Bit addressable for real would be a fruitless endeavor because the amount of extra traces will not be worth the returns, as nobody bothers with bit access. My bet is the medium will not even be byte addressable, they will just add that in software via bitwise ops. Much like the IOPS boost will likely be due to caching and only for cached data. All this is perfectly possible to do with NAND flash as well, as usually the industry is holding back on very logical and straightforward improvements in order to milk the most out of everything. So far optane has been rather hypetane... and how we get news of it making it into actual products. Oh wow, 16 gigs of optane, that's almost enough to install windoze. Paradigm shifting! Reply mdriftmeyer - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link Stop it! You're making too much sense. What you describe is a dagger into this 3D crap from Intel. Put in that 1TB or 2TB PCI-E based NVME drive and save money in the process while your system flies. Reply Billy Tallis - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link The PCIe x2 bit comes only from the months-old leaked roadmap, and we have no official confirmation of that. And for what it's worth, those roadmaps showed that only this first generation of cache drives would be so limited, while the next version will move to PCIe 3 x4. But the biggest advantage of 3D XPoint memory is low latency, which doesn't require a lot of PCIe lanes. And with only one or two dies, the bandwidth limitation might be between the controller and the memory, rather between the controller and the host. Larger drives suitable for primary storage rather than just caching will have the same parallelism advantages that flash SSDs enjoy, and should be much better able to deliver high throughput. In the meantime, these cache devices will probably offer sufficient throughput given their small capacity and the low performance of the hard drive backing devices, while not wasting power on more PCIe lanes than needed to offer the most performance benefit possible without abandoning the mechanical hard drives entirely. Reply drajitshnew - Thursday, December 29, 2016 - link My laptop is i7-4700mq lenovo y510p. It has a m2-2242 slot. Basically, ruling out any high performance or mainstream drives. My mom's laptop is i5-4200u, costed half as much, weights half as much and has an 2280 slot. I anticipate lenovo will DELIBERATELY cripple the sku's with optane to X2--2242 designs. Reply unityole - Wednesday, December 28, 2016 - link people like you only look at sequential eh? know why SSD is so much faster than HDD? its because of latency hence the QD1 4k random read/write performance. optane will bring QD1 4k random read/write so much closer to that speed of ram, samsung isnt even able to compete. the sequential speed you see won't be used as often as you think brother. time to move on and really learn what tech is about and what benefits and what doesn't.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 29, 2016 at 2:45PM Image source: NVIDIA. Generally speaking, I'm not a huge fan of Citron Research, the often short-oriented commentary site run by Andrew Left. I consider Citron one of those market prognosticators that makes constant calls, and on occasion, some of them turn out to be fantastic, well-researched picks. And the street credit earned from a subset of correct calls overshadows the incorrect calls based on poor theses that no one pays attention to. Regardless, Citron certainly does have the power to move the market in the short term, which incidentally helps its positions and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy -- at least for a day or two. (I've always strongly suspected that Citron front-runs its own picks.) That being said, I don't necessarily disagree with Citron's latest note, which targets high-flying graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Following an incredible year of gains, Citron took the company down a notch yesterday with a single tweet, with shares falling 7%. The $4.3 billion tweet NVIDIA's drop wiped out $4.3 billion in market value, so yeah, Citron can move the markets. In the tweet, Citron pointed to six risks that it believes NVIDIA investors are discounting, which combined with the soaring valuation this year could be a recipe for a pullback.  Citron readers know we have long been fans of $NVDA,but now the mkt is disregarding headwinds. In 2017 we will see $NVDA head back to $90 pic.twitter.com/n4U7f6eV7G — Citron Research (@CitronResearch) December 28, 2016 I don't disagree -- just a couple weeks ago I expressed some concern over stretched valuation multiples, even while acknowledging that NVIDIA has executed extremely well on many of its growth initiatives. Still let's dig through Citron's concerns. Growth and market share: It's true that a lot of NVIDIA's top-line growth has been driven by market share gains, mostly from primary GPU rival AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). AMD clawed back a little bit of market share in Q2, as NVIDIA had been gaining ground for a string of quarters. But AMD gave that back in Q3 following NVIDIA's launch of Pascal-based products. Remember that the PC market hasn't been a growth market in years, nor has the PC gamer niche within it, and the core GPU business accounts for over 80% of sales. The best ways to grow revenue under those circumstances are to steal market share or increase prices; NVIDIA is doing both. NVIDIA is growing into new addressable markets, just not by much as those businesses are still very small compared to the GPU segment. I don't see this as a "risk." If anything, I see it as evidence of strong execution.  Data center competition: NVIDIA has made some progress in the data center, which it hopes will be a growth avenue going forward. There is potential, but Citron is right that competition will only intensify further. This is a relatively small part of the business currently, so while the downside risk may be somewhat limited if competition starts to eat into NVIDIA's results, the issue is valuation. If investors are pricing in data center growth that fails to materialize, shares could be punished from multiple contraction. At the very least, competition could erode gross margin, and the data center business is quite profitable relative to NVIDIA's overall corporate average (56%). Intellectual property and licensing revenue: NVIDIA and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) signed their patent cross-licensing deal back in January 2011, settling years of litigation between the two companies. It's true that Intel's royalty payments will end soon and that revenue will be missed, but investors have known about this for half a decade. This should all already be priced in by now, and you can't argue that NVIDIA's valuation is predicated on royalty revenue. NVIDIA collected $66 million in licensing revenue from Intel last quarter, or just 3% of sales. Gross margin sustainability and competition: As mentioned above, concerns around gross margin are completely valid, given the expected intensification of competition in many of the growth areas that NVIDIA is enjoying right about now. Intel's vertical integration with silicon fabrication does give it cost and strategic advantages, which it will surely leverage. It wouldn't be particularly surprising if NVIDIA does pull back to $90 in 2017. Stocks that run up as fast as NVIDIA has in 2016 often do pull back if the market got ahead of itself, which is entirely possible given the significant multiple expansion that NVIDIA experienced this year. Some of Citron's concerns are worth acknowledging, but others are probably already priced in. Evan Niu, CFA, has no position in any stocks mentioned.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums The Tech Report System Guide: December 2016 edition Man, it feels good to be a gamer by Bruno Ferreira  2:07 PM on December 29, 2016 Welcome to the December 2016 edition of The Tech Report System Guide. Since our last installment, AMD made a big splash by taking the wraps off its Ryzen CPUs. Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs are now inside many laptops and convertibles, and the rumor mill says that the desktop variants of Kaby will be arriving soon. AMD's Ryzen chips also shouldn't be too far behind. The company has said its next-gen parts will launch in the first quarter of 2017. CES is just around the corner, in any case, so you'll probably want to hold off buying a motherboard or CPU until after the dust from that show has settled. Should you need a machine right now, though, we did our best to select the cream of the crop from the current-generation lineups. powered by In the graphics card arena, there's been some major shifts in the $250-and-under segment of the market now that both AMD and Nvidia have revealed basically their entire next-generation graphics-card lineups. While we previously lamented the fact that AMD's originally-promised pricing for its Radeon RX 470 and RX 480 cards didn't materialize in stores, we're now happy to report that supply seems to have increased and prices have fallen. For example, you can grab a Radeon RX 470 4GB card for around $170, and its bigger brother the RX 480GB 8GB goes for about $240. This all means that the fight in the entry-level and budget graphics card segments is fierce indeed. Nvidia isn't sitting still, though, and it's launched the wallet-friendly GeForce GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti to take the fight to the entry-level graphics-card market. The GTX 1050 is a solid enough performer for its price, but our preliminary testing has shown that the 2GB of RAM on board limits its appeal. The GTX 1050 Ti and its 4GB of RAM, on the other hand, are more interesting. Although the slightly-more-expensive RX 470 4GB boasts superior performance, the GTX 1050 Ti sips barely any power, runs dead-quiet, and often doesn't even need a 6-pin power connector to do its thing. That makes it a near-perfect choice for a living-room PC or upgrading a prebuilt system. As for the remaining components that make up a PC, there hasn't been much in the way of new releases. Along with its next-generation CPUs, there are indications that Intel will be releasing new chipsets to go with them, which are reportedly going inside motherboards from all manufacturers as we speak. However, those motherboards have yet to hit the market. Given the rather large amount of uncertainty about these products, we'd be wary of buying a motherboard or CPU right now. When it comes to memory, we'll put it plain and simple: buy it right now, and buy as much as you can. From what we can see, RAM prices have been climbing like crazy, sometimes in the range of 30% or more per kit. Even though our recommendations for specific kits won't be changing all that much, the price tags are rising by the minute. According to some reports and our own observations, SSD prices are on the rise, too. Although we've actually yet to see this phenomenon in most retail listings, the recent dearth of promotional deals and the apparent steadiness of the current prices (instead of the expected continued drop) may be a sign that your flashy new SSD will soon become more expensive. The Tech Report System Guide is sponsored by Newegg. We'll be using links to the site's product pages throughout this guide. You can (and should!) support our work by purchasing the items we recommend using these links. A big thanks to Newegg for their continued support.

Rules of the road The System Guide is our list of recommended parts for building a new PC. If you've never built a PC before and want to, that's great. Just be sure to read through our guide to building a PC, or kick back and watch the handy video below, before proceeding. In the following pages, we'll discuss our picks for the critical components that make up a PC, including processors, motherboards, memory, graphics cards, storage, cases, and power supplies. We've picked parts to fit budgets of all sizes, without compromising on quality or performance. Those picks are divided into three categories: budget, sweet spot, and high-end. We'll also make a note of good choices for those readers who are looking to get in to a VR ready system. Our budget picks will get you up and running with solid components that won't break the bank. Stepping up to our sweet spot parts gets you even more bang for your buck. At the high end, we've chosen parts that represent the pinnacle of performance, without falling into the trap of spending money for its own sake. Each part will have a link to a TR review where possible. We also include a notable needs section for each item with any critical information that you need to know before putting together a parts list.

I’m really leaning on Cade Webb and Cowboys Ride for Free for knowledge on the Cowboys. Luckily, he was nice enough to answer my questions. Mason Rudolph is obviously a great quarterback, one of the top 3 that CU has faced this season. Based on what I saw, he has a strong arms, deceptive legs, and good command of the offense. What are his weaknesses? I saw some intermittent accuracy issues and panic under pressure during the OU game, are those consistent in his career or a product of circumstance? I think you hit his strengths on the head. He's an accurate quarterback and can make every throw on the field. I think he does struggle with accuracy at times, but it's usually when he comes under pressure. When he is under duress in the pocket, he tends to panic. However, he's gotten better about that as he's become a better running quarterback of late. Against OU, I think his accuracy issues were a product of the weather, and poor pass protection. OSU seems like the prototypical Big 12 team. Prolific offense, softer defense. Is this is an accurate description? What are their strengths and weaknesses? I don't think "soft" would be the word I would use to describe the defense, but I think you're spot on about the OSU offense. They throw the ball down the field incredibly well, and they're starting to run the ball at a pretty nice clip. On offense, they struggle with complex blitz schemes and a good defense can take them out of their game. When that happens, OSU tends to shell up on offense. They can't do that against CU. On defense, their strength is in the defensive line, specifically the interior defensive line. They're usually able to defend the run with their front seven. They don't defend the pass as well as they defend the run, but they still do a decent job of limiting downfield opportunities. Justice Hill and Chris Carson have been very effective in the latter part of the season. How do the Buffs stop this running game? How about the offense in general? I'm not sure how the Buffs can stop the OSU running game. I think they'll have to pick their poison with OSU. Not many teams are able to completely take them out of their game. If CU decides to limit the vertical passing game, then expect OSU to run the ball successfully. They're generally able to do both well, but I think it's pretty tough to say that CU would be able to contain both aspects of this Cowboy offense. It seemed like the defensive line was the strong point of the Cowboys defense, is that accurate? How do you move the ball on OSU? It absolutely is. As I mentioned above, they're typically able to defend the run with their front 6 or 7. They did that incredibly well against TCU, who is a very prolific running team. If they do that against CU, I expect CU to try to air it out. One thing that has historically given OSU trouble is dual-threat quarterbacks. From watching the Buffaloes, it seems like Liufau prefers to make plays with his legs, but has the arm to make defenses pay if they key too hard on that. I think CU will find more success through the air than they will on the ground. Who are some players to watch on offense? On defense? The OSU offense goes as Mason Rudolph goes. As I said above, he makes all of the throws and when he's on, he's nearly impossible to stop. That said, he can be rattled with pressure. Something to watch there. You also need to be aware of James Washington and Justice Hill. Washington is the top receiver for the Cowboys and is an incredibly dangerous deep threat. OSU loves going to him in one-on-one situations. Hill, the true freshman running back for the Pokes, has led the resurgence of the running game. He is a downfield runner with deceptive speed. If he gets an inch, he can make you pay. On defense, watch for Vincent Taylor and Jordan Sterns. Taylor is a future NFL guy at the DT spot, and is incredibly athletic for a guy his size. Not many teams have been able to slow him down, so expect to hear his name a few times. Sterns, a first-team All-Big12 safety, is a punisher. He's exceptional in run stop defense, but is athletic enough to help out in the pass defense. What is your prediction for the game? I like OSU in this game. I think CU has a really good secondary, but OSU does enough on offense that if CU slows the passing game, OSU should still be able to move the ball on the ground. OSU is fighting for 10 wins, but CU has a lot on the line too. I expect a very physical, very close game. Give me OSU 31-27. Ok, hypothetical: the Big 12 blows up in 10 years like some predict, will you join the ex-Big 12 club in the Conference of Champions? Conference of Champions? When did Colorado move to the SEC? *winks* But seriously... I think the Pac-12 would be a great fit for Oklahoma State. I've been a proponent of blowing up the conference (at least when expansion was a hot-button topic), and I thought the Pac-12 or SEC would've been the most likely landing spot. I think OSU would thrive in either of those conferences.

MIL-STD-810G tested and IP54 water and dust resistant. Convenient keyboard and kickstand. Includes 4G LTE cellular radio with GPS. Cons Bluetooth keyboard takes a few seconds to wake from idle. Heavy for one-arm use. Lacks USB-C ports. Bottom Line With an excellent display, strong components, and solid design, the Xplore XSlate R12 is a powerful rugged Windows tablet that will serve you as well outdoors as it will in the office. By Joel Santo Domingo The Xplore XSlate R12 (starts at $2,649; $3,699 as tested) is a rugged slate Windows tablet with useful features like an Intel Core i7 processor, a full HD display that's visible in sunlight, and a removable kickstand that also acts as a carrier for a wireless keyboard. It's protected by a rubberized case, and has been tested for drops, extreme environmental conditions, and resistance to blowing dust and water. This is the best tablet we've tested recently for use in nonconventional workspaces. //Compare Similar Products Compare Getac F110 (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Microsoft Surface Pro 4   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Amazon Fire HD 8   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Amazon Fire   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Asus Transformer Book T100HA   %displayPrice%%seller% see it HP Pavilion x2 (10-n123dx)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet (7202)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Nvidia Shield Tablet K1   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Xplore XSlate B10   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple iPad Pro (9.7 inch)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 700   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Acer Switch Alpha 12   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Dell Latitude 13 7000 Series 2-in-1 (7350)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it HP Spectre x2   %displayPrice%%seller% see it HP Elite x2 G1 (1012)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 310   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Microsoft Surface Book (2016, Intel Core i7)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Asus Transformer Mini (T102HA-D4-GR)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo Miix 510   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Design and Features The XSlate R12 looks like a muscular slab clad in a black rubber protective coating. It measures 0.75 by 12.93 by 8.17 inches (HWD), which is thinner (but a smidge wider and deeper) than the 2015 version of the Getac F110, our last top choice. There are implanted guides and pogo plugs for attaching the tablet to mounts in vehicles or its optional desktop docking station. With all its connectors and mounts, the XSlate R12 is meant to work equally well in the office or out in the field. For example, a police officer could use it to look up a potential suspect's criminal record during a traffic stop, then unlatch the tablet and use it in a dock at her desk to finish filling out the paperwork later. View All 10 Photos in Gallery I have no doubt that the R12 will survive use in an auto repair garage or a large-scale warehouse, as it's rated for 4-foot drops onto plywood over concrete (though we didn't copy those conditions). In addition, it has been through MIL-STD-810G testing for extreme temperature swings, vibration, 20g shocks while operating and 40g shocks while off, humidity, altitude, liquid spills (including bleach and oil), and blowing sand and rain. It's rated IP54 for resistance to dust and water; the Getac F110 and Xplore XSlate B10 are both rated a more-resilient IP65, but the XSlate R12 should have no trouble surviving most indoor and many outdoor environments. The tablet weighs in at 3.09 pounds alone, and 4.09 pounds with its kickstand and wireless keyboard magnetically attached to the back panel. It weighs about the same as the Getac F110 (3.1 pounds alone), and less than the Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet (4.46 pounds). It's easy enough to carry in a bag, though holding the full 4-pound tablet in one arm will become tiring after a few minutes. The kickstand swings out, so you can use the tablet on a desk or counter, and opening the kickstand's framework frees a limpet-like wireless keyboard that rides on the tablet's back. The kickstand is also held in place by magnetic clasps, but it is easily removable for those times you don't need it. The innovative keyboard charges itself from contacts on the back of the tablet, so you won't have to carry a micro USB cable around all the time (if you're not carrying the keyboard clipped to the tablet, you can also charge the keyboard with a micro USB cable back at your desk). Since it uses Bluetooth, it's not dependent on being physically attached, like the keyboard on the Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet. The keyboard has a touchpad built in, so you wont have to carry an extra mouse, but note that it takes a second or two of tapping the keyboard or touchpad before they "wake" for input. Included with the R12 is a tethered active stylus, which stows in the right side of the tablet's body. You can use the stylus for tasks like filling out forms or sketching on blueprints. Next to the stylus holder you'll find a Windows Hello–compliant fingerprint reader. Two non-locking doors on the right side cover I/O ports. The first has a port for an optional Ethernet and serial port (both are on a y-shaped cable). The second door covers the jack for the AC adapter, a headset jack, a USB 3.0 port, and an HDMI port. Like most specialized business PCs, the R12 lacks a USB-C port, but that's not a deal breaker. Underneath the hot-swappable battery is a microSD card slot, a SIM card slot for the built-in 4G LTE radio, and a smart card slot that supports government-issued common-access cards (CAC) used by the military. Bluetooth 4.2 and 802.11ac handle short-range wireless communication. The 4G LTE adapter is carrier unlocked, and has GPS built in. The 12.5-inch full HD (1,920-by-1,080-resolution) display is a nice addition. In the past, rugged tablets were kept to 1,366-by-768 resolution because manufacturing portable displays with both 1080p resolution and 800-nit backlights was extremely expensive. This screen's high visibility outdoors, even in full sunlight, is obviously nice for architects and construction workers, but someone in a clerical role will also benefit from being able to see more information on the display at once. Our tested configuration hits the current sweet spot for most business users. The 8GB of RAM is more than enough to keep an instant messaging client, dozens of Web browser tabs, multiple Microsoft Office apps, and information retrieval software utilities active at the same time. And the 256GB of space on the solid-state drive (SSD) is enough for all of the above apps, plus every word processing and spreadsheet document you can generate in the next few years. The memory isn't expandable, though you can replace the SSD with a larger-capacity drive in the future. Xplore covers the R12 with a three-year warranty. Performance and Conclusion The system is equipped with an Intel Core i7-7500U processor with Intel HD Graphics 620. The quad-core processor is more powerful than the usual Core i5 CPU found in most rugged tablets, as proved by the XSlate R12's top scores across the board on our performance benchmark tests. It was excellent on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test (3,282 points), ahead of the other rugged tablets we've seen, from the Panasonic ToughPad FZ-M1 (1,470) to the Getac F110 (2,833). The XSlate R12 also led our multimedia test scores. HandBrake took 2 minutes, 11 seconds, while the other tablets took 3 to 6 minutes, and its CineBench (340 points) and Photoshop (3:34) results were the best we've recorded for this category. The 3D results at our Heaven and Valley tests (at 1,366-by-768 resolution, using the Medium graphics quality preset) didn't signal playability, but they were at least 10 frames per second (fps) faster than rivals'. You're not going to be playing Call of Duty in a squad car, but otherwise the R12 is one of the fastest rugged tablets we've reviewed. See How We Test Tablets The XSlate R12 lasted 8 hours, 59 minutes, on our battery rundown test. That certainly qualifies as all-day computing. That's only 15 minutes less than the Getac F110, our class leader, and several hours longer than any other tablet in this group. The Xplore XSlate R12 is a powerful and sturdy Windows tablet made for harsher conditions than the average business PC. It can handle high-stress environments where it has to survive being dropped, and with double the memory and storage, a much higher resolution screen, and good components, it's a strong performer now that you won't need to worry becoming obsolete anytime soon. For that reason, the XSlate R12 leapfrogs the Getac F110 as our new Editors' Choice for rugged Windows tablets.

Running The Intel NUC6i7KYK On Linux With Skylake Iris Pro Graphics Written by Michael Larabel in Computers on 29 December 2016. Page 1 of 2. 15 Comments I've managed to get my hands on an Intel NUC6i7KYK "Skull Canyon" NUC featuring the Core i7 6770HQ Skylake CPU with Iris Pro Graphics 580. When paired with 32GB of RAM and a Samsung 950 PRO 500GB NVMe SSD, it makes for a very speedy, small form factor Linux-friendly PC. This week I've started out testing the NUC6i7KYK under Linux. Many more benchmarks will come in the days ahead, just wanted to share some initial thoughts for those that may be looking at a post-holiday PC upgrade. This latest Intel NUC comes in a 211 x 116 x 28 mm sized enclosure, making it very slim while offering a lot of potential with the i7-6770HQ CPU, dual M.2 SATA3/NVMe SSD slots, dual channel DDR4-2133+ SO-DIMMs, Thunderbolt 3 / USB 3.1 Gen 2, Wireless-AC 8260 WiFi onboard, and HDMI 2.0 / mini DP 1.2 / DisplayPort 1.2 Type-C. This Core i7 Skylake NUC currently retails for $525 USD on Amazon without any storage or RAM. The Core i7-6770HQ is a quad-core CPU with Hyper Threading (eight logical cores), 2.6GHz base frequency, and 3.5GHz turbo frequency with a 45 Watt TDP. The onboard Iris Pro Graphics 580 have a base frequency of 350MHz and a maximum dynamic frequency of 950MHz. The Iris Pro Graphics 850 can support 4K displays -- 24Hz when using HDMI or 60Hz with DisplayPort. So far in my testing of this NUC6i7KYK, it's been working well with Linux. Ubuntu 16.10 has been my primary target thus far but will be running other distribution benchmarks in the days ahead -- in fact, will be using it for my year-end desktop/gaming distribution comparison on the Intel side. The wireless, Ethernet, UEFI, DP / HDMI, Iris Pro SKL 3D graphics, and all other key functionality has been working in my tests thus far with the only feature I haven't tested as of writing yet is the Thunderbolt 3.

Intel SGX Patch For GCC - Software Guard Extensions Written by Michael Larabel in Compiler on 29 December 2016 at 07:36 AM EST. 3 Comments Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) has been supported since the launch of Skylake CPUs while finally support for it is being added to the GCC compiler. Software Guard Extensions allow user code to allocate private regions of memory that becomes protected from higher-level processes too. Those wishing to learn more about SGX and their protection "enclaves" can visit software.intel.com to learn more.

(Client Computing Group). New Delhi: The last time Navin Shenoy, senior vice-president and general manager, Intel Corp. (Client Computing Group), was in India in 2012, Paytm was an unknown commodity. On a visit this month, he realized he can make payments to a fruit vendor instantly, which he thought was not possible in India 2-3 years ago. Such dramatic changes, including India’s adaptation of 4G and Digital India, make him an “unabashed India bull”. In an interview, Shenoy talked about the Indian IT industry, advent of Reliance Jio and technology evolution in India. Edited excerpts: How do you see growth in Indian IT especially with the current situation in this financial year? I’m an unabashed India bull as it pertains to prospects for technology in India and I am probably more of a bull than I have ever been largely because of the fact that India has even such a notion as the Digital India initiative from the prime minister and proliferated through the rest of the country. As I travel around the world, there are very few countries that have a digital initiative from the head of the country and so I think the recognition of the government that the digitization of the country is the only way to advancement for the next couple of years, decade is something obviously that we are aligning ourselves to… But if I think what is next for the Indian IT industry, it is really about much like other countries, a much broader proliferation of technologies. The cloud infrastructure in India is not ultimately where it needs to be, the computing infrastructure—many people have mobile phones but still don’t have computers. So I think as I look at the next few years, development in these areas is going to be important… I remember the last time, it’s been four years since I have been here, the fact that you can go to a fruit stand now and use PayTm to buy something, I would never have imagined we will be here so soon one or two or three years ago. So, I am bullish I guess and I guess the conditions are right for the technology industry to continue to grow here. It is the only way India will continue to grow at 7-8% in terms of GDP. What kind of impact do you see of Donald Trump winning US presidential elections on Indian IT industry? It is way too soon to say. It is a pretty broad leap to think of impact right now. There are a lot of unknowns. So we will see how it goes. At the end of the day, India has so much potential that political events are going to happen around the world all the time and there are going to be bumps but if you look in the long term, there is no doubt in my mind that technology is going to be inextricably linked with the progress in India. The two will go hand in hand, and like I said before I am an unabashed bull about how Intel will do in India and the course of how industry will develop in India. We are at a tipping point in India where the next 5-10 years are incredibly bright. You just talked about Paytm at a fruit shop. A lot of it is happening because of demonetisation, so what is your take on that especially considering digital and e-payment revolution that will step in? You think it’s positive for technology? I am not an expert on the demonetization policy. I can tell you that I think from a government point of view, it’s a bold step and probably the right step for India in the long run. But with as most bold steps, there is going to be some bumps. Ultimately it’s inextricably linked with technology, you cannot do demonetisation and not also apply technology in a much broader way. I think it will accelerate the adoption of e payment and modernization of banking system. The fact that 90% plus of the transactions in India are done through cash is not how you build a technology economy, you have to be able to leverage technology. This new company Reliance Jio is bringing its network entirely on 4G LTE. What is your take on it? I think they have been incredibly disruptive, I think they chose to do it in a way that is going to at some point be written about in business school case studies because they did a pan-India service, free voice service, they did their own hardware devices. They really thought it through really well. And I think they have probably accelerated it, it was inevitable that it was going to happen at some point but they have acted as an accelerator. When do you see 5G coming to India? I have that conversation with Reliance. You know the prime minister here is pretty progressive when it comes to technology and I think it will be interesting to see how quickly India moves but I don’t have an exact date but based on everything I have seen so far, it certainly won’t lag the rest of the world like 4G did. I think India will be closer to the 5G evolution and transformation as opposed to kind of later on as perhaps it was on 4G. And what would 5G mean to your business in India? It will accelerate our business in a major way—5G will be much different than the 4G transition. The 4G transitions were largely about mobile phones and computers. The 5G transition will have a much bigger impact because it will be about infrastructure that will get deployed, it will be about automobiles being connected to the Internet, it will be about hospitals being connected to the Internet, it will be about drones being connected to the Internet and literally about every electronic device being connected to the Internet in some way, IOT (Internet of Things) devices and so I think will have a much broader impact on transformation which will be one of the reasons why government and enterprises in India will adopt 5G much faster.

Oh, and it was thirsty for power requiring 2V of power.   Intel and AMD have a massive CES ahead of them next week, but a 7700K at 7GHz does sound delicious. Now give me that with all cores enabled, less power consumption, and an AIO cooler that keeps it cool enough and I'm happy.

Reuters/Robert Galbraith Lenovo is doing one better than its competition by offering Intel’s Optane solid state drive, which boasts to be better than current SSDs and DRAM. The upgrade will be optional for several products, including the ThinkPad Yoga and ThinkPad 13, as well as the upcoming ThinkPad T570. READ: Lenovo ThinkPad laptops getting Windows Precision trackpads, Kaby lake processors & Windows Hello; Business laptops to offer Intel Optane SSDs Lenovo is going to be one of the first companies to offer products with Intel’s Optane SSD option. This piece of technology uses Intel and Micron’s 3D XPoint technology, which reportedly allows for faster and more long-term storage when compared to traditional SSDs. The company promised that various items will begin shipping out before the end of the year. At this point, however, the Optane storage technology is still more expensive than standard options, so Lenovo is offering the same as a choice for 16GB worth of additional cache. The update is possible with the ThinkPad Yoga, ThinkPad 13, T, L and X units. The same will also be fitted into the ThinkPad T570, which is one of the company’s upcoming products. The upcoming laptop boasts of stellar specs and features, which Computer World has reported to include a configuration for 4K touch display. It will also house Nvidia’s GeForce 940 MX discrete graphics chip and will be powered by Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processor. The screen will be 15.6 inch. However, Intel’s Optane technology is what will really set it apart.

The three targeted at least seven major international law firms that had been retained by companies to advise on deals and successfully got into the e-mail accounts of senior lawyers at two of the firms, according to the indictment unsealed yesterday. They profited on deals and speculation involving the drug maker Intermune, chipmaker Intel Corp. and business services company Pitney Bowes Inc., the U.S. said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also sued and is seeking an asset freeze. The case places law firms among the widening group of targets for cybercriminals seeking to profit from insider information. Last year, the U.S. broke up an international ring of hackers who allegedly infiltrated the computer servers of PRNewswire Association LLC, Marketwired and Business Wire and stole market-moving press releases before they were published. According to the SEC, the group, which included Ukrainians and a Georgian, made more than $100 million from trading on the information. “This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in the statement. The three men – Iat Hong and Chin Hung, 50, of Macau, and Bo Zheng, 30, of China – worked at a robotics company that was started by Zheng, according to the government. Hong, 26, was arrested in Hong Kong on Christmas Day and is awaiting extradition. The SEC is also seeking to freeze an account registered in Hong’s mother’s name. In addition to the law firms, they also hacked other robotics companies, the U.S. said. They allegedly stole schematic designs of a robot vacuum cleaner made by a U.S. company. The three generally used the same tactics to get the information, according to the U.S. They would get the log-in credentials of an employee and place malware on a server that allowed them to access the e-mails of key people at the firms and companies, according to the indictment. In a one-day period in 2014, they took 10 gigabytes of confidential data from one law firm’s server, the U.S. said. They weren’t always successful, the U.S. said. During one six-month period in 2015, the three men allegedly tried on more than 100,000 occasions to break into the networks of five law firms. The law firms weren’t identified in the complaints. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP and Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP were among the targeted law firms. Amy Fantini, a Weil, Gotshal & Manges spokeswoman, declined to comment on the charges. Cravath Swaine & Moore didn’t respond to a request for comment. The three men allegedly bought shares of Intermune based on the information gleaned from the hacked data. Though the deal didn’t close, they still made money as shares rose on media reports that the company was seeking a tie-up, the U.S. said. Intermune was ultimately purchased by Roche AG. Cravath advised Intermune on the deal. In another deal, the group allegedly bought shares in chipmaker Altera Corp. after Intel had retained one of the law firms to advise on an acquisition. They scored $1.4 million in profits on the trade amid media reports of the pending deal, and sold their shares before it was publicly announced, according to the indictment. Weil Gotshal was one of the law firms advising Intel on the deal. Using information gleaned from a second law firm, the trio also bought shares of Borderfree, an online commerce site that was an acquisition target of Pitney Bowes, the U.S. said. They made a profit of $841,000 on the trades after the deal was announced on May 18, 2015, according to the indictment. Prior to the Borderfree takeover, Hong and Chin bought so much of the company’s stock that on certain days the two accounted for 25 percent or more of the company’s trading volume, according to the SEC complaint.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Lenovo shows off updated ThinkPads with Kaby Lake CPUs by Eric Born  3:41 PM on December 28, 2016 Ahead of this year's Consumer Electronics Show, Lenovo announced that it's refreshed its lineup of ThinkPad laptops. The headline feature for the updated machines is that they're fitted with Intel Kaby Lake CPUs. Lenovo has other tricks up its sleeve, though. Other nitfy features include new touchpads supporting Microsoft's Precision Touchpad, fingerprint sensors, and new connectivity options including Wi-Fi Certified WiGig. In total, there are nine new laptops to discuss, so let's get started. First up is the ThinkPad X270. This thin-and-trim notebook is 0.8" thick and weighs 2.9 lbs. The base model is equipped with a 1366x768 TN panel, which we suggest upgrading to the 1920x1080 IPS option. Lenovo claims that the X270's battery can power the device for up to a whopping 21 hours. The ThinkPad X270 starts at $909, and will be available in March. Flexible notebooks in Lenovo's ThinkPad Yoga line are known for their multi-mode operation. The new ThinkPad Yoga 370 packs a new screen: a 1920x1080 13.3" display. It ships with an integrated pen, a Thunderbolt 3 port, and an optional touch fingerprint reader. At 0.7" thick, it's just a little leaner than the ThinkPad X270 above. Lenovo claims that the Yoga 730 can last 10.5 hours between charges, and plans to ship it in March. Pricing starts at $1264. Need a notebook that can handle some abuse? Lenovo says the new ThinkPad 13 is durable enough to pass military-grade toughness requirements, so it might survive being used by a toddler. It has a 13.3" 1920x1080 display like the Yoga 370, but lacks the Thunderbolt 3 port. The notebook is 0.77" thick, weighs 3.17 lbs, and Lenovo says it'll last 11 hours on battery. The company plans to make the $674 ThinkPad 13 available in January. Next up are four new T-series notebooks: the T470s, T470, T470p, and T570. At 2.9 lbs, the T470s is the lightest of the bunch, and can be equipped with a 14" 2560x1440 IPS display. It'll ship in February, and starts at $1099. The T470 doesn't offer a high-resolution screen, but has a heftier battery that Lenovo claims will run for up to 18 hours. It'll be available in February as well, with the base model selling for $909. Lenovo equipped the T470p with an Nvidia N16S-GTR GPU (apparently a GeForce 940MX), and there's an optional upgrade for a 2560x1440 IPS display. It'll sell for $1049 starting in March. The ThinkPad T570 is the last and largest of the bunch. Lenovo offers multiple storage option on this machine, which can be equipped with a 15.6" UHD display. In the graphics department, it's powered by Nvidia's 940MX GPU. Lenovo claims the T570's two batteries should be good for about 16 hours of usage on a single charge. This model starts at $1049, and will be available in March. Finally, Lenovo is offering two new L-series laptops. The ThinkPad L470 has a 14" 720p display that can be upgraded to a 1920x1080 panel. For its graphics muscle, Lenovo turned to AMD's Radeon R5 M430. It weighs 4.23 lbs, and will be available in March at a starting price of $779. The L570 offers a larger 15.6" display, but otherwise has very similar specs as the L470. Lenovo plans to sell the base L570 model for $809, and it will also be selling in March. One of the more intriguing features of all these laptops is that they are available with a "Signature Edition" of Windows 10 Professional which contains no trialware or unwanted apps. Lenovo claims that this approach allows the company to optimize the performance of the laptops, eliminate distractions for users, and make life a little easier for the local IT staff.

(George Frey/Bloomberg) December 28, 2016 TECHNOLOGY Qualcomm will fight South Korean fine South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) for what the regulator called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales, a decision the U.S. chipmaker said it will challenge in court. The fine, the largest ever levied in South Korea, marks the latest antitrust setback for Qualcomm’s most profitable business, licensing wireless patents to the mobile industry, at a time when the business is facing head winds from a cooling smartphone market. Qualcomm shares fell 1.7 percent on the Nasdaq. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled Wednesday that Qualcomm had abused its dominant market position and forced handset-makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips. Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chipmakers such as Intel, Samsung Electronics and MediaTek, the regulator said. Those practices hindered the rival companies’ sales and left their products vulnerable to lawsuits, the regulator said. The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing and to renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset-makers if requested — measures that would, if upheld, affect the U.S. firm’s dealings with major tech companies including Apple, Intel, Samsung and Huawei Technologies.

(Kimimasa Mayama/EPA) The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm’s practices in 2014 after complaints from industry participants but did not name specific companies. Qualcomm said it will seek an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. The firm also will appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it. “Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision,” it said in a statement. — Reuters ECONOMY Pending home sales drop in November Fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in November. The decrease probably reflects rising mortgage rates and the shallow inventory of properties on the market. The National Association of Realtors says its seasonally adjusted index of pending home sales fell 2.5 percent to 107.3, its lowest reading since the start of 2016. Pending sales declined in the Midwest, South and West, while improving in the Northeast. Mortgage rates began to rise after Donald Trump’s presidential win in November, making it more expensive to purchase a home. Average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were 4.3 percent last week, up from a 52-week low of 3.4 percent. — Associated Press Also in Business ● Delta Air Lines scrapped an order for 18 Boeing widebody Dreamliner jets valued at $4 billion at list prices, a commitment that was inherited with the company’s 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines. Atlanta-based Delta reached an agreement with Boeing on the cancellation, without disclosing terms, according to a statement from the carrier Tuesday. The airline is sticking with orders already in progress for 120 narrow-body Boeing 737-900ERs. The 787-8 Dreamliners had been on Delta’s order book since the Northwest Airlines deal. ● Britons are holding onto their cash in a sign they may be hunkering down in the face of economic uncertainties, according to the British Bankers Association. Personal deposits grew an annual 4.8 percent in November, data compiled by the BBA shows. They increased by 32.4 billion pounds ($39.7 billion) in the first 11 months of the year, outstripping the 19.8 billion-pound growth in the same period of 2015. ● A federal appeals court on Wednesday revived a lawsuit accusing Medtronic of defrauding shareholders by covering up negative side effects from its Infuse bone-growth product for nearly a decade. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which sits in St. Paul, said a lower-court judge erred in finding that the plaintiff shareholders had sued too late by waiting more than two years after learning information that could suggest an intent to defraud. Medtronic did not respond to requests for comment. — From news services Coming THURSDAY ● 8:30 a.m.: Labor Department releases weekly jobless claims. ● 10 a.m.: Mortgage company Freddie Mac releases weekly mortgage rates. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

Qualcomm said it will appeal what it called “an unprecedented and insupportable decision relating to licensing practices that have been in existence in Korea and worldwide for decades.” The fine is the largest ever levied by the South Korean agency, the KTFC said in an English-language summary of the decision it provided to EE Times. It charged Qualcomm unfairly used its patents against both customers and competitors. Specifically, Qualcomm coerced mobile phone makers to sign unfair license agreements by linking the chipset supply with patent license contracts, using its market position as a leveraging tool, the KTFC wrote. In addition, the company only offered portfolio licenses to mobile phone makers and forced unilaterally-decided licensing terms[including] making them provide patents for free. The KTFC also charged Qualcomm refused or restricted the licensing of patents essential to standards for making chips despite the request by rival modem chip makers. Standards bodies routinely require participants to license patents that pertain to their standards on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis. The KFTC began its investigation in 2014 after receiving complaints from unspecified companies. Apple, Intel, Mediatek and Huawei participated in the investigation, a KTFC spokesman said in a media briefing, according to a Reuters report. The KTFC said it also invited Nvidia and Ericsson to participate in the investigation. The fine and an order to take corrective actions is not expected to be released for four to six months, Qualcomm said in a response to the decision on its Web site. The order would require Qualcomm to renegotiate licenses with competitors and customers, Reuters said. “Qualcomm will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the KFTC’s decision to the Seoul High Court,” the company said in a statement. It “will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it,” it said. The company will be required to pay the fine within 60 days after a written order is issued, Qualcomm said. However the amount may be reduced or refunded as part of the appeals process, it added. The company argued the fine and ruling “disregard the economic realities” of a large and growing mobile market. The fine is out of proportion because “the royalties received by Qualcomm for sales of handsets into Korea accounted for less than three percent of total Qualcomm licensing revenue during Qualcomm’s fiscal 2016,” it said. Qualcomm said it will oppose any moves to apply the decision in Korea to other countries. It also claimed KTFC investigators repeatedly denied it “access to the case files and the right to cross examine witnesses.” The KTFC informed Qualcomm of its decision in November 2015, it said. Since then it has held seven hearings with the chip vendor. It plans to post details of the decision soon on its English language Web site. The KTFC fined Qualcomm about US$208 million (260 billion won) and imposed corrective orders in July 2009 after an investigation into its practices in CDMA patents. At the time, KTFC claimed the company “excluded its competitors” and charged handset makers “discriminatively high royalties for using non-Qualcomm modem chips.” In February 2015, Qualcomm paid $975 million as part of a settlement over patent disputes in China. The deal also cut royalty rates Qualcomm was charging in China. Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm, the Reuters report said. Qualcomm made as much as a third of its revenues on patent licensing in 2016. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: Qualcomms China Compromise Pays Off China Deal Squeezes Royalty Cuts from Qualcomm Qualcomm-NXP Deal Targets Connected World Email This Print Comment More Related Links Wi-Fi Expands with .11ax at CES Drone Detection: An Interesting RF Challenge Computing Got Colorful in 2016 2017 Predictions, Networking Edition DARPA Funds Small Businesses with Big Ideas Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author Re: Microsoft?? GSMD   1/2/2017 3:46:40 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I have testified in court against these so called essential patents. Most of them lack novelty and should not have been been granted in the first place. In any case all of them are algorithm patents which in most jurisdictions are not grantable and the patent holders claim that these patents are apparatus or system patents. The tricks the patent attorneys play ! Take for example the this patent claim that I came across in a web search. I think it is a Nokia patent , will head to the patent office today to check the public filings.  Now this patent has I presume lost of claims. The first claim, a typical boiler plate claim reads as A method for receiving data from a base station comprising the steps of processing a signal for communication received from the base station in a first subchannel using a radio resource of a time division multiple access system, characterized in that the communication occurs in the first subchannel simultaneously with another communication of the base station in at least one second subchannel using  the radio resource of the time division multiple access system , wherein the radio resource is a timeslot on a predetermined transmission frequency. Out of the many claims, this claim alone is mapped to some telco  standard and thisif I am not mistaken is supposed to be a standards essential patent.  This boilerplate will match pretty much to any multi-channel network. Not sure if actually came up in a lawsuit but this illustrates the nature of the issue. Now a few questions arise  - how can one claim be removed from a complete patent, does the patenet as per its own admission realize a complete device ? - the patent claims to have used known technques in a unique fashion. If that is the case, then sections like these are not necessarily unique. In another patent, two array are vector quantized to n bits each. The idea of jointly quantizing the two array into a 2n-1 vector is patented ! This is just two lines of code in an audio codec.  For examples like these a % of the phone is demanded.   Not only are most of these patents worthless, but all of them target a miniscule portion of the phone.    Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank CEO Re: ... realjjj   12/31/2016 7:00:14 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate BTW this translation from korean seems to be by Qualcomm itself (PDF warning) goo.gl/1vWq3Z Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank CEO ... realjjj   12/31/2016 6:12:48 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Qualcomm today gets payed as a % of the retail price of the entire device and gets payed a lot. http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1325631 Why exactly would Qualcomm deserve to get payed for all the technology in the device, marketing, margins, value added by the channel and so on is unknown to any sane person. Last year Apple sued Ericsoon and argued the same thing. 3G/4G is such a small fraction of what a phone is today. Qualcomm reacted violently because Korea is trying to change this absurd practice and , for Qualcomm, it's about some 8 billion in revenue per year at some 80% margins. What i haven't seen in the press are any guesses as to what is the just amount Qualcomm should receive when licensing 3G/4G standard essential patents to other silicon vendors. If Mediatek or Intel sell a mobile SoC at X$ and there is quite a bit of other technology in there, how much does Qualcomm deserve for FRAND? 2%, 4%, more?

Has Trump Trade Chief Navarro Made a Simple Economics Mistake? Dec 28, 2016 Bloomberg View EMAIL Tweet Comments 4 Lots of people think that if imports go up, GDP — and therefore growth — goes down. But that’s not right. The reason, which every econ student ought to learn, is that imports also add to consumption, investment or government spending. More About: Trump and Manufacturing Advertisement Donald Trump has chosen Peter Navarro, one of the most ardent critics of trade with China, to head his newly created National Trade Council — a move many consider to be the opening shot in a trade war. Though I think the China trade boom of the 2000s did have some harmful effects, especially on certain U.S. workers, I worry that Navarro’s overall approach to trade doesn’t make economic sense. The Cato Institute’s Dan Ikenson recently took Navarro to task for his views on trade. Ikenson says Navarro is making an elementary error when he writes: “When net exports are negative — that is, when a country runs a trade deficit by importing more than it exports — this subtracts from growth.” It’s definitely not true that trade deficits always subtract from growth. This is a common error that I see people making, so it’s important to explain why it’s wrong. Everyone who’s taken an economics class knows that gross domestic product, which represents the total value of the stuff a country produces, can be broken down into four parts: GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports Popular Now Who is Killing American Manufacturing? Humility: Your No. 1 Leadership Asset for 2016 What Automotive Needs Right Now: Quality Control, Manufacturing Efficiency That last term, “net exports,” represents the difference between exports and imports. So the equation is actually: GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Exports - Imports Because imports have a negative sign in this equation, lots of people think that if imports go up, GDP (and therefore growth) goes down. But that’s not right. The reason, which every econ student ought to learn, is that imports also add to consumption, investment or government spending. Suppose you’re living in Cleveland, and you buy a video game console made in Japan. Consumption goes up. But we don’t want to count that in GDP, since the console was made outside the U.S. So we subtract the value of the console. That’s why the “imports” term in the GDP component equation is negative. It’s just to avoid bad accounting. Similarly, if Intel Corp. imports a German machine tool, investment goes up, and we need to subtract the import to make sure GDP stays the same. In other words, imports don’t count negatively in GDP. They amount to zero. This means that a higher trade deficit doesn’t have to make the U.S. poorer. Imagine a situation where the U.S. keeps consuming and investing the same amount of domestically made goods, but starts exporting $1 billion more to foreign countries and importing $3 billion more. The trade deficit just went up by $2 billion, but GDP went up by $1 billion! Growth was positive! The new imports didn’t change U.S. GDP, but the new exports added to it. Similarly, cutting the trade deficit doesn’t necessarily make the U.S. richer. Suppose the country enacted trade restrictions that cut imports by $10 billion and cut exports by $1 billion, but (as in the previous example) left consumption and investment of domestically made goods unchanged. The trade deficit just shrunk by $9 billion, but GDP declined by $1 billion. That’s negative growth. That’s a recession! That’s going to cost American jobs. So when Navarro writes that Trump will boost growth by cutting the trade deficit, is he making this mistake? It sure looks like he is. Later in his white paper on Trump’s economic plan, Navarro writes: “Suppose the US had been able to completely eliminate its roughly $500 billion 2015 trade deficit through a combination of increased exports and decreased imports rather than simply closing its borders to trade. This would have resulted in … a real GDP growth rate that year of 5.97%.” This is just wrong. Imagine in 2015 the U.S. had closed the $500 billion trade deficit by exporting $1 more and importing $499,999,999 less. GDP would have gone up by $1, not by $500 billion. The increased exports would have added a single dollar amount to GDP, while the decreased imports would have left it unchanged. In that scenario, which fits Navarro’s description perfectly, GDP growth in 2015 would have been exactly the same as it actually was — 2.6%. Keep up on the latest manufacturing news, notes, analysis and more here on IW.com and in the IW Daily Newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning So it does look like Navarro is making a mistake that an econ professor like him really shouldn’t be making. To really figure out the impact of trade changes on GDP, we need to know a lot more than just the simple accounting equation written above. We need to know how trade interacts with domestic production. If I buy a Japanese-made laptop, does that mean I decide not to buy one made in the U.S.? If Intel buys a German-made machine tool, does that mean it chooses not to buy a different tool made domestically? The answers to these questions will determine how trade affects the economy. If imports substitute for domestic-made goods and services, then reducing trade deficits really might boost the economy — not via the simple accounting fallacy described above, but by boosting domestic producers. If tariffs on Chinese electronics caused companies like Apple Inc. to start making their products in the U.S., without spurring China to block U.S. goods, it really could give the American economy a shot in the arm. But if imports are complements to U.S. production, then trade restrictions could backfire severely. Foreign-made parts are often essential to U.S. manufacturing. Foreign call centers and other business services help many U.S. businesses concentrate on doing what they do best. Foreign-made industrial tools are essential for many U.S. manufacturers. If these imports prove very expensive to replace with domestic equivalents, then trade restrictions could create huge costs for many American businesses, forcing those businesses to be less profitable, shrink or shut. The moral of this story is that we can’t just do economics by looking at simple accounting relationships. The world is too complicated for that. Because it’s very hard to forecast the precise effects on the U.S. economy, trade restriction is an inherently risky policy. By Noah Smith Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 4 Blueneck on Dec 29, 2016 No - its Ikenson making the mistake. The equation is exactly as it appears, imports are subtracted from GDP, any first year economic student knows this. Trade deficits are a drag on GDP growth plain and simple. Estimates would put our GDP anywhere from .5% to 3% higher if we were not running chronic trade imbalances. Gomory, Tonelson, Prestowitz and Fletcher have all shown how the value of US production is inflated because the amount of imported content is not correctly accounted for as well, so the amount imports should be subtracted from GDP is very likely understated. I really wish Industry Week would stop publishing this sort of globalist propaganda, it is harming the credibility of this great site devoted to manufacturing, especially editorials from economic hacks like Dan Ikenson, or at the very least offer some sort of disclaimer on opinion pieces of this sort. Log In or Register to post comments Blueneck on Dec 29, 2016 "This means that a higher trade deficit doesn’t have to make the U.S. poorer" But it does. the trade deficit is the gage of jobs, wealth and technology leaving the country. Log In or Register to post comments Ron K. on Dec 29, 2016 I wonder if anyone at the Cato Institute will bother to address any concern about the level of "government spending" that is occurring. It would seem almost all of the tepid GDP growth that has been recorded during the Obama Presidency relates to the out of control growth in government spending (which also grew too much during G. W. Bush's presidency). At what point to economists get off the technical nuances add voice a useful opinion regarding the magnitude & scope of the elements of GDP? Log In or Register to post comments Advertisement hmoser on Dec 29, 2016 The relationships are very simple. Everything else being equal, if we produce a $billion more and import a $billion less, the GDP and our incomes will be higher. The writer appears to even admit this relationship.

The next version of Intel's processor microarchitecture is called Kaby Lake, which forms the successor to Skylake and chips using it are just now just starting to appear. Kaby Lake is a 14nm processor with very few changes to the CPU architecture compared to Skylake. It's best to view it as a refinement, promising faster CPU clock speed, higher Turbo frequencies, and a new graphics architecture allowing for better 3D and 4K performance. A small improvement in performance across the board may not be enough to tempt those already running Skylake chips into an upgrade. However, Kaby Lake looks to have an ace up its sleeve: it's great for overclocking. The highest performing Kaby Lake processor Intel currently plans to offer is the Core i7-7700K. It runs at a stock clock speed of 4.2GHz, with Turbo increasing that to 4.5GHz. That's impressive, but as HotHardware reports, Russian website OCLab (translated) managed to get hold of a 7700K and decided to see what it could really do. Using liquid nitrogen cooling, they placed the Kaby Lake chip in a Z170 motherboard and started ramping up the speed. When they were done, the chip was running steady at 7022.96MHz, so 7GHz! Typically with these massive overclocks, unless you're willing to have an abundant supply of liquid nitrogen on hand you'll never achieve them for your desktop PC. They also require all but one of the cores on the chip be shut down, rendering the CPU single core. However, here again the Kaby Lake chip impressed as that 7GHz speed was achieved with two cores still running. Related New Dell XPS 15 Leaks With Quad Core Kaby Lake, GTX 1050 GPU New Dell XPS 15 Leaks With Quad Core Kaby Lake, GTX 1050 GPU There's still some headroom left to increase the overclock speed. I mentioned the Z170 motherboard above as it's an older board. Kaby Lake is getting its own line of motherboards built specifically to support it, meaning there's potential to go quicker still once they are available. So if you enjoy overclocking your gaming PC, and especially if you are using liquid cooling, a Kaby Lake processor should definitely be on your buy list. While you won't hit 7GHz, over 5GHz should be easily achievable, and with some tweaks I'm guessing 6GHz could be attainable without turning off any of the cores. I suspect we'll get quite a few of these overclocking tests as more 7th gen Intel processors are shipped out. Hopefully they prove OCLab wasn't lucky with the processor it got and Kaby Lake chips are fantastic for overclocking across the board.

Although there are no current products in Apple’s lineup that support Thunderbolt 3, it’s widely assumed that such hardware, made possible by Intel’s Skylake microarchitecture, is in the pipeline. The folks over at Lacie, Promise, and CalDigit have all revealed new Thunderbolt 3 products at NAB 2016, bringing high bandwidth and high-capacity storage solutions to market. What is Thunderbolt 3? Thunderbolt 3 is the latest generation of the Thunderbolt hardware interface, and the direct successor to Thunderbolt 2. There are several differences between Thunderbolt 3 and previous generations, but the most obvious difference is the connector type. Previous generations used the miniDisplay Port connector, while Thunderbolt 3 uses USB-C. More importantly, Thunderbolt combines DisplayPort and PCI express into one serial signal, while providing DC power in a single cable. This means that, in theory, it’s possible to both power and connect a Thunderbolt 3-equipped machine to the rest of the peripherals that you need using a single cable. With Thunderbolt 3, bandwidth has been doubled to 40Gbps vs Thunderbolt 2’s 20Gbps. The controller also supports HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2 protocols for the ability to daisy chain dual 4K monitors at 60Hz. Needless to say, Thunderbolt 3 is a uber-promising interface that serves as the basis for the following hardware products announced today at NAB. Lacie Lacie, who is no stranger to Mac workflows big and small, revealed its 12big Thunderbolt 3 12-Bay Desktop RAID storage solution. The all aluminum enclosure features the same high design standards that we’ve come to expect from Lacie. Not only is this unit ridiculously fast, with up to 2600MB/s transfer speeds, and 2400MB/s speeds in RAID 5, but it also features an obscene amount of storage capacity. Loaded with 12 7200 RPM enterprise-class Seagate drives for a record-setting 96TB of storage, the 12big Thunderbolt 3 features a vast amount of storage space that is perfect for professional workflows. The drives are designed to operate 24×7 and are rated for 8760 hours of operation per year. For a system that ships with so many drives, you’re probably wondering about the warranty included with this setup. The 12big comes with a five-year limited warranty that covers all of the drives, the enclosure and spare parts. With this being a RAID-protected setup, Lacie has redesigned its RAID manager to offer a more intuitive interface to help administer the 12big. Users can put the RAID manager to work to assist with initial setup and storage monitoring. It also allows for advanced features like auto rebuild, drive diagnostics and CPU settings. Along with dual Thunderbolt 3 ports, the unit also features a USB 3.1-enabled USB-C port for added flexibility. Read more about Lacie’s big announcement via its press release. CalDigit T8 Extreme Thunderbolt 3 RAID CalDigit announced two new Thunderbolt 3 products today at NAB, starting with the T8 Extreme Thunderbolt 3 RAID, an 8-bay storage solution that can support both 2.5″ and 3.5″ drives. The T8 features capacities of 48TB with 3.5″ traditional spinning disks, or 8TB with using 2.5″ SSDs. CalDigit says that the T8 features speeds of up to 1440MB/s with SSDs. The T8 bay features support for RAID 0,1, 5, 6, or JBOD, and features dual Thunderbolt 3 ports for up to 40Gb/s bandwidth. The T8 also sports a full sized DisplayPort input on its rear, allowing for a quick and easy 4K 60Hz monitor setup. T4 Thunderbolt 3 The original T4 RAID featured Thunderbolt 2, but it’s receiving a Thunderbolt 3-centric update featured dual USB-C ports with 40Gb/s performance. Like the T8, the T4 features a full-sized DisplayPort connector on its rear for connecting a 4K monitor. The T4 features support for RAID 0, 1, 5 and JBOD. The bay comes in 24TB (HDD) or 4TB (SSD) varieties with hot-swappable drive bays. The updated T4 features transfer speeds up to 1440MB/s with SSD drives. If you’re looking for what will doubtlessly be a more affordable Thunderbolt 3 drive bay solution in a more compact form-factor, then the T4 is an interesting proposition. Pricing for either product has yet to be confirmed, but we’re hoping to hear more details soon. Check out CalDigit’s full press release for additional information. Promise Last, but certainly not least, the folks at Promise showed off some intriguing new Thunderbolt 3-equipped products as well. Promise’s Pegasus3 Series of Thunderbolt 3 products is headlined by an 8-bay storage solution, but it’s also revealed smaller 6-bay and 4-bay solutions for customers who don’t require as much storage space. All three products in the Pegasus3 Series support Thunderbolt 3, along with the 40GBps bandwidth that the interface affords. Promise hasn’t provided drive configurations or transfer rates in its press release, but we can assume that they will be quite speedy and feature RAID configurations like the competition. Each model in the Pegasus3 Series ships with two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which allow for daisy chaining. Like CalDigit’s two Thunderbolt 3 offerings, a full-sized DisplayPort connection is there to support directly connecting a 4K monitor. Have a look at Promise’s full press release for more details. Potential game-changer Thunderbolt 3 is still in its infancy, and as you know, no Mac that’s currently on sale supports the technology. That should change in the near future, as some Windows machines and hardware providers already support Thunderbolt 3. We’ll be sure to keep you updated with any additional news regarding Thunderbolt 3, and the new offerings from Lacie, CalDigit and Promise.

Newest HDD single drive can deliver >220 MB/sec (I have several 4TB and 6TB drives that can do this). RAIDed together, I would expect to see 12 x 200MB/sec, or approximately 2400MB/sec theoretically possible using hardware RAID controller. LaCie specs for the 12big state 2400MB/sec for a RAID5 configuration. We’ll have to wait for independent reviews to quantify what is actually possible. Thank you. LikeLike Kevin Reilly - 1 week ago Reply What they don’t tell you is that the Thunderbolt 3 is NOT backwardly compatible with Thunderbolt 2 or 1! so don’t expect to use any of these on your existing computer.

Iat Hong of Macau, Bo Zheng of Changsha, China, and Chin Hung of Macau were charged in an indictment filed in a Manhattan federal court with conspiracy, insider trading, wire fraud and computer intrusion. Prosecutors said the men made more than US$4 million by placing trades in at least five company stocks based on inside information from unnamed law firms, including about deals involving Intel Corp and Pitney Bowes Inc. The men listed themselves in brokerage records as working at information technology companies, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said in a related civil lawsuit. Hong, 26, was arrested on Sunday in Hong Kong, while Hung, 50, and Zheng, 30, are not in custody, prosecutors said. Defense lawyers could not be immediately identified. The case is the latest US insider-trading prosecution to involve hacking and follows warnings by US officials that law firms could become a prime target for hackers. “This case of cyber-meets-securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world — you are and will be targets of cyberhacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals,” US Attorney Preet Bharara said. Prosecutors said that beginning in April 2014, the trio obtained inside information by hacking two US law firms, targeting the e-mail accounts of partners working on mergers and acquisitions. Prosecutors did not identify the two law firms, or five others they said the defendants targeted, but one matched the description of New York-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, which represented Pitney Bowes in last year’s acquisition of Borderfree Inc, one of the mergers in question. The indictment said that by using a law firm employee’s credentials, the defendants installed malware on the firm’s servers to access e-mails from lawyers, including a partner responsible for the Pitney deal. Cravath, Swaine & Moore declined to comment. In March, the firm confirmed discovering a “limited breach” of its systems last year. Prosecutors also accused the defendants of trading on information stolen from a law firm representing Intel on the chipmaker’s acquisition of Altera Inc last year.

Though I think the China trade boom of the 2000s did have some harmful effects, especially on certain U.S. workers, I worry that Navarro's overall approach to trade doesn't make economic sense. The Cato Institute's Dan Ikenson recently took Navarro to task for his views on trade. Ikenson says Navarro is making an elementary error when he writes: "When net exports are negative, that is, when a country runs a trade deficit by importing more than it exports, this subtracts from growth." It's definitely not true that trade deficits always subtract from growth. This is a common error that I see people making, so it's important to explain why it's wrong. Everyone who's taken an economics class knows that gross domestic product, which represents the total value of the stuff a country produces, can be broken down into four parts: GDP = consumption + investment + government spending + net exports That last term, "net exports," represents the difference between exports and imports. So the equation is actually: GDP = consumption + investment + government spending + exports - imports Because imports have a negative sign in this equation, lots of people think that if imports go up, GDP (and therefore growth) goes down. But that's not right. The reason, which every econ student ought to learn, is that imports also add to consumption, investment or government spending. Suppose you're living in Cleveland, and you buy a video game console made in Japan. Consumption goes up. But we don't want to count that in GDP, since the console was made outside the U.S. So we subtract the value of the console. That's why the "imports" term in the GDP component equation is negative. It's just to avoid bad accounting. Similarly, if Intel Corp. imports a German machine tool, investment goes up, and we need to subtract the import to make sure GDP stays the same. In other words, imports don't count negatively in GDP. They amount to zero. This means that a higher trade deficit doesn't have to make the U.S. poorer. Imagine a situation where the U.S. keeps consuming and investing the same amount of domestically made goods, but starts exporting $1 billion more to foreign countries and importing $3 billion more. The trade deficit just went up by $2 billion dollars, but GDP went up by $1 billion! Growth was positive! The new imports didn't change U.S. GDP, but the new exports added to it. Similarly, cutting the trade deficit doesn't necessarily make the U.S. richer. Suppose the country enacted trade restrictions that cut imports by $10 billion and cut exports by $1 billion, but (as in the previous example) left consumption and investment of domestically made goods unchanged. The trade deficit just shrunk by $9 billion, but GDP declined by $1 billion. That's negative growth. That's a recession! That's going to cost American jobs. So when Navarro writes that Trump will boost growth by cutting the trade deficit, is he making this mistake? It sure looks like he is. Later in his white paper on Trump's economic plan, Navarro writes: "Suppose the US had been able to completely eliminate its roughly $500 billion 2015 trade deficit through a combination of increased exports and decreased imports rather than simply closing its borders to trade. This would have resulted in … a real GDP growth rate that year of 5.97%." Who's hired? Check our People in Business Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis This is just wrong. Imagine in 2015 the U.S. had closed the $500 billion trade deficit by exporting $1 more and importing $499,999,999,999 less. GDP would have gone up by $1, not by $500 billion. The increased exports would have added a single dollar amount to GDP, while the decreased imports would have left it unchanged. In that scenario, which fits Navarro's description perfectly, GDP growth in 2015 would have been exactly the same as it actually was — 2.6 percent. So it does look like Navarro is making a mistake that an econ professor like him really shouldn't be making. To really figure out the impact of trade changes on GDP, we need to know a lot more than just the simple accounting equation written above. We need to know how trade interacts with domestic production. If I buy a Japanese-made laptop, does that mean I decide not to buy one made in the U.S.? If Intel buys a German-made machine tool, does that mean it chooses not to buy a different tool made domestically? The answers to these questions will determine how trade affects the economy. If imports substitute for domestic-made goods and services, then reducing trade deficits really might boost the economy — not via the simple accounting fallacy described above, but by boosting domestic producers. If tariffs on Chinese electronics caused companies like Apple Inc. to start making their products in the U.S., without spurring China to block U.S. goods, it really could give the American economy a shot in the arm. But if imports are complements to U.S. production, then trade restrictions could backfire severely. Foreign-made parts are often essential to U.S. manufacturing. Foreign call centers and other business services help many U.S. businesses concentrate on doing what they do best. Foreign-made industrial tools are essential for many U.S. manufacturers. If these imports prove very expensive to replace with domestic equivalents, then trade restrictions could create huge costs for many American businesses, forcing those businesses to be less profitable, shrink or shut. The moral of this story is that we can't do economics just by looking at simple accounting relationships. The world is too complicated for that. Because it's very hard to forecast the precise effects on the U.S. economy, trade restriction is an inherently risky policy. Noah Smith is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Krisztian Bocsi / Bloomberg UAE can steer driverless future Chris Nelson December 28, 2016 Updated: December 29, 2016 12:18 PM Related Tesla postpones price hike for British customers Autonomous tech safety is a primary concern Masdar City’s driverless cars system celebrates milestone A world of driverless cars on the road to realisation Dubai puts autonomous smart car through its paces on roads Imagine yourself driving to Abu Dhabi International Airport on the motorway and an important delivery you had hoped would arrive before you left turns up at your front door at home. Frustrating at the least. But, in the near future, such a scenario would be no cause for concern, according to Volker Bischoff, the Middle East general manager/vice president for the German multinational engineering and electronics company Robert Bosch. "Your smart car will be connected to your smart home, and you can let the car drive itself while you speak to the delivery man and open the front door to allow him to deliver the package," Mr Bischoff tells The National. (See video below) And once at the airport, he says, there will no longer be the hassle of finding a parking spot. "When you arrive, you exit your car at the entrance to the [airport] parking garage and the car autonomously proceeds inside and finds a spot completely by itself. This Automated Valet Parking function from Bosch is simply controlled through an app on your smartphone. This will reduce queues and issues with tight parking spots." Vision While the robots have been gradually easing us from behind the steering wheel for a while now, how will a driverless car actually work for the average driver? "Vehicle connectivity, coupled with innovative solutions for operating the vehicle, will create an entirely new driving experience in the coming years," says Mr Bischoff. "Bosch’s current test vehicles [on trial in the US, Germany and Japan] inform the driver when a stretch of the road is available for automated driving. Using a highly accurate map, the vehicle always knows where it is on the road. The car compares its sensor data in real-time with information stored in the HD map; for instance this could be road markings and crash barriers. To hand over driving tasks to the vehicle, the driver must press two buttons on the steering wheel simultaneously for several seconds. Then, on the central display, the road on the HD map turns blue when automated driving mode is activated. The display also shows the driver everything that the vehicle’s environment sensors can see, as well as how much time remains before the driver must once again take over the wheel." While the vision of a wonderful new transport world is nearing reality, there are still significant hurdles to overcome regarding driverless vehicles, not least the need for infrastructure that can support the technology. "Automation is the biggest advancement in motor vehicles since the horseless carriage, and just as roads upgraded from dirt to pavement decades ago, our infrastructure must similarly evolve today," says Kevin Curry, who is responsible for public sector global application sales for Infor, a US-based software multinational. "Without public roads, bridges, and information systems that match the technological prowess of private sector inventions, autonomous vehicles will reach only a fraction of their true potential." Goals The UAE may well become among the frontrunners regarding infrastructure, says Mr Bischoff. "This is of course very difficult to predict, but what I will say is that the population in the Gulf region is young and tech-savvy, and usually when something catches on here it spreads very fast. "There are also ambitious goals in place, especially Dubai a Smart City, which means it might be faster than the average city in adapting the infrastructure to automated vehicles." If such infrastructure is in place, by gathering and analysing information from roads and vehicles, the rules of the road will adjust throughout the day, resulting in the smoothest, fastest and most efficient way to travel, says Mr Curry. "The integration of sensor technology and the enterprise resource management software that organise, manage, and monitor road repairs, bridges, signs, signal systems, repair facilities, and inspection programs, will bring the age of driverless cars to fruition by allowing citizens to benefit from the full potential of safety and convenience improvements they have to offer." Mr Bischoff adds that this region is maybe more open than others to adopting self-driving vehicles. "Generally the sentiment here is perhaps more positive than in the rest of the world," he says. "The Gulf region loves its cars, and there are lots of straight, wide freeways where drivers who commute on a daily basis – for example between Dubai and Abu Dhabi – that could really benefit from the comfort and convenience of an automated car." He says there is huge market potential for connected and automated mobility. "A whole host of companies are working on these concepts around the world, and with Dubai’s Smart Driverless Mobility Strategy in place, we predict that the market will continue to grow. The global market for connected mobility is expected to grow by nearly 25 per cent annually between 2017 and 2021." Embryonic But the potential for fully autonomous car sales is less than eye-popping, Dubai-based Tarik Taman, the general manager for India, Middle East & Africa at Infor, tells The National. "The market for driverless – ie fully autonomous vehicles – will remain a very small percentage – 1 to 2 per cent of total vehicle sales through 2025 with the overwhelming majority of these vehicles used for commercial use in controlled environments. The remaining autonomous vehicle sales will be for ride hailing service fleets." Despite this, Bosch, like others, has been investing heavily in the embryonic sector. "In 2015, Bosch raised R&D expenditure to €6.4 billion (Dh24.56bn), and for the past five years we have spent no less than 8.1 per cent of our sales revenue on R&D," says Mr Bischoff. In 2015, sales revenue came in at €70.6bn. "Currently, there are almost 2,500 engineers working to further develop driver assistance systems and automated driving at Bosch. In 2016, Bosch will reach sales of €1bn for driver assistance technology." As with any emerging sector, cost and efficiency are paramount. Intel recently teamed up with the car-parts suppliers Mobileye and Delphi Automotive after they launched a collaboration to develop a low-cost system for self-driving vehicles that is slated to begin sales to car makers in 2019. Intel chips capable of processing 12 trillion operations per second will be inside the autonomous cars being designed by the two parts firms. Safe "This is really about the path to production," Glen De Vos, Delphi’s vice president of engineering, told Bloomberg. "We’re shifting the focus away from just talking about the technology. The dialogue about automation is moving from, ‘Will it happen?’ to ‘When will it happen?’" Volvo Car Group has begun delivering robot taxis to Uber Technologies, which are being tested in Pittsburgh as part of a US$300 million development deal. Ford, which has promised to sell 100,000 self-driving cars for ride hailing by 2021, invested $150m with China’s Baidu in Velodyne Lidar. Mobileye and Intel already have a partnership with BMW to field a self-driving car by 2021. Adding Intel’s high-speed processors to the Delphi/Mobileye partnership will, they hope, allow the companies to develop a system robust enough to handle the rigours of everyday driving – without a driver behind the wheel. The cost of the system will be about $5,000 per car when it is introduced, but will probably drop rapidly as the technology becomes more widespread, Mr De Vos says. But for the technology to be safe, the entire vehicle needs to be adapted to automation, from the powertrain to the brakes, steering, display instruments, navigation and sensors, as well as connectivity inside and outside the vehicle, says Mr Bischoff. "To ensure that the vehicle remains safe and stable in the event of failure of one of these components, redundancy needs to be built into the system." Other limitations of today’s technology come into play, says Mr Taman. For instance, "when vehicles are operating in snow-covered roads where lane markers become invisible to cameras making it difficult to keep vehicles in the lane. Similarly, when vehicles enter tunnels they can lose their connectivity to mapping applications. "These limitations will be overcome, but it may take several years before they can reach a level of reliability needed to produce autonomous vehicles for widespread adoption of vehicles for consumers in all environments," he says. For Bosch, the vision does not stop with driverless cars, road haulage is also on the agenda. "Truck drivers have tough jobs, working long hours and driving seemingly endless kilometres seated in a small cabin," says Mr Bischoff. "We are working on connected technologies to take the strain off the drivers by basically functioning as copilots who can relieve the strain. "We are looking at real-world cases where automated driving can offer the greatest benefits. One such thing is platooning, which involves multiple trucks traveling with 10 to 15 metres between them, all following a lead vehicle to which they are electronically connected and linked along a virtual longitudinal axis. The lead vehicle controls acceleration, brakes and steering for the follower trucks, ensuring that they keep a safe distance. Automated driving in the slipstream of the truck in front not only cuts fuel consumption by up to 10 percent, but also eases pressure on the driver as well as improves road safety." Depending on how it is configured, automated platooning is likely to take at least another five to 10 years to reach maturity, Mr Bischoff says. This could also make the roads much safer, he adds. "Bosch accident researchers estimate that, of all accidents caused by trucks involving physical injury, 90 per cent could be avoided in the future by using these systems." Road accidents are part and parcel of human-controlled driving today but when one happens involving a robot-driven car, the impact to public perception can be a serious problem. Visionary If a driver is not prepared to take over control of the vehicle immediately, "bad things can happen as evidenced in the recent crashes of Tesla Model S vehicles being operated in ‘autopilot’ mode". "This presents a public perception problem because the primary selling point of an autonomous vehicle is that the driver shouldn’t have to be fully engaged," says Mr Taman. "Put another way, if the driver has to have both hands on the wheel and be prepared to take over control of the vehicle in a split second, they might as well be driving a non or semi-autonomous vehicle." However, in the UAE, Mr Bischoff says steps being taken in the driverless sector are providing a positive for public perception. "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has expressed a desire for 25 per cent of transportation in Dubai to be driverless by 2030, and this kind of visionary thinking will of course have an impact on public opinion," he says. "A couple of months ago, the RTA demonstrated a driverless 10-seater car in Downtown Dubai, which is a great way of educating the public about the technology and how we can benefit from connected and automated mobility in the UAE." Transformation But aside from technical, perceptual and infrastructure challenges, legal considerations will primarily dictate the speed at which fully-autonomous driving becomes mainstream on the world’s roads. "This is something that is more in the hands of … law makers, since they are the ones who need to pave the way for this technology in the vehicles and make decisions on whether automated driving is permissible within the nation’s laws," Mr Bischoff says. In the US, a few days of regulatory tussles were enough for Uber to pull its fleet of self-driving cars from the streets of San Francisco and send them instead to friendlier territory in Arizona. The California department of motor vehicles banned Uber’s self-driving cars from San Francisco on Wednesday last week, just days after they first deployed. In response, Uber moved out. "Our cars departed for Arizona by truck," Uber said. "We’ll be expanding our self-driving pilot there in the next few weeks." Mr Curry says a change of approach regarding the future of transport is required. "‘What can driverless cars do to comply with the government?" is the wrong question," he says. "The governments must ask themselves, ‘what can we do for our future cars?’ and the sooner the better. "Connected cars require a nation-wide transformation of our cities and we are nowhere near ready. It is time for our innovators, our contractors and our national leaders to start working together to bring technology across industries up to par. "It is time to break down silos and embrace the synergistic future. It is time for us to get behind the wheel and steer change." chnelson@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Tesla postpones price hike for British customers Autonomous tech safety is a primary concern Masdar City’s driverless cars system celebrates milestone A world of driverless cars on the road to realisation More Technology Review: SignEasy takes the legwork out of submitting your documents Badly burned Samsung sees tough year ahead Robin Mills: Energy advancements have a habit of changing society South African mines dig deep into technology MOST VIEWED Business | All Dubai Harbour: Sheikh Mohammed unveils major new project with Middle East’s biggest marina Adnoc CEO Al Jaber says we are just getting started after steering unprecedented year of change at Abu Dhabi state oil company Lack of snow chills French ski resorts The National’s business reporters look ahead to what 2017 has in store Signs of recovery adding up for US oil sector Emirati takes the road less travelled with career in UAE tourism UAE online job postings down 35% but improvement expected Insurers in UAE rally amid M&A speculation Majid Al Futtaim to open distribution centre in Dubai amid expansion How Saudi Arabia is building the date trade More Most Viewed Dubai Harbour: Sheikh Mohammed unveils major new project with Middle East’s biggest marina Boss of Dh50m foreign currency scheme in Dubai arrested Family’s tears for Layan, ‘just a shy, innocent child’ murdered in Istanbul Album review: Run the Jewels 3 is a real jewel in the crown of hip-hop Battle for Mosul is emerging as a lost opportunity Pair fined Dh10,000 for insulting biker bride and husband online Escape from Aleppo: a reporter’s story of leaving the city he grew up in Adnoc CEO Al Jaber says we are just getting started after steering unprecedented year of change at Abu Dhabi state oil company How fog caused recent flight disruptions at UAE airports Gabriel Jesus, 19-year-old Brazilian prodigy, arrives in England just in time for Manchester City More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS SME profile: Dubai entrepreneurs are making their name in wills Year in review: SMEs were the engines of the UAE economy in 2016 Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Survivors describe terror inside Istanbul nightclub Rafa Nadal still going strong, Andy Murray now the hunted: 5 things we learnt from Mubadala World Tennis Championship About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

One such recipient, Allen “Splave” Golibersuch, recently shared good news on the overclocking front. TechPowerUp reports that Splave managed to cross the 7GHz barrier using the aforementioned i7-7700K. Specifically, he was able to hit a benchmark-stable 7,022.96MHz (multiplier of 69x and a bus speed of 101.78MHz) using an ASRock Z170 OC Formula motherboard. That said, some concessions were made in order to achieve the milestone. Splave had to disable HyperThreading as well as two of the processor’s four physical cores. The Vcore voltage, meanwhile, was pushed all the way up to 2.00V which meant liquid nitrogen had to be used for cooling. That said, the chip reportedly completed PiFast in 9.02 seconds and zipped through SuperPi 32M in roughly four minutes and 20 seconds. When paired with an Asus GTX 1080 STRIX OC video card, the combo turned in a score of 643,316 in Aquamark and 86,798 in 3DMark 05. Some will no doubt discredit the feat due to the fact that two cores were disabled and / or liquid nitrogen had to be used and that’s a fair argument. With NDAs set to lift any day now, most will be more interested in how the chip performs in an everyday setup with either air or basic liquid cooling.

Video Need a data center location? Iceland wants you The San Andreas Fault gets all the attention, media coverage and movies, but it’s not the fault line the tech sector needs to worry about. A much bigger problem lies to the north, and some of the most important tech firms are directly in its crosshairs. The Cascadia subduction zone runs north-south from Canada to northern California and sits roughly 80 miles offshore. That’s the good news, since it’s 80 miles out to sea, as opposed to the San Andreas and Hayward faults, which run right through the Silicon Valley and East Bay, respectively. The bad news is it is capable of a much more severe quake. The Cascadia fault is believed to be capable of a 9.4 magnitude quake. Residents of the Pacific Northwest got quite a fright last year when The New Yorker published an article called “The Really Big One,” which detailed the potential of a 9.4 magnitude earthquake hitting the area. The article outlined projections for 13,000 immediate deaths, one million left homeless, and the whole region left without power and water for months. The quote that shook everyone up came from Kenneth Murphy, the director of the division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that's responsible for that whole region. "Our operating assumption is that everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast,” he said. That includes the Washington state capital of Olympia. This puts four significant technology companies directly in the line of fire: Amazon, Microsoft, Intel and T-Mobile. Amazon is located in downtown Seattle, which will get hit much harder. Microsoft and T-Mobile, along with Nintendo of America, are further inland to the east, which should lessen the rumbling. If the quake is bad, the aftermath will be far worse. The chairman of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission (OSSPAC) told The New Yorker it estimates that in the I-5 corridor it will take between one and three months to restore electricity after the earthquake, a month to a year to restore drinking water and sewer service, six months to a year to restore major highways, and eighteen months to restore healthcare facilities. That basically means the PNW will be uninhabitable for months and perhaps more than a year. If that becomes the case, Microsoft, Amazon, T-Mobile, and Intel, along with Boeing, Starbucks, Costco, Groupon, and many other companies, could be put out of business as their employees are all evacuated from the region. Needless to say, this will really disrupt their businesses, but it will also disrupt yours. What happens to the two largest cloud providers in the business, Amazon and Microsoft? Sure, their data centers are scattered all over the country and will be unaffected, but the management of those cloud services is handled out of Amazon and Microsoft headquarters. Billing is done through corporate, not the remote data centers. And if the worst case scenarios happens and Seattle must be evacuated, Jeff Bezos and Satya Nadella will have much bigger concerns than getting people to pay their AWS or Azure bill. I asked both companies about these things and was basically stonewalled. The only company to offer anything resembling an answer was Intel. Down on the outskirts west of Portland is the city of Hillsboro, where Intel has a significant amount of its engineering teams. Most x86 work, CPUs and chipsets, is done there, and the killer quake could bring chip development to a halt. Intel told me it has contingency plans in place for a wide variety of emergencies and disasters that they review and update regularly, and do drills with the local emergency services. After all, the Santa Clara HQ is sitting smack between the San Andreas and Hayward faults. So even though Amazon and Microsoft wouldn't fess up, I have to think they have a similar kind of emergency plan to keep their companies functioning and cloud services going even if a massive quake does leave Seattle in ruins. But as a customer, it can't hurt you to ask them. They may not answer me but they have to answer a customer or potential customer. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

Intel's Beignet Working On More OpenCL 2.0 Support Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 28 December 2016 at 06:25 AM EST. Add A Comment It's unfortunate that the Beignet developers weren't able to get OpenCL 2.0 support fully working for Intel graphics hardware by the end of 2016, but nevertheless the project is ongoing and more OCL2 work landed today. Over in Beignet Git is more of the OpenCL 2.0 upbringing. There is generic address space memcpy and memset, enabling -cl-std=CL2.0, adding some bitcode files related to OpenCL 2, add read_write image type of image APIs, a prolifing feature for CL2, and more. The OpenCL 2.0 support is going bit by bit into Git master with Beignet's OCL20 branch not being used anymore for staging the new code. Hopefully it won't be too much longer before seeing a full open-source OpenCL 2.0 implementation for Intel's graphics processors.

REUTERS/Edgar Su By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK Three Chinese citizens have been criminally charged in the United States with trading on confidential corporate information obtained by hacking into networks and servers of law firms working on mergers, U.S. prosecutors said on Tuesday. Iat Hong of Macau, Bo Zheng of Changsha, China, and Chin Hung of Macau were charged in an indictment filed in Manhattan federal court with conspiracy, insider trading, wire fraud and computer intrusion. Prosecutors said the men made more than $4 million by placing trades in at least five company stocks based on inside information from unnamed law firms, including about deals involving Intel Corp and Pitney Bowes Inc. The men listed themselves in brokerage records as working at information technology companies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a related civil lawsuit. Hong, 26, was arrested on Sunday in Hong Kong, while Hung, 50, and Zheng, 30, are not in custody, prosecutors said. Defense lawyers could not be immediately identified. The case is the latest U.S. insider trading prosecution to involve hacking, and follows warnings by U.S. officials that law firms could become prime targets for hackers. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: you are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said. Prosecutors said that beginning in April 2014, the trio obtained inside information by hacking two U.S. law firms and targeting the email accounts of law firm partners working on mergers and acquisitions. Prosecutors did not identify the two law firms, or five others they said the defendants targeted. But one matched the description of New York-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, which represented Pitney Bowes in its 2015 acquisition of Borderfree Inc, one of the mergers in question. The indictment said that by using a law firm employee's credentials, the defendants installed malware on the firm's servers to access emails from lawyers, including a partner responsible for the Pitney deal. Cravath declined to comment. In March, Cravath confirmed discovering a "limited breach" of its systems in 2015. Prosecutors also accused the defendants of trading on information stolen from a law firm representing Intel on the chipmaker's acquisition of Altera Inc in 2015. Intel's merger counsel on the deal was New York-based Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. The law firm declined to comment. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she was aware of the reports about the case but knew nothing about it. The case is U.S. v.

The company’s upcoming BRIX Gaming GT Desktop has been spotted on one of its official websites, which will likely get pulled very soon. However, the website has revealed all the specs of the device and it seems like a pretty interesting device. Firstly, Gigabyte will be offering two different variants of the device: one with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU and another with the 1080 GPU. For the CPU, Gigabyte is including a 6th gen Intel Core i7-6700K processor clocked at 4.0GHz which is quite interesting to see as most OEMs are opting for 7th gen Intel processors for their new devices at the moment. The CPU does come with Intel’s Turbo Boost 2.0 technology, which is definitely a major plus point since it is capable of providing a lot of power during gaming. This, obviously, makes the device capable of powering virtual reality headsets like the HTC Vive which is pretty neat. Gigabyte is also including 16GB of DDR4 RAM, 240GB of SSD and 1TB HDD for internal storage. The device comes with one USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB 3.0 Type-A ports. The device also has Bluetooth 4.2 and 808.11ac for Wi-Fi built-in. At the moment, pricing details for the BRIX Gaming GT aren’t available which is expected considering the fact that it hasn’t been announced officially just yet. The company will likely reveal more details at CES, so we’ll let you know when that happens. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Iat Hong of Macau, Bo Zheng of Changsha, China, and Chin Hung of Macau were charged in an indictment filed in Manhattan federal court with conspiracy, insider trading, wire fraud and computer intrusion. Prosecutors said the men made more than $4 million by placing trades in at least five company stocks based on inside information from unnamed law firms, including about deals involving Intel Corp and Pitney Bowes Inc. The men listed themselves in brokerage records as working at information technology companies, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said in a related civil lawsuit. Hong, 26, was arrested on Sunday in Hong Kong, while Hung, 50, and Zheng, 30, are not in custody, prosecutors said. Defense lawyers could not be immediately identified. The case is the latest US insider trading prosecution to involve hacking, and follows warnings by U.S. officials that law firms could become prime targets for hackers. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: you are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," US Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said. Prosecutors said that beginning in April 2014, the trio obtained inside information by hacking two US law firms and targeting the email accounts of law firm partners working on mergers and acquisitions. Prosecutors did not identify the two law firms, or five others they said the defendants targeted. But one matched the description of New York-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, which represented Pitney Bowes in its 2015 acquisition of Borderfree Inc, one of the mergers in question. The indictment said that by using a law firm employee's credentials, the defendants installed malware on the firm's servers to access emails from lawyers, including a partner responsible for the Pitney deal. Cravath declined to comment. In March, Cravath confirmed discovering a "limited breach" of its systems in 2015. Prosecutors also accused the defendants of trading on information stolen from a law firm representing Intel on the chipmaker's acquisition of Altera Inc in 2015. Intel's merger counsel on the deal was New York-based Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. The law firm declined to comment. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she was aware of the reports about the case but knew nothing about it. The case is U.S. v. Hong et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-cr-360. - With additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in Beijing Share Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Pinterest Read More:  United States   Chinese   Securities and Exchange Commission   hacking   insider trading   /sports/01/03/17/chelsea-rivals-want-spurs-win-pochettino /sports/01/03/17/nadal-hopes-schedule-change-brings-success /sports/01/03/17/federer-returns-in-style-to-beat-evans-at-hopman /sports/01/03/17/ferrer-muguruza-break-australian-hearts-in-brisbane /business/01/03/17/pension-hike-must-come-from-sss-funds-diokno LATEST NEWS MOST READ Chelsea rivals want Spurs win: Pochettino January 03, 2017 Nadal hopes schedule change brings success January 03, 2017 Federer returns in style to beat Evans at Hopman January 03, 2017 Ferrer, Muguruza break Australian hearts in Brisbane January 03, 2017 Pension hike must come from SSS funds: Diokno January 03, 2017 Defoe frustrates Liverpool, Aguero helps Man City win January 03, 2017 Fil-Am YouTuber dances live for a cause January 03, 2017 China navy confirms carrier conducted drills in S.

Qualcomm said that it will appeal the decision which would be the largest ever levied in South Korea. The Korea Fair Trade Commission which is very nearly the unfortunate acronym of a US fried chicken outfit  (KFTC) ruled  Qualcomm abused its dominant market position and forced handset makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips. Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chipmakers such as Intel, Samsung  and MediaTek , the regulator said, hindering their sales and leaving their products vulnerable to lawsuits. The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers if requested – measures that would affect the U.S. firm’s dealings with major tech companies including Apple, Intel, Samsung and Huawei if upheld. The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm’s practices in 2014 following complaints from industry participants, but did not name specific companies. Foreign companies including Apple, Intel, MediaTek and Huawei expressed their views during the regulator’s deliberation process, KFTC Secretary General Shin Young-son told a media briefing in the country’s administrative capital. Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it. “Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision,” it said in a statement. While the fine is big, analysts said that the KFTC’s orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker. The ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones.   Tags: chips, intel, mobile, Qualcomm Search for: Recent Articles Don't look at that email when you wake up Checking your email on your smartphone after you wake up is a bad way to start the day, according to[...] 2016 a bad year for tech celebs too While the world moaned about the surprise exit of so many celebs in 2016 it was a pretty rubbish yea[...] Germany thinking of fining Facebook for each fake news story The German government is thinking of slapping a huge fine on Facebook for each fake news story it pu[...] Lumia has gone the way of the Dodo It is starting to look like the end is near for Microsoft's Lumia handsets and it is about to go the[...] Consumer Reports will not bow to Apple pressure The nonprofit outfit Consumer Reports is standing by its damning verdict on the MacBook Pro and is r[...] © 2017 TechEye.

After years of researchers saying artificial intelligence (A.I.) was on the cusp of a revolution, the technology has made major advances this past year. And now, finally, the beginnings of that major A.I. revolution seem to be here. "It's been a huge year in A.I.," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. "We've seen industry giants -- like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, IBM, Intel, and Nvidia -- either make A.I. their company 'north star' or add and advance the craft with new offerings to democratize A.I." In this past year, the land grab for anything A.I. was one of the most noticeable aspects of this industry. For instance, in this past year alone, at least 20 artificial intelligence companies have been acquired, according to CB Insights, a tech market analysis company. In 2016, Apple acquired Emotient, Tuplejump, and Turi, while Salesforce bought PredictionIQ and MetaMind; Google picked up Api.ai and Moodstocks; and Intel acquired Itseez, Nervana Systems and Movidius. Twitter, eBay, Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, and GE also acquired A.I. companies. Some of the companies getting scooped up were startups, meaning the big companies were often as interested in the A.I. researchers as much as the technology they were working on. That's because big players in, and out, of the tech industry see the writing on the wall. A.I. is going to be a big player, whether it's being used to help customers pick out the perfect jacket online, or give them directions around an accident on their commute home, find fraudulent action on client accounts, or interact with clients and customers using voice commands, text, and chat apps. Executives at online retailer 1-800-Flowers, for instance, say artificial intelligence technology is so important that it will completely change their business. "We are on the cusp of a change as big as when e-commerce hit," said Chris McCann, president and CEO of 1-800-Flowers.com, in an interview this fall. "It's giving us the opportunity to have such deep relationships with our customers that it'll be like the company hasn't existed before." This past May, Google showed how focused it is on A.I. during its annual Google I/O developers conference, unveiling A.I.-powered products like Google Assistant, its Google Home device, the Allo chat app and the Duo video chat app. And this past October, IBM president and CEO Ginni Rometty said during a keynote at the company's World of Watson conference that in the next five years, every major decision -- personal or business -- will be made with the help of IBM's Watson A.I. system. A statement like that takes a lot of confidence in advances coming in the technology. "We are about where I expected we'd be in the industry but, be aware, this is a moving bar and one big breakthrough could change this dynamic dramatically. And there are a lot of people in the hunt for that breakthrough," said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group. "Next year, we'll see a lot more smart systems, an increasingly capable group of smart assistants and far more self-driving, and even self-flying, vehicles being tested." In other words, in the coming year artificial intelligence advances may begin to cascade, instead of simply inch forward. And A.I. itself could begin to fuel that progress. "Right now, A.I. is largely being created by humans," said Enderle. "The big wave will likely come when A.I. systems are more aggressively used to create future A.I. systems. When that happens, the speed of advancement will likely follow less of a linear scale and more of an algorithmic one." For Moorhead, he thinks 2017 will see an increasing number of companies using artificial intelligence-based platforms in their apps and services. "I also think we will start to see enterprises jumping onto the A.I. bandwagon," he added. "I expect the Tesla full autonomous car capabilities will be close to be turned on... I don't believe we're yet at the tipping point [with A.I.] but we are close. The tipping point will likely happen next year as A.I. makes its way into more apps." Dave Schubmehl, an analyst with IDC, said he too expects to see more enterprises adopting A.I. technologies in the coming year. "I think we'll see a significant increase in the distribution and use of A.I. that is embedded within enterprise applications, providing guidance, recommendations, and predictions," he said. "I think we're on track as far as what we're seeing in the marketplace." Schubmehl, however, said while there have been strong advances in conversational A.I. systems, he's disappointed there haven't been more advances in consumer-focused digital assistants. Moorhead, agreed, adding, "Intelligent agents, like Alexa and Siri, are behind where I thought they'd be." They're hoping, though, that 2017 will see that turn around.

 UPDATE 2-U.S. accuses Chinese citizens of hacking law firms, insider trading Reuters Dec. 27, 2016, 2:17 PM 1,493 facebook linkedin twitter email print (Adds details on charges) By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Three Chinese citizens have been criminally charged in the United States with trading on confidential corporate information obtained by hacking into networks and servers of law firms working on mergers, U.S. prosecutors said on Tuesday. Iat Hong of Macau, Bo Zheng of Changsha, China, and Chin Hung of Macau were charged in an indictment filed in Manhattan federal court with conspiracy, insider trading, wire fraud and computer intrusion. Prosecutors said the men made over $4 million by placing trades in at least five company stocks based on inside information from unnamed law firms, including about deals involving Intel Corp and Pitney Bowes Inc. The men listed themselves in brokerage records as working at information technology companies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a related civil lawsuit. Hong, 26, was arrested on Sunday in Hong Kong, while Hung, 50, and Zheng, 30, are not in custody, prosecutors said. Defense lawyers could not be immediately identified. The case is the latest U.S. insider trading prosecution to involve hacking, and follows warnings by U.S. officials that law firms could become a prime target for hackers. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: you are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said. Prosecutors said that beginning in April 2014, the trio obtained inside information by hacking two U.S. law firms and targeting the email accounts of law firm partners working on mergers and acquisitions. Prosecutors did not identify the two law firms, or five others they said the defendants targeted. But one matched the description of New York-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, which represented Pitney Bowes in its 2015 acquisition of Borderfree Inc, one of the mergers in question. The indictment said that by using a law firm employee's credentials, the defendants installed malware on the firm's servers to access emails from lawyers, including a partner responsible for the Pitney deal. Cravath declined to comment. In March, Cravath confirmed discovering a "limited breach" of its systems in 2015. Prosecutors also accused the defendants of trading on information stolen from a law firm representing Intel on the chipmaker's acquisition of Altera Inc in 2015. Intel was represented by Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. Weil Gotshal did not respond to requests for comment. Gibson Dunn, which advised Intel on antitrust matters, had no immediate comment. The case is U.S. v. Hong et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-cr-360.

All of the new devices will include Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake Core i-series processors. Also, they're all Signature PCs, which means that you can expect a bloatware-free experience. This will be a big deal for anyone that may have lost faith in the brand due to some issues with third-party malware. ThinkPad Yoga 370 Lenovo's ThinkPad Yoga 370 will include a new 13.3-inch 1080p display, along with up to 16GB of DDR4 RAM, up to 1TB SSD, and 10 hours of battery life. It also includes Thunderbolt 3, which means that it will be USB Type-C. The GPU Intel HD Graphics 620, but a Thunderbolt 3 port can handle up to two 4K monitors. The ThinkPad Yoga 370 will be available beginning in March, starting at $1,264. ThinkPad T470 Lenovo says that the ThinkPad T470 is meant to be the "standard 14" workhorse" for business deployments, "complete with the long standing security and management features, along with the de facto MilSpec certification." It sports a 14-inch 1080p display, 32GB DDR4 RAM, GeForce 940MX GPU with 2GB GDDR5, Thunderbolt 3, an Ethernet port, Windows 10 Pro, and the company is promising 18 hours of battery life. The T470 will be available in February, starting at $914. ThinkPad T570 Also aimed at the business market, the ThinkPad T570 is similar to the T470, but with a 15.6-inch 1080p touchscreen; however, it also offers a model with a 4K non-touch display. Unfortunately, there's no option for 4K and touch. Lenovo says that this iteration of the T570 is 8% lighter than its predecessor at 4.4-pounds, and 10% thinner. It will be available in March, starting at $909. ThinkPad T470s The ThinkPad T470s, unlike the T470, uses integrated graphics, but this is an ultrabook that weighs under 3-pounds and is under 19mm thick. The 14-inch display is offered in 1080p and 1440p, but only the FHD model comes with a touchscreen. It also promises up to 10.5 hours of battery life, up to 24GB of DDR4 RAM, supports Thunderbolt 3, and comes with either Windows 10 Home or Pro. It will be available in February, starting at $1,099. ThinkPad T470p The 470p is a bit heavier - at four pounds - than the 's' model, but it's also more powerful. Aimed at businesses, it includes a discrete Nvidia GeForce 940MX 2GB GPU, and up to 32GB of RAM. Like the 's' model, it offers the same 14-inch display options (FHD, FHD touch, and WQHD) and an Ethernet port. You'll find three USB 3.0 ports on the T470p, but no Thunderbolt 3, or any USB Type-C, for that matter. It will be available in March, starting at $1,049. ThinkPad 13 The ThinkPad 13 is meant to appeal to those on a budget, such as individuals, students, and "business shops". Starting at $674, it's certainly one of the less expensive options for a device with a Windows 10 Pro license and USB Type-C (no Thunderbolt). The display is 13.3-inch 1080p touch, and it's available in configurations with up to 32GB DDR4 RAM and 512GB of storage. It will be available in January. ThinkPad L470 If you've been shopping around for a laptop with a VGA-out port, then look no further. Of course, this device is positioned as a "mainstream business" PC. The 14-inch display is available in 720p and 1080p, neither of which offers touch. There are a number of options on the device, with integrated or discrete GPUs, up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM, and up to 1TB HDD or up to 256GB SSD. Aside from VGA-out, you'll also find an Ethernet port, three USB 3.0, and a 4-in-1 card reader. The ThinkPad L470 will be available in March, starting at $779. ThinkPad L570 The L570 offers similar display options as the L470, except at 15.6-inches. There are also even more ports, such as a fourth USB 3.0, and mini DisplayPort. Unfortunately, the L570 isn't offered with a discrete GPU, but offers up to 1TB HDD or 512GB SSD. The ThinkPad L570 will be available in March starting at $909. ThinkPad X270 Lenovo says that the X270 is a 12-inch "business road warrior" system that is "optimized around battery life with the potential of over 20 hours of run time thanks to the dual configurable battery architecture." It's offered with 4, 8, or 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and up to 2TB HDD or 512GB SSD. The 12.5-inch display is offered in HD or FHD touch, and the device comes in at only 2.9-pounds. It will be available in March starting at $909. Of course, in today's day and age of USB Type-C, there's a need for docks and dongles. Lenovo will be offering two new docks, one of which is for standard USB Type-C, and the other is for Thunderbolt 3. Both docks add a variety of ports to whatever device they're attached to. The USB-C dock will be available in January for $199.99, and the Thunderbolt 3 dock will show up in February for $279.99. And finally, Lenovo is announcing a pair of 1440p monitors, both of which will be available in April. The ThinkVision P27h and P24h have 27-inch and 23.8-inch displays, respectively, both with a 99% sRGB color gamut. The 27-inch model will cost $329, and the smaller display will be $259.

In a complaint unsealed on Tuesday, the commission said that between April 2014 and late 2015 Iat Hong and Chin Hung from Macau, and Bo Zheng from Changsha, Hunan province, installed malware on the law firms’ networks, thereby gaining access to the email accounts of attorneys advising corporate clients on mergers and acquisitions. Armed with proprietary information on these clients, the trio traded big. The commission said the three spent roughly US$7.5 million on shares of semiconductor company Altera before news of it being in talks to be acquired by Intel Corporation became public. In addition, hours after extracting emails about a deal involving an e-commerce company, Hong and Hung purchased shares that amounted to 25 per cent of the company’s trading volume on certain days in advance of the 2015 deal’s announcement. Hong and Zheng are also accused of trading in 2014 ahead of a merger announcement of a pharmaceutical company. They also stole schematic designs of a robot vacuum cleaner made by an American company, the commission’s complaint said. Hong, 26, and Hung, 50, were employed at a robotics company founded by Zheng, 30, to develop robot controller chips and provide control system solutions, according to authorities. Hackers in Greater China target online transactions, building ‘dossiers’ of information on individuals, expert says The trio was accused of copying and transmitting dozens of gigabytes of emails to remote internet locations. Hong was arrested in Hong Kong on Christmas Day with extradition proceedings scheduled to begin in mid-January. Hong’s mother was also named as a relief defendant for the purpose of recovering money in her accounts from her son’s illicit trading, the commission said. It is the first time the commission has charged anyone with hacking into a law firm’s computer network. The Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong has assisted with the ongoing investigation. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a daily press briefing that she was aware of the reports, but did not know the details. The commission has asked for a judgement ordering the three to pay penalties and relinquish their illegal gains, plus interest. Two government agencies in Hong Kong attacked by hackers, US firm says The commission is also seeking to freeze an account opened in Hong’s mother’s name. The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York also announced a 13-count indictment against the three stemming from the hacking.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 28 December 2016 | MYT 10:12 AM US accuses Chinese citizens of hacking law firms, insider trading Illegal trades?: Prosecutors said the men made over US$4mil (RM17.9mil) by placing trades in at least five company stocks based on inside information, including about deals involving Intel. — Reuters NEW YORK: Three Chinese citizens have been criminally charged in the United States with trading on confidential corporate information obtained by hacking into networks and servers of law firms working on mergers, US prosecutors said on Tuesday. Iat Hong of Macau, Bo Zheng of Changsha, China, and Chin Hung of Macau were charged in an indictment filed in Manhattan federal court with conspiracy, insider trading, wire fraud and computer intrusion. Prosecutors said the men made over US$4mil (RM17.9mil) by placing trades in at least five company stocks based on inside information from unnamed law firms, including about deals involving Intel Corp and Pitney Bowes Inc. The men listed themselves in brokerage records as working at information technology companies, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said in a related civil lawsuit. Hong, 26, was arrested on Sunday in Hong Kong, while Hung, 50, and Zheng, 30, are not in custody, prosecutors said. Defence lawyers could not be immediately identified. The case is the latest US insider trading prosecution to involve hacking, and follows warnings by US officials that law firms could become a prime target for hackers. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: you are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," US Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said. Prosecutors said that beginning in April 2014, the trio obtained inside information by hacking two US law firms and targeting the e-mail accounts of law firm partners working on mergers and acquisitions. Prosecutors did not identify the two law firms, or five others they said the defendants targeted. But one matched the description of New York-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, which represented Pitney Bowes in its 2015 acquisition of Borderfree Inc, one of the mergers in question. The indictment said that by using a law firm employee's credentials, the defendants installed malware on the firm's servers to access e-mails from lawyers, including a partner responsible for the Pitney deal. Cravath declined to comment. In March, Cravath confirmed discovering a "limited breach" of its systems in 2015. Prosecutors also accused the defendants of trading on information stolen from a law firm representing Intel on the chipmaker's acquisition of Altera Inc in 2015. Intel's merger counsel on the deal was New York-based Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. The law firm declined to comment. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Super Mario Run: Give the plumber a hand What is cloud computing?

Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Hackers who stole US$4 million nabbed AFP | December 28, 2016 The hackers allegedly made US$380,000 on trades of Intermune, a drug maker bought by Germany's Roche in 2014; $1.4 million in trades on Altera, bought by Intel in 2015; and $841,000 on Borderfree, acquired by Pitney Bowes in 2015. NEW YORK: US prosecutors announced criminal charges Tuesday against three hackers who allegedly made $4 million in illicit profits from insider trading of information pilfered from law firms advising on corporate mergers. The three defendants, two from Macau and one from China, successfully breached the computer networks of international law firms with New York offices by unlawfully obtaining a firm employee’s credentials and installing malware on his company’s server, the US Attorney’s office in New York said. The malware permitted the hackers to monitor law firm communications about more than a dozen transactions in 2014 and 2015 that were discussed or contemplated, including some deals that were never consummated. The hackers then bought shares of companies that would later be acquired, winning big profits. The hackers allegedly made $380,000 on trades of Intermune, a drug maker bought by Germany’s Roche in 2014; $1.4 million in trades on Altera, bought by Intel in 2015; and $841,000 on Borderfree, acquired by Pitney Bowes in 2015. “This case of cyber-meets-securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: you are and will be targets of cyber hacking because you have information valuable to would-be criminals,” US Attorney Preet Bharara said. The authorities arrested Iat Hong of Macau in Hong Kong, who is now pending extradition proceedings. The other two defendants, Chin Hung of Macau and Bo Zheng of China, are at large, a spokesman for the US Attorney’s office said.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 28 December 2016 | MYT 7:07 AM US accuses Chinese citizens of hacking law firms, insider trading Prosecutors said the men made over $4 million by placing trades in at least five company stocks based on inside information from unnamed law firms, including about deals involving Intel Corp <INTC.O> and Pitney Bowes Inc NEW YORK: Three Chinese citizens have been criminally charged in the United States with trading on confidential corporate information obtained by hacking into networks and servers of law firms working on mergers, U.S. prosecutors said on Tuesday. Iat Hong of Macau, Bo Zheng of Changsha, China, and Chin Hung of Macau were charged in an indictment filed in Manhattan federal court with conspiracy, insider trading, wire fraud and computer intrusion. Prosecutors said the men made over $4 million by placing trades in at least five company stocks based on inside information from unnamed law firms, including about deals involving Intel Corp <INTC.O> and Pitney Bowes Inc . The men listed themselves in brokerage records as working at information technology companies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a related civil lawsuit. Hong, 26, was arrested on Sunday in Hong Kong, while Hung, 50, and Zheng, 30, are not in custody, prosecutors said. Defence lawyers could not be immediately identified. The case is the latest U.S. insider trading prosecution to involve hacking, and follows warnings by U.S. officials that law firms could become a prime target for hackers. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: you are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said. Prosecutors said that beginning in April 2014, the trio obtained inside information by hacking two U.S. law firms and targeting the email accounts of law firm partners working on mergers and acquisitions. Prosecutors did not identify the two law firms, or five others they said the defendants targeted. But one matched the description of New York-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, which represented Pitney Bowes in its 2015 acquisition of Borderfree Inc, one of the mergers in question. The indictment said that by using a law firm employee's credentials, the defendants installed malware on the firm's servers to access emails from lawyers, including a partner responsible for the Pitney deal. Cravath declined to comment. In March, Cravath confirmed discovering a "limited breach" of its systems in 2015. Prosecutors also accused the defendants of trading on information stolen from a law firm representing Intel on the chipmaker's acquisition of Altera Inc in 2015. Intel's merger counsel on the deal was New York-based Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. The law firm declined to comment. The case is U.S. v.

The call comes as police patrols have been stepped up in major cities across the world in the wake of the recent truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market which killed 12 people. Seven people were also arrested in Moscow on suspicion of planning ISIS New Year's Eve attacks allegedly involving automatic weapons and explosives. Islamic State-linked group Nashir Media Foundation published propaganda warning revellers: "Prepare your coffins as well. Your celebrations have become a battlefield" - according to terrorism watchdog SITE Intel Group.

Revellers in New York City on Saturday will find 65 large sanitation trucks filled with sand placed in strategic positions to block potential truck attacks, as well as about 100 other smaller "blocker" vehicles, officials said.

The current terror threat level in the UK remains at 'severe' - meaning an attack is "highly likely".

Bill Gates embraces Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg during an announcement of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to ‘cure, prevent or manage all disease’ by the end of the century. Beck Diefenbach/Reuters Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn A new kind of philanthropist is emerging in the 21st century. They show little interest in the old philanthropic model - attending galas and endowing their alma mater. Today, relatively young technology billionaires are creating a new paradigm of philanthropy, one that arguably sets a new standard of ethical practice in the non-profit sector. Their purpose is to use their influence to push the boundaries of science and technology for the creation of social benefit. In a growing trend, in 2014, more than US$5 billion was donated by wealthy technologists for this purpose. A cynic might say it is about lining their own pockets, yet there is ample evidence to suggest they are motivated by a kind of win-win altruism. These are men and women who think global and want to leave a legacy. Who are we talking about? It is a long list indeed, with names like Gordon Moore (Intel), Bill Gates (Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg & Priscilla Chan, Sean Parker (Facebook), Paul Allen (Microsoft) and Michael Dell, to mention a few. Shortfalls in government funding One factor in the rise of the new philanthropy is that government spending on science in the US has been dropping in recent times. Research institutes are closing, projects being put on hold or abandoned for want of funding. Increasingly, science philanthropy is stepping up to address the shortfall. It is not surprising that wealthy technologists would want to invest in pushing the boundaries of science. Technology is, after all, applied science. Without the research, technological progress slows to a crawl. As a result, we are seeing the priorities of science being influenced less by government policy and academia, and more by the priorities of the philanthropic giver. After all, who pays the piper calls the tune. It is a trend giving rise to some disquiet in the science establishment. With pressure on government budgets from other priorities, the trend towards the outsourcing of science funding is likely to continue. The Gates Foundation Even the wealthiest of governments would be hard pressed to match the funding of some of the larger new “venture philanthropists”. With assets of around US$44 billion, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a prime example of the new philanthropy. To date it has spent roughly US$10 billion on a range of programs in developing countries to improve health care, provide education and reduce poverty. It has funded efforts to control infectious diseases, malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. It also funds family planning, basic health care, nutrition and sanitation. It would be difficult to criticise such efforts, though it will not stop some from claiming they are only giving back what they had no right to take in the first place. Being a philanthropist today can be a thankless business. Is there a dark side? Silicon Valley billionaire and philanthropist Peter Thiel incurred the wrath of his peers by strongly supporting Donald Trump, donating money and making speeches for his election. Thiel has since been named a member of the President-elect’s transition team, indicating that he is not just a supporter but a trusted friend. What does Thiel expect in return? Time will tell, but it is likely he will be most valuable serving as a mediator between a Trump White House and the largely left-wing Silicon Valley establishment to implement a new policy agenda. Not an easy job. The new philanthropy is diversifying It is a measure of the hyper-partisan nature of politics today that would call participation in the political process a bad thing. It’s actually a good thing. We need more intelligent, capable people with technology skills to enter a field that has been brought into disrepute in recent times.

Opinion: this will be a pivotal year for the Mac By Gary Marshall | Dec 29, 2016, 10.13 PM IST FacebookLinkedinTwitterGoogle+Reddit Continue reading In December, Microsoft made a surprising announcement: more Mac users are switching to Surface devices than ever before, partly due to “the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro.” It’s important to take rivals’ claims with a huge pinch of salt, of course, but at the same time the ever popular MacRumors’ Buyer’s Guide was only willing to recommend a single Mac, the same new MacBook Pro. The MacBook was labelled with "caution", and the MacBook Air, iMac, Mac Mini and Mac Pro were – and at the time of writing, still are – labelled with big red “don’t buy” buttons. You can see why. All of those Macs are massively overdue updates, assuming Apple intends to update them at all. The worst offender is the “innovation my ass” Mac Pro, which hasn’t been touched since its debut three years ago. In computing, that’s an eternity. After years of rising sales, Macs are in decline. According to Strategy Analytics, the decline increased from a 3% year-on-year drop in the fourth quarter of 2015 to a 17% drop in the third quarter of 2016. Strategy Analytics’ senior analyst Eric Smith has an explanation: he says that Apple “pretty much forgot about the Mac” in 2016. He’s not the only person who thinks that Macs aren’t Apple’s top priority, and that they haven’t been for some years now. Are we seeing the last gasp of the Mac? It just doesn’t work You can pin some of the blame for the lack of exciting new Macs on chip suppliers, who haven’t delivered what Apple’s hardware needs to make updates necessary or attractive. Mac updates were similarly sluggish just before Hell froze over and Apple moved from PowerPC to Intel processors. But people’s concerns aren’t just about the lack of hardware excitement. The software is making some Mac fans nervous, too. Here’s a genuine example: we’d have started this piece earlier, but a minor update to macOS Sierra borked our iMac’s boot disk and took most of our morning with it. The last update killed Boot Camp on our MacBook Pro. We’re battling intermittent Finder errors on our MacBook Air. And don’t get us started on iCloud Drive, Siri or iTunes. Our experience is not unusual. Legendary tech commentator Walt Mossberg wrote early in 2016 that “I’ve noticed a gradual degradation in the quality and reliability of Apple’s core apps, on both the mobile iOS operating system and its Mac OS X platform,” he wrote. While the core apps generally still work beautifully, the “it just works” mantra no longer applies.  We share the LA Times’ exasperation at Preview’s endless crashes, and we’ll happily echo Marco Arment’s lament that “just a few years ago, we would have relentlessly made fun of Windows users for these same bugs on their inferior OS, but we can’t talk anymore.”  How to fix common macOS problems Even John Gruber, aka Daring Fireball, was moved to write that “Maybe we expect too much from Apple’s software. But Apple’s hardware doesn’t have little problems like this.”  The reason is obvious. Apple’s concentrating most of its resources on the iPhone, which is where it makes most of its money and which requires significant annual updates, and on the iPad, which it sees as the future of general purpose computing. New Macs are coming in 2017 – the iMac, at least, is due to be updated imminently – but it’s clear that Apple’s attention is elsewhere. Will it come back? In many respects, Apple’s Mac business looks very much like its Mac business of the 1980s: solid but uninspiring, and focused on maximising profits rather than finding the next insanely great thing. The current product range echoes that too: Apple no longer sticks to Steve Jobs’ grid of four distinct Mac lines (consumer desktop, consumer laptop, pro desktop, pro laptop).  But what’s different this time around is that the Mac isn’t Apple’s core business any more. Mobile is.  Since 2009, the iPhone has jumped from 25% of Apple’s revenues to 68%; while Apple shipped 4.2 million Macs in Q3 2016, it shipped 40.4 million iPhones and 9.9 million Macs.  You don’t need to be an accountant to recognize that Apple without the Mac would still be one of the most successful and highly profitable companies in the world. Macs in a post-PC world “The Macintosh line of computers is 32 years old”, writes former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée. “It has a venerable past… but what kind of future does it have in a declining market?” As Gassée rightly points out, the Mac is still big business: $22 billion in annual revenue for the year just gone isn’t bad at all, and of course Apple’s profit margins remain huge. But is it a business Apple wants to keep, when the future increasingly looks ARM-powered and iPad shaped? Industry analyst Horace Dediu is well known for his perceptive analysis of Apple. While he’s quick to applaud the Mac’s continued success, he argues that thinking in terms of Macs vs PCs is a distraction. It’s Macs vs mobile now. “What exactly is the purpose of the Mac in the age of the mobile device?” he asks.  It’s a rhetorical question. “It cannot take on the role of being the future,” - that’s the iPhone’s job. And “it will not morph into a touch device any more than a teen’s parent will become cool by putting on skinny jeans.” For Dediu, “What it will do is become better at what it is hired to do.” And that’s to deliver non-touchscreen input in jobs where it makes sense to do so. Touch interfaces can be great, but there are some tasks for which the good old keyboard and mouse (or trackpad) and perhaps Touch Bar are better suited. “Alternative ways of doing the jobs it does will with direct input are emerging, but they are not yet good enough,” Dediu argues.  For as long as that’s the case, there will still be Macs.

Monday, January 2, 2017 A look inside San Jose politics and culture Twitter Facebook San Jose Inside San Jose Inside is made possible through support by: San Jose Inside (http://_/2016/12/28/the-departure-lounge-we-lost-some-great-people-in-2016/) More News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly Categories News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly News The Departure Lounge: We Lost Some Great People in 2016 By Silicon Valley Newsroom / December 28, 2016 1 Clockwise from left: Natalie Cole, Gene Wilder, David Bowie, Thom Steinbeck, Paul Kantner, Muhammad Ali and Prince. We were so traumatized by the deaths of David Bowie, Prince, Muhammad Ali, Leonard Cohen and George Michael (maybe less so by Fidel Castro’s) that passings that might have attracted attention in a normal year failed to get the attention they deserved. Like America’s greatest astronaut, John Glenn, or the fifth Beatle, George Martin. Or Gene Wilder. Jazz great Bobby Hutcherson died at his home in Montara, near Half Moon Bay. David Bunnell, the founder of PC, PC World, Macworld and Upside magazines, who helped shape the personal computing revolution, died in Berkeley. Author Thomas Steinbeck, son of John, who presented awards annually at San Jose State’s Steinbeck Center, had his ashes spread in Big Sur. San Jose’s retired planning director, Joe Horwedel, was remembered fondly, and with the demise of Santa Clara’s colorful ex-Mayor Eddie Souza, local journalists have less to write about. Monsignor Eugene Boyle was a longtime local champion of social justice. Silicon Valley said goodbye to longtime Intel CEO Andy Grove and Bill Campbell, who had run Intuit and filled key roles at Apple and its spinoff Claris. We lost the creator of email’s “@” symbol, Ray Tomlinson, and Henry Heimlich, who invented that maneuver. Eye patch-wearing editor Warren Hinckle, who helped introduce gonzo journalism to the world, succumbed in San Francisco. Fellow new leftie turned California politician Tom Hayden, who stopped by Metro’s office for a chat when he ran for governor in 1994, slid off the coil in Santa Monica, the same place where Mexican musical treasure Juan Gabriel took his leave. Also in that city, synthesizer great Keith Emerson exited the stage, followed by fellow band member Greg Lake, leaving Carl Palmer as the sole survivor of the once formidable ELP. Nine Inch Nails keyboard player James Woolley died after a ladder fall, 25 years after his unforgettable Lollapalooza performance at Shoreline Amphitheatre. Parliament/Funkadelic, Talking Heads and Mos Def keyboardist Bernie Worrell met the Great Spirit. And electronic synthesizer pioneer Don Buchla, who engineered the sound system for Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters’ Further bus, fell silent. Other noteworthy musicians who played their final notes included Rob Wasserman, bassist with Bob Weir’s Ratdog, Lou Reed and Elvis Costello, Merle Haggard, who wrote Grateful Dead staple “Mama Tried” and Paul Kantner, who began his Jeffersonian journey in the South Bay. Crack-smoking former Toronto mayor Rob Ford died of cancer at 46 and Harambe the Gorilla was fatally shot a day after his 17th birthday at the Cincinnati Zoo after he fished a three-year-old boy out of a moat. Natalie Cole, who had an unforgettable voice, came to San Jose for Cinequest four years ago and wanted to see the city’s nightlife. After a doorman at Fahrenheit turned her away because it was past what San Jose considers late, er 11pm, we apologized as we walked a block in the chilly night to the only nearby open spot, The Loft. “That’s okay. I’ve been thrown out of nicer places than that,” she graciously assured us.

Lenovo's latest ThinkPads ship bloatware-free Engadget 4 days ago Jon Fingas © Provided by Engadget It's virtually a tradition for Lenovo to unveil new ThinkPads around CES time, but this year it's doing something a bit different: its systems are defined by what they don't have. The PC builder has just unveiled a slew of mid-tier ThinkPad laptops that all run Microsoft's Signature Edition image of Windows 10 -- that is, you shouldn't expect bloatware bogging things down or introducing security holes. While ThinkPads have had cleaner software than Lenovo's non-pro systems as a general rule, this is good news if you're more interested in getting to work than dealing with unwanted apps. Of course, there are plenty of hardware updates. All of the new systems use 7th-generation Core processors, and some of the larger models (the ThinkPad T470, T470p, T570, L470 and L570) have the option of using Intel's extremely fast Optane 3D storage. You can only have up to 16GB of the cutting-edge memory, so it won't replace the main drive in your system, but it should help in those situations where even a fast SSD isn't enough. You should also expect improved trackpads (using Microsoft's Precision TouchPad spec) and protection against dodgy USB-C cables. As for the specific systems? The headliner is the ThinkPad Yoga 370 2-in-1 (shown at top). As its numbering scheme suggests, it slots neatly between the 200- and 400-series Yogas with a brand new 13.3-inch design that's tough enough to meet MilSpec certifications. Its 3.2-pound weight, 1080p screen and 10-hour battery life aren't huge breakthroughs, but it touts Thunderbolt 3 support to connect to Lenovo's new docks and displays (more on those later). It ships in February starting at $1,149. © Lenovo Lenovo ThinkPad T570 The remaining systems are mostly the customary performance updates, although there are a few highlights: the 15.6-inch T570 has an optional 4K non-touch display (up from "just" 3K in the T560). Thunderbolt 3 is common across most T-series laptops, and the 12-inch X270 adds USB-C. It won't shock you to hear that prices and ship dates will vary widely. The most affordable rig is the updated ThinkPad 13, which begins at $699 when it arrives in January, but you can drop $1,149 on the 14-inch T470s (also arriving in January) if you're determined to meld Ultrabook portability with an abundance of ports. And yes, Lenovo is upping the ante on its docks and displays. The $280 ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 Dock gives you power, two DisplayPort connectors, HDMI, VGA, five USB 3.0 ports, gigabit Ethernet, audio and another Thunderbolt 3 port using a single cable attached to your PC. It ships in February. If that's overkill, you can get a $200 ThinkPad USB-C Dock in January; it ditches Thunderbolt 3 (naturally) and HDMI, and downgrades two of the USB ports to 2.0. Prefer to hook things up to a display? The 24-inch ThinkVision P24h and 27-inch P27h both support charging, video and 4 USB 3.0 ports through a solitary USB-C cable. There's no pricing on the smaller screen as of this writing, but the P27h will sell for $329 when it and its sibling launch in March.

OpenELEC 7.0 Linux OS Out Now with OpenVPN & Bluetooth Audio, Based on Kodi 16.1 GO Includes ALSA 1.1 and Linux kernel 4.4 LTS Dec 29, 2016 15:42 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, December 29, 2016, the OpenELEC development team proudly announced the release of a new stable build of their HTPC (Home Theater PC) Linux-based operating system for embedded devices. OpenELEC 7.0.0 is now the latest stable version of the GNU/Linux distribution built around the well-known open-source and cross-platform Kodi 16.1 (formerly XBMC) media center. It's powered by the long-term supported Linux 4.4 kernel and comes with support for Bluetooth Audio and VPN (Virtual Private Network) through OpenVPN. This is also the first release of the HTPC-oriented OS to add new AMDGPU video driver for newer AMD Radeon GPUs, but it also updates the graphics drivers for Intel and Nvidia cards, the latter being provided as a mix between Nvidia and Nvidia Legacy drivers, thus supporting old and new Nvidia GPUs. The WLAN drivers and firmware have been updated, too, and the graphics stack is now based on the X.Org Server 1.18 and Mesa 11.2 3D Graphics Library. Other updated components include ALSA 1.1, FFmpeg 2.8, libva 1.7, systemd 229, connman 1.31, libnfs 1.11, libressl 2.2, GNU Binutils 2.26, GCC 5.3, Python 2.7.13, LLVM 3.8, and Glibc 2.23. WeTek Core platform now officially supported with a separate build Being a major release and all that, OpenELEC 7.0.0 introduces official support for the WeTek Core platform by creating a separate build of the OS for this type of Android TV boxes. Other than that, users of OpenELEC 6.0 series are urged to use the Generic build of the distribution if they used the Nvidia_Legacy build before. "Users running OpenELEC 6.95.1 or later with auto-update enabled will be prompted on-screen to reboot and apply the update once it has been downloaded and enabled in some hours. Users running older OpenELEC releases or with auto-update disabled will need to manually update," reads today's announcement. If you're using OpenELEC from the 6.x series, you are encouraged to perform a full backup of your installation before attempting to upgrade to OpenELEC 7.0.0, which you can download right now from our web portal or directly from the official homepage of the project, where you'll find all the information you need to get started with using OpenELEC on your device(s). #OpenELEC 7.0#Kodi 16.1#HTPC#Linux distribution#embedded subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Here's Ubuntu Budgie 16.10 Linux Operating System Running on an Onda Tablet PC KDevelop 5.1 Promises LLDB Support, Analyzer Run Mode, and Perforce Integration Wine-Staging 2.0 RC3 Adds AES-GCM Support and Fixes DOOM 2016 Multiplayer Mode Linux Kernel 4.9 Now Unofficially Available for Slackware 14.2 and Derivatives New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    OpenELEC 7.0.0 released Other Linux Distros Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Netrunner Rolling Edition / Desktop: A special edition of the Netrunner Linux distribution based on Arch Linux and designed as a rolling-release operating system Reader comments You Can Now Create Your Own Remix of Raspberry Pi Foundation's Raspbian PIXEL OS more on: Raspberry Pi i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

News Windows 10 Windows 10 Anniversary Update Gaming About LG to soon release the PJ9, a levitating bluetooth speaker WE RECOMMEND: Click to free scan your PC for malware & improve performance 0 0 0 CES 2017 is going be one hell of a tradeshow. Some of the biggest names in the tech world, including HP, Lenovo, Microsoft, Intel and LG will parade their latest gadgets and contraptions on January 5th in Las Vegas. One of these companies, LG, has been working on a powerful electromagnet device for quite some time and we now know for sure what the device really is: A PJ9 levitating portable bluetooth ppeaker. LG says that it collaborated with DTS to bring a “realistic theater-like sound for a cinematic experience wherever you may be”. The magical hovering gizmo contains electromagnets that levitate the speakers and on top of that, there is 360° of omnidirectional sound and a 10-hour battery life, descending to its base station to charge wirelessly when low on juice. The le PJ9 is equipped with Multipoint technology, giving users the ability to connect two Bluetooth devices at once. There is also an embedded subwoofer for deep bass and IPX7-certified speakers for water resistance conditions. The PJ9 also features Dual Passive Radiator technology to reproduce “flush mid-range tones and crisp highs”. Apart from hovering over its dock like some futuristic doodad, it produces booming sound in every direction to give your guests something to talk about at your New Year’s party. Which makes sense: LG is the first major electronics brand to put out such an outlandish product. To find out more of its features, you’ll have to wait till the CES 2017 event where LG will also be unveiling its full lineup of wireless audio products. As for pricing, LG hasn’t shared any details regarding the matter.

The Secretary of State's office audit found that property tax breaks for Intel and similar exemptions for data centers consumed the lion's share of Business Oregon's incentives. "We recommend that Business Oregon develop additional metrics and targets for incentive and loan performance, using them to evaluate the awards and report performance to policymakers and the public," the auditors wrote. Oregon's biggest tax incentives, 2015-2017 Strategic Investment Program: Large manufacturers received property tax exemptions worth $406.3 million. Intel received 80 percent of those tax breaks. Standard Enterprise Zone: Property tax exemptions for three to five years saved employers $71.9 million. Rural Enterprise Zone: Data centers received most of these incentives, worth $56.8 million altogether. Oregon Production Investment Fund: Tax credits for film and TV productions, worth $22.9 million. Manufacturing Business Energy Tax Credit: Manufacturers received tax credits for using renewable energy worth $22.6 million. Source: Audit by Oregon Secretary of State's office Data centers' tax exemptions received particular scrutiny: For each job the tax breaks brought in, the auditors found, local communities gave up property tax revenue between $87,000 and $800,000. Beneficiaries of those exemptions include Amazon (in Morrow County), Google (The Dalles), Facebook and Apple (both in Prineville). Local cities and counties decide whether to grant the exemptions under Oregon's enterprise zone program. "State and local jurisdictions need to periodically examine the zones in-depth to identify potential improvements and weigh the tax breaks against the zone benefits," the auditors wrote. "An evaluation of data center tax incentives could also include a broader range of community benefits and costs tied to these projects." Oregon offers some of the nation's most attractive incentives for data centers, providing broad property tax exemptions coupled with the absence of a state sales tax. That combination can save individual projects several million dollars a year. Tax deals financed a new industry formed by pairing rural America and Silicon Valley. Even large data centers, though, typically employ no more than several dozen people. State auditors said Oregon should undertake a more careful analysis to weigh the size of the tax breaks against the jobs created. Roger Lee, executive director of Economic Development for Central Oregon, said the data centers would never have come to small towns like Prineville and The Dalles without the tax breaks. So those communities aren't giving up anything when they grant the incentives, he said. "It doesn't take away from the tax base, the existing tax base," Lee said. "It's only on new investment." The state audit notes that community service and franchise fees offset some of the data centers' property tax breaks, but says Oregon doesn't adequately quantify those benefits. Other findings in the audit: Oregon granted $680 million in tax incentives through Business Oregon during the state's last two-year budget cycle. Three-quarters of that was awarded to programs under local control, including the data center and Intel tax breaks. Oregon's incentives are relatively small compared with those in other states. For example, Texas distributed $86 million through its enterprise fund in 2015, compared with $4 million in the comparable Oregon program. Most awards during 2011 and 2012 went to businesses that paid average wages below that of the county where they operated. Enterprise zone property tax breaks were concentrated on relatively well-off regions, in contrast to the program's initial aim to help poorer parts of the state. Oregon's enterprise zone programs haven't had a thorough review since 2009, and aren't scheduled for another until 2025. Most Business Oregon incentives aren't subject to a "sunset" review to determine whether the state should continue offering them. Oregon's history with tax incentives has been poor. The Business Energy Tax Credit was little short of a catastrophe, gobbling up 40 times more than lawmakers expected when they approved the program. A recent state audit found nearly a quarter of all projects funded by that tax credit "seemed improper, violated statutes or rules, or exhibited suspicious activity." The Oregon Energy Department administered that program, however, and it was separate from the Business Oregon tax incentives cataloged in this month's audit. In a formal response, Business Oregon said it "generally agrees with the audit recommendations." The agency committed to update its website with more information, but said sunset reviews are beyond its mandate and said additional transparency must "balance the public's right to know with individual businesses' rights to privacy." -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

Let's go live to the White House now okay Karen Travers was where those in Washington Karen just what can the president do. Looking at the White House today. For economic sanctions against us and we need before of course would be different fresh round. Using there's also a possibility of diplomatic measures sanctions against diplomats restrictions on travel things like that one thing we're not expected here today is. Any discussion about Covert actions taken by US intelligence agencies that's not surprising of course but it is something and the president has talked about. As part of this response and experts are saying you know the US is very good at this of course it. The won't have a footprint we won't know about it but the issue there is when you start doing it back when you start hacking back. Then what happens next in what happens next and what chain reaction get sent off. With only 23 days left Intel Donald Trump becomes president. How much of this can be reversed how much of this matters. We know that the White House would like to do this in such a way that makes it very difficult for Donald Trump to. Watered down or scrap all together now we're reading here. But that is something that administration officials have indicated to us is. A priority as they lay this out because they do you only have three weeks left and it's also important to note that this is not. The conclusion of that broad review that the president asked for after the election looking into the whole issue of the cyber attacks after the intelligence agencies. Came to this conclusions about Russia. We will expect that sometime next month that review is still ongoing in the administration that. Not Donald Trump who's named Tom Bonser to be his chief cyber security advisor on the president elect those elevated to the admiral put into this guy at the same level. As the incoming national security advisor Michael Flynn. Bob served as a kind of guy who can resolve this. Resolve this sword making it a top priority. In terms of figuring out response and not sure he could. Stop it and have for instance but I think what I think it's interesting is that. As you say will be elevated to the same level as the national security advisor and busters coming in with. Public and private sector experience he's a former official in the George W Bush Administration. Focusing on these issues and he's been in the private sector at a consulting firm doing security issues for the last couple of years now we don't. Here a lot from him and he's not a member of congress who's given a lot of speeches or press statements so it's unclear. Worry now where he comes down on the issue which is certainly going be one of the most pressing for the trump administration on day one. All right Karen we must dash thanks for your time this morning.

There has been a lot of change in IT this year, but the one constant has been the continued decline of the PC industry. In March, Computer Weekly reported Windows 10 had done little to stimulate upgrades in business. According to analyst Gartner, the annual selling price of ultramobile premium devices will have a negative 5.3% compound annual growth rate of 5.9% until 2019.

And in this highly competitive market, the strong US dollar combined with Brexit has meant IT budgets were squeezed as some device prices increased, rather than fell. Looking at the major IT companies, this was the year of the Dell/EMC merger, making the newly formed Dell-EMC a strong player in the datacentre market. But it remained the third largest PC manufacturer, according to IDC’s Q2 2016 market share report. HP Inc, the PC and printers arm of post-split HP, was second, with a share of 20.8% while Lenovo was the biggest PC maker, with 21.2%. Chip technology has continued to follow Moores’ Law, but, given the current state of the PC market, it was no real surprise to see Intel expanding into new areas such as IoT during its annual IDF conference in August. The PC industry appears to be shifting towards “personal systems”, which covers any device used for computing; from smartphones and tablets, to laptops, notebooks and hybrid devices. USB C made headlines at CES this year in Las Vegas, promising a universal connector for all devices, including those from Apple. It has the potential to make a radical change to the way office work space is organised. As Computer Weekly noted in January, a single cable for monitors, keyboards and mouse simplifies desk clutter. From an operating systems perspective, Microsoft released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, and the open source community reflected on 25 years since Linus Torvalds released the first Linux kernel. What has been truly remarkable about Linux is not the operating system itself – although most web-scale organisations probably run their infrastructure on Linux systems – but the fact that it opened up the possibility of open source, as an alternative model to commercial software licencing. Apart from Canonical with its Ubuntu Linux distribution, Linux has not really made a massive direct impact on the consumer and desktop computing. But Android, currently the most widely used operating system, is derived from Linux, and many popular websites are powered by Linux back-end systems. It may have started with Siri, but the true artifiicial intelligence star of 2016 has been the recently launched Alexa voice-controlled assistant from Amazon. The idea of a personal digital assistant harks back to early 1990s, with classic devices such as the Palm Pilot and Psion Organiser. But artificial intelligence offers the potential to revolutionise smartphones. “Alexa is the future of search, and smart agents have the potential to be the main user interface,” said Gartner research director Roberta Cozza. Smartphone makers need something to boost sales. Apple released iOS 10 and the iPhone 7, and introduced a professional tablet with extras that include an add-on keyboard and smart pencil aimed squarely at the niche Microsoft has forged with its Surface Pro hybrid device. But many experts believe iPhone users will delay upgrading until next year when the iPhone 8 is released. Samsung, which seized market share from Apple to become the dominant smartphone player, has had a terrible end of year, thanks to its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone devices. In the summer, Samsung was forced to recall 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphone devices worldwide because a number were found to have faulty batteries that made them vulnerable to overheating and catching fire. In the coming year, IT departments will need to come to terms with aging Windows 7 desktop computing, and the dilemma of whether to invest in another major PC refresh or try something else. Windows applications are the mainstay of desktop IT, but corporates are increasingly turning to Saas, delivered as mobile apps or browser based. Apple set about to change end user computing in 2010, with the first generation iPad. This has been joined by a multitude of Android tablets at different price points and hybrid PC devices like Microsoft’s Surface. At the same time, cloud-based software has meant applications can lean on powerful servers to do the heavy lifting. This means devices do not need to be as powerful from a computational perspective. So the manufacturers are focusing instead on areas like collaboration, offering features such as Skype for Business and integration with Intel’s RealSense cameras.  1. United Utilities protects field engineering deployment with AirWatch United Utilities deploys mobile device management software AirWatch to secure Samsung devices running a SAP workforce management app. 2. User devices require careful orchestration Options for access to IT have soared since the desktop PC’s heyday, and organisations must conduct a balancing act. 3. Manufacturers must shift to smarter software to stem smartphone decline Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa illustrate a shift that phone makers must make to continue adding value to devices. 4. Windows Mobile shrinks as Microsoft prioritises productivity and platforms Microsoft prepares to axe 2,850 jobs as it culls smartphone business and majors on productivity and platforms. 5.

Qualcomm has said it will fight the massive fine in court. The Korea Fair Trade Commission, or KFTC, held that Qualcomm refused to license certain standard-essential patents on its chips to rival chipmakers including Intel, Samsung, and MediaTek. The commission ordered Qualcomm to renegotiate those licenses in good faith, according to a Reuters report on the matter. The fine is the largest ever issued in Korea. In its report on the Korean fine, Bloomberg notes that Qualcomm makes most of its profits, about $ 6.5 billion in its most recent year, from selling the rights to its chip technology. Qualcomm “has violated its agreement to license patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms, known as FRAND,” the Commission said in a statement.

Join For Free Evolve your approach to Application Performance Monitoring by adopting five best practices that are outlined and explored in this e-book, brought to you in partnership with BMC. An important consideration when moving to the next generation of multi/manycore systems is striving to create a refactored application that can run well on available systems. There are numerous similarities between the multi/manycore systems of today. Today’s systems have very powerful nodes, and the application must exploit a significant amount of parallelism on the node, which is a mixture of MIMD (multiple instruction, multiple data) and SIMD (single instruction, multiple data). The principal difference is how the application utilizes the MIMD parallelism on the node. Multicore Xeons and many-core Intel Phi systems can handle a significant amount of MPI on the node, whereas GPU systems cannot. There is also a difference in the size of the SIMD unit. The multi/manycore systems’ vector units are less than 10 and the GPU is 32. Since longer vectors on the multi/manycore systems do run better than shorter vectors this is less of an issue. All systems must have good vectorized code to run well on the target systems. However, there is a problem: “Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.” – Niklaus Wirth, 1995 The Other P There is a trend in the industry that goes against creating a performant portable application: the attempt to utilize high-level abstractions intended to increase the productivity of the application developers. The movement to C++ over the past 10 to 15 years has created applications that achieve a lower and lower percentage of peak performance on today’s supercomputers. Recent extensions to both C++ and Fortran to address productivity have significantly contributed to this movement. Even the developer of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, has indicated that C++ can lure the application developer into writing inefficient code: “C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.” “Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.” – Bjarne Stroustrup The productivity argument is that the cost of talented labor is greater than the cost of the high-performance computing system being utilized, and it is too time-consuming to improve the performance of the application. On the other hand, time spent optimizing application performance not only makes better use of expensive machines, it also reduces operational costs as energy costs continue to rise for future systems. Several years ago, a team led by Thomas Schulthess and Oliver Fuhrer of ETH Zurich refactored the production version of COSMOS, the climate modeling application used by MeteoSwiss, and found that not only did the application run significantly faster on their current GPU system, the cost of the effort would be more than repaid by the savings in energy costs over a couple years. The charts below show the performance increase and power consumption decrease for the refactored application. The work on COSMOS employed C++ meta-programming templates for the time consuming dynamical core, which resulted in the instantiation of CUDA kernels on the GPU and optimized assembler on the x86 systems. This work is an example of the developers understanding the architecture and restructuring the application to utilize its features with the high-level C++ abstractions. The bulk of the code – the physics – was Fortran, and OpenACC was used for the port to the accelerator. This is an excellent example that shows how an investment of several person-years of effort can result in an optimized application that more than pays for the investment in the development cost. Data motion is extremely expensive today and will be more expensive in the future, both in energy and time, and many of the high-level abstractions in the language can easily introduce excessive memory motion in an application. Retrofitting a large C++ framework with a high-level abstraction requires application developers to move data into a form acceptable to the abstractions and/or refactor their applications to have the abstraction manage their data structures. The first approach introduces too much data motion, and the second approach often requires a significant rewrite. Once such a rewrite has been performed, the application is dependent upon those interfaces making efficient use of the underlying architecture. Additionally, most complex multiphysics applications are a combination of computations that flow from one set of operations to another, and breaking that flow up into calls to the low-level abstractions could result in ineffective cache utilization and increased data motion. Much of the blame of this productivity movement has to be placed on the Language Standards Committee that introduces semantics that make the application developer more productive without thinking about compilation issues. Considering the recent additions to the language, both Fortran and C++, it seems that the Committee really does not care about how difficult it might be to optimize the language extensions and that their principal goal is to make programmers more productive. When users see an interesting new feature in the language, they assume that the feature will be efficient; after all, why would the Committee put the feature in the language if it wouldn’t run efficiently on the target systems? At some point, this trend of achieving productivity only at the expense of performance has to stop. Most, if not all, of the large applications that have taken the productivity lane have implemented MPI and messaging outside of the abstraction and they have obtained an increase in performance from the parallelism across nodes. Increased parallelism must be obtained on the node in the form of threading and/or vectorization, with special attention paid to minimizing the movement of data within the memory hierarchy of the node. At some point, application developers have to put in extra work to ensure that data motion on the node is minimized and that threading and vectorization are being well utilized.

A team of NIA operatives have been assigned to  President elect Adama Barrow, and his Transition Team have been under the radar of the brutal National Intelligence Agency for surveillance, the Freedom Newspaper can reveal. A team of NIA operatives have been assigned to monitor the movements and activities of President elect Adama Barrow. It’s a covert operation approved by the outgoing dictator Yahya Jammeh. Mr. Barrow, and his team should be aware of their surroundings now towards inauguration day. The NIA surveillance team attached to President elect Barrow, have been divided into two units:  Ebrima Badjie, a senior Intel officer, is commanding the four men unit of surveillance officers. Kebba Jasseh, another senior member of the Agency, is also heading another four men unit. One of the surveillance team has been stationed outside Barrow’s residence. Their job is to infiltrate and monitor Barrow’s daily activities and movements. The other unit, has been tasked with monitoring Barrow’s motorcade. Both  surveillance team have been allocated double cabin pickup trucks by Jammeh. We are compiling the names of the other NIA agents working with Ebrima Badjie, and Kebba Jasseh. We will publish their names in due course. Meanwhile, the Inspector General of police, has issued a statement asking people interested in using convoys to apply for police permit. The goal is to prevent President elect Barrow and his team from driving around town. In annother development, Staff Sergeant Samba Jawo, and Staff Sergeant Jahateh are still detained at the NIA gutter cell Bambandingka. The men were arrested recently. Bakary Fatty, a GRTS, agricultural reporter is also detained at Bambadinka. Mr. Fatty, was given D50,000 and a double cabin truck by Jammeh prior to his arrest. Businessman Abdou Njie, who was detained since October, is languishing at Bambadinka together with former Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Sarjo Jallow. Momodou Sabally, the former GRTS MD, has been moved to the mile two prison. Omar Malleh Jabang, the guy, who used to be in charge of Jammeh’s sand mining in Kartong, is also detained.  Mr. Jabang, recently got arrested after dictator Jammeh received information that he was campaigning for the former Independent Candidate Isatou Touray. Mr. Jabang, has been held at the seized home of Fatou Nickle Touray, in Brusubi .Written By Pa Nderry MBai Source : Freedomnewspaper Sulayman Ceesay Many thanks Essa, Pa Nderry, Baba Galleh, Bamba Mass, Fatu, Fatou Jaw and other heroes of Gambian online newspapers. You guys are true heroes and when all is done and the dust settles, I hope we Gambians, with the leadership of the new administration, can find the moment to specially honour you all and pay our tributes. At this crucial time of the Gambian people’s struggle to enforce their spoken voices through the polls, we need more security around our chosen President-elect Barrow. In that context, it will help immensely if the photos of these NIA hoodlums can be obtained and posted on your online papers for all Gambians to know and make them out facially. With our eyes on them, we will be better able to add to Barrow’s security. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to 19833.68, down 113.36, or 0.56%. The S&P 500 also declined, down at 2249.92, a decline of 18.96, or 0.84%. The Nasdaq drpped a bit, a slip of 48.89, or 0.89%. The Russell 2000 also went south, but the VIX was up. Travelers Companies group up on the day, the leading gainer among equities on the Dow index. Industrials like Boeing (NYSE:BA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) led declines on the Dow. Analysts are now saying that the market may have been too optimistic, in the wake of the election of Donald Trump, and raced up toward the 20,000 mark too quickly. There now is a refining of expectations for the Dow and for stocks traded on other markets too, analysts said. President-elect Trump is poised to release an economic statement for U.S. workers after the close of the markets, and the transition team members told members of the media this morning on a teleconference call that the message was expected to be "positive" in tone. Trump is on a working vacation at his home in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, where he has in recent days released additional names of appointees to his incoming White House team.

Login Search Technology Stock Roundup: Apple, Nokia Fight Over Patents December 28, 2016, 04:37:00 PM EDT By Sejuti Banerjea, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo Top news last week were patent infringement-related lawsuits between Nokia NOK and Apple AAPL as well as strong results from Micron MU .   A closer look at the top stories- Apple-Nokia Patent Fight This year has been a relatively quiet one as far as patent infringement cases are concerned, but the series of lawsuits and counter suits between Apple and Nokia indicate that things are again changing in the final two weeks.   It appears that Apple has a license for some standard-essential patents that Nokia holds, but it refused to license certain others that it uses, possibly because Nokia was asking for higher rates than would be required under the fair and reasonable terms, or FRAND policy typically used in case of standard essential patents. Nokia subsequently transferred some patents to patent assertion authorities (PAEs) that likely aren't bound by the letter of FRAND rules. PAEs Acacia and Conversant (recently hired former Apple director of patent licensing and strategy Boris Teksler as its new CEO) subsequently filed lawsuits against Apple. Last week, Apple filed a countersuit: "With its cell phone business dying, Nokia began to seek out willing conspirators and to commence its illegal patent transfer scheme in full force; that scheme has continued in full effect to the present. The driving force behind Nokia's strategy was to diffuse its patent portfolio and place it in the hands of PAEs. Acacia and Conversant were its chief conspirators." In response, Nokia filed separate lawsuits in Germany and the U.S. including with the ITC covering 32 patents related to technologies such as display, user interface, software, antennae, chipsets and video coding. Later it expanded its lawsuits to 9 more countries (Finland, UK, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Netherlands, France, Hong Kong and Japan) with the number of alleged patent infringements extending to 40. Around 18 of these patents were named in the Texas lawsuit. Nokia is looking to make a comeback in the cell phone market through a 10-year agreement with HMD. It had earlier sold its struggling phone business to Microsoft, which recently offloaded it to a newly formed company called HMD. Micron Reports Q1 Results Micron reported encouraging first-quarter results with both the top and bottom lines ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimates. Results were helped by strong demand, with margins benefiting from a higher mix of 3D NAND and stronger pricing. The stronger pricing came from tight DRAM supply problems associated with the industry wide transition from planar to 3D NAND that also limited supply for NAND. These dynamics along with accretion from the Inotera acquisition will remain positives going forward.

The WSJ now reports that Apple has drawn up such a plan and asked for financial incentives and Indian government officials are considering Apple's proposal. Apple's largest iPhone assembler, Honhai Precision (Foxconn), that also offers similar services to Nokia and other companies, has been scouting for properties that indicate several manufacturing facilities. The company already has one facility in Southern India. However, Foxconn hasn't yet offered any statement on the matter.  India is an important market for Apple because it is set to become the second largest smartphone market behind China next year (IDC estimates) and Apple has a very small share. Moreover, Apple will also be able to sell other products in the country. Optimism on Facebook Instagram : Suntrust Robinson has said in a research note that Facebook's FB Instagram's 600 million-strong user base (or the accelerated growth of a 100 million users in the last six months) suggests that the company can beat his 2017 revenue estimate of $3.5 billion. Moreover, the service is expected to account for a larger share of Facebook revenue. New features that mimic Snapchat have helped the platform attract younger Internet users and ad load remains low, two factors that should drive its growth. Goldman Likes NVIDIA : Goldman Sachs's Toshiya Hari (as reported by Barron's) raised the price target on NVIDIA and put the shares on their conviction buy list. The reason for optimism is NVIDIA's unique position with respect to strong growth markets like virtual reality, machine learning and automotive electronics. The total addressable market in machine learning and artificial intelligence is around $5-10 billion and although Intel has a big share of the total Web 2.0 market, NVIDIA is expected to grow its share on the strength of its machine learning prowess. Piper, Morgan Stanley Like Microsoft : Piper Jaffray analysts say that Microsoft's MSFT cloud revenue (defined as Azure, Office 365 (commercial + consumer), LinkedIn and a portion of the Dynamics franchise) will grow at a CAGR of 33% through fiscal 2019, with this business moving from 11.5% to 30.6% of total revenue with gross margins moving from 42% to 60%. The analysts see pent up demand for Azure that will be supported by Office 365 (user base to increase 26% through 2019) and LinkedIn (estimated to reach $5.7 billion by 2019) to result in a hyper-growth story. Morgan Stanley analysts say that Microsoft's broad distribution channels with LinkedIn's Sales Navigator, Talent Solutions and Lynda.com/LinkedIn Learning products will help it increase monetization of both individual and commercial user bases, increase engagement, and create valuable integration and upsell opportunities with Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics 365. While LinkedIn revenue comes for higher gross margins than Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, it carries higher operating expenses. But if Microsoft can make the most of the potential revenue synergies, the analysts expect an FY19 EPS upside of up to 20 cents. Microsoft Wins DoD Contract : The Department of Defense has awarded Microsoft a $927 million contract for technical support and consulting services. This follows the deal in February, when the DoD signed up for Windows 10 to all four million of its employees within 12 months. New Google Privacy Policy : Consumer Watchdog and Privacy Rights Clearinghouse has filed a complaint alleging that the changes Alphabet's GOOGL Google made to its privacy policy in June "intentionally misled users, who had no way to discern from the wording that Google was breaking from a nearly decade-old practice and asking them if it could link their personal information to data reflecting their behavior on as many as 80 percent of the internet's leading websites." Google's response was to the effect that the change was to improve user experience as its services are increasingly used across devices. Google's statement also said, "it is 100 percent optional - if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged." Google Deal with Cuba : Google has signed a deal with Cuba's state telecommunications company, La Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba to set up computer servers in the island nation where content such as popular YouTube videos may be saved for quicker transmission to the growing Internet population. The country with 11.2 million people had just 150K daily Internet users last year, but the encouraging point is that this was more than double the number in the previous year. Amazon Echo Sells Out : Amazon AMZN sold out of its A.I.-powered Echo speakers that it had earlier discounted for the holidays. The Echo, which normally sells for $180 was priced at $140 while the Dot was sold for $40, i.e. $10 off its regular price. It's being speculated that Amazon misread demand, or it wouldn't have discounted them so heavily. Amazon is miles ahead of Google Home, its next competitor in the space, especially because it has opened the platform to third-party developers that are now building home products around Alexa. But the discounting probably makes sense because Google Home sells at $129, so this would have been a good time for the device to make inroads. Twitter CTO Out : Twitter's chief technology officer, Adam Messinger, and product VP Josh McFarland left the company last week. Twitter has seen a steady outflow of high-level executives all through this year including the VPs of Product, Commerce, Global Media, Engineering, HR, Business Development, Communications and Global Online Sales. The GM of Vine and COO/Head of Sales were other departures. While some continue to hope for a turnaround surrounding video, the constant brain drain does paint a bleak picture. Legal/Regulatory Facebook on Government Data Requests : Facebook said that total government requests for data on Facebook users rose 27% from 59,229 from 46,710 with more than half the requests accompanied with non-disclosure orders preventing the company from informing users. U.S. law enforcement agencies made the largest number of requests. Content restriction requests dropped 83% from last year, but mainly because of accelerated requests last year related to the Paris attacks. For the first time, Facebook also said that it received 38,675 user information preservation requests for 67,129 accounts. EU Says Facebook's WhatsApp Deal Misleading : The European Union's competition regulator has said that it believes that Facebook misrepresented its technical capabilities to match WhatsApp user accounts with Facebook accounts when it filed for approval of the acquisition. The deal is still expected to go through, but Facebook may be required to pay a fine of up to 1% of its current revenue. Facebook is required to file its response by Jan 31, 2017. The company maintains that it has provided all relevant information as requested and also voluntarily, but when approval was sought in 2014, it didn't have the capability. But now that it's able to match users across its services, it can, for the first time, determine the total number of unique users across its services.    Germany Wants Payment for Fake News : The German government headed by German Christian Democrats' (CDU's) Angela Merkel has decided to bring a law to force Facebook to take down fake news religiously. The government is reportedly looking to fine Facebook 500K euros (around $522K) for each case where it fails to take down fake news within a day after it is flagged. The government fears Russia's influence in the polls, particularly since the democrats blamed Facebook for fake stories and claimed that they clinched the President's title for Donald Trump. Merkel is contesting for a fourth term.   Alibaba's Counterfeit Problems Continue : Alibaba was reinstated on the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) annual list of global marketplaces that carry counterfeit or pirated goods. The list is intended to single out companies and countries that do not attempt to stop counterfeiters and can influence American policy makers. Alibaba's problems are related to Taobao, where rights holders are having difficulty removing counterfeits. Michael Evans, president of Alibaba Group responded: "We are very disappointed by the USTR's decision to include Taobao on its 'notorious markets' list, as we are far more effective and advanced in IPR protection than when the USTR took us off the list four years ago. "The decision ignores the real work Alibaba has done to protect IP rights holders and assist law enforcement to bring counterfeiters to justice. We question whether the USTR acted based on the actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate." New Technology/Products MacBook Pro Problems : For the first time, a Macbook received a negative feedback from Consumer Reports magazine due to its faulty/inconsistent batteries. As stated in the magazine, "the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third," the magazine said, whereas normal variance is 5% from trial to trial. Instagram Stickers : Instagram has introduced stickers to its "Stories" and direct messaging services, two features that help it compete with Snapchat. The platforms have gained popularity because of the feature that enables sharing of photos and video that disappear after 24 hours or after two views. Since the content becomes unavailable after a period, engagement is generally high. Facebook Messenger Gets Group Video Chat : Facebook added a new feature to the desktop version of Messenger, Macs and Android. Accordingly groups of up to 50 can do a chat although smaller groups of up to 6 will have greater visibility. If the number of people on the chat exceeds six, only the dominant speaker will be visible to the others. Microsoft Testing Payments API : Microsoft is testing Payment Request API, a developer solution for easier in-browser payments. Microsoft has limited presence on mobile platforms although it is still the dominant player in desktops. Since the bulk of ecommerce still takes place on desktops, this is a good start. The facility will be available on the new Edge browser and is connected to Microsoft's wallet. So once users enter their information into the mobile wallet, they won't need to do it each time they want to buy thus driving demand for the wallet. There might also be a solution down the line for those using other browsers. Google Smartwatches for 2017 : Google is getting ready to launch a new line of smartwatches in 2017 in partnership with an undisclosed hardware maker. The watches will carry the manufacturer's brand but run on Android, be supported by Google's new voice assistant and include Android Pay. M&A and Collaborations Google Waymo Meets Honda : Honda has announced that it is advanced talks with Google's Waymo to install its "fully self-driving sensors, software and computing platform" in Honda vehicles. The agreement would help Honda get its self driving cars on the road faster while also speeding up Waymo's revenue generation through partnership with smaller automakers with more limited budgets.   Silver Lake in Alibaba Funding Round : Alibaba's on-demand services unit Koubei is close to securing $1.2 billion of funding for expansion. The leading investors are Silver Lake Management, China Investment Corp., Yunfeng Capital (a fund backed by Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma) and China's sovereign wealth fund. IBM Watson in Retail : IBM has announced that South Korea's Lotte Group will use Watson's AI capabilities to "maximize insights from the huge amount of structured and unstructured customer data collected through its various channels, including the Lotte Members program, deriving valuable learnings about customer preferences and product feedback." Some Numbers Cowen Survey on IT Spending : A survey of 118 IT executives through November and December revealed that 75% expect 2017 budgets to move higher with "uncharacteristically strong average in excess of 6%." Cowen analysts estimate this will translate to 2-3% increase in 2017 spending. Networking is expected to grow as a share of total spend (38% of respondents say their networking spend will increase 11% while 59% say their spending will increase by 6%). Moreover, only 2% expect to reduce their networking spend. The survey is particularly positive for Cisco because 35% of respondents expect to spend more with the company, 17% will be first-time buyers, 35% expect to spend the same and only 3% expect to spend less.

The three targeted at least seven major international law firms that had been retained by companies to advise on deals and successfully got into the e-mail accounts of senior lawyers at two of the firms, according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday. They profited on deals and speculation involving the drug maker Intermune, chipmaker Intel Corp. and business services company Pitney Bowes Inc., the U.S. said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also sued and is seeking an asset freeze. The case places law firms among the widening group of targets for cybercriminals seeking to profit from insider information. Last year, the U.S. broke up an international ring of hackers who allegedly infiltrated the computer servers of PRNewswire Association LLC, Marketwired and Business Wire and stole market-moving press releases before they were published. According to the SEC, the group, which included Ukrainians and a Georgian, made more than $100 million from trading on the information. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world," Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in the statement. The three men - Iat Hong and Chin Hung, 50, of Macau, and Bo Zheng, 30, of China - worked at a robotics company that was started by Zheng, according to the government. Hong, 26, was arrested in Hong Kong on Christmas Day and is awaiting extradition. The SEC is also seeking to freeze an account registered in Hong's mother's name. Hackers stole information from more than 1 billion Yahoo accounts In addition to the law firms, they also hacked other robotics companies, the U.S. said. They allegedly stole schematic designs of a robot vacuum cleaner made by a U.S. company. The three generally used the same tactics to get the information, according to the U.S. They would get the log-in credentials of an employee and place malware on a server that allowed them to access the e-mails of key people at the firms and companies, according to the indictment. In a one-day period in 2014, they took 10 gigabytes of confidential data from one law firm's server, the U.S. said. They weren't always successful, the U.S. said. During one six-month period in 2015, the three men allegedly tried on more than 100,000 occasions to break into the networks of five law firms. The law firms weren't identified in the complaints. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP and Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP were among the targeted law firms. Amy Fantini, a Weil, Gotshal & Manges spokeswoman, declined to comment on the charges. Cravath Swaine & Moore didn't respond to a request for comment. Intermune Buy The three men allegedly bought shares of Intermune based on the information gleaned from the hacked data. Though the deal didn't close, they still made money as shares rose on media reports that the company was seeking a tie-up, the U.S. said. Intermune was ultimately purchased by Roche AG. Cravath advised Intermune on the deal. In another deal, the group allegedly bought shares in chipmaker Altera Corp. after Intel had retained one of the law firms to advise on an acquisition. They scored $1.4 million in profits on the trade amid media reports of the pending deal, and sold their shares before it was publicly announced, according to the indictment. Weil Gotshal was one of the law firms advising Intel on the deal. Using information gleaned from a second law firm, the trio also bought shares of Borderfree, an online commerce site that was an acquisition target of Pitney Bowes, the U.S. said. They made a profit of $841,000 on the trades after the deal was announced on May 18, 2015, according to the indictment. Prior to the Borderfree takeover, Hong and Chin bought so much of the company's stock that on certain days the two accounted for 25 percent or more of the company's trading volume, according to the SEC complaint.

The three men, identified as Iat Hong, Bo Zheng and Chin Hung, are accused of targeting law firms that specialized in mergers and acquisitions and hacking their email servers to siphon off insider trading scoops. The three had targeted seven law firms in New York, and successfully breached two unnamed firms, Preet Bharara, the US district attorney for New York, said in a statement on Tuesday. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: You are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," Bharara said in the statement. The hackers were able to buy shares for cheap before anyone else knew how much they would shoot up in value from the acquisition, investigators said. Hong, Zheng and Hung looked to hack the lawyers who were helping these deals go through, according to the district attorney's office. That's how they were able to make $1.4 million off of Intel's $16.7 billion merger with Altera in March 2015, officials said. Hong, Zheng and Hung had accessed one of the law firm's web server as early as July 2014 through illegally obtained credentials of one of its employees and installed malware on the server, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The trio had a list of 11 partners at the law firm who could provide the most valuable information. The malware helped the three men allegedly steal about 2.8 gigabytes of insider trading information, including an email on January 29, 2015 that included the deal terms and the proposed price Altera would be purchased for by the chipmaker. On 26 occasions, the alleged thieves purchased shares of Altera stock, netting more than 210,000 shares before selling it for a $1.4 million profit. After Intel's acquisition, Altera's share price had jumped by $9, 26 percent more than what they bought it for. Between August 1 and August 9, 2014, the three men also stole more than 50 gigabytes of confidential details from that law firm's email server, prompting them to buy 18,000 shares of Intermune stock before the drug maker was sold to Roche AG -- netting the accused hackers $380,000 in profit. They did the same for another New York law firm, targeting the firm's mergers and acquisitions partners, and installing malware on the servers. They allegedly made $841,000 off Borderfree, an e-commerce company, after it was acquired by Pitney Bowes in 2015. The US district attorney's office said this happened on at least 10 other deals, all using information the three hackers allegedly stole from the two law firms. While they weren't successful in hacking into the other five law firms, the three are accused of attempting to breach the servers on more than 100,000 occasions. The three are also accused of hacking into rival robotics companies and stealing confidential designs from their email servers between April 2014 and late 2015. Zheng, Hong and Hung were involved in a start-up robotics company, according to the affidavit (PDF). The three face at least 50 years in prison for their 13 charges and are awaiting extradition for an appearance in January.

The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it.   “Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision,” it said in a statement.              The decision in Seoul could mean lower costs for mobile phone makers and others in the tech supply chain who source Qualcomm chips, said a Taiwanese industry executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.   The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals.   Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC’s orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker.   A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones.   “How can they force you to license to a competitor? That’s what I never understood. I guarantee Qualcomm won’t want to do that,” he said, adding that the dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts.   The KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips, which were then used in handsets made by Samsung and LG.   Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them.   “Korea’s decision will serve as an important reference point for us,” Chiu Yung-ho, vice chairman and spokesman for Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters.

The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it.   “Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision,” it said in a statement.              The decision in Seoul could mean lower costs for mobile phone makers and others in the tech supply chain who source Qualcomm chips, said a Taiwanese industry executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.   The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals.   Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC’s orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker.   A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones.   “How can they force you to license to a competitor? That’s what I never understood. I guarantee Qualcomm won’t want to do that,” he said, adding that the dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts.   The KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips, which were then used in handsets made by Samsung and LG.   Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them.   “Korea’s decision will serve as an important reference point for us,” Chiu Yung-ho, vice chairman and spokesman for Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters. He gave no timeline on when Taiwan’s own year-long investigation would be concluded.   Se Young Lee & Stephen Nellis Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Qualcomm fined $854 mn by S Korean regulators The regulator ruled firm abused its dominant market position South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales, a decision the US chipmaker said it will challenge in court.   The fine, the largest ever levied in South Korea, marks the latest antitrust setback for Qualcomm’s most profitable business of licensing wireless patents to the mobile industry, at a time when the business is facing headwinds from a cooling smartphone market.   The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled on Wednesday Qualcomm abused its dominant market position and forced handset makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips.   Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chipmakers such as Intel Corp, Samsung Electronics Co and MediaTek Inc, the regulator said, hindering their sales and leaving their products vulnerable to lawsuits.   The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers if requested - measures that would affect the US firm’s dealings with major tech companies including Apple, Intel, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd if upheld.   The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm’s practices in 2014 following complaints from industry participants, but did not name specific companies.   Foreign companies including Apple, Intel, MediaTek and Huawei expressed their views during the regulator’s deliberation process, KFTC Secretary General Shin Young-son told a media briefing in the country’s administrative capital.   “We investigated and decided on these actions because Qualcomm’s actions limit overall competition,” Shin said, adding that the ruling was not about protecting domestic companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics but about improving market competition for all players.   Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home News Motherboards Motherboard makers are excited for AMD's new Ryzen CPUs AMD's next-gen Ryzen CPUs has motherboard makers excited for 'aggressive' orders as they believe demand will be high By: Anthony Garreffa | Motherboards News | Posted: 5 days, 6 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA I've been excited for AMD's next-gen Zen CPU architecture since day one, and that excitement has built up over the last 12 months into the official Ryzen CPU architecture AMD teased earlier this month.     Ryzen will rock up to 16 threads of CPU performance with an 8-core processor starting at 3.4GHz, and performance in the levels of the Core i7-6800K and 6900K from Intel. Now we're hearing that motherboard makers have been "rather aggressive about placing orders" for Ryzen-capable motherboards, as they "believe demand for the new platform will increase AMD's share in the worldwide desktop processor market in the second quarter of 2017", reports DigitTimes.   Better yet, we're getting an idea of how far along the Ryzen CPU and compatible motherboards are, with DigiTimes' report continuing: "The sources pointed out that they have started receiving high-end X370, mainstream B350 and entry-level A320 chipsets from AMD and are now in the final stage of finishing related testing and motherboard designing".   AMD is expected to launch its 8-core/16-thread Ryzen CPU in the final weeks of February, or early March. AMD should fully unveil Ryzen at CES 2017 next week, as well what I'm hoping will be a better look at Vega. Recommended for You ASRock Fatal1ty and Extreme4 Z270 motherboards detailed...

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents South Korea slaps Qualcomm with record-setting $850M fine Largest-ever penalty said to be warranted by Qualcomm's unfair patent licensing. by Joe Mullin - Dec 28, 2016 8:20 pm UTC Login to bookmark 47 Qualcomm displays some of its patents on a wall in its headquarters in San Diego, California. Nathan Rupert / flickr South Korean regulators say that Qualcomm's patent-licensing methods violate Korean unfair competition laws, and the company must pay a fine of 1.03 trillion won, or about $850 million or £695 million. Qualcomm has said it will fight the massive fine in court. The Korea Fair Trade Commission, or KFTC, held that Qualcomm refused to license certain standard-essential patents on its chips to rival chipmakers including Intel, Samsung, and MediaTek. The commission ordered Qualcomm to renegotiate those licenses in good faith, according to a Reuters report on the matter. The fine is the largest ever issued in Korea. In its report on the Korean fine, Bloomberg notes that Qualcomm makes most of its profits, about $6.5 billion in its most recent year, from selling the rights to its chip technology. Qualcomm "has violated its agreement to license patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms, known as FRAND," the Commission said in a statement. In response, Qualcomm issued a statement calling the fine "an unprecedented and insupportable decision, relating to licensing practices that have been in existence in Korea and worldwide for decades." Qualcomm also said the KFTC has shown no evidence of any harm to competition, which it claims is "robust among chip and handset suppliers" because Qualcomm's model promotes competition. The fine undermines incentives to invest. "Importantly, this decision does not take issue with the value of Qualcomm’s patent portfolio," said Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg. "Qualcomm’s enormous R&D investments in fundamental mobile technologies and its broad-based licensing of those technologies to mobile phone suppliers and others have facilitated the explosive growth of the mobile communications industry in Korea and worldwide." The KFTC directive won't become official until it issues a written decision and order, which typically takes about four to six months. Qualcomm has said it will immediately appeal at that time. The company will still have to pay the fine within 60 days after the written order comes out, although it will be subject to adjustment or refund based on the appeal. In a separate case brought by the Korea Fair Trade Commission in 2009, Qualcomm was hit with a $209 million fine, which was the largest in Korea's history at that time. That fine is on appeal at the Korean Supreme Court, according to Bloomberg. Last year, Qualcomm was fined $975 million by Chinese anti-monopoly regulators. The company did not challenge that decision, which also set rates and conditions for Qualcomm's licensing in China.

It is important to note that semiconductor trends are considered to be leading indicators of technology and broader electronics demand. A strong rally in the tech sector largely pushed many of these companies to new highs, as the Dow and S&P are both trading near all-time highs. The December 15 short interest data have been compared with the previous report. Short interest moves were mixed in these selected semiconductor stocks. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) saw its short interest increase to 78.62 million shares. The previous level was 77.66 million. Shares were last seen trading at $36.90, in a 52-week trading range of $27.68 to $38.36. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) had a short interest increase slightly to 82.81 million shares from the previous level of 82.41 million. Shares were recently trading at $11.66, in a 52-week range of $1.75 to $12.42. Note that like Intel and Micron, AMD is one of the most shorted Nasdaq stocks. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) saw the number of its shares short drop to 18.23 million, compared to the 19.20 million reported in the previous period. Shares were changing hands at $66.45, in a 52-week range of $42.24 to $71.62. Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) short interest fell to 14.51 million shares. The previous reading was 15.56 million. Shares were trading at $33.20, in a 52-week range of $15.44 to $33.68. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) saw its short interest decrease to 57.00 million shares from the previous reading of 60.02 million. Shares were trading at $22.91, in a 52-week range of $9.31 to $23.64. Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) short interest rose to 4.68 million shares in the period, from the previous 4.25 million. Shares were last seen at $180.31, in a 52-week range of $114.25 to $183.99.

The fine, which is the largest ever for South Korea, was handed down by the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) after it ruled on Wednesday that the company was abusing its market dominance by making smartphone manufacturers pay for an “unnecessarily broad” set of patents for its modem chips. The Commission also found that Qualcomm had limited access to some of its essential patents by competitors like Intel, Samsung and MediaTek, which left them susceptible to lawsuits and hindered potential sales. The findings closed out an investigation that began in 2014 and included intervention from Apple, Huawei, Intel and MediaTek. In addition to the fine, the regulator also ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with manufacturers if requested. For its part, Qualcomm has said it “strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision” and plans to appeal both the corrective order and fine. South Korea’s admonishment is the latest in a long line for the company. The news follows a Chinese fine in February 2015 and a strongly-worded caution from the European Union in December 2015. Meanwhile, investigations are pending in the U.S. and Taiwan. SourceReuters JD About damn time Ipse Did I miss when South Korea fined Samsung?

It helps us see what has changed and what hasn't, and where we might improve. 2016 has been a momentus year for storage. Here are the top stories. By Robin Harris for Storage Bits | December 28, 2016 -- 13:00 GMT (05:00 PST) | Topic: Storage (Image: file photo) Legacy vendors and the cloud The cloud has devastated revenue, growth and margins of legacy vendors. Any CFO can look online to see what similar capacity, performance, and higher availability costs compared to the huge capital costs of traditional RAID arrays. 2016 saw the world's largest independent storage company -- EMC -- bought by Dell, after shopping itself to all the big system vendors. The $60 billion price tag was excessive given the rapid obsolescence of much of EMC's intellectual property, but a worthy capstone to CEO Joe Tucci's brilliant leadership of the storage giant. Tucci saw what many other CEOs denied, which is that the scale-out commodity-based storage systems and the internalization of storage have forever changed the storage industry. EMC needed a system partner to leverage their storage expertise, and Dell needed a robust enterprise sales force. NetApp acquired SolidFire, a promising flash array vendor, that finally got them into the highest growth area of legacy storage. Plagued by years of flash misfires and infighting, NetApp has done well in the new market, but has had to lay off thousands of employees. NetApp is touting their integration with Amazon Web Services -- cloud -- but that is a rear guard action as cloud vendors gobble up more enterprise dollars. Their next big problem: object storage systems are getting faster, offer much better data protection, are much more scalable, and more cost-effective than NetApp's flagship NAS boxes. I hope their CEO, George Kurian, recognizes the threat and acts decisively in 2017. Legacy vendors and the upstarts Legacy vendors are getting squeezed between the cloud and aggressive storage startups. Companies like Nimble Storage, Nutanix, and Pure Storage offer modern architectures that leave the RAID paradigm in the dust. All three had successful IPOs, and now have the money to bring the fight to the legacy vendors. Other startups have been acquired by legacy vendors to remake their products lines. DSSD, supported by Silicon Valley legend Andreas Bechtolsheim, was bought by EMC a couple of years ago. NetApp acquired SolidFire this year. HGST acquired Amplidata last year and are making a solid play for the active archive market. The storage startup scene continues to boil. Non-volatile RAM NVRAM is the Next Big Thing for servers and notebooks, as support from Intel and Microsoft shows. Some versions -- there are around 10 -- are almost as fast as DRAM, but use much less power and are much denser. Terabyte DIMMs, anyone? Big Data will especially benefit from high capacity NVRAM equipped servers. 2016 was supposed to be the year that Intel introduced their NVRAM 3D XPoint Optane drives, but like many ambitious engineering projects, they've slipped into 2017, and may be one reason the recent MacBook Pro's were delayed. But Intel isn't the only player, and certainly isn't the first to market. MRAM vendor Everspin IPO'd this year, raising funds needed to further enhance their NVRAM line. Nantero licensed their NVRAM to a couple of major fabs, putting their carbon nanotube technology on the fast track. Thunderbolt 3 I've been a happy Thunderbolt 1 user for years. It's a great technology that is fast, stable, and low-cost. 2016 saw it get even better, now that one Thunderbolt 3 connector supports 40 Gbit/s bandwidth with half the power consumption of Thunderbolt 2. That's enough bandwidth to drive dual 4k displays at 60 Hz, PCIe 3.0, HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.2, as well as 10 Gbit/s USB 3.1. Plus to to 100 watts of power to charge systems and up to 15W for bus-powered devices. Using newly available and cheap PCIe switches, Thunderbolt 3 can be stretched to build large clusters at low prices. We'll see more of that in 2017. On notebooks it offers performance and connectivity undreamed of 10 years ago. External drives with gigabyte per second performance are already here, with more on the way. The Storage Bits take I've been involved with storage for over 35 years, starting when a disk drive cost $40 a megabyte. For the last 15 years the industry has been on an innovation spree that has upended many companies and delivered incredible capabilities. Storage is the basis of our digital world. Given the crisis of a post-fact world, I take comfort in the fact that a $100 billion plus industry is working hard to store and protect the data that is critical to the challenges humanity faces. Courteous comments welcome, of course. (Disclosure: I've done some work for HGST and Nimble in the last couple of years.)

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple CEO promises fresh Mac hardware, as report shows Apple is ignoring its desktops, macOS Apple CEO promises fresh Mac hardware, as report shows Apple is ignoring its desktops, macOS By Joel Hruska on December 21, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Apple’s recent MacBook Pro updates and “courageous” iPhone 7 have proven to be controversial, and a recent pair of news items highlights how much pent-up frustration is aimed at the device manufacturer. First, Tim Cook made several posts to an Apple employee bulletin board, detailing Apple’s thinking on thinking on both desktops and the intersection between hardware and software design. Cook writes: The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that… From a strategic point of view, we also focus on things where software, hardware and services all come together and bring out the magic that only Apple can. That’s our secret sauce. It shows up in a lot of different places, and it’s something that we look for in new employees. Apple CEO Tim Cook. A brand new report from Bloomberg offers an interesting counterweight to Cook’s confidence. According to that investigation, Apple has made a number of strategic decisions that took emphasis away from the Mac design teams. The software team has been reorganized, such that a dedicated macOS team no longer exists and most of the software engineers at Apple are iOS first, Mac second. Hardware engineers are now asked to work on multiple projects at once, or to develop multiple versions of a potential product simultaneously. For example, Apple engineers working on the 2016 MacBook update reportedly wanted to add a second USB-C port and Touch ID support, according to the report. Instead, Apple pushed out a slightly iteration of the same platform and a new “rose gold” color. Engineers working on Mac hardware no longer command the same attention from Jony Ive, the report said, and the appetite for leapfrogging the competition with a more daring approach to technology doesn’t always pay dividends — apparently Apple intended to introduce new battery technology with the MacBook Pro, but unspecified problems killed that option. The Bloomberg report concludes on this note: “Mac fans shouldn’t hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro.” Apple’s innovation decline Part of the problem Apple is facing is straightforward: CPUs haven’t really scaled since 2013. I discussed this last August, but it bears repeating. The image below shows the CPUs Apple currently sells in the three-year-old Mac Pro as compared with the most recent chips available from Intel: Each 2013-era chip is contrasted with its 2016 equivalent. Now, the one thing Apple could do is introduce some high core-count chips that weren’t really available in 2013. Back then, the Xeon E5v2 family topped out at 12 cores; modern CPUs in the E5v4 family top out at 22 cores within the same 135W TDP. But that option carries a hefty frequency penalty: The 12-core E5-2697v2 has a base clock of 2.7GHz and a boost clock of 3.5GHz. The 22-core E5-4699v4 has a 2.2GHz base frequency and a 3GHz boost clock. In other words, if your workload is embarrassingly parallel and can easily scale above 12 threads, the E5-4699v4 is a better option. If it doesn’t — or if you can’t afford the $7,000 price tag Intel has hung on the chip — you won’t see benefits. The GPU market is a markedly different story. AMD’s Polaris refresh would be a good fit for the iMac or even potentially lower-end variants of the Mac Pro, while Vega should address the Mac Pro market head-on (and of course, Nvidia has its own lineup of GPUs, should Apple be interested). Either way, the GPUs baked into current Mac systems are quite old. Apple has never put graphics front-and-center, and it failed to follow up on the graphics-centric argument it made for the Mac Pro. Instead of investing in OpenGL or OpenCL (macOS still only supports OCL 1.2, despite OCL 2.0 now being widely available), Apple has doubled-down on Metal, its own custom iOS API that it also backported to macOS. But major companies like Adobe, which do make use of GPU acceleration, have only begun to add Metal support and it’s not fully baked yet. But I don’t think the issues Apple is facing with macOS and its various Mac systems are simply a matter of lackluster hardware cycles. Apple used to present buyers with a very simple argument: “It just works.” Those three words, however inaccurate or accurate you feel they happen to be, captured most of how Apple marketed itself to customers. MacOS was easier to use. The iPhone and iMac were designed to work together. Apple hardware was a consolidated, discrete ecosystem, with fewer choices but better integration of its various components. And while you may not have found this argument particularly appealing, there was truth to it. Apple built routers and peripherals that were designed to interface with its own software and platforms in ways that other companies rarely matched. That argument seems much less potent now than it did in the past. Apple is leaving the peripheral business (apart from dongles, natch) and its clearly not putting the resources into macOS development that it once did. The latest MacBook and MacBook Pro don’t ‘just work’ unless you’ve got a varying number of dongles to hook up. In the event the company does refresh the Mac Pro, everyone who shucked out for Thunderbolt 2 adapters so they could plug non-Thunderbolt peripherals into the system is going to need to buy Thunderbolt 3 adapters for their Thunderbolt 2-to-USB (or what have you) adapters so they can continue to use their hardware. It’s not very Mac-like, when you get right down to it. In fact, it’s precisely the kind of inelegant-but-functional arrangement I associate with PCs. There’s another answer to this issue, though — one that has nothing to do with Tim Cook or Steve Jobs and everything to do with the evolution of the PC and smartphone ecosystems. In retrospect, it’s clear that the iPod, iPhone, and touchscreen interfaces arrived during the last great hurrah of Moore’s Law, at a time when process node scaling and multi-core products were still delivering rapid improvements. The original iPhone in 2007 happened because it became possible for a capacitive touchscreen device to happen. Steve Jobs and Apple still deserve credit for the idea, but the idea only worked because technology had advanced to the point that it could be made to work. Such inflection points are rare — one could argue that we’ve only had a handful throughout the entire history of computing. The first computers relied on a non-realtime batch interface, followed by command-line interfaces that incorporated video terminals and keyboards. The addition of the mouse and GUI are significant enough to deserve their own separate classification, followed by the rise of capacitive touchscreens since 2007. In 72 years (1945 – 2016) we’ve had four of these transitions, and Steve Jobs’ career happened to fall at a time when he could make significant contributions to both. In the end, it scarcely matters. However loyal Apple customers may be in the short term, they’ll inevitably leave the platform if Tim Cook doesn’t give them reason to stay. 2016 was a distinct let-down in this regard, and 2017 isn’t looking much better if the Bloomberg report is right.

They probably can’t fathom not tweaking a processor to get the best possible performance they can out of it. While the public has to wait for a bit to get their hands on Intel’s latest Kaby Lake Core i7 processors, the company has sent out several units to overclocking professionals over the past few weeks to see what they can do with it. On such professional has been able to overclock the Core i7-7700K past a whopping 7 GHz. Professional overclocker Allen “Splave” Golibersuch tweaked the Core i7-7700K to blaze past 7 GHz by disabling key features like hyperthreading and two of the processor’s four cores. The clock multiplier was turned up to 69x and the Vcore voltage pushed past 2.00V. These are not the sort of settings that an average user would need to would even know how to configure. It’s safe to say that special aftermarket cooling will be required to run such a setup and a motherboard that’s designed for overclocking will be required as well. The 7022.96 MHz clock of Golibersuch’s Core i7-7700K appears to have been fairly stable, demonstrating that the processor can do much more than what the average user can fathom. He had to use liquid nitrogen to cool this overclock which was reportedly bench stable because that’s just what overclockers do. Filed in Computers. Read more about core i7, Intel and overclocking.

The attacks seem to be relatively straightforward: hackers broke into two law firms seeking data on future deals, like acquisitions, and then placed trades with knowledge that others in the market weren’t aware of. It’s classic insider trading, just with a cybercrime twist. Just the beginning “This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: you are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals,” U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said this week. The U.S. government is charging the three hackers with computer intrusion, insider trading, wire fraud and conspiracy, Reuters said, noting that just one of the men has been arrested. The trio of hackers reportedly began attacking the law firms as early as 2014, placing malware on system computers. The three hackers reportedly made off with as much as $4 million before the U.S. decided to swoop in and make its arrests.

Korea fines Qualcomm $854m for violating competition laws Qualcomm says it will fight ruling in court Published: 17:08 December 28, 2016 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE SEJONG, South Korea, SAN FRANCISCO South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm Inc 1.03 trillion won (Dh3.1 billion, $854 million) for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales, a decision the US chipmaker said it will challenge in court. The fine, the largest ever levied in South Korea, marks the latest antitrust setback for Qualcomm’s most profitable business of licensing wireless patents to the mobile industry, at a time when the business is facing headwinds from a cooling smartphone market. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled on Wednesday Qualcomm abused its dominant market position and forced handset makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips. Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chipmakers such as Intel Corp, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and MediaTek Inc, the regulator said, hindering their sales and leaving their products vulnerable to lawsuits. The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers if requested — measures that would affect the US firm’s dealings with major tech companies including Apple Inc, Intel, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd if upheld. The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm’s practices in 2014 following complaints from industry participants, but did not name specific companies. Foreign companies including Apple, Intel, MediaTek and Huawei expressed their views during the regulator’s deliberation process, KFTC Secretary General Shin Young-son told a media briefing in the country’s administrative capital. “We investigated and decided on these actions because Qualcomm’s actions limit overall competition,” Shin said, adding that the ruling was not about protecting domestic companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics Inc but about improving market competition for all players. Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it. “Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision,” it said in a statement. The decision in Seoul could mean lower costs for mobile phone makers and others in the tech supply chain who source Qualcomm chips, said a Taiwanese industry executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. In regulatory crosshairs The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC’s orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker. A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones. “How can they force you to license to a competitor? That’s what I never understood. I guarantee Qualcomm won’t want to do that,” he said, adding that the dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts. The KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips, which were then used in handsets made by Samsung and LG. Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them. “Korea’s decision will serve as an important reference point for us,” Chiu Yung-ho, vice-chairman and spokesman for Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters. He gave no timeline on when Taiwan’s own year-long investigation would be concluded.

The new ThinkPads are getting better screens, faster DDR4 memory and more storage capacity. Features like USB-C ports, optional LTE connectivity, precision touchpads and optional infrared cameras for Windows Hello are being offered across the ThinkPad X, L and T series. Lenovo also introduced the ThinkPad Yoga 370 2-in-1, which is the first model in the brand with a 13.3-inch HD screen and a Thunderbolt 3 port. The upgraded products are mainly workhorse ThinkPads, but Lenovo is also expected to separately announce flashier laptops and 2-in-1s at CES. Lenovo doesn't mess around with the design of mainstream ThinkPads, which have a strong following, but you can expect thinner and lighter laptops with longer battery life. The ThinkPad Yoga 370, which weighs 1.37 kilograms, will be available starting at $1,264 in March. The device turns into a tablet when you rotate the screen 360 degrees. It will include up to 1TB of SSD storage and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. In addition to Thunderbolt 3, it has two USB 3.0 ports, a MicroSD slot and an HDMI port. A cheaper option with a 13.3-inch screen is the ThinkPad 13, which comes with an HD screen and NVMe SSD storage. It will be available this month starting at $674. One upgrade in the popular X200 series is the ThinkPad X270, which has a 12.5-inch screen, and the same look and feel as its X260 predecessor, which has Skylake. The laptop has up to 16GB of DDR4 memory and up to 1TB of SSD or 2GB of hard-drive storage. It also has USB-C, HDMI, two USB 3.0, SD card and a SIM slot. It will be available in March starting at $909 with a 1366 x 768 pixel non-touch screen. The powerful ThinkPad T-series, which is a favorite among business buyers, stands out for its sleeker look. The screens have thinner borders and the laptops are smaller and lighter as a result.  The ThinkPad T470 (starting at $914, available in February) is available with or without an HD screen, while the T470p (starting at $1,049, available in March) and T470s (starting at $1,099, available in February) are available with screen resolutions up to 2560 x 1440 pixels. The laptops have a wide range of storage and memory options, but only the T470 has a Thunderbolt 3 port. For those who don't want integrated graphics, the T470p can be configured with Nvidia's N16S-GTR discrete graphics card, which is mainly designed for laptop workstations. Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 is the most loaded laptop of the bunch, and can be configured with a 4K 15.6-inch touch display, Intel's superfast Optane memory, Nvidia's GeForce 940MX discrete graphics and up to 32GB of DRAM. It will be available in March starting at $909. It will weigh 2.04 kilograms, and can also be configured with a Snapdragon LTE modem. It will also include an HDMI slot, three USB 3.0 ports and one Thunderbolt 3 connector.

The latest terrorist atrocity in Europe — in which a man drove a truck into a crowd shopping at an outdoor Christmas market in Berlin, Germany, December 19, killing 12 and injuring 49 — highlighted the fact that intelligence agencies throughout Europe are still struggling to unite on common intelligence sharing. © AP Photo/ Anis Amri, a Tunisian suspect in the Berlin truck attack Italian authorities shot dead Anis Amri, the Berlin market attack suspect, during a routine check in the Sesto San Giovanni area of Milan, in the early hours of December 23 — but only after he had traveled from Germany, through France and into Italy despite being the most wanted man in Europe. Latest reports suggest he even may have traveled via The Netherlands. Questions are being asked on how he managed to cross out of Germany and reach Italy in the middle of a massive police and security agency hunt in Europe at a time when the issue of terrorism, security, border control and immigration is so politically sensitive. It was revealed he was known to German authorities, had been under surveillance, the subject of two deportation attempts, suspected of planning an attack and his details had been passed on to them by foreign agencies. Even if Anis Amri has been put off the streets we need to admit it was a lucky catch. We need more inter EU Intel exchange #berlinattack — karim (@Specta_Orientem) December 23, 2016 ​​A senior UK security expert, Will Geddes, founder of ICP Group says one of the major issues is the federalized nature of many agencies in EU member states. "There are some failings on the German side, in terms of their intelligence instruments, because they are very federalized and they are [now in the same situations as] where France was after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, where none of [the French] intelligence agencies were really effectively communicating with each other," Geddes told Sputnik.  "That is not to say that there aren't those that have rally upped their game — and France is certainly one of them — however, it's evident by what we've seen materializing in Germany that there is still quite some way to go."  German Law Enforcement Divisions  © AFP 2016/ CLEMENS BILAN Berlin Terror Attack: Mixture of Luck and Failings - Security Expert Germany's law enforcement agencies operate historically at state level, where the Landespolizei carry out the bulk of the work of policing. Only the Bundespolizei operates at federal level, having emerged from the Bundesgrenzschutz — the Federal Border Guard — and become responsible for major national emergencies beyond the scope of the state police forces. Meanwhile — also at federal level — the Federal Intelligence Service (Bundesnachrichtendienst) and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz), respectively deal with national security externally and internally. The latter has no powers of arrest and cannot use force, but can pass on information to another agency, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office (Bundeskriminalamt). "It's not so much the question of the sharing of intelligence, but how are they going to disseminate it within their own countries.  The biggest problem is that some of those territories — like Germany — that are federalized means that [agencies in countries such as] the UK may pass on those nuggets of intelligence, but are they cascading through to all the relevant agencies to ensure that they have got the best picture and a tapestry of the terrorism trail in their own country?" Geddes told Sputnik. ...

The updated laptops now sport the latest, seventh-generation Core processors from Intel, along with fingerprint scanners, beefed up security courtesy of a discrete Trusted Platform Module 2.0 chip, and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity. The company also revealed a new ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 dock, and a ThinkPad USB Type-C dock for adding additional ports for ThinkPad laptops. Before we dive in, take note that the following devices sport the “Signature Edition” of Windows 10 Pro or Home. That means customers won’t find the annoying bloatware that typically comes preinstalled on laptops — unnecessary software loaded by the laptop maker that eats system resources and storage space, slowing the device down. Many laptops listed on the following pages are compatible with WiGig, which is the next level of wireless connectivity, better known at Wireless AD. It adds the 60GHz band to the current 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands already offered in Wireless N and Wireless AC, with speeds of up to 8 gigabits per second. Right now, the Wireless AC 5GHz band is only capable of up to 1.3 gigabits per second. That said, 2017 will be the year Wireless AD (WiGig) explodes on the mass market. ThinkPad Yoga 370 This unit, according to Lenovo, is designed for both business and general use, packing a 360-degree hinge and a “Lift n’ Lock” keyboard to make this a unique 2-in-1 device. Despite its “transforming” form factor, the ThinkPad Yoga 370 is durable enough to be certified for military use. Other notable features include a touch-enabled screen, Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, WiGig support, a fingerprint scanner, and a lightweight form factor of just over 3 pounds.

Many of us had cold feet when it came to trying out a new system and abandoning the safe comfort of our Symbian’s. In 2011, When people had pretty much chosen a side, Bluestacks provided the final push that made people still holding onto their old devices finally jump ship. It simulated an Android experience on a Windows machine, meaning people could finally try out a new OS without the risk of buying a news phone. It became the Gold Standard for Android Emulators on PC. Many Android Apps were given the big treatment.Apps like Snapseed and Sketchbook worked better on a larger screen. At the 2011, Computex trade show in Taipei, Bluestacks was featured on the AMD Exhibit which showed off a emulator running on top of Windows 7. What was more astonishing at that time was the fact that Android apps required an ARM architecture to run, but courtesy of Bluestack's patented Layercake technology an x86 tablet could switch back and forth between Windows and Android without much of a hassle. "Bluestacks emulates Android on Windows using a three-step virtualisation process- Processor level virtualisation, graphics level virtualisation and a translator which translates ARM code to Intel code on the fly," Chief Technology officer of Bluestacks, Suman Saraf told Gizmodo India. Its Layercake technology basically exploits hardware accelerators found in x86 chips to run Android apps and games smoothly on Windows systems. A version of the emulator was ported to the MacOS system as well. It has been more than half a decade since then and BlueStacks have continuously rediscovered itself to keep up with rapidly changing trends. It did start off as an emulator for Android apps for PC and to an extent, it still is. Only now, the emphasis is more on Android gaming than running apps. The company was quick to realise the potential of a robust Android emulator for PCs for competitive and immersive Android gaming. After all, who wants to keep their gaming restricted to a tiny window when there are large monitors ready for use? Bluestacks struck gold offering the solution to adopt the PC gaming culture of using mouse and keyboards over to Android gaming. "There's no reason to keep Android gaming constricted only to small screens. Just like how PC gaming is more immersive, Bluestacks can do the same for Android gaming," Suman said. Bluestacks became the world's largest mobile gaming platform on PC with over 150 million downloads and over 1.5 billion apps played every month. China is the platform's largest subscriber base, followed by India. And this surge in its popularity gave Bluestacks the confidence it needed to build out its own App Store and invite independent developers to make apps and games exclusively for the emulator platform. It has formed an indie developer community to allow independent game developers to leverage Bluestack's large subscriber base. It provides indie game devs a platform to promote their games with the potential of even featuring them on the Welcome Page and the Top Apps section which attracts the most number of visitors. Yet, the latest exploit has been in the space of Game Streaming. Recently, Bluestacks launched BTV, a platform to livestream your gameplay to a worldwide audience in collaboration with Twitch. Using the Bluestacks App Player, a gamer can directly sign up or sign in to Twitch and start streaming in no time. In addition, you can even watch other streams and play simultaneously while watching a stream. All the usual features are loaded into BTV. You get a string of recommended games to stream based on the games you play and stream. It gives you the ability to connect your mic, webcam and even preview the streams before making it live. With BTV, the larger aim of Bluestacks is perhaps to enter competitive gaming and be at the forefront of e-gaming tournaments that are a rave among gamers especially in China, Korea, Taiwan and India. Using BTV, anyone can organize and run their own tournaments around a game of their choice. As Android started to make its presence known in living rooms in the form of Chromecast, Android TVs and in laptops with ChromeOS, Bluestack's pivot to streaming Android games on PC was a masterstroke to stay relevant. Bluestacks was quick to let everyone know the advantages it had over competitors like Steam, Origin and UPlay when it comes to streaming and playing games. For starters, courtesy its full-fledged support for Android apps and games, it boasts of a catalogue of 1.5 million Android games. The closest anyone else gets to it is Steam with just 5,600 titles. It needs the least powerful hardware to run on and supports Android, HTML5, Flash and Macs other than PCs. But the most important feature is its direct integration with Twitch. All this makes Bluestacks the go-to platform to play and stream many games. Bluestacks started off with closing the gap between Android mobile devices and PCs and giving early adopters a taste of what Android can do and now when the rest of the world has finally come onboard the Android experience, it has trained its crosshairs on giving game developers a platform to promote their games and for players to enjoy their favorite games on the big screen and share it with a global audience.

Se Young Lee and Stephen Nellis SEJONG, South Korea/SAN FRANCISCO — Reuters Published Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2016 6:54AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2016 6:57AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm Inc 1.03 trillion won ($854-million) for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales, a decision the U.S. chip maker said it will challenge in court. The fine, the largest ever levied in South Korea, marks the latest antitrust setback for Qualcomm’s most profitable business of licensing wireless patents to the mobile industry, at a time when the business is facing headwinds from a cooling smartphone market. Video: Qualcomm fined $854-million by South Korea (Reuters) The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled on Wednesday Qualcomm abused its dominant market position and forced handset makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips. Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chip makers such as Intel Corp, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and MediaTek Inc, the regulator said, hindering their sales and leaving their products vulnerable to lawsuits. The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chip makers on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers if requested – measures that would affect the U.S. firm’s dealings with major tech companies including Apple Inc, Intel, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd if upheld. The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm’s practices in 2014 following complaints from industry participants, but did not name specific companies. Foreign companies including Apple, Intel, MediaTek and Huawei expressed their views during the regulator’s deliberation process, KFTC Secretary General Shin Young-son told a media briefing in the country’s administrative capital. “We investigated and decided on these actions because Qualcomm’s actions limit overall competition,” Shin said, adding that the ruling was not about protecting domestic companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics Inc but about improving market competition for all players. Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it. “Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision,” it said in a statement. The decision in Seoul could mean lower costs for mobile phone makers and others in the tech supply chain who source Qualcomm chips, said a Taiwanese industry executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. IN REGULATORY CROSSHAIRS The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975-million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC’s orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chip maker. A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to licence patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones. “How can they force you to licence to a competitor? That’s what I never understood. I guarantee Qualcomm won’t want to do that,” he said, adding that the dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts. The KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips, which were then used in handsets made by Samsung and LG. Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them. “Korea’s decision will serve as an important reference point for us,” Chiu Yung-ho, vice chairman and spokesman for Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters. He gave no timeline on when Taiwan’s own year-long investigation would be concluded.
