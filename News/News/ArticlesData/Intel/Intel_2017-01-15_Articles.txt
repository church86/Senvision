CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Intel has a $100m plan to bring the IoT and robots to the high street Chris Davies - Jan 16, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Shopping is about to get seriously high-tech, with Intel launching its Responsive Retail Platform, an Internet of Things upgrade for stores that will track shoppers as much as stock. Announced today, the Intel RRP is effectively a combination of a common language for various sensors intended for use in retail environments, a new tracking device, and a cloud-gateway combination that, altogether, promise to make brick & mortar stores as clever as their pattern-calculating online counterparts. Along the way, it might also mean more robots in the aisles. While online shopping has been at the forefront of Big Data-style pattern crunching, with retailers like Amazon building vast and comprehensive profiles of each customer so as to make better recommendations and encourage more sales, physical stores have been slower to upgrade. That’s something Intel plans to pump $100m into over the next five years, CEO Brian Krzanich said today. Intel RRP is built around a new Responsive Retail Sensor, a multi-sensor product with an RFID reader and antenna specially designed for dense retail environments. It’s intended to record from numerous data points across the store; eventually, Intel says, it’ll expand to include video gathering along with WiFi and Bluetooth LE connectivity. It’s based on an Intel Atom processor. Each of those sensors communicates with the RRP Gateway. That’s currently built by HP, which has two such systems, each hooking up to the Responsive Retail Sensors over ethernet and using Intel’s Core i7 and Xeon processors. Data is passed to the cloud via wired, WiFi, or 3G/LTE networks; some local processing of real-time analytics is supported, but for everything else there’s an open-source analytics platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that can be run in AWS, Azure, or similar. It’s that which does the interesting work. For instance, with a combination of RFID, video, radio, and other sensors, Intel’s new platform could keep track of stock in real-time, spotting incorrectly-placed items on shelves, and tallying up what’s on the floor and what’s in the back room. Items taken into changing rooms but not subsequently making it to the checkout could be monitored, both to help prevent theft and to figure out what isn’t being loved enough to make a sale. The upgraded aisles, meanwhile, could be patrolled by stock-checking robots like Simbe Robotics’ Tally. Resembling a price-check scanner atop a Roomba, the robot is designed to take on some of the more mundane tasks that human staff would otherwise need to. That includes auditing shelves for out-of-stock items and low stock items, looking out for misplaced items, and spotting any pricing errors. Tally can be active during store hours, and in combination with other sensors opens the door to even more precise restocking schedules. Intel isn’t the only tech company looking to revolutionize old-school retail, of course. Last month, Amazon revealed plans to open a physical store in 2017 that, with a combination of cameras and other sensors, would do away completely with the traditional checkout process. Shoppers at the store, dubbed Amazon Go, would check in with their Amazon account and then be observed as they grabbed items from the shelves; simply walking out at the end would be enough to trigger payment.

ByNatalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | January 16, 2017 -- 15:35 GMT (07:35 PST) | Topic: Internet of Things Image: Intel Intel CEO Brian Krzanich spoke at the National Retail Federation's Big Show conference on Monday and announced the chipmaker's latest platform for the retail sector. What's Hot on ZDnet Microsoft's multi-pronged robotics play takes shape Trump aides' use of encrypted messaging may violate records law ​Ex top Mozilla dev: Ditch all antivirus except Microsoft's Defender Students team aims to brew beer on the moon It's called the Responsive Retail Platform (RRP), and according to Intel, it connects disparate islands of in-store technology and makes it easier to develop and deploy Internet of Things (IoT) software and services. Simply put, it works to bring together retail hardware, software, APIs, and sensors in a standardized way. "Think of it as a Xeon-based multi-tenant processor for the store," said Intel marketing director Ryan Parker, during a pre-briefing on the news. The core of the platform is Intel's low-power integrated sensor with RFID capability and an expandable sensor suite that allows for the eventual inclusion of other sensors from third-party sensor vendors. The sensors can be used to track inventory and generate in-store data that highlights store activity and customer preferences. The RRP also includes an open source analytics platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for cloud applications from independent software vendors (ISVs). The current RRP runs on an Intel Core i7 processor-based gateway, but as more use cases become available, Intel said it will enable Intel Xeon processor-based gateways for better efficiency. The platform is available today through Intel's partner ecosystem. "This is one of those rare situations where it's a win-win-win," Parker added. "It's a win for Intel, and a win for sensor vendors and ISVs because they don't currently have access to the market. And retailers get a lot of choice." Intel also announced plans to invest more than $100 million over the next five years in the retail industry. The investment supports Intel's wider efforts to integrate aspects of IoT and other technologies like virtual reality and robotics into retail to address needs ranging from inventory management to checkout. Krzanich made sure to note that this kind of technology innovation is not intended to displace workers -- a growing concern with the rise of robotics, artificial intelligence and automation in the workplace -- but rather to allow stores to shift human resources to other areas in operations. "With technology like robots and artificial intelligence to free up employees, every aspect of the store and supply chain will allow retail employees to better focus on the customer and improve the store's performance," Krzanich said. "By bringing together virtual reality and the power of data, we'll help create the store of the future -- one that is smart, responsive, connected and secure." Also at NRF, Intel is showcasing new technology for on-demand, in-store 3D knitting, real-time clothing and shoe matching platforms, and interactive product displays designed to boost customer engagement.

Page 1 of 3. 5 Comments In addition to Nouveau Gallium3D seeing a performance boost last week, last week Intel's Vulkan driver also seen some interesting work around HiZ. Here are some fresh benchmarks showing recent performance improvements to the Intel "ANV" Mesa Vulkan driver plus some fresh OpenGL benchmarks too. For this testing are results for a Core i5 6600K "Skylake" system with HD Graphics 530. Tests were done on Ubuntu 16.10 with the Linux 4.10 Git kernel. Being compared today was Mesa 13.0.3 stable, Mesa 13.1-dev Git from earlier this year, and then Mesa 17.0-dev Git (since being renamed from 13.1 to 17.0) from today. So there's a look at how the performance compares to the current stable series and then how the graphics performance has evolved in just the past two weeks. With the Mesa 17.0 branching expected at any time now, this is nearly what the Intel Skylake Mesa performance will look like for next month's Mesa 17.0.0 debut. All of these Intel Linux OpenGL and Vulkan benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

Page 1 of 1. 9 Comments The MSI X99A RAIDER is a sub-$200 LGA-2011 v3 motherboard. I've been using it for almost two months now on one of the daily Linux benchmarking systems and it's been running great. This shouldn't be a big surprise though given the Intel X99 chipset is now rather mature and in the past I've successfully tested the MSI X99A WORKSTATION and X99S SLI PLUS motherboards on Linux. The X99A RAIDER is lower cost than these other MSI X99 motherboards I've tested, which led me in its direction, and then sticking with MSI due to the success with these other boards and MSI being a supporter of Phoronix and encouraging our Linux hardware testing compared to some other vendors. The MSI X99A RAIDER supports LGA-2011v3 Xeon / Core CPUs, up to eight DDR4-UDIMM ECC memory modules, USB 3.1 support, M.2 storage, SATA Express + SATA 3.0, Intel Gigabit LAN, and all the other usual features expected from modern motherboards. I've been running this system with an Intel Xeon E5-2609 v4 Broadwell CPU, 16GB of DDR4-2133 memory, and 256GB Corsair Force LX SSD graphics. The Linux distributions I've run with this setup include Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 16.10, and Intel Clear Linux. Currently this system is used for daily Clear Linux benchmarks on LinuxBenchmarking.com. For those interested there are some benchmarks with this motherboard on OpenBenchmarking.org. Several weeks into using this system, the MSI X99A RAIDER continues working out great so simply wanted to pass it along in case anyone else is looking for a X99 / LGA-2011v3 motherboard on the lower-cost side at under $200 USD. Those potentially interested can find the motherboard currently in stock at NewEgg.com. Those with any questions about it and Linux can drop by our forums.

By Quiruben Dela Cruz https://twitter.com/Vhelskud on January 16 2017 11:26 PM PHOTOGRAPH: PlayStation | Share Tweet Share Share Email The Styx: Shards of Darkness system requirements had just been revealed. It appears as if the Unreal Engine 4 stealth-based assassin game is a bit demanding. Users must have a high CPU content, as well as at least 8GB of RAM accompanied by a moderate GPU. Styx: Shards of Darkness System Requirements When it comes to the AMD side, the developers ask for an Octa-core Piledriver CPU or stronger. As for the Intel side, the game requires an Intel Quad-Core Broadwell i5 running at 3.1GHz or stronger. In addition to this, the game will require an NVIDIA GTX 570 or R7 370 graphics processing unit or above. All of the specifications mentioned above should be accompanied by at least 8GB of RAM. The RAM specification appears to be lower given that games nowadays usually require 16GB. Furthermore, the game itself looks impressive when it comes to the graphical side. PlayStation Hence, users playing on resolutions higher than 1920 x 1080p should have a higher-end hardware, especially on the GPU side. Increasing the graphical settings could also result in lower performance. In that case, players who wish to play the game at higher graphical settings and resolutions should at least have twice the power of the hardware mentioned above. As for the Styx: Shards of Darkness system requirements breakdown, read on below. Processor: Intel Core i5-5675 at 3.1GHz or AMD FX 8320 at 3.5GHz Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 570 or AMD Radeon R7 370 RAM: 8GB Operating System: Windows 7 64-bit Additional Notes: Online connections is required for the game’s Co-op Play. Styx: Shards of Darkness Release Date The game is scheduled to arrive on March 14 on PC. With that in mind, there is still a lot of time for the developers to figure out the recommended specifications for the game. However, the absence of the recommended settings is kind of a bad sign. Recommended system requirements usually aim for “High” settings on most games. For more news and updates on Styx: shards of Darkness system requirements, stay tuned to TheBitBag.

And there are signs of progress. [Photo: Unsplash user Cindy Tang] More from Innovation Agents How Sesame Street Explains The Toughest Parts Of Life GoodRx And Iodine Quietly Merge To Help Consumers Find The Right Drugs Now MailChimp Is Helping Small Businesses Buy Facebook Ads How Sesame Street Taught Kids About Emotions Long Before Schools Caught On Jared Newman 01.16.17 6:00 AM Smart home gadgets were everywhere at the CES trade show in January, from useful iterations on connected light bulbs and door locks to odder endeavors such as fridge cams and connected trash cans. But one theme was constant: They're not all going to work together. While some of these devices can communicate with others, no universal language yet exists for the "Internet of Things"—the industry catch-all term for ordinary devices made more powerful through connectivity. Device makers must instead choose between disparate frameworks such as Apple's HomeKit, Samsung's SmartThings, Works with Nest, Android's Things, and Amazon's Alexa. The burden then falls on users to determine whether the products they want are compatible with the system they bought into. The good news is that standardization is under way, with meaningful progress toward a common language for all these devices. But it'll probably be another CES or two until consumers start to notice. No More Standards War The Open Connectivity Foundation—the industry body that's building an Internet of Things standard—didn't have an outsized presence at CES. Its modest demo pavilion blended into a sea of booths within the smart home section of the Sands Expo, which itself is a shuttle ride away from the cavernous Las Vegas Convention Center that serves as CES's main venue. Yet the firms that are leading OCF are some of the biggest in technology, including Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung, LG, and Sony. LIFX light bulbs support OCF predecessor AllSeen. Until about a year ago, those companies were split on how to standardize. Intel and Samsung belonged to one standards group, called the Open Interconnect Consortium, while Qualcomm, Microsoft, LG, and Sony were part of the AllSeen Alliance. Each group was developing its own framework, with seemingly different policies over intellectual property, structure, and bylaws. But over the last year, those two groups hashed out their differences and merged into one entity, now called the OCF. All members are now working toward a single framework that will support the couple dozen existing products already certified by AllSeen. With the newfound unity, there's been an uptick in interest from device makers; the group now has more than 300 members. "I think we've eliminated one of the potential hurdles for other companies to consider joining and participating," says Matt Perry, a Microsoft program manager who is also the OCF's president. Look For The Logo The goal for this year, Perry says, is to get products into the market. Member companies are now trying to define standard behavior for various types of devices—for instance, a common on-off function across all connected light bulbs, and a common set of climate adjustments for smart thermostats—and are coming up with a certification process. The group has also started working beyond the smart home, into automotive and industrial applications. "A standard's just a standard. When it really gets interesting is when you have real products that are interoperating together, and that makes it more compelling for other companies to join," Perry says. The connected refrigerator at the OCF's CES display To that end, the OCF used its CES booth to demonstrate how products might work together. A living room section showed light bulbs, a TV, an air conditioner, and a robot vacuum cleaner all turning on and off from a single command on a Windows PC. In the kitchen section, the touch screen on a connected fridge triggered the room's lighting, air purifier, air conditioner, and coffee maker. The OCF also demonstrated its potential for medical devices, for instance allowing different-brand blood pressure detectors to feed standardized information into a single smartphone app. Once the OCF feels it has enough products, it'll offer a logo that consumers can look for. The logo wasn't always a certainty—last year, Perry said the OCF was still evaluating whether to create one—but since then, member companies have started to ask for it. "The companies are proud of the work they put in from a tech perspective, and they trust the certification program, so they wanted to have some way to represent that work, and asked us to have a cert mark so they can put it on their products," says Kimberly Lewis, a marketing program manager for Intel's Standards and Advanced Technologies group. The OCF isn't giving a timeline for when that logo might appear, or how many devices the group would like to see on the market first. But Lewis notes that there's a lot of interest in pushing things forward. "Everyone's anxious to make money, so it's like, 'When are we going to be done?'" she says. "That's a good problem to have, that people want to start putting this in their products." Can Open Win? Although competition among standards is no longer an obstacle, the OCF still has plenty of competition from existing Internet of Things platforms. Some of the biggest companies in tech, including Apple and Google, aren't participating, nor is smart home mainstay ZigBee, which used CES to announce its own common language for smart homes. Device makers must still make tough decisions about which of these platforms to support. Perry says the OCF's phone lines are still open, though it doesn't sound like there's been much progress in working with the major players who aren't yet on board. For now, the OCF is assuring itself with the long view, believing that free, open standards will prevail over time. People shouldn't have to worry whether their smart door lock is compatible with Apple's system, or Google's, or Amazon's. "There's only one company out there that's probably going to be successful with a vertically integrated stack or solution, and that's Apple," says Gary Martz, Intel's product line director for Internet of Things communications frameworks. "And even then, in markets where they've done this, at some point in time, markets develop to a level of maturity where there are enough industry heavyweights that they'll sit at the table and they'll participate as well." That's not to say there's no room for proprietary systems. One might imagine a virtual assistant like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa sitting on top of all these connected devices, able to control them all in a standard way instead of needing each device maker to add their own support. (Alexa currently has more than 7,000 "skills," but gadget companies must hand-craft each integration individually.) The real value of interoperability, Martz says, is that it grows the overall market so that these kinds of uses can flourish. "The players that recognize this are going to do very well," Martz says. "If somebody comes in and says, 'Oh, my brand is so important, and I'm going to use this space as a competitive barrier,' they're not going to be successful, not in this space, not in the narrow space that OCF has defined as having this common framework." That's not to say there's no room for proprietary systems. But Martz's point is that those systems—whether they're virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, home-monitoring services, or other types of offerings—should sit on top of interoperable hardware. In other words, people shouldn't have to worry whether their smart door lock is compatible with Apple's system, or Google's, or Amazon's. Instead, "door lock" would be a generic concept that every service could tie into, with no walled gardens keeping them out. "The players that recognize this are going to do very well," Martz says, whereas companies that try to use hardware compatibility to beat their competitors will fail. On the whole, he's optimistic that the industry will choose the right path. "[Compatibility] is not the space that we need to differentiate our products on," he adds. "This is the space where we all need to agree on interoperability, so we can all provide features above the standards." Never miss a story.

Until today, the Intel i965 graphics drivers offered by the well-known Padoka and Oibaf PPAs for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) and Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) operating systems exposed only OpenGL 4.0 for Intel Haswell GPUs, thus support for some demanding games just wasn’t there. Last week, we told you that the Mesa team decided to change the versioning scheme of the devel branch to Mesa 17.0.0 from 13.1.0, a change that, apparently, will happen at the beginning of every year, and that developer Juan A. Suarez Romero announced new patches that implement support for Intel Haswell 64-bit vertex attributes. Since then, we’ve been monitoring the Padoka and Oibaf PPAs, and only today, January 14, 2017, are these patches available in both of them for the Intel i965 open-source graphics drivers, along with the latest Mesa 17.0.0-devel series, of course.

It will go on sale on 25 January. The workstation is being marked as the first “mini workstation designed for CAD users”. Regardless of your inclination to using CAD, the workstation is quite powerful. You get a choice of CPUs, ranging from an Intel i3 6100 to an i7 6700 and Xeon E3-1245 v5. You get 32GB of RAM at 2133MHz, a 500GB or 1TB HDD or, for performance, various configurations of 256GB PCIe-based SSD modules. For graphics, you can either stick with Intel’s integrated graphics option (HD Graphics 530 or HD Graphics PS30) or you can opt for a discrete chip in the form of the Nvidia Quadro M620. You get one spare M.2 slot, 2 USB 3.0 ports on the side, and on the back, two USB 3.0 ports and 2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type C ports. Depending on your configuration, you’ll get either a 135W or 200W power supply unit. The dimensions and weight of this workstation is what makes it special. The base model tips the scale at a mere 2.04 kg, which is less than that of many workstation laptops. It’s also small enough (2.3 inches tall) to be mounted behind your monitor via a VESA bracket. The workstation will come pre-loaded with Windows 10 Pro or Linux. HP claims that the workstation starts at Rs 72,000 and if the base model does indeed come with an Intel i3 6100 CPU, the price is on the higher side.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 16 January 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Startup pays real people to answer questions to build better AI The more data, the better: A file photo of a humanoid robot operating a switchboard during a demonstration by a German research centre for artificial intelligence at CeBit in Hanover. Mighty AI obtains specific information for companies interested in building smarter AI software. — Reuters To set up effective artificial intelligence software, a company needs a lot of data. But what happens if you don't have that kind of specific information about your area?  A Seattle-based startup, Mighty AI (formerly known as Spare5) will get it for you by paying subject-matter experts to spend a few minutes answering questions or performing tasks. Some examples include finding golf aficionados for IBM, people who can describe a photo for Getty Images, and radiologists or technicians to read tumour scans.   The company, which renamed itself to reflect a focus on AI training tasks, is adding three new investors as part of a US$14mil (RM62.46mil) funding round: Intel Capital, Google Ventures and Accenture Ventures. It's unveiling partnerships with Intel and Accenture, too.  Spare5 was spun out of Seattle-based VC Madrona Venture's labs in 2014, a mobile rival to Amazon's Mechanical Turk program, which finds workers for tasks online. Around the same time, Getty, reached out to get help categorising images in its collection.  Like Getty, customers increasingly wanted Fives – the people that take on the “microtasks” – to perform brief activities that train AI algorithms. So Spare5 refocused and renamed itself around that idea.  “There's an arms race in training data” for AI, said chief executive officer Matt Bencke.  IBM, with its focus on Watson AI products, wanted to create a chat bot for spectators at the 2016 Masters golf tournament it sponsors. Using tablets on site or their own mobile phones, golf fans would be able to ask the bot questions or banter with it. The only problem? IBM couldn't find enough annotated golf-related training data.   So IBM sent Mighty AI a large body of information culled from the web that it thought was related to golf. Mighty AI found workers familiar with golf, had them tag information specific to the sport and compose questions and answers based on the material. That data became the basis of IBM's Watson golf conversational agent.   Accenture and Intel see Mighty AI as a way to help their customers deploy artificial intelligence apps and algorithms more quickly, letting them use Accenture services to set them up and Intel software and chips to run them.   “What we like about Mighty AI is that for a lot of our customers the first step is annotating data – they need that before they can build on top of our chips and software for AI,” said Ken Elefant, Intel Capital managing director for software and security. “With Mighty AI all of this annotation will happen at a much faster rate which will help Intel customers deploy much more quickly.”  Some companies handle the problem by trying to label data themselves, and others use general crowdsourcing software like Mechanical Turk or CrowdFlower, Bencke said.   Mighty AI has more than 100,000 specialists in 155 countries and it rates how they handle tasks. If the person does well, he or she gets paid more and gets offered more jobs. A poor job will generate feedback and eventually lead to termination if the person doesn't improve.  Mighty AI dubs its product “Training Data as a Service,” a riff on cloud product categories like “Infrastructure as a Service” and “Software as a Service.”   Previous investors Madrona Venture Group, Foundry Group and New Enterprise Associates also participated in this funding round. — Bloomberg You May Be Interested Data centre growth drives Intel's fourth-quarter revenue, profit beat Alibaba's Ant Financial in overseas push with MoneyGram deal Amazon woos parents with educational toy scheme Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Go purple this CNY if you want to get lucky in love Six simple steps to feng shui your home Others Also Read Arrogate wins $12 million World Cup Invitational Hearing aid maker seeks feedback via national hearing survey Dishes that symbolise good luck and prosperity advertisement Latest News China turns to blockchain to make markets clearer and cleaner Coming soon: Robot DoorDash deliveries PayPal outlook muted on mobile competition, currency trends Alphabet posts strong revenue growth, higher taxes hit earnings Russian security service says hackers attacked major banks in 2016 Most Viewed in Tech China turns to blockchain to make markets clearer and cleaner Coming soon: Robot DoorDash deliveries Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

As part of its Fox Sports Lab tech initiative, the company is planning to give viewers point-of-view perspectives from players on the field during Super Bowl LI in February. No, it doesn’t involve strapping GoPros to players’ helmets (they wouldn’t last five minutes), or even fitting tiny cameras inside. Instead, Fox has teamed up with Intel to create what it calls a “Be the Player” experience, a feature that displays POV footage from any player on the field without the need to attach a physical camera. If that sounds pretty darn clever, that’s because it is. The system involves Intel’s 360 Replay technology, which uses a raft of cameras placed around the stadium, all facing the action. The gathered data allows the director to zoom into any part of the field for a player POV replay, giving the audience a clear perspective on exactly what they were seeing at any stage of the contest. “We tasked Intel to push their amazing Intel 360 Replay technology to the limit of what it could do, using their array of cameras circling the stadium to synthesize a player’s view on the field,” Michael Davies, Fox Sports SVP of Field and Technical Operations, said in a release. “The cameras, backed up by a huge bank of Intel computing power, allow a moment to be recreated in 3D space, so that a ‘virtual camera’ can be placed at the player’s eye line – not unlike how limitless camera views can be created in video games.” Davies said the remarkable footage “literally brings the audience down to the viewpoint of the player at the critical decision-making moment. What other choices did he have? Was his sight blocked? It all looks much different from field level, and can assist our announcers in describing what actually happened on the field.” Check out the video above for a preview of what to expect during the big game at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on February 5. More: Here’s why feel-good ads dominate the Super Bowl In other efforts to jazz up its content, Fox Sports Lab recently partnered with virtual reality firm LiveLike to offer viewers a VR experience during December’s Major League Soccer Cup. Offered via Fox Sports VR app, it marked the first time for the league’s championship game to be offered in VR. The Lab also recently partnered with GoPro to fit referees with point-of-view cameras for the College Football Playoffs. “It’s in our Fox Sports DNA to constantly challenge our team to come up with new and interesting ways to enhance the viewing experience, bring fans closer to the action, and make the story of sports even more compelling,” Davies said at the time.

They had also hinted about some updates to the ZBOX lineup, with some details about the ZBOX CI549 nano, a vPro-enabled passively cooled UCFF (ultra-compact form factor) PC with Thunderbolt 3 support. However, at their suite, we found that many of their existing ZBOX models will be getting a Kaby Lake update. Since Kaby Lake is a minor update in terms of features to Skylake, the Zotac really doesn't have much to work with compared to the Skylake models. Despite that, Zotac has introduced some new features into the ZBOX series - including vPro and Thunderbolt 3 support - that are not present in the Skylake versions. Gallery: Zotac @ CES 2017 - Suite Visit - mini-PC Segment Zotac markets their mini-PCs in multiple market segments - the E-series for gaming, the C-series for users interested in passively cooled systems, the M-series for certain PCs with active cooling in multiple form factors, the VR-series for virtual reality use-cases, the P-series for pocket-sized computers, and so on. The Kaby Lake updates are coming to the C-series, M-series, and E-series. While the C-series units come with the nano tag (with a 5in x 5in x 1.78in form-factor), the M-series come in either the regular ZBOX size (7.4in x 7.4in x 1.78in) or the nano size. The three tables below summarize the specifications of the Kaby Lake mini-PCs announced by Zotac at CES 2017.

From the perspective of a home consumer, the most important update when compared with the Skylake-U C Series models is the availability of a Thunderbolt 3 port. Thunderbolt 3 brings a host of exciting expansion possibilities. In addition, Zotac seems to have retained the two USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C from the ASMedia ASM1142 controller. The other important aspect of the ZBOX CI549 nano and the MI549 nano is that the Core i5-7300U is a vPro SKU, making it more suitable for use in business environments. Intel's UNITE technology is also supported for secure workplace conferencing. AMT is also available for IT administrators to remotely repair and maintain the systems. The vPro designation makes it necessary for one of the two LAN ports to be an Intel-branded one. The other mini-PCs being updated with Kaby Lake in the above table all use two Realtek adapters.

Using a desktop PCH allows Zotac to include Thunderbolt 3 as well as a rich set of I/Os compared to the others launched at CES. Gallery: Zotac ZBOX MI526 Gallery: Zotac ZBOX MI548 Gallery: Zotac ZBOX MI572 In the E-series, Zotac has only one updated SKU - the EN1070K, a Kaby Lake version of the EN1070. We would have liked them to move the MAGNUS EN1080 to Kaby Lake, given the pin compatibility between Skylake and Kaby Lake, and the fact that the PCH used for the Skylake board could work with Kaby Lake too.

It is great to see dual LAN ports spread to more models, though we would prefer Intel adapters to the Realtek ones that are currently in the units. Zotac must also be appreciated for adding the LSPCon to the BOM to enable HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 capabilities. The Thunderbolt 3 feature, as well as the vPro capabilities, will definitely expand the target market for these systems. That said, some of the shortcomings such as the thermal design of the C-series (which is the same as that of the Skylake C-series) and the placement of the USB ports in the chassis (that we pointed out in our review of the Zotac ZBOX CI523 nano) don't seem to have been addressed. Hopefully, Zotac can tweak a few things before the final market release.

Reply lordmocha - Monday, January 16, 2017 - link For the "EN1070K" you have "2x DP 1.3 (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz)" which is also what Zotac has on the specification sheet. But isn't DisplayPort 1.3 4k@120hz? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#1.3) Reply lordmocha - Monday, January 16, 2017 - link DisplayPort 1.3 also supports dual 4k@60hz using MST, so maybe this is what Zotac is doing? Reply jabbadap - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Well that old magnus en was the same barebone for gtx1060,gtx1070 and RX480. Barebone for gtx1080 was different and watercooled. I would expect to see EN1060k and maybe ERX480k version of it. But what I find interesting zbox MAGNUS ERX480 has vanished on their site. So is it canned? Marketing page is still there: https://www.zotac.com/us/page/magnus-erx480 But it is missing on the e series lists, where it were https://www.zotac.com/product/mini_pcs/zbox-e-seri... And old spec link just redirect to zotac members login. https://www.zotac.com/us/product/mini_pcs/magnus-e... Reply tai - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link What material is it? Reply Old_Fogie_Late_Bloomer - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link So, it looks like the Realtek Ethernet ports are not a great choice for Linux, but the Intel WiFi is? Wonder how much that MI572 is gonna turn out costing. Reply jabbadap - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link Realtek is like a hit and miss, it might work out-of-the box or not. Most common problem for it that kernel is loading wrong driver. For intel you need firmware, which should be included on your distribution. But again it should work out-of-the box with generic drivers, but for full speed that restricted firmware will be needed. Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 is supported from kernel 4.6 and up. http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/net... Reply Old_Fogie_Late_Bloomer - Thursday, January 19, 2017 - link Thanks for the clarification. I'm currently in an environment where I'm using Wi-Fi, but I would prefer to retain the option of using a wired connection. Then again, I don't want to go with the one with the Intel NIC on account of deeply distrusting vPro/IME. :/ Reply 1 PIPELINE STORIES + Submit News MSI Upgrades Its Aegis and Nightblade PCs with Intel’s Kaby Lake CPUs SK Hynix Lays Out Plans for 2017: 10nm-Class DRAM, 72-Layer 3D NAND NVIDIA Releases Android 7.0 Update for 2015 SHIELD TV, Adds Amazon Video App QNAP at CES 2017 - Thunderbolt 3 and Xeon D NAS Units, Residential Gateways, and More Toshiba Announces Plan to Sell Minority Stake In NAND Flash Production Business Microsoft Announces Q2 FY 2017 Results Intel Announces Record Quarterly Revenue And Full-Year Revenue For Q4'2016 AOC Announces the AGON AG352UCG 21:9 Curved Display: 35", 3440×1440, 100Hz with G-Sync MSI Trident 3 Announced: A Core i7 Console BenQ PD2710QC Announced: 27" 2560x1440 with Integrated USB Type-C Dock HP Recalls Over 100,000 Laptop Batteries Due to Potential Fire and Burn Hazards Pioneer Announces Ultra HD Blu-ray Supporting BDR-S11J Drives TWEETS RyanSmithAT: @MTG_lichking It's a work in progress IanCutress: @BrettHowse @skiboysteve I have a set of good Sennheisers.

Robot cars are now learning to drive by playing Grand Theft Auto Software allows AI developers to use GTA V as a simulator for self-driving cars Game gives them a realistic and diverse world for testing and developing AI Platform is another method of teaching road scenarios to machines, including the use of Google Street View By Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline Published: 07:12 EST, 16 January 2017 | Updated: 07:28 EST, 16 January 2017 e-mail 69 shares 14 View comments With its reckless and violent driving scenarios, you may not imagine playing Grand Theft Auto would be an ideal way to teach anyone or anything to drive in the real-world. But the popular game is being used to train computers capable of controlling self-driving cars of the future to navigate streets. GTA V is said to give researchers access to a realistic and diverse world for testing and developing artificial intelligence, without putting vehicles on real roads. Scroll down for video  With its reckless and violent driving scenarios, you may not imagine playing Grand Theft Auto would be an ideal way to teach anyone or anything to drive in the real-world. But the popular game is being used to train computers capable of controlling self-driving cars of the future Video games are the latest of a number of tools being used to test computers that could one day control cars on our roads. Recently, researchers from Princeton University developed software able to gather useful information about the physical properties of roads from Google Street View and OpenStreetMap, enabling a computer to learn where the edges of junctions should be, MIT Technology Review reported.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Look out, Uber!

Would you live in a 3-MILE-high smog-eating skyscraper?... Share this article Share 69 shares Such technology is of interest to companies designing autonomous vehicles because creating 3D maps of street environments is time consuming and expensive, according to automated driving expert John Leonard, a professor at MIT’s CSAIL. Various companies, including Intel have also modified Grand Theft Auto to test AI for driverless cars. However, this is the first one to be released to the larger research community A FASTER PROCESS  A separate research team made up of scientist from Darmstadt University and Intel has explored how Grand Theft Auto can help teach autonomous cars how to drive.  The team discovered that machine learning can extract maneuver and landscape data much faster in these virtual settings than with traditional methods. Using computer vision algorithms, tehy labeled thousands of images in just a few hours, which will be used to teach autonomous cars to recognise different objects.  Cars use object identification data to ‘learn’ how to recognize objects, such as pedestrians or cyclists. Gathering this information is usually conducted by researchers, who comb through scenes from real life footage and draw borders around objects by hand. This process can take 60 minutes per image for the CamVid datasets and 90 minutes per image for the Cityscapes datasets, according to the team at Intel Labs and Darmstadt University. However, a virtual world like Grand Theft Auto allows computers to step in and complete the labeling in just seconds.   ‘If this process can be automated using deep networks that operate on large public databases, this would be a big win for self-driving technology.’ Craig Quiter, an engineer at self-driving truck company Otto also believes learning from Street View is a good idea and came up with a method to use video games to prepare computers intended for self-driving cars for real-world scenarios. Together with researchers at OpenAI, he developed a way to use Grand Theft Auto V’s detailed road layouts as a training ground, using software called Universe. He described Universe as ‘a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites and other applications,’ in a blog post.  The open source software works with his DeepDrive project – a platform that allows developers to create self-driving car AI using memory inspection techniques to repurpose the video game into a self-driving car simulator. Quiter says DeepDrive can be set up in 20 minutes on various operating systems and works best using a joystick rather than keyboard and mouse. With this set-up GTA V can ‘train software to recognise elements of the real world,’ Because developers only need buy a copy of the video game and download the Universe agent to get started, it’s not only computer scientists working for top companies such as Google or Uber – that are said to be developing self-driving vehicles – who can start driving a virtual car around a detailed virtual world. ‘GTA V gives researchers access to a rich, diverse world for testing and developing AI,’ Quiter wrote. ‘Its island setting is almost one-fifth the size of Los Angeles, giving access to a broad range of scenarios to test systems. ‘Add to that the 257 different vehicles, seven types of bicycles, and 14 weather types, and it’s possible to explore a huge number of permutations using a single simulator.’ However, while the software may be giving more developers access to the tools with which to develop AI for the auto industry, its prowess has not yet been tested with a physical self-driving car.  Various companies, including Intel have also modified Grand Theft Auto to test AI for driverless cars. However, this is the first one to be released to the larger research community.   Recently, researchers from Princeton University developed software able to gather useful information about the physical properties of roads from Google Street View and OpenStreetMap, enabling a computer to learn where the edges of junctions should be   Read more: Robot Cars Can Learn to Drive without Leaving the Garage GTA V + Universe Share or comment on this article e-mail 69 shares Most watched News videos Serena Williams awkwardly neglects her fiancé after Aus Open win Many Clouds dies after beating Thistlecrack in the Cotswold Chase 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Incredible moment truck crashes through middle of bus Grandma accused of killing son-in-law celebrated during testimony Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border George and Laura Bush welcome the Obamas to the White House 2009 Harriet was rescued from a South Korean meat farm Look what the cat dragged 'OUT'!

Intel's Mesa Driver Set To Flip On OpenGL 4.5 For Haswell Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 16 January 2017 at 06:19 AM EST. 19 Comments It was just two weeks ago that Intel's Mesa driver finally crossed the threshold with Haswell for supporting OpenGL 4.0 and then last week OpenGL 4.2 was crossed for this older generation of Intel graphics hardware. Now, it looks like OpenGL 4.5 will be enabled for Haswell with the i965 Mesa driver. With a rather small patch sent out at the end of last week by Intel's Kenneth Graunke, Haswell is ready to see OpenGL 4.5 exposed with this open-source graphics driver. Ken commented, "Everything is in place and the test results look solid." The patch has already seen some reviews. Given it's rather trivial and Mesa 17.0 hasn't yet been branched, we'll hopefully be seeing OpenGL 4.5 for Haswell with Mesa 17.0 -- a nice upgrade after it was stuck with OpenGL 3.3 for years. Broadwell and newer has already supported OpenGL 4.5 since Mesa 13.0. 19 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Home National Security Politics Issues Culture Columns Washington Free Beacon National Security Politics Issues Culture Columns Store One Hundred Guns in Eight Hours EPA Employees Given ‘Dealing with Change’ Counseling Post-Trump Win Heinlein’s Children Bob Woodward Agrees With Trump About ‘Garbage’ Allegations From Intel Community Share Tweet Email BY: Cameron Cawthorne Follow @@Cam_Cawthorne January 15, 2017 11:19 am The Washington Post‘s Bob Woodward defended Donald Trump on Fox News Sunday against the”garbage” allegations waged against the president-elect on his relationship with Russia. “That [BuzzFeed dossier] was a garbage document. It never should have been presented as part of an intelligence briefing,” Woodward said. “As you suggested, other channels have the White House counsel give it to Trump’s incoming White House counsel.” Fox News host Chris Wallace asked Woodward his opinion of how the intelligence community handled the so-called Russian dossier against Trump. Woodward said Trump’s point of view on the issue is often underreported and then scolded the CIA for its criticism of the president-elect. “When those former CIA people said these things about Trump that he was a recruited agent of the Russians,” Woodward said. “A useful fool,” Wallace interjected. “A useful fool. They started this. In Trump’s mind, he knows the old adage, ‘Once a CIA man, always a CIA man.’ And no one came out and said those people shouldn’t be saying things,” Woodward said. Woodward said he has been in the journalism world for 45 years and that journalists receive information where people make allegations. Woodward said that Trump has the right to be upset with the allegations. “Those intelligence chiefs were the best we’ve had were terrific and had done great work. [They] made a mistake here, and when people make mistake, they should apologize,” Woodward said. Trump addressed the reports at his press conference on Wednesday morning, calling them “disgraceful.” “As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they are going to suffer the consequences. They already are,” Trump said.

Credit: Intel More like this Crate and Barrel works to balance online and offline sales New Relic aims to be your dashboard of the future Nasuni CEO: ‘We’re going to liberate you from the bottleneck around your files’ Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Shopping can be fun but also harrowing, especially in electronics or shoe stores. You can't find help or can't figure out if a specific product is in stock. In the future, the shopping experience should be much better thanks to technology. The store will recognize you, dig into your shopping habits, and guide you in the right direction. If your favorite product is in the store, retailers will make sure you know through messaging. That Minority Report-type technology is still many years away but will be possible with the magic of sensors, cameras, and data analytics. But some retailers have an early start: Some furniture stores are already using virtual reality so buyers can preview how furniture will look in a room. Poking into your shopping habits and recognizing your face may sound too invasive, but retailers are trying to make the shopping experience better. It starts with products like Intel's Responsive Retail Platform, which can track store inventory and respond to customer needs in real time. RRP, announced on Monday, includes hardware and software that could take control of inventory and pass on real-time alerts to sales associates and customers in the store about what's in stock. For example, if you're shopping for jeans, RRP could tell you if a particular size is available so you don't have to shuffle through a stack. Or if you are trying on jeans, you could request a size to be delivered to the fitting room. RRP includes a range of sensors and a mini desktop-like gateway box with an Intel x86 chip. The sensors, for example, can read RFID tags for real-time inventory checks, with the gateway providing the computing muscle. A large store may need a number of RRP boxes sitting on walls to keep a track of many products in real time. Also packaged with RRP are cloud services for analytics. Levi Strauss will use RRP to read tags to monitor inventory and issue an alert if jeans are left in dressing rooms or if shelves need to be restocked. The system will also map in-store traffic so the company can analyze what products are selling. The technology will be one piece of an effort to improve logistics at Levi Strauss stores. The new system is potentially the start of a way for Levi Strauss to make shopping a lot easier at their stores. On entering the store, repeat buyers could be instantly redirected to their jeans of choice, and they may be able to try on jeans through a virtual reality headset. There are many internet-of-things technologies being used to improve logistics at stores. Revel Systems provides technologies for collection and analysis of real-time store or restaurant intelligence at iPad point-of-sale systems. The Revel technology also helps in registering orders and billing. For restaurants, analytics helps figure out key operational details like how much food to buy on a given day. Home appliance store Pirch is experimenting with numerous technology to improve the buying experience in its large stores. Salespeople at its Manhattan store carry Surface tablets for inventory, billing, and helping customers find the best product. The store is also looking at virtual reality to help customers visualize rooms and kitchens with specific products. Intel is establishing a fund of $100 million for retail technology development. Intel will invest in companies developing compelling technologies for use in stores. The company established a similar $100 million fund for the development of automotive technologies. The fund and RRP were announced at the National Retail Federation show being held in New York, where Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is expected to give a speech. Intel will also have pop-up environments demonstrating cool shopping experiences based on its technologies.

Dean, VT Editor, … and Tasnim News Agency, Tehran Americans have no perspective of what it is like to be an ancient people, despite our DNA roots [ Note: VT gets most of its mainstream media coverage overseas primarily from organizations that have followed our work on subjects of interest to them. We do the same when cross-posting NEO material. And there are some that don’t, like Syria, where we do not have any kind of a media partnership, due to the war situation which has their government organizations on full focus there, with a big pipeline of current news coming at them all the time. Iran is slowly building up and diversifying its English news coverage to challenge the monopoly of platforms like the BBC and Voice of American, which are partially or fully under the influence of their respecting Intel communities. Such is the world we live in, and we cannot wish it away. We usually break the ice with them via written interviews, which we are normally happy to do, as they are published in Farsi also, which gives our material the ability to reach into the non-English speaking Iranian community, something we could not do on our own, due to our non-existent translation department. So we build these relationships one brick at a time, on overlapping interest areas during a trust-building stage. Sometimes that effort flatlines, and sometimes it evolves into being able to do Skype radio and video, and even brainstorming as to the current state of the crazy world we live in. We are always learning through new relationships, and we try to be as accessible as our time allows, which is limited. But Tasmin picked out a topic that I had written about, which they wanted to delve into more, so here that is… JD ] ____________ Pasargade, Iran – Capitol of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great, built during 559-530 BC, a UNESCO world heritage site Europe Facing Abject Security Failure: US Analyst – First published … January 12, 2017 – TEHRAN (Tasnim) – A senior political expert based in the US city of Atlanta warned against a “mind-boggling” security situation in European countries and said their governments have lost their battle against terrorism. European governments have lost battle against terrorism on several fronts, politically, by immigration policy, and an abject security failure, Managing Editor of Veterans Today Jim W. Dean said in an interview with the Tasnim News Agency. ____________ Following is the full text of the interview: Tasnim: British Security Minister Ben Wallace recently said Daesh (ISIL or ISIS) terrorists have aspirations to launch mass-casualty chemical attacks on targets in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. In fact, European authorities fear that as the terror group was driven out of its strongholds in the Middle East such as the Iraqi city of Mosul, their nationals fighting for the group would return home and pose a growing domestic threat. It seems that Europe is going to face an influx of Takfiri militants as a continent battered by a string of terror attacks. What would Europe do in order to contain this threat? Do not you think Europeans are somehow paying the cost of their moves to follow US’s lead in the Middle East region? Persepolis, Iran Dean: Europe has no security against terrorism. They have lost that battle on several fronts, politically, by immigration policy, and an abject security failure. But that I mean the various security forces do not have the manpower to track all the suspects they have because they have allowed way too many into their respective countries to recruit and set up cells. And we have this mind-boggling situation where, despite all the mass surveillance we all live under now, in Britain they are using public cameras to fine people for not picking up dog poop, while militants seem to have no problem traveling around Europe on their own passports. It’s almost like this door has been left open on purpose, by some power wanting to profit somehow from the resulting fear and chaos from growing terror attacks. Fortunately, a large number of suicide bombers have been killed in Syria and Iraq, who will not be returning home. But they can be replaced in time and can attack soft targets almost anywhere they want. Why has there been no legislation making membership in a terrorist organization a serious felony and open travel impossible for them? Why has no one at the UN demanded that state sponsors of terrorism lose their membership in the body? As long as those really behind this scourge have sovereign immunity, we will never see an end to it I am afraid. Tasnim: Thousands of Europeans are thought to have traveled to Syria, many to join Daesh, since the outbreak of the foreign-backed war in that country. It sounds that chickens are coming home to roost. What do you think? Dean: Not only will they be going home, but they will be filled with anger and hate. Does anyone think they will be content with a low-paying job or on public assistance? Once they have lived by the gun as they have, and abused their religion as a tool to cover their horrible crimes, they are beyond reform. Every one of them is a major threat if allowed to walk around freely, and any country that allows them to would be in effect aiding them in their future attacks. Tasnim: Reports suggest that certain European states have been supporting terrorist groups in the Middle East. Do you believe that they will finally reconsider their position on Syria and the rest of the region? Dean: They will not reconsider until they are fully exposed so their voting public can deal with it. This is a two headed problem, as even European opposition parties are lax to publicly charge their own government with aiding and abetting state proxy terrorism, not wanting to be tagged as “unpatriotic”. No Western democracies anywhere see anyone running for office with the issue of ending state-sponsored terrorism as an agenda. All we see happening for now is some changes to the disastrous open door immigration policy that was primarily driven by Angela Merkel. Tasnim: It is no secret to anyone that the election of Donald Trump as next US president gave a big shock to the entire Europe. How would US-Europe ties change under Trump? Will Europe try to turn to other powers as a replacement for US? Shiraz, Iran Dean: As Trump is such a showman and a narcissist, it remains to be seen if he can project a presidential image versus that of a “reality TV” host. He has already picked up the nickname of “President Twitter”, not out of any rudeness or spite, but because he likes to “play” on the world stage using Twitter, acting like a teenager with his numerous off-the-cuff remarks. Trump is unpredictable at this point, and by design…embodying a kind of psychological war on everybody, allies and adversaries alike, except for Israel, for which he has appointed himself as an American ex-official president with Netanyahu. Europe has no replacement powers for America. It has a long list of domestic problems, due to its governing body, the EU Council, having lost faith with the EU people, who have effectively been disenfranchised with the extra levels of bureaucracy between the voters and the decision makers. Many are now suspecting that this may have been by design. Trump threw the EU a big curve ball with his threatened NATO changes and demands that Europe carry the full cost of its defense. The key to all this will be exposing the hoax of the Russian threat to Europe, which followed the destruction of the Iran nuclear weapons threat hoax. No one, including Israel, who had claimed for years that Iran had a secret program put one shred of evidence on the table to kill the successful conclusion of the P5+1 talks; and that huge fraud was completely ignored by corporate media afterward.

Nothing of this exists in this country at all. We are the prototype of a complete brainwashed country, loving our enemies and hating ourselves. This is sad to state but it’s true. People love to be open for anyone brown, black or even white – if it only is “Not German”. If this is not Orwellian in the real sense, I don’t get it. I know there will be a war coming to the Europeans and I feel why, I really feel it coming. This state of affair is not sustainiable, no one speeks about it but everyone feels it deep down. I have no hope at all about your new president, because my personal humint and the absolute irreal (or grotesc) situation in Germany tells me that the smallest “Incident” at the Polish border can lead to a European catastrophy. I learned from Mr. Trump that Europe is not that important (if they don’t make fair deals, of course), so I wait for things to come for me, my family and my country. I aready know that it will be devastating. Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  January 16, 2017 at 5:55 pm I am sad to hear this Detlef as the German people have so many fine qualities. But it is the same with the Americans. The shrinks and the super computers have figured out that we can be led around like the Pied Piper’s children, just by playing the right tune. And now we have Mr. Trump, with no musical talent, thinking he can do it with lyrics alone. Detlef Reimers  January 16, 2017 at 3:44 pm Jim, let me tell you this: There is no threat at all of any crazy muslim, doing anitihng that migh hurt the people or – which would be much worse, of course – the government of this slowly but definitely dying country. Your government’s brainwashing of our whole contry over the last 70 years has been so effective and complete, that I have to confess: you won, we loose! There is no hope, people here hate their own country (which was one of the main aims of our enemies right from the beginning in the great 20th century game against Germans), the Preussians and all of this. No real history is teached, only zionist and western clap trap. The people are so perfectly and totally brainwashed over the years, they hate everyone who only tries to bring some new (which mostly comes from foreign historians) ideas about the sad situation. Congratualation to Edward Bernay, he’s done his job really well. We are dumb as dumb can be. Merkel will shurely win the next election, no doubt at all about this. My comment from a dying nation. Log in to Reply Andrew_Bukanov(Russia)  January 17, 2017 at 8:30 am Detlef Reimers – really sorry to hear that from You. It’s a pity. But you must do something. Merkel wouldn’t be the desirable candidate. I don’t know who will keep her up to win? Russian hackers maybe. Frankly – most Germans in the streets look like calm zombies, not paying attention on what happens in their country. We hear sometimes your Sahra Wagenknecht and Noam Homski from the “Voice of Germany” they are the only alternative info from Germany we know. Andrew_Bukanov(Russia)  January 16, 2017 at 2:08 pm Trump’s declaration about NATO has already made EU crazy :))))) I should mention, that Trump had such opinion since 1980s. It is pragmatic attitude to the question of a businessman. When it was Eastern military block of USSR, and the threat was actual – NATO was actual , too. But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO lost its orientation. it became huge military machine with no compass. No ideas, no aggressor to counterpart. What to do next? The newly proclaimed next NATO’s goals: terrorism fighting, anti-drugs fighting, Iran….. Iran’s problem was no so evident. Tell me – how to explain the army brigade generals, lieutenants, sergeants, admirals – what they must do to fight terrorism? HOW? All they could do is written in the military books of strategy and tactics since ww2. Thus West got a great bureaucratic war machine, too expensive and too great to do smth. Log in to Reply Andrew_Bukanov(Russia)  January 16, 2017 at 2:08 pm EU as i mentioned a week ago – has no military power at all. But it was comfortable for them – Uncle Sam pays for everything! All you need is to roar like a wounded whale – “Russians go”! The louder – the more profitable. As for NATO wars – the main forces were American. Libya was actually “democratized” by USA alone. Now Trump says: why do we need NATO? And he is right. It doesn’t mean that project NATO will be shut. It is not needed. It should be, but restructured. EU doesn’t have money to make EU Army. France, Germany, England – they can afford to have own armies. Another countries can’t. Maybe also European countries would protest the Germanization of Europe, remembering Hitler. Andrew_Bukanov(Russia)  January 16, 2017 at 2:09 pm Anyway, the doctrine to separate Germany and Russia as the most powerful union is in action if to see how many weapons arrived in Poland and Baltic. And Merkel was a piece of that plan.Poland is the most suitable buffer zone for separation. So, very interesting process start in EU. We sit and drink orange juice or glintweine and watch, in Russia 🙂 Will EU pay and use, or start dog-fighting for its virtual independence. JL  January 17, 2017 at 3:14 pm No Andrew, European Countries will protest against sovjetization of Europe, remembering Lenin. The big difference between Hitler and Lenin is not that Lenins mummy is still avaible, but Hitler got finance from Detroi businessmen and Lenin got finance from Wall Street bankers. Grampah  January 16, 2017 at 11:19 am “Yes, VT is working to build a bridge between East and West, to combat those sowing the seeds of destruction for both of us” But you will make the field tougher for the fiction producers, “their business model”. Blame xxxx one week, xxx2, the following week. Display indecent hubris with a policy such as “switch to Asia”, as if that was not a “swing the artillery (aka lies from a comic book) signal. 24/7 promote, confirm blatant false hoods, actually myths about 20th century events and wars. “Thy mist have a list of “rogue states” to use in your overall plan.” Rigidly control all media and academia to keep polishing up stale, obvious lies, fake names, fake everything.

The inputs related to the planning of the terror outfits were received by the intelligence agencies that have been keeping a tight vigil on the movements of these outfits. According to highly-placed sources in the Intel agencies, specific inputs have been received that these outfits including Hizbul Mujahideen (HuM), Lashkar-e-Tayiba (LeT), Indian Mujahideen (IM), Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) are hatching a plot to launch a terror attack in various parts of the country at one-time.  Inspired by the terror strikes of ISIS, the banned terror outfits in India are plotting 'Nice-style' lone-wolf attack to sabotage the Republic Day celebrations (pictured - terror attack in Nice) Another input reveals that the militants may try and target the Parliament, too.  'Heavy vehicles could be used deliberately to be driven into crowds to kill maximum number of people like Nice (France) attack,' one of the inputs reveals. The security forces have been informed and instructed to keep a tight vigil on movements of heavy vehicles. Also, the forces have been planning to prohibit the entry of the heavy vehicles for at least a day or two, sources said.  Recently, after the NIA busted an ISIS module that had planned a Nice-style attack in Kerala, it was learnt that as many as 30 radicalised men were actively recruiting terror sympathisers from across the country using Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  Meanwhile, senior officials said after demonetisation, terror fundings along with hawala transaction have remained as major hit. Paramilitary soldiers take position as they cordon off the area near the government building, Jammu and Kashmir 'They have activated the sleeper cells and sympathisers. The outfits are now using the parked money (new currency including Rs 100 notes) across the border and for the sleeper cells,' sources added. 'Apart from LeT, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) also suffered heavy casualties in the surgical strikes the Indian Army carried out across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. 'It may take a leaf out of the Islamic State playbook to inspire what may look like lone-wolf attacks in major Indian cities during Republic Day celebration,' sources further added.

We identified close to 250 smart wearables, being developed by over 150 companies, across different segments of the industry. The current landscape is dominated by activity / fitness trackers; in fact, wrist wearables, made available by leading players on several B2C platforms, are widely used. 2. Of late, the focus has broadened; the companies have intensified their efforts towards development of more complex applications in monitoring critical parameters such as ECG, EEG, EMG, blood pressure, blood glucose monitoring, aiding in timely and accurate diagnosis. Such wearables represent ~40% of the products we identified. In addition, the trend has also shifted towards smart wearables that provide therapeutic benefit. These wearables currently have applications in pain / stress / anxiety management. 3. The overall market is highly fragmented across the different segments highlighted above. Despite the presence of new players, several well-known non-healthcare stakeholders such as (indicative list, in no specific order) Apple, Adidas, Asus, Acer, Huawei, Intel, LG, Microsoft, Nike, Philips, Samsung, Sony and Xiaomi have strengthened their position on the market, specifically in activity / fitness tracking. The other two segments namely monitoring & diagnostics and wearables for therapy have also attracted several start-ups and SMEs that have developed innovative technologies. Examples of stakeholders in these segments include (indicative list, in no specific order) Atheer, Brain State Technologies, Chrono Therapeutics, dorsaVi, Empatica, Force Impact Technologies, G-Tech Medical, Hexoskin, Hocoma, iSono Health, Lumo Bodytech, Numera, Orpyx and Proteus Digital Health. These companies are expected to foster significant technological advancements in the near future. 4. With more and more people becoming aware about smart wearables, trends on social media platforms have demonstrated the growing popularity. In fact, we were able to capture over 80,000 mentions of relevant keywords on different social media platforms in the last five years. The activity has increased dramatically over the last 2-3 years. The same behaviour was observed on Google Trends. 5. Venture capitalists have strongly backed the innovation. We identified over 180 instances of funding across 70 companies over the last few years. The total amount invested has been close to USD 3.1 billion; of this, USD 2.1 billion came during the last three years alone. This clearly depicts the high interest of venture capital firms and other strategic investors in this area. 6. During the same time, several agreements were inked amongst the stakeholders. We captured over 120 partnerships across product development / integration, distribution / marketing agreement, supply agreements, mergers / acquisitions and others. Over 90 collaborations were signed in the last 3-4 years with product development / integration accounting for 44% of the total agreements. It is fair to state that such collaborations are one of the key enablers that are expected to drive new products in the market over the coming years. We expect the overall market for smart wearables within the healthcare industry to grow at an annualized rate of 13.6% over the coming 15 years. Relatively higher growth is expected for novel wearables under monitoring & diagnostics and therapy segments. As the market evolves, North America and Europe will continue to be the biggest contributors. These regions are likely to drive the market in the mid to long term before a wider adoption is seen in the emerging markets of India and China (likely to happen as price declines over time).

Peter Bright - Jan 16, 2017 10:30 pm UTC reader comments 328 Share this story Windows 7's extended support ends on January 14, 2020. The operating system left mainstream support in 2014, meaning that for the last two years—and next three—it only receives security fixes. But Microsoft is telling corporate customers that even with those security updates, the 2009 operating system isn't really cut out for the world of today. According to Redmond, enterprises should plan to move to Windows 10 sooner, rather than later. The reason, according to Markus Nitschke, head of Windows at Microsoft Germany, is that Windows 7 "does not meet the requirements of modern systems, nor the security requirements of IT departments." There are two elements to this. Companies buying new hardware using Intel's Skylake or Kaby Lake processors have little choice but to use Windows 10. Installation and driver support for Windows 7 and 8.1 is limited to certain systems since changes in the Skylake platform, such as the integrated USB 3 controllers and processor-controlled power management, aren't supported in Windows 7. PC OEMs can still make the older operating system work, but it requires extra effort on their part. AMD's new Ryzen processors and Windows machines built using the Qualcomm 835 processor will similarly need Windows 10. With so many companies holding onto their PCs for so long, that may not be a big reason to drop the older operating system. This is where security comes in. Windows 10 includes a wide range of security improvements that aren't found in Windows 7: stronger built-in biometrics with Windows Hello, cloud-based threat analytics with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, built-in sandboxing with AppContainer (used for Store apps, the Edge browser, and certain aspects of font-handling), virtualization-based security to protect against certain kinds of credential theft, and much more. The value of these improvements is not that they address individual security flaws, rather they make whole classes of flaw harder to exploit, protecting the operating system against both known and unknown threats. Microsoft argues that it is these systemic, architectural protections that mean corporations should adopt Windows 10 over Windows 7. This was demonstrated in a write-up of two zero-day exploits published by Microsoft last week. The Strontium group (aka "Fancy Bear," aka "APT28") is believed to be involved in the hacks of the Democratic National Committee, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and others. They're believed also to be tied to Russian intelligence. In a spear-phishing campaign conducted in October, the group used then unknown vulnerabilities—one in Windows' windowing subsystem, one in Windows' font management, and one in Adobe Flash—to attack think tanks and non-governmental organizations in the US. The two Windows flaws that were targeted, however, wouldn't be exploitable in Windows 10 with the Anniversary Update. Windows 10 includes additional validation of internal structures, and it performs certain aspects of font handling in an unprivileged, sandboxed process. The result is that even though Windows 10 had the same underlying bugs, its defense in depth made those bugs harder or impossible to successfully exploit. This kind of protection isn't going to be retrofitted to Windows 7; organizations that want the best available protection against both known and unknown flaws will have to upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft has, of course, made this same pitch to corporations before. Windows 7 may be looking long in the tooth today, but it represented a substantial improvement, especially with regard to security, over Windows XP. Windows 8.1 introduced further structural security improvements. In spite of this, many companies stuck with Windows XP for years past its prime. Often, compatibility with legacy browsers or legacy applications made migrating to newer versions of Windows expensive. Nitschke says, "As we saw with Windows XP, companies should take early steps [to move to Windows 10] to avoid future risks or costs" from being trapped on the older operating system. The longer organizations wait, the argument goes, the more institutional knowledge and expertise about those problematic applications leaves the company, and the harder it becomes to upgrade them to work on the new operating system. Migrating away from Windows 7 should be less problematic than dropping Windows XP was, because Windows 7 applications are less ill-behaved than many Windows XP ones were. Still, Microsoft is clearly keen that customers heed the lessons learned from that migration and not leave upgrades until the last minute. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Within weeks of the election, Trump had already claimed a victory. Through a mix of inducements and intimidation, he prevailed on the heating and cooling firm Carrier to keep some of its operations in Indiana, “saving” around 1,000 US jobs. Touring the Carrier plant subsequently, he warned other US firms that he would impose stiff tariffs on them if they moved plants overseas and shipped products back home. His Twitter account has produced a stream of commentary in the same vein. He has taken credit for Ford’s decision keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky rather than move it to Mexico. He has threatened General Motors with import tariffs if it continues to import Chevrolet Cruzes from Mexico instead of making them in the US. Trump has also hounded defense contractors for cost overruns, berating aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin on separate occasions for producing planes that are too expensive. His policy style represents a sharp break from that of his predecessors. It is highly personalized and temperamental. It relies on threats and bullying. It is prone to boasting, exaggeration, and lies about actual successes. It is a type of public spectacle staged on Twitter. And it is deeply corrosive of democratic norms. Economists tend to advocate an arm’s-length relationship between government and business. Public officials are supposed to insulate themselves from private firms, lest they should be corrupted and engage in favoritism. This is a prized principle in the US, but one that is more often breached than observed. An obvious example is the undeniable influence over US government policy exercised by finance moguls during the last three decades. Yet close business-government interactions also lie behind many of America’s successes. The history of US economic development is one of pragmatic partnerships and collaboration between the public and private sectors, rather than arm’s-length relationships and rigid rules. As historically minded economists and policy analysts such as Michael Lind, Stephen Cohen and Brad DeLong have reminded us, the US is heir to a Hamiltonian tradition in which the federal government provides investment, infrastructure, finance and other support that private enterprise needs. US technological innovation owes as much to specific government programs, such as loan assistance or government purchases, as it does to American entrepreneurs’ and inventors’ ingenuity. As Harvard Business School Professor Josh Lerner notes, some of the most dynamic technology companies in the US, including Apple and Intel, received financial support from the government before going public. Electric carmaker Tesla was a beneficiary of the same public loan guarantee program as Solyndra, the solar cell company that went bust in 2011 in a spectacular public collapse. As the Solyndra example illustrates, many public initiatives fail. However, the ultimate test is whether the social return on the portfolio as a whole is positive, taking successes together with the flops. Such broad evaluations tend to be rare, but one analysis found that US programs to boost energy efficiency had produced positive net benefits. Interestingly, the bulk of the benefits were attributable to three relatively modest projects. Sociologists Fred Block and Matthew Keller have provided perhaps the best analysis of the US “developmental state,” a reality they say the reigning market-fundamentalist ideology has obscured. Block and Keller describe how a “decentralized network of publicly funded laboratories” and an “alphabet soup” of financing initiatives, such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, work with private firms and help them commercialize their products. They and their colleagues have documented the extensive role of both federal and state governments in supporting the collaborative networks on which innovation rests, whether in biotech, green technologies or nanotech. Such industrial policies, based on close collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors, have been the hallmark of East Asian economic policymaking. It is difficult to imagine China’s transformation into a manufacturing powerhouse — and the attendant success of its export-oriented model — without the Chinese government’s helping and guiding hand. It is ironic that the same people who extol Chinese gains from globalization are often alarmed that a US administration may copy the Chinese approach and explicitly endorse industrial policies. Unlike China, the US purports to be a democracy. And industrial policy in a democracy requires transparency, accountability and institutionalization. The relationship between the government and private firms has to be calibrated carefully. Government agencies need to be close enough to private enterprises to elicit the requisite information about technological and market realities on the ground. For example, what are the fundamental reasons for the loss of manufacturing jobs in, say, automobile production, and how can the government help, if at all? However, they cannot get so close to private firms that they end up in companies’ pockets, or at the other extreme, simply order them around. That is where industrial policy à la Trump fails to pass the test. On one hand, his appointments to key economic positions indicate he has little intention of severing government ties to Wall Street and big finance. On the other hand, his policymaking-by-tweet suggests he does not have much interest in building the institutionalized dialogue, with all the required safeguards, that sound industrial policy requires. This means we can expect the Trump administration’s industrial policy to vacillate between cronyism and bullying. That may benefit some, but it will do little good for the overwhelming majority of American workers or the economy as a whole. • Dani Rodrik is professor of international political economy at Harvard University’s John F.

Image: hp australia By HP Australia2017-01-16 20:00:00 UTC It’s people that make your business operational, and it’s people who will make your business succeed or fail. However, the resources you provide for those people—even if you’re the only person in the business—will directly affect how much they’re able to get done, how efficiently they’re able to do it, and how organised they remain into the future.  To put it simply, if you want your business to run smoothly into the new year, you’ll need to make sure it’s got the right equipment to make that happen. That’s why you need these absolute office essentials—even if you’re just working from the dining room table most days.   A high-quality printer  Even if you’re trying to reduce your paper usage, you’re going to need a printer and/or copier at some point—but not just any printer will do. You’ll want something that’s easy to use, compatible with all your devices, and capable of printing high-quality images that will make an impression to your clients. The HP Office Jet Pro is one of the best printers on the market, and will help you print better-looking documents more efficiently—and is incredibly reliable, even when printing remotely via your mobile device.   High-tech primary devices It may be tempting to go with a less expensive primary device for you and your workers; you may opt for a mid-range laptop, try to find a deal on a used tablet, or go with last year’s model of smartphone. In the short term, this may save you some money, but remember—technology develops quickly, and there’s a reason the newer devices are more expensive. As Intel points out, upgrading your devices can give you a massive boost in productivity—not to mention making you and your employees happier—so go with newer, more advanced devices when you can, and upgrade if you’re stuck with older inventory.  Reliable internet Next up, you’ll need reliable internet. With practically every business action—from sending email to storing documents—happening over the web, you would be crippled if your Internet unexpectedly gave out or suffered from low speeds. Do your research and go with a provider with a track record for consistent success, and invest in a router that’s going to provide sufficient and stable coverage throughout your home or office. If you’re not sure how to buy a router, this guide is highly informative.   Filing cabinets and label-makers  Filing cabinets may seem like they belong in offices from decades ago, but they can still help you store, protect, and organise your documents. Keeping your office organised will make everything else run smoother—especially if you end up facing an audit or some other mechanism that forces you to produce documentation. Label makers, like the P-Touch 1290, are also good to have on hand.   A paper shredder  Though there are a wide variety of paper shredders available on the market, you don’t need the cutting-edge technology here. The more complex and fine the shredding is, the more secure it will be, but even a basic paper shredder can help you protect your business from fraud. You should be shredding any and all documents that contain any information about your business you wouldn’t want someone to know.   Desk supplies  Perhaps because they’re so basic, they’re often forgotten, but you should have basic desk supplies on hand. Even if you don’t regularly take notes, having pens and paper available will come in handy the day you realise you need them. The same goes for sticky notes, paperclips, binder clips, binders, folders, and other common materials you’ll eventually need.   Apps and software   Finally, you’ll need to choose the best apps and software to keep your business running smoothly, whether it’s accounting software like QuickBooks, CRM platforms like SalesForce, or a project management platform like Producteev or the HP All-in-One Printer Remote app. The user experience, usability, learnability, and general performance of apps like these can have a major impact on your overall performance as a business—so do your research and choose your options carefully (and don’t be afraid to switch if one isn’t working out).   With the right investments in these areas, you (and your entire workforce) will be better able to plan, manage, and execute your work. You’ll be faster, more efficient, and more capable than ever before, which means you’ll be able to attain higher profitability and deal with less stress than ever before. Make these items a priority for your new year in the office if you don’t already have them, and make sure you invest in the right equipment in each area.   Topics: Business, hp officejet pro, office supplies, printers, Small Business About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

the online world to physical stores News provided by BT Jan 16, 2017, 08:29 ET Share this article DALLAS, January 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- BT today announced that leading shirtmaker and luxury clothing retailer Thomas Pink has deployed the Acuitas Digital Internet of Things (IoT) platform, which helps retailers to digitize the physical store, at its Wall Street New York City store. Thomas Pink installed the pilot Acuitas Digital IoT digital store solution as part of its digital strategy. It will enable the retailer to track in real time the movement of merchandise and people around the store, use big data analytics to predict shopper behavior and provide a foundation for real-time interactive in-store experiences. This will help the retailer personalize customer service, optimize store layout, improve employee workflows, reduce cost and grow sales. Launched in January 2016, the Acuitas Digital Alliance brings together like-minded technology innovators determined to bring the full benefits of the new digital era across the entire retail supply chain. Its members are BT, Intel, RetailNext, NexGen Packaging, SATO Global Solutions and Valmarc Corporation. Acuitas Digital's solution uses IoT multi-sensors to automatically scan the whole store in real-time to improve efficiency and unlock new interactive in-store experiences.  The IoT powered Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors provide real-time inventory visibility and movement tracking of merchandise throughout the store, increasing efficiency and delivering near 100 per cent stock accuracy. This new IoT approach to digitizing the store overcomes the limitations of legacy handheld RFID systems that rely on manual weekly or daily store scanning.  Manual scanning can be error prone, time consuming and of limited value to retailers looking to deliver in-store interactive customer experiences or for real-time analytics. The IoT powered video sensors within the Acuitas Digital solution will allow Thomas Pink to understand the behavior of customers in the store.  They will provide insight and intelligence on what customers are buying, who goes where in the store, merchandising effectiveness and how the stores are performing. Alex Field, marketing director, Thomas Pink, said: "The Acuitas Digital solution will give us the insight to ensure that we have the right products, in the right place at the right time, all of the time. This is fundamental to delighting our customers and delivering great new digital experiences to the store. "We will now be able to use big data analytics to improve store efficiency and performance to help our people to spend more time with customers rather than getting tied up in admin tasks.  We're incredibly excited about how it will transform the store for our people and customers.  It will bring our digital store strategy to life and will show how it can become a real driver of growth." The Acuitas Digital solution is offered world-wide by BT.  It brings together best-of-breed components powered by the Intel® Responsive Retail Sensor, in-store analytics by RetailNext, software by SATO Global Solutions and RFID tags by NexGen.  This is underpinned by global BT's Cloud of Clouds and networking capability and international support. Bas Burger, BT's president for the Americas, said: "There are many solutions on the market designed to help retailers predict customer behavior and improve experiences for shoppers. However, these solutions do not easily integrate with each other, and that lack of integration translates into data silos and limited usefulness. "BT is working with Thomas Pink to maximize the business benefits of our Acuitas Digital solution, bringing together the power of IoT sensors, software and analytics to give a single comprehensive view of store operations and customer behavior.  This will help to grow sales, boost productivity and deliver a greater experience for customers." The Acuitas Digital solution will help Thomas Pink and its customers in a number for ways. For example, if a customer picks up a men's shirt, carries it elsewhere in the store and then abandons it for another product, the next person who's looking for that shirt may not be able to find it.  A sales assistant will then get tied up searching for the item, while the new customer waits.  With the Acuitas Digital Alliance solution, the Thomas Pink sales assistant will know exactly where to find the item, saving time, removing frustration and giving the customer a better shopping experience. Moreover, if a garment sold happens to be the last one of its style and size in the store, the real-time nature of the Acuitas Digital solution will allow for a replenishment order to be made instantly and automatically by sending an alert notifying a sales assistant, rather than waiting until the end of the day for a stock check. When combined with digital signage, the solution could also prompt a customer buying a shirt to consider a matching tie or cufflinks, improving service and helping grow sales.  Fitting rooms will be transformed.  New Smart Fitting rooms will improve customer experience and increase sales conversion. Mike Beedles, chair of the Acuitas Digital Alliance, said: "Today's customers have higher expectations of the retail experience than ever before.  Digital solutions are key to helping retailers meet this challenge and seize the opportunities new shopping behaviors offer.  We're delighted to be working with Thomas Pink as it develops its digital store strategy and look forward to our mutual success."

About Thomas Pink Thomas Pink was founded in London in 1984 by the Mullen brothers, whose founding inspiration was the history of Mr. Pink, the 18th century tailor credited as the originator of 'hunting pink' - referring to the scarlet jackets of hunt staff. The Mullen brothers appreciated the fundamental quirk of British humour that something so obviously red could be referred to as Pink. This quirk so appealed to them that they saw it as a tension right at the heart of the brand they were founding - namely a men's brand called PINK - an obviously feminine colour. Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired the brand in 1999. From business and casual shirting to evening and Made To Order shirting, PINK shirts are made using traditional, time-honoured methods with exclusive fabrics from world-renowned mills. Detail is everything – the collars are hand turned and are composed of up to 14 individual pieces. Pink shirts are available in Classic, Slim and Super Slim Fit and in addition, the brand also offers tailoring, separates, knitwear and accessories. Celebrated for innovative design, Thomas Pink made its name with the renowned original Classic Fit shirt. The style is a modern take on the classic Jermyn Street cut and is generously designed for style and comfort. It features a long tail that stays tucked, as well as signature PINK gussets. Since then, Thomas Pink has launched a number of pioneering shirting solutions – including the Athletic Fit and the Independent collar. 2015 saw the Jermyn Street shirtmaker extended its popular 'Personally Pink' Made To Order service. An extensive choice of more than 160 fabrics span long staple Egyptian cottons, Sea Island cottons, linens. and fine cotton poplins in two-fold 100s, 120s, 170s, 200s and 300s. The service also encompasses options for evening and special occasions. The shirts are made in the United Kingdom and delivered back to clients within three weeks. Final details include a choice of buttons as well as monogramming and engraved collar bones. The 'Personally Pink' Made To Order Service is available at Thomas Pink's London flagship store on Jermyn Street as well as in Heathrow T2, Sloane Street, Blomfield Street, Canary Wharf and Selfridges. A very patriotic brand, Thomas Pink has proudly dressed The British & Irish Lions rugby team, designed an exclusive Team GB Collection for Rio, and ferried many an international guest around central London in its iconic union jack clad pink Morgan. Today, Thomas Pink is a modern British shirtmaker with over 100 stores worldwide and flagships in London's Jermyn Street, Madison Avenue, New York and Rue Francois Premier, Paris.

This year’s edition, Super Bowl LI, will be broadcasted on FOX. FOX Sports has announced that they will be utilizing an array of interesting camera technology for the big game, including field-of-vision perspective. Teaming up with Intel, FOX Sports Lab will use what they call “Be the Player,” which is a camera angle that shows a “POV perspective from any player on the field without ever having a physical camera attached to the player.” This works by utilizing the many cameras that are stationed around the stadium and creating a “virtual camera” at the eye line of a specific player. As FOX Sports points out, it’s not unlike the camera freedom you would have when playing a video game. Similarly, there is a lot of computing power behind the “Be the Player” camera, which you can see used in a college football game earlier this season below. FOX Sports isn’t only utilizing the POV camera technology, but it is also going to use more Super Motion and 4K cameras than they have ever used for a broadcast before. The game itself will be covered by more than 70 cameras, requiring the use of three production trucks. Of their coverage, FOX Sports SVP Graphic Technology and Innovation says, “We, as broadcasters, are always trying to provide the viewer with something they’ve never seen before. With this new ‘Be the Player’ technology, it is now achievable and we are incredibly excited to debut this at the Super Bowl on FOX.” Super Bowl LI isn’t the first time FOX has leveraged distinct camera equipment and technology to cover sporting events. In 2016, they used aerial production drones at the U.S. Open Championship and delivered virtual reality broadcasts of over a dozen sporting events, including a Premier Boxing Champions bout, Bundesliga soccer match and the Daytona 500, among others. The broadcast company was also the first to offer POV camera angles from GoPro cameras strapped to the hats of on-field referees during the Big Ten Championship football game in November. As camera technology continues to develop, sports viewers will certainly benefit. We don’t know which teams will be facing off in Super Bowl LI, although we will see four teams fall out of contention for the opportunity this weekend, but we do know that we will see the game in a very distinct way come February 5.

A tipping point could be its licensing deal with Fujitsu, which the BCC Research report, "Is NRAM Creating Market Volatility?" mentions. Nantero did not sponsor the BCC report. The trend-report-pusher suggests NRAM revenues could be $75m in 2018, $120m in 2019 and $850m in 2023, a 62.5 per cent CAGR. We've covered the technology in a little detail in the Fujitsu licensing article and explain there how its basis is the movement of the ends of carbon nanotubes to connect or break current-carrying connections and so provide binary ones or zeros. So far, NRAM has been positioned as a potential candidate resident of the DRAM-NAND gap, being faster than NAND, up to DRAM in speed, and with virtually unlimited endurance. So it is competing with Intel/Micron's XPoint, PCM, STT-RAM, and other candidate tech. But the report makes it clear that NRAM can be faster than DRAM, as well as using less power, which would lead to longer battery life in mobile devices. Unlike DRAM, it does not need refresh power sent through it to maintain its state. The report notes: NRAM read and write consumes lower energy in comparison to flash or DRAM. Due to which NRAM is expected to have much longer battery life. In addition, it is expected to be much faster to write than flash and DRAM. However its speed is gated by the interface used, DDR4 currently, and associated protocols. Since NRAM is non-volatile, it does not need, as the report emphasis, the "refresh" part of the DDR4 interface. How fast is carbon nanotube memory? Ann Jacoby, client solutions director at BCC Research, tells us: "[The] media (ie, carbon) has an intrinsic response time down to picoseconds. One needs to have an interface just as fast in order to take advantage of that speed. The first wave of products will use the standard DDR4 interface – so that's the DRAM speed. Some early application engineers are working to optimize NRAM for the specific tasks on their wish lists. These will be faster than DRAM." A picosecond, a trillionth of a second, is 1/1,000th of a nanosecond. If we say DRAM access latency is in the order of 14ns then that would mean 14,000ps. To describe NRAM as having picosecond speed needs it to be lower than 1000ps. We haven't seen actual numbers and so cautiously assume that we are looking at speeds of 800ps – 999ps. It could be much lower, but we need to see numbers. The report goes on to say NRAM can be made in logic factories as well as at mass-production semi-conductor fabs, and that, therefore, NRAM dies could be customised, unlike DRAM. It means NRAM customers, such as mobile phone manufacturers, could order NRAM chips designed specifically for their phones. A downside is capacity. The report quotes Mark Webb from MKW Ventures Consulting as saying: "Initial reported plans for 2018 are [a] 256 Mbit range of density, which is significantly lower than we expect from RRAM and 3D Xpoint in 2018. As such, it would appear to be competing in the NOR, FRAM, MRAM, embedded memory space for the next few years. RRAM, NAND, Xpoint will fight it out for the 128 Gbit and higher market." Productisation with this kind of tech is a long, long and rocky road. The BCC Research report suggests that NRAM could be about to make it, even though the initial market destination is going to be a niche. The market researchers want $2,650 for a single user licence for the report. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 3 Comments More from The Register Someone just chucked another $21 million at carbon nanotube memory techies Nantero’s NRAM crowd's tech has already been licensed 10 Comments Deep inside Nantero's non-volatile carbon nanotube RAM tech Biz has signed up Fujitsu as a licensee for its technology 36 Comments Big Blue welds bits of carbon for nanotube transistor Bonding beats Ώ-ophobia 8 Comments Carbon nanotube memory tech gets great big cash dollop Forget NAND, this here carbon tube stuff is the future, baby 19 Comments Fujitsu seeks PC exit, finds willing buyer in Lenovo But can they fund the deal? 13 Comments Strike day struck off as Fujitsu and Unite negotiate job cuts It's good to talk... with Acas Whitepapers Accelerated Computing and the Democratization of Supercomputing This whitepaper provides an analysis on how accelerators like the NVIDIA Tesla P100 can lower data center cost by up to 50%.

When Cars Fly Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent 1/16/2017 00:22 AM EST  4 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet "HD Mapping" and "Connectivity" (V2V, V2I) are both viewed as indispensable predictive tools for highly automated driving. In the context of highly automated driving, describing HD mapping simply as “mapping” is misleading. Today, HD mapping is considered must-have data for highly automated driving. It can provide information just as critical as other sensory data generated by vision, lidar and radar. HD Mapping (Source: Here) Liran Bar, CEVA’s director of production marketing, had his finger on it. Asked why mapping is such a big deal, he said, “It’s all about prediction.” HD mapping enables you “to predict before lidars and radars detect that a road is blocked ahead, for example,” he explained. It’s a hugely important element in the advancement of the robo-car. “HD Mapping” and “Connectivity” (V2V, V2I) are both viewed as indispensable tools for “prediction.” But much of their implementations needs a buy-in from everyone in the automotive industry, and a consensus to build common infrastructure. We’ve witnessed some progress. But I don’t think we’ve gone far enough. In this column, let me zoom in on the HD mapping issue. At the CES last week, Here, owned by a consortium of German automotive companies including Audi, BMW and Daimler, garnered numerous partnership deals. Aside from Intel’s announcement to buy a 15-percent stake in Here, Here and Nvidia also announced at CES an extended collaboration to develop Here HD Live Map into a real-time, high-definition mapping solution for autonomous vehicles. Mobileye also disclosed that it is now working with Here to provide Mobileye’s own crowd-sourced, high-definition mapping technology called Road Experience Management (REM). Phil Magney, founder and principal advisor for Vision Systems Intelligence (VSI), explained, “Here brings value by providing the location platform and the infrastructure to support it. Mobileye brings a crowd source of data that collectively will pool with Here data to create a localization platform.” REM is a technology unique to Mobileye. As Mobileye describes it, REM is “is an end-to-end mapping and localization engine for full autonomy.” The solution consists of three layers: harvesting agents (any camera-equipped vehicle), map aggregating server (cloud), and map-consuming agents (autonomous vehicle). The harvesting agents collect and transmit data about the driving path’s geometry and stationary landmarks. Mobileye’s real-time geometrical and semantic analysis, implemented in the harvesting agent, allows it to compress map-relevant information – facilitating very small communication bandwidth (less than 10KB/km on average). Crowd sourced Roadbook (Source: Mobileye) Under this scheme, the relevant data is packed into small capsules called Road Segment Data (RSD) and sent to the cloud. The cloud server aggregates and reconciles the continuous stream of RSDs – a process resulting in a highly accurate and low time-to-reflect-reality map, which Mobileye calls “Roadbook.” Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder, CTO and chairman, sees Roadbook as a layer above what Here offers. He stressed, for Mobileye, “Mapmakers are not competitors.” Aside from Here, Mobileye announced a partnership with Japanese mapmaker Zenrin and an OEM to complete HD-Mapping of Japan. “By October, 2018, we get this done,” Shashua promised. The ultimate goal for Mobileye is to develop “World Roadbook” in collaboration with a variety of OEMs. HD mapping isn’t the only thing that needs to be shared among car OEMs, however.

It should be up to the car company that writes/maintains the software to insure it can only operate autonomously in areas where it is legal to do so. In areas where the legal status isn't known for sure, the vehicle should refuse to operate autonomously. Perhaps it might include some method to override that in an emergency (i.e. you are injured and need to get to a hospital) but only in cases where the owner overrides the vehicle's restrictions should the owner be liable. Making the owner criminally liable for what an autonomous vehicle does is the fastest way to insure they never take off. That would be like putting you in jail because you bought some consumer product that unbeknownst to you leaked RF on restricted bands.

A vehicle that may be quite capable of driving itself might find its owner fined, or even jailed if it excercizes that capability without the consent and regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction. Not only will industry standards be necessary, but will have to be approved by government agencies. It would make sense for at least part of the infrastructure to be publically built and operations publically funded. It seems to me that crowdsourcing road data might have advantages, but disadvantages too. Stationary cameras and other roadside sensors could be more robust. In either case though, the robustness and timeliness would be of the utmost importance. These vehicles could be totally autonomous, not requiring a local infrastructure separate from the vehicles themselves. It would take making these vehicles part of a mesh network. Of course, here (no capital H), would definitely require industry standards.

Years of major efforts to bring together many parties, from past efforts of the AdaptIVe consortium, ERTICO-ITS Europe, Vehicle and Road Automation (VRA) Group, SENSORIS Innovation Platform, Navigation Data Standard (NDS) Association, Open Autodrive Consortia, ADASIS Forum, up to the present efforts from entities such as OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, or Dynamic Map Development Co. (SIP-adus in Japan) or HERE or TomTom, would provide evidence that any outsider not directly involved in these discussions and negotiations simply cannot project any reasonable assessment of the depth, details or timing of such monolithic agreements. Observing that even as we speak the telecommunications industry, the cloud providers, the big data analytics leadership, and other supporting providers are signing contracts for committing substantial resources to the infrastructure required to faciltate this monolithic model, even before the final announcement is consummated, supports an analysis that needs much elaboration and underpinning. An announcement of a master data sharing plan for mapping could easily be presented to the marketplace tomorrow, and this article is then essentially void of any real analysis or accuracy, or merits.   I am miffed why those who reside in California seem to be touted as the leading experts in the Auto Industry.

Market watchers shared long-term forecasts for mid-single-digit growth, with this year performing above average. Ballooning design costs and geopolitical wild cards stood out as two of the biggest risks ahead in talks at the event famous for providing a view that spans macroeconomics to nanotechnology. Scotten Jones, president of IC Knowledge, gave perhaps the most upbeat assessment of the technical roadmap. His talk also provided a kind of decoder ring to decrypt the smoke and mirrors surrounding today’s process nodes. “I don’t believe [that] Moore’s law is dead, and the deep techs don’t believe it either,” he said, noting that both Intel and GlobalFoundries now report cost savings in post-14-nm nodes. “I think [that] we have a path that produces transistors that scale down in cost,” he said. He predicted that a 5-nm node could hit starting in late 2019 using EUV in at least some steps, probably still using some form of FinFETs as transistors. Beyond that, a 3.5-nm generation moving to horizontal nanowires could mark the last node for classical scaling. Nevertheless, a 2.5-nm generation stacking n- and p-nanowires could deliver 60–70% density increases into the year 2025, he said, citing a simulation run by process-modeling specialist Coventor. In a separate talk, GlobalFoundries chief technologist Gary Patton shared his optimism. He predicted that chip makers will move to gate-all-around transistors somewhere around 2020 as device structures approach atomic limits. “There’s a view [that] Moore’s law is ending, but we always figure out how to move things forward,” Patton said. In the short-term, it's becoming a neck-and-neck race among chip makers, said Jones. In the chart below, he showed his view that TSMC recently took the lead from Samsung, which took it from Intel last year. The x86 giant will retake the lead with its 10-nm process early this year, with GlobalFoundries stealing it back with its 7-nm node in 2018, he predicted.

Reuters/Shannon Stapleton Microsoft is said to be developing a Surface Phone and also developing an upgraded version of the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Pro 5. Tech enthusiasts are divided in their opinion as to when the two highly-anticipated devices will be released. While some believe they will be unveiled in March, others think it’s April. Earlier it was reported that the Surface Pro 5 will be released in the first quarter of 2017 and since then has been subjected to a lot of speculation. According to Tech Times, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is rumoured to sport an Intel 7th Generation Kaby Lake processor. The device is expected to come out in three processor variants namely, Core M (dual core), Core i5 (dual-core with two threads), and Core i7 (quad-core with eight threads). Higher processor speeds and better battery life are two highly-anticipated boosts fans are expecting in the Surface Pro 5. A 12.5-inch 4K screen is also expected in the device that will offer 3D support at 60fps. Microsoft may also drop the Super AMOLED screens in favour of an IPS touch one. The device may run on the Windows 10 Redmond 3 version. Storage versions of 16GB and 32GB are expected. The Surface Pro 5 will likely support 512GB to 1TB storage SSD. Microsoft is also expected to severely enhance Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and camera of Surface Pro 5. A fingerprint scanner and trackpad may be incorporated into the device. It may also have an upgraded Surface Pen. The stylus could have a rechargeable battery capable of being recharged wirelessly when docked into the tablet. Microsoft may be waiting for the Kaby Lake processor to be implemented. Hence, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date may be pushed back further. The starting price of the device could be US$899 (AU$1,200).

The company informed customers on the German Microsoft press site that support for Windows 7 will end on January 14, 2020: about three years from today. This means, according to Microsoft, that devices won't receive security updates or technical support anymore if they still run Windows 7 by that time. If you are a regular here on Ghacks, or on other tech sites, you know that support will run out. You know about the Windows lifecycle, and that Windows 7 won't be supported forever by Microsoft. Microsoft waving goodbye to Windows 7 Microsoft's press release paints a grim picture, highlighting that Windows 7 is the cause for high operating costs, that Windows 7 is susceptible for malware attacks causing a reduction in work time, and the cause for an increase in support requests. In addition, manufacturers have begun to stop providing drivers for Windows 7 for hardware they release; Windows 7 won't support the newest chips by AMD, Intel or Qualcomm on top of all that. Microsoft's solution for all of this is the company's newest operating system Windows 10. It states that it was never easier to switch from an older version of Windows to Windows 10. Windows 10 furthermore would offer better and exclusive security features and non-security features such as biometric authentication or the personal assistant Cortana. My Take Microsoft gets some of the facts right. Windows 7 support will run out in 2020, there is no doubt about that. It is also okay to inform customers about the end of support for a much used operating system, even three years in advance. Home users may not have any issues changing an operating system from one week to the next, but companies may need months or even years in advanced to prepare for that. But the press release is not entirely fair when it comes to Windows 7. I cannot really confirm for instance that companies have stopped distributing drivers for Windows 7 with their hardware components. While that may be the case for a small selection of components, it seems highly unlikely that companies would stop producing drivers for the most used operating system out there at this point in time. If there is one company that did that, it is Microsoft itself as company executives made the decision not to long ago to support newer chips by AMD or Intel only on Windows 10 and not on older versions of the Windows operating system. That decision was made deliberately by Microsoft. Windows 10 offers better out of the box security than Windows 7, but it should be clear that security can always be better, and that third-party software, and making good use of common sense, may improve it significantly. Closing Words It is clear that the time that Windows 7 has left is running out. Three years is a long time however, and the prospect of migrating to an operating system that gets new feature upgrades twice a year may not be to the liking of companies who prefer as little change as possible when it comes to operating systems. Sure, there is the long term servicing branch of the Enterprise edition of Windows 10, but it is reserved to the Enterprise edition. Small businesses, and medium sized businesses who use Pro versions of Windows 10 face the tough challenge of having to upgrade their devices to these new feature upgrade versions of Windows 10 regularly. There is also the privacy issue. Microsoft promises to improve privacy options with the release of the Creators Update, out April 2017. The company burned lots of bridges however, not only because of increased telemetry collecting in Windows 10, but also because of the aggressive pushing of the free Windows 10 upgrade to customer systems. Now You: Windows 7, Windows 10, or another operating system? What will your devices run?

Load archived copies with Wayback Machine for Chrome Responses to Windows 7: Microsoft waves an early goodbye Tom Hawack January 15, 2017 at 9:28 am # Wait and see, that's how I consider the Windows 10 option. Because Win10 is no more than an option as far as I"m concerned. No hurry. The OS was delivered 18 months ago. How will it evolve within the next 3 years I have no idea. If it ever gets to run smoothly and if its privacy issues appear to be seriously taken into consideration by Microsoft then I'll start viewing the upgrade as a possibility. The end of win7' life-cycle in perspective is not a problem when it comes to Windows Updates since I've stopped all updates last October 2016. But should the PC start coughing or appear to no longer support latest drivers and software (I'd be surprised on the short-medium term, I rather believe the market is on a slow-down demand) then I'd advance the switch to a new OS. That will be either Linux either Win10. I dislike to close doors (and Windows!) in a definitive manner but, as I perceive Win10 eighteen months after its launch I don't believe Cortana is likely to hear me sing "O Sole Mio" !! Reply Mikhoul January 16, 2017 at 10:08 pm # After Win 7 for me it will be Win 8.1 and Linux after or at same time than Win 8.1 Reply Bob Hill January 15, 2017 at 9:41 am # I am very happy with Windows 7 SP1. I dislike Windows 10 for all the usual reasons. So I have bought an official Microsoft Windows 8.1 DVD, which I will install in late 2019 (shortly before Windows 7 SP1 support ends). For me, Windows 8.1 is a lesser evil than Windows 10, and it will keep me going for another three years, until 2023.01.10. After that, who knows what might be available? What hardware will I have then? Of the offerings available now (six years before the fact!), I would tend towards a rolling-release Linux distribution, such as Arch Linux (which I already keep installed and maintained for occasional use), or OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Reply Pants January 15, 2017 at 10:04 am # One of the other aspects to take into consideration, is what will MS push to Windows 7 and 8.1 in that time period. & is quite different, but AFAIK, a lot of 8 architecture is the same, and Windows 10 features (especially those that allow MS monetisation/knowledge/leverage) will roll down .. you know .. in bundled updates you can't opt out of. Whatever direction 10 takes, expect 8 to incur a lot of the crap as well. Reply HopTzop January 16, 2017 at 8:40 am # At least on 7 I'll have the option to choose if I install those updates or not. www January 17, 2017 at 11:28 am # On 8.1 you still have a choice as well. Just turn off automatic updates and use WSUS or go to various websites like http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/ and do it manually. Dave January 15, 2017 at 12:24 pm # I have a Windows 8 DVD ready to install too. I might do it sooner rather than later though, as 8.1 has some decent improvements over 7. This article doesn't tell the full story though. I'm sure MS will release updates for Windows 7 Embedded (or whatever it's called) than can be installed on regular Windows 7 by tweaking a registry key and then using a tool like WSUS. I might even seek out a retail copy of Windows 8.1 Embedded just in case. Reply T J January 15, 2017 at 12:44 pm # This is a typical MS ploy which is designed to sow Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt ( FUD ) in the minds of Win 7 users. Why ? Because Win 10 installs have flat lined and Senior staff at MS are panicking. Like Tom Hawack, I have not installed Win 7 "security" or recommended / optional updates since July 2016. Amazingly, despite doom laden warnings from MS about the OS becoming unstable and vulnerable to hack attacks, with good quality AV and anti-malware software installed Win 7 is still running virus and malware free. Mind you, I have wrapped my Laptop in tin foil and I do wear a tin foil hat when I'm using it !! :)) Reply lehnerus2000 January 16, 2017 at 3:16 am # They said the same things about XP. I'm still waiting for "XP Armageddon" to arrive (it's been > 2 years now). Dilandu January 16, 2017 at 1:03 pm # On the other hand, people don't know when their computer has been compromised and is now part of a botnet. (OS agnostic sentence) Dave January 16, 2017 at 11:29 pm # This is a brilliant comment. Why July 2016 though? Donna January 15, 2017 at 9:50 am # I'm not sure I like Windows 10 at all, but 3 years is a huge period of time in terms of technologies. So it may evolve in something unpredictably great. But for now it eats my battery way faster than Windows 7 did. Reply Fena January 15, 2017 at 10:19 am # As many of us do not allow updates we are ok til the software developers give up on win7 then I believe many will move to a version of Linux or possibly something new that may arrive out of the blue as android did. Remember the OS called Warp. It was a good try & fun for a while. Another idea as the virtual machines are getting better perhaps we can always have win7 or similar run as a virtual tfn. They brought out many simulators that run all the old games & operating systems. About 25 years ago I was doing voice-overs for TV commercials. We had video, animation, music, sound & it all fit on a floppy disc. It was an Amiga. Remember ? Reply Lincoln January 15, 2017 at 10:24 am # Behold, Windows 10 is taking off and will become the world's most popular in almost no time at all. Reply Gary D January 15, 2017 at 12:55 pm # Well, that's what Nadella said in 2014, 2015 AND 2016. Oops :) Reply Tom Hawack January 15, 2017 at 1:20 pm # LOs (laughing out silently) :) Ten words and you said it all, Gary D! A real pleasure to read us all here and notice that no one is unaware of the soap opera Microsoft is directing with a few very bad actors. I take the bet here that my Windows 7 will be in great shape tomorrow and for some time. The company just doesn't know what more to invent. I wonder what the next episode will look like. Anyway, always a nice laugh, less for the scenario than for the clowns hardly managing to perform their task. - What do you in life? - Well, I work at Microsoft... - Oh... I'm so sorry, I couldn't have known. Don't worry, tomorrow is another day.... you know life is tough for many of us nowadays. Chin up! 420 January 15, 2017 at 10:51 am # windows 7 pro sp1, wsus offline security only updates, panda free and tinywall works fine for my one winbox, sure you dont get dx12 but in my mind totally worth it to not have all the drama of win 10 atleast for 3 more years then I guess linux only unless microsoft pulls a 180. Oh and you need to go through the group policy editor to turn off a few things too. Reply Anonymous January 15, 2017 at 11:43 am # "Microsoft's press release paints a grim picture" If you are a regular here on Ghacks, or on other tech sites, or everywhere all over the world, you already know how the "picture" of Windows 10 is great. "highlighting that Windows 7 is the cause for high operating costs" If you are a regular here on Ghacks, or on other tech sites, you are probably wondering how much this new disastrous "picture" is going to cost to Microsoft, to PC vendors etc. "that Windows 7 is susceptible for malware attacks causing a reduction in work time, and the cause for an increase in support requests." If you are a regular here on Ghacks, or on other tech sites, and your combat is each day to stop Microsoft to harass you, you have nothing to learn about nagware, malware, etc. Please stop calling Windows 10 an "OS", call it an "OS as a "grim" service". Reply Clairvaux January 15, 2017 at 12:12 pm # Three years is a very short period of time. Obviously people have lost some sense of perspective. When I buy something, I intend it to live for decades, that's twenty or thirty years at least. Planned obsolescence does not change this. Reply Henk van Setten January 15, 2017 at 12:39 pm # I'm gradually moving to laptops with Linux Mint, but for software compatibility reasons I still cannot do without Windows on my desktop PCs. So unless the hardware breaks down, my desktop PCs will keep running Windows 8.1 for at least the next six years. One related thought: Right now, many tech blogs are already treating Windows 7 / 8.1 like a thing of the past (that is, mainly forgetting about those systems). Microsoft might like this attitude, but if you look at real life, it's plain wrong. A minority of people is using Windows 10 today -- 7 / 8.1 users may well remain the larger group for some years to come. Considering this, user blogs (including Ghacks) should keep offering much more practical tweaking tips etc. specifically for Windows 7 and 8.1, instead of offering mainly Windows 10 usage tips like they do now. Reply T J January 15, 2017 at 1:11 pm # "A minority of people is using Windows 10 today -- 7 / 8.1 users may well remain the larger group for some years to come.

I agree with you 100 %, Henk. Reply Yuliya January 15, 2017 at 12:50 pm # Nah, I don't need their updates anymore. Since those rollups WU is disabled here and I have no problems whatsoever. Also no more daily checking, so I've also gotten rid of the annoying CPU usage that would occur every morning. Also I recently installed 7 on a new XPS15 with an i7 6700hq without any trouble. And there are also numerous people using 7 on laptops with KabyLake CPU.. So I think won't run into any trouble using 7 in the foreseeable future. Reply Pierre January 15, 2017 at 1:28 pm # when will the general public AKA the end user, tire of the constant requirement to always upgrade?. - windows-7 was a good system, so now look forward to windows-11. but, will they always "keep paying"?. Reply Gary O'Connor January 15, 2017 at 2:18 pm # When Windows 10 came out, and for months afterwards, any mention of Windows 10 on a blog would solicit complaints from hundreds of Anti-Microsoft trolls who were working tirelessly to destroy any chance of Windows 10 being successful. Lots of those were avid Apple followers but many were from the Linux hopefuls working in the vein hope that they might actually be able to create the fabled 'Year of Linux on the desktop' without having to claim Android as Linux when it is actually Java. Now, look at the response here, only about 20 of you have turned up? What has happened to all your mates? Probably off being creative on their Windows 10 machines because they've discovered that W10 is the best OS that Microsoft have produced yet and it even includes a Linux sandbox for them to play in. They have also realised that it is far better than anything that Apple or Linux have yet produced. Now donning my body armour :) Seriously though folks, I am a software developer, I sit at a desk that has a Windows 10 desktop, a Widows 7/Linux dual booting desktop and an iMac running El Capitan. I have various Android tablets and a couple of iPads as well as an iPhone 6s a Samsung S7 Edge and a Lumia 950XL and I use them all and I can tell you that I, and every one of my clients that have upgraded, believe Windows 10 IS the best OS that Microsoft has yet produced. I do agree with a couple of you here though when you say that if you're not happy with Windows 10, just hang onto W7 for the next three years and I guarantee that by then you will more than likely agree that W10 is the place to be and happily upgrade. I'd also like to thank you for all the bitching and wailing that you do because I suspect that you have caused Microsoft to work on improvements that they otherwise might not have, so thank you for that. Reply Clairvaux January 15, 2017 at 4:21 pm # "Complaints from hundreds of Anti-Microsoft trolls." You're projecting. Incidentally, the word you're looking for is users. Not trolls : users. "Lots of those were avid Apple followers but many were from the Linux hopefuls." That's absurd. This just shows you haven't been following the thousands of discussions going on. Those were, and are, Microsoft users trying to hang on their beloved Microsoft products. How does liking and using Windows 7 qualifies one as an "anti-Microsoft troll" ? Did you ever read Woody Leonhard's blog ? As for Apple users, they are busy usings their Macs, and generally quite happy with them. They don't need to troll discussions that don't relate to them, the way you do. (I don't know what an "Apple follower" is ; why don't you speak of "Microsoft followers", or of "Windows 10 followers" ?) Regarding Linux, yes there's often mentions made to it, and generally they are from old-time Microsoft users looking at reluctantly making the switch, in the wake of all the hostility and nonsense they have had to suffer from once-reliable Microsoft. Also from Linux converts or dual booters, encouraging others to transition. What's wrong with that ? What's wrong with people helping each other ? Beats your snickering anytime, in my opinion. "Hang onto W7 for the next three years and I guarantee that by then you will more than likely agree that W10 is the place to be and happily upgrade." This, again, shows you don't know what you're talking about. Nobody can "guarantee" anything about what the Microsoft landscape will be in three years. Not even Microsoft themselves. It's funny how some people can't just be content with using happily the systems and products they've chosen for themselves. They also feel an urge to berate those who don't use the same tools for different reasons. How stupid and immature can that be ? Reply Steve V.

Hardware/Software not working, update problems, restarting for no reason, WiFi disappearing, sound not working, printer problems. Don't even get me started on complaints about the new Office gui! Over the past year I've only had one customer wanting to upgrade to 10 and they still love it. No accounting for taste! M$ has adopted a hostile attitude toward its customers, that it knows what is best for you and therefor you don't need choice. They forgot about individuality. Then they dumped DRM whip cream and a SPYING cherry on top of it. This is a common theme for companies these days. I believe this to be a major mistake. Reply Corky January 15, 2017 at 5:41 pm # @Gary O'Connor, Seriously? You wrote all that simply to troll. I would normally respond to the points you've raised but what you've said is so full of logical fallacies, assumptions, and other flaws it's really not worth it. One point i will address though is how you say you're software developer and how every one of your clients believe Windows 10 IS the best OS that Microsoft has yet produced, i think that says more about you and your clients than Windows 10 TBH. Reply Tom Hawack January 15, 2017 at 6:05 pm # @Gary, I have to agree with Clairxaux's comment above. Yet maybe do I understand what you have in mind, maybe do you believe the Web carries an atmosphere of hysteria and that a few bright minds have the ability to impact the vast majority of us, including in the fact of manipulating our ideas with a series of programmed interventions in social sites, blogs ... This may be true but I believe it would concern ideas, philosophy, societal problems, religion, politics but far less the situation where an acquisition is concerned. There's money, possession and above all pleasure in the air or at the horizon. And also, this is not the situation of a dandy spreading his word on how awful the last Ferrari behaves but a context with, what? 2 billion users connected? I don't believe this is a situation which would enable a minority to influence a majority. This said, it is true that we are many to prefer strong feelings to luck-warm objectivity. But the point is that besides objectivity stands devotion as well as hatred : some people may look as if they enjoy wrecking a product"s reputation and when you meet them the day after you'll see/hear/read their most enthusiast comments on another product. So the question is ; does it make any sens to consider that those who dislike would have been manipulated and that those who like and them only would be objective? Obviously not. Everyday shows us happy users and who say why they are happy, but when such an amount, such a percentage of users (world-wide, this is not a psy laboratory with seven students) who detail their experience, for others who learn everyday from the former the amount of problems with a product... well, they remain aware but also slightly annoyed (to put it mildly) about the nerve of a company who dares threaten those, reluctant to move on to Win10. People loved XP, cried over Vista, loved (and still do!) 7 ... no one, who could? created a trend to have a planet endure problems and evoke them. This is planetary, no World Guru yet! Reply T J January 15, 2017 at 6:25 pm # @ Gary O'Connor "I am a software developer." So, how do you cope with all the problems that your "happy" Win 10 clients need you to fix with every new iteration of this flawed OS ? The latest Fast Ring release, 15007, has 23 KNOWN FAULTS !! I realize that it is for testing by Win 10 fanboys like you so that you can act as unpaid QA staff for MS and feed the fixes back to them. But, even on the Fast Ring, these known faults should have been corrected before the release. However the bosses and programmers at MS cannot be arsed. Why? Because the "useful idiots" (like you) on the Fast Ring can't wait to show what clever programmers you are. Read the rest of the comments on your stupid post and, next time, engage your brain before you engage your typing finger. Can you use more than one ? Consider yourself flamed. Reply Admin07 January 15, 2017 at 7:42 pm # It must be really painful for some users to realize that Microsoft has been collecting browsing history and search history for each user (without stripping personally identifying information) and who knows what other information. Microsoft stated that it would remove all identifying information from the telemetry and it was a blatant lie. You can log into your account Microsoft account on a Microsoft server and 'clear' the information. I have a feeling that 'clear' in Microsoft's (misinformation) language means 'hide' and not 'delete'. By the way, the current changes were due to the Swiss government intending to take legal action against Microsoft for breaching privacy and this was Microsoft's response to avoid the legal action. It had absolutely nothing to do with your idea of 'trolls' and I doubt Microsoft would have admitted taking the browser history and search history except that it was forced to do so by the Swiss government. It turns out the anti-bully, pro-privacy users were a much better judge of character than the trusting loyal Microsoft users. There is very little chance of a significant number of users moving to Windows 10 when it contains blatant spyware. It steals user's browser history and search history and who knows what else. Very few users will accept this blatant violation of their privacy and security. It's as simple as that. Windows 10 is dead as an OS for many users because of these reasons and there is zero chance that these users will ever use it. It wont matter if its 3 years or 10 years. If you want spyware, use Windows 10.... Reply Anonymous January 15, 2017 at 8:19 pm # Legal actions not only from the Swiss government... any "software developer" should inform every one of his clients that he "suspect" Windows 10 to be a spyware :) Reply DaveyK January 16, 2017 at 11:27 am # Gary, the "bitching and wailing" will stop when MS does the following: 1) Implements an "off" button for the telemetry that actually works, and is honest and open about exactly what data they do collect (shadiness breeds lack of trust). 2) Implement better controls over updates. It's my machine, and I will not accept updates being forced onto it against my control, especially when there have been a number of bad updates released by MS that have broken various things. 3) Fix the UI! It's part Windows 8, part Windows 7, part Windows XP/2000. It's an unfinished mess in places and is not coherent. 4) Apologise unreservedly for the GWX fiasco and the utter contempt that they showed their loyal customers during this mess. I do actually agree that Windows 10 is a good OS. However, it has a few major issues that greatly sour things, and they're not actually that difficult to fix either. Until then though, I'll stick with an OS that has a coherent UI, control over updates and no telemetry (ie, Windows 7). Reply Count Soxington January 18, 2017 at 9:15 am # You've triggered so many haters. Im with you. Quite like Win10. Many many Vast improvements over win7/8.1. Reply Gary D January 18, 2017 at 1:45 pm # @ Count Soxington "You've triggered so many haters". The people posting are not haters. They are users who resent the liberties which MS is attempting to take with THEIR personal data by using telemetry, phoning home etc. The attempts by MS to force auto install of Win 10 with GWX has been one of the major annoyances.That is why they have made the deliberate choice not to install Win 10 until such time as they can control and configure the OS. "Quite like Win10. Many many Vast improvements over win7/8.1" That is a very vague statement. Please post another comment in which you detail exactly what these improvements are. This is a short list of non-improvements: Deleted drivers, apps removal, uninstallable security updates, botched Fast Ring releases (15007 has 23 known problems), OS upgrade builds which hang leaving the user with unusable PCs, etc. There are many other problems which should have been fixed by now. After all, Win 10 has been available for 18 months and IMO it is still only beta quality. I look forward to your response in which you list the Win 10 improvements but I will not hold my breath waiting for it. Clairvaux January 18, 2017 at 2:31 pm # Also, what's wrong with hating ? Are all people, things and organisations lovable ? No. Good judgement comes from being discriminating enough. It's not loving everybody that counts. Nobody does. It's knowing whom to love and whom to hate. (If that word hurts you, you can replace it with intensely dislike, strongly disapprove of, rather objects to, isn't particularly fond of -- or would never buy again from. All perfectly legitimate feelings and attitudes, hate included.) Davin Peterson January 15, 2017 at 3:02 pm # Windows 7 is a beloved operation system - still the most popular used version of Windows. I like the beautiful Aero glass, which Microsoft took away in newer version of Windows. Also, it is a very stable operating system and fast. The only major problem with Windows 7 is that is very susceptible for malware attacks. At the Library, our public machines have had malware attacks. Internet Explorer 11 is the latest version of IE for it, which Microsoft is no longer updating or adding features too. This browser is a bit outdated now. While software developers are starting to drop support for Vista, they are still supporting Windows 7.

Warnings about what will happen to computers running unsupported versions of Windows are overblown, and I wonder why folks are so quick to believe it. I plan on buying another computer and another Win7 disk, so when this computer can no longer be repaired, I'll have another waiting in the wings that I can customize to my specifications.

Hopefully neon will do something about getting rid of all the white washing. However it's never been a reason why someone has asked me to revert them back to windows 7.

Reply MikeFromMarkham January 15, 2017 at 6:34 pm # Martin, I have to agree with the majority of your readers, and will be sticking with Windows 7 SP1 on my primary desktop computer until 2020. My backup desktop runs a carefully configured version of 8.1 PRO and will likely keep doing that until 2023, unless I install Linux before then. I do own two Windows 10 devices. One is an HP Stream 7 tablet that originally came with Windows 8.1, and I put 10 on it just to see if it would work. So far, nothing has broken it, which is tryly remarkable considering it cost so very little ans so many other computers have been hosed by Window 10 updates over the past year. But I really don't use if for anything, it's just there. I will likely reinstall Windows 8.1 some time this Spring, or give Ubuntu touch a try to see if I can make that work just for fun. My other Windows 10 device is a fairly new, decently spec'd laptop (I6 CPU, 8GB RAM, 1TB hard drive, high res touch screen, optical drive) I bought on sale to replace the year-old Windows 8.1 laptop I gave to my daughter when her laptop went up in smoke last fall. When I took the laptop out of the package, I updated W10 to whatever was current that day, then I disconnected it from the internet, made 2 full image backups in case I ever need to go back to W10 on that machine, and then I reconnected and installed Linux Mint 18.1 on it to use as the primary OS, and It runs as smooth as silk. I've dabbled with various Linux distros over the last 5 years, and will likely install one or two more over the next few months, but this year I hope to decide on one distro going forward, and that will eventually be my primary OS on all of my machines. I do not intend to become involved in the whole Windows-as-a-disservice circus ever again, Reply 420 January 16, 2017 at 5:15 am # I would suggest trying Manjaro, it is based on arch linux, so it is a rolling release.

I have a 5 year old Lenovo business laptop that cost me a pretty penny and it came optimized by the OEM for W7/Pro. It is well built and very responsive. That too was a binding contract (warranty now expired), but this little Chinese gerbil will probably last through to 2020 also. I like the hardware - I am a delighted customer. Microsoft should be delighted to have a satisfied customer. The most valued customer, is a return customer. That does not mean an intimidated customer. I will not bend to intimidation. Marketing is a source of pure entertainment to me. The current mob at Redmond are a laugh a minute.

It's nothing more than cartel conduct and planned obsolescence by corporations. There is absolutely no point and reason to install Windows 10, not even Windows 7. Windows XP works perfectly. Who cares if Microsoft will stop supporting Windows 7? They already stopped supporting XP, yet XP is still working perfectly. Even at my workplace, in the council all computers run Windows XP with disabled Windows updates, but with up to date antivirus and a router-based security. So XP is still good for everything, except if you want to play the latest games and you need DirectX or the latest .NET framework which they didn't make for XP because of planned obsolescence. And that's why the latest DirectX is available only on Windows 10. They want to force people to use Win 10. Reply Clairvaux January 16, 2017 at 5:58 pm # Unfortunately, anti-virus and routers are not enough to protect against exploits. XP has long been unsupported, which means it's an open avenue for attack. Even the harshest Microsoft critics among the experts warn against using XP anymore. Unless you're not connected to the Internet obviously, and don't have any USB ports. Hopefully, your concil has multiple backups and they are regularly tested. Such organisations are prime targets for ransomware. Reply Sum Guy January 17, 2017 at 1:45 am # See my comment (above) about Win-XP. Microsoft is *STILL* supporting XP -> by way of updates to POSReady 2009. POSReady 2009 is what Micro$haft strategically called a specific version of XP-SP3 intended for POS (point-of-service) PC's. Those are PC's used by bank tellers, airline check-in counters, retail cash registers, etc. All you have to do is add or modify 4 registry entries on your XP-SP3 machine and as far as WindowsUpdate is concerned, it's now a POSReady 2009 machine. Then have it do a Windows-Update check. You'll see that it will magically discover new updates, fixes and patches. Just search for POSReady XP hack. Read about it on the MSFN XP forum. POSReady 2009 will be getting updates until April 2019. And for those of you using Win-7, I think there's another newer version of POS based on Windows 7, and that OS will be getting updates for years. Clairvaux January 17, 2017 at 2:11 am # Yes. I know. I read your comment. Just because it's possible does not mean it's safe. What you're talking about is basically a hack. We don't know if it's supported by Microsoft (on the face of it, it isn't). It's meant to trick your computer into thinking it's a cash register. Cash registers don't access the Internet, or at least they don't surf the Web, exchange mail, do instant messaging and the like. It's highly unlikely that Microsoft updates meant for point of sales terminals address the attacks levelled at a PC facing the Internet all day long. There's no place you can turn to for assistance. Regular Microsoft updates for supported operating systems create all sorts of problems by themselves. It's already a full-time job for some people to keep their systems running and secure while they are officially supported, and you're telling us that just changing a few register keys in Windows XP will magically make it safe and smooth, while this simulates an environment completely different from one's own, and unfamiliar to most ? It might "work", and it might give one bragging rights ("Look ! I receive Windows XP updates !"), but there's no way this will make it safe. To begin with, a vast number of application software don't support XP anymore, and might even be downright incompatible. So you need to use ancient, unsupported programs, which are bound to be wide open to their own set of exploits. Microsoft updates meant for POS terminals might even break things which are never attached to POS terminals, but are routinely used with PCs. It's a hack. It's fun to know you can make a hack work, but there's a world of difference with a real, reliable solution. vosie January 18, 2017 at 8:17 am # Antivirus and routers are perfectly enough to protect XP.

That said, getting compromised involves a great many variables, witness the fact that so many are now proudly proclaiming that they have turned off all updates on various Windows versions with no issues. We don't actually know what sorts of updates POSReady 2009 does or does not get but uninstalling and reinstalling Microsoft Security Essentials afterward will see it getting regular malware updates and showing the computer as protected. My point is that you are speculating about risks and treating your conclusions as facts. While you are most likely correct at least in part, we are both just guessing so I would moderate my condemnation somewhat if I were you.

Jack Stewart Transportation Date of Publication: 01.15.17. 01.15.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am As Self-Driving Cars Approach, the Auto Industry Races to Rebuild Getty Images When Ford executives started dropping in on Silicon Valley startups a couple of years ago, they were met with less than warm receptions. The stalwart car company was looking for help and fresh talent to help it in the fast-paced development of driverless cars—but it was a stranger in a new land. “We’ve learned a lot,” says CEO Mark Fields. “Simple things like, if you’re going to have a purchasing agreement with a startup, you can’t walk in with an 80-page legal document. It’s got to be two or three pages, saying OK here’s how we want to do business.” The fact that one of the world’s oldest, largest, and most successful automakers is rewriting decades of standard practice to satisfy companies one millionth its size, evinces the scope and speed of the change rocking its industry. More than that, it points to the very real ways that change is solidifying into action. Over just a few days at CES, a host of companies whipped up a frothing eddy of partnerships, buyouts, and consolidations. Audi paired with Nvidia, Microsoft with Volvo, BMW and Intel with Mobileye. And while the show floor was littered with shiny concepts proclaiming the future, those contracts—banal as they might sound—were the real news. A New Auto Industry The age of autonomy is real, and it’s almost here. Ford, GM, Audi, BMW, Tesla, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, and others have promised to deliver self-driving cars in the next five years or so. These newly forged partnerships are a vital part of making that happen. In and of themselves, these types of deals are nothing new. Automotive supply chains span tiers of companies scattered around the globe. Automakers themselves merge and break up, occasionally share engines or vehicle platforms, and pass around smaller brands like so many Pokemon cards. The goal is always the same: Reduce cost and complexity—and increase profit—by joining forces with the folks whose strengths match your weaknesses. Now, the industry is building the supply chains and partnerships that well help it push into a new age, one that demands manufacturing expertise, artificial intelligence know-how, mapping skills, piles of cash, and more. “We’re still learning how to build autonomous cars, so there’s different companies trying out different ideas,” says Walter Sullivan, head of the Silicon Valley innovation lab for German software company Elektrobit. “We’re seeing a lot of partnerships to do that, and we’ll see some consolidation, because of the number of companies involved.” Ford opened a bulked-up Silicon Valley outpost in 2015, just to rub shoulders with startups. It started working a couple of companies developing neural networks, invested in Civil Maps, which translates gobs of LIDAR data into maps for self-driving cars, and jointly formed the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets with Uber, Google and others to lobby for autonomous vehicles.1  Every other serious player in the autonomous car space is doing the same. Last year, General Motors bought self-driving startup Cruise, and Nissan shacked up with NASA. “The stage we’re at now is much more open partnerships and collaboration, a model stolen from the tech industry 15 years ago,” says Thomas Jönsson of Autoliv, a leading supplier of car safety systems. Let’s take one example from CES. Mobileye, the largest supplier of cameras for self-driving cars, is now working with major industry supplier Delphi, plus Intel and BMW. It has entered a strategic partnership with mapping company Here (which Audi, BMW, and Daimler jointly bought in 2015). At the giant tech show, this coalition announced it would have autonomous test vehicles on the roads later this year. Here’s another one: Uber is working with Volvo to strap self-driving add-ons to real vehicles. Volvo is also partnering with Autoliv. Those two companies are lending employees to a joint project called Zenuity, to share patents and ideas. OK, one more: Newly launched as a standalone company, Google’s self-driving car outfit, Waymo, inked a deal with Honda to go along with its partnership with Fiat Chrysler. “It comes from two directions,” says Jönsson. “You have the old established industry, trying to automate their vehicles, but you also have the tech companies coming in from the left with new, more disruptive ideas.”  Zenuity will have 200 software engineers, pulled from both Volvo and Autoliv, which Jönsson says is key—they’re approaching the problem from both angles. “The automotive industry is being led by technology, as opposed to cost, or horsepower,” says Sullivan. His company, Elektrobit, is owned by Continental, which apparently wanted to be a mobility shop as well as a tire-maker. Now, Elektrobit is also working with Mercedes and Nvidia. It announced a partnership with Argus Cyber Security at CES. Catch all that? The good news is that although this stage of the process might be complicated, and not especially dramatic, it means that driverless cars are approaching reality. The industry is moving past the oh-so-easy to build a concept car (ahem, Faraday Future), and flashy demonstration videos filmed in one, experimental vehicle (ahem, Tesla). It’s a lot harder to create a stable and long-lasting business that makes money building millions self-driving cars, but that’s exactly what companies, large and small, are working to do. 1 Updated 1:40pm 1/17/17 to include details on the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets.

Customer-Responsive Inventory Visibility is Possible with New Retail IoT Platform. Visit SATO Global Solutions at NRF Booth 3181 As part of the Acuitas Digital Alliance, SATO Global Solutions will demo strategic applications that improve inventory visibility, workforce efficiencies and customer experience January 16, 2017 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A deluge of retail technology has created enormous opportunities for retailers, but has not solved the issue of siloed technology systems. To address this issue, IoT solution provider SATO Global Solutions will launch two customer-responsive applications at the NRF Big Show in New York. At SATO Global Solutions Booth 3181, retailers can test out the first cloud-based IoT platform that leverages shared data to improve inventory accuracy and visibility, product on-shelf availability, sales associate efficiency and the retail customer experience. This solution from SATO Global Solutions (as part of the Acuitas Digital Alliance, co-founded by SATO Global Solutions) is the Vision Retail Platform. It seamlessly connects RFID tags, sensors, gateways and the cloud to deliver actionable insights across retail applications when and where data is needed within the store. The platform allows retailers to respond to customers’ actions promptly and wisely. It recognizes product movement prompted by customer actions and generates real-time inventory visibility while providing insight into customer preferences. As part of the Vision Retail Platform, the Sales Associate Application empowers employees with real-time visibility into inventory information, including product movement. For example, if a customer picks up a shirt, carries it elsewhere in the store, and then abandons it for another product, a sales associate will be notified of the item’s location, reducing misplaced inventory and increasing workforce efficiency. Additionally, if the last on-display garment of a particular style or size is sold, the application will notify a sales associate in real time. This enables retailers to replenish shelves with inventory immediately, rather than waiting until the end of the day for a stock check. The Smart Fitting Room Application gives shoppers access to in-stock information, optional colors and sizes, and a connection point to the sales associate. When integrated with the Sales Associate Application, the Smart Fitting Room Application enables retailers to respond to customer requests from the fitting room, offering concierge-style personal service to shoppers and enhancing the in-store experience while influencing purchasing decisions. “Sales Associate and Smart Fitting Room are the two strategic applications initially available on the Vision Retail Platform, which integrates and shares data to support multiple tasks. The platform is expandable and sustainable. Additional applications will be added to help retailers meet ever-changing consumer expectations and seize opportunities driven by 'in-the-moment' shopping behaviors,” said Goro Yumiba, chairman and CEO of SATO Global Solutions. “Being part of the Acuitas Digital Alliance was beneficial as we developed the platform. It allowed us to leverage the deep knowledge and wisdom of other Acuitas members who have served the industry for a long time. We look forward to pursuing new solutions with Acuitas members,” Yumiba added. SATO will be joined at NRF by fellow members of the Acuitas Digital Alliance, like-minded technology innovators determined to bring the full benefits of the new digital era across the entire retail supply chain. Launched in January 2016, the Acuitas Digital Alliance members are BT, Intel, RetailNext, NexGen Packaging, SATO Global Solutions and Valmarc Corporation.

Automakers, technology companies and glass manufacturers are teaming up to turn the display that graces the front of an iPhone into the windshield of a car — one that can show ads, directions and vehicle information to the person behind the wheel. The advent of connected cars is creating a new sales battleground, and using a windshield may be the next way to pitch more products and services to consumers. McKinsey & Co. estimates that mobile and data-driven services in autos will generate $1.5 trillion by 2030. At least part of that will be spent projecting information to drivers and passengers right before their eyes. “When you think of a person driving and what your needs are when you’re on a typical trip, it’s food, it’s fuel and it’s rest stops,” said John Butler, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “Owning the inside of the car is critical, it’s really where the money is made. The real value is locked up in the ad opportunity.” How might a smart windshield work? A driver who is close to running out of gas would see an alert pop up that notes the fuel situation and offers to find a gas station. The car’s virtual assistant will offer a choice, again on the windshield, of two options, including directions to a station where the driver is eligible for a free cup of coffee — an ad placed by the gas company that fits with the driver’s buying patterns, also known by his smart car. At CES, the gadget show in Las Vegas this month, Panasonic demonstrated technology that lets a driver order and pay for fast food through a display, before pulling off the freeway. Pairing such offerings with other connected subscription services could generate hundreds of dollars in additional recurring revenue per car each year, according to Tom Gebhardt, the head of Panasonic’s automotive business in North America. “When you start doing payments out of the vehicle, you have to secure those payments somehow, so we’re matching the facial recognition with your credit card,” he said. “We’re really investing in an integrated solution.” Corning is starting to sell carmakers the glass used in Apple’s iPhones for windshields and in-car entertainment systems. The company said the durability and thinness of the glass means that any image projected onto it is sharper than onto a typical windshield. While the product is less than 10 inches wide, Corning is working to expand it to a full windshield-size display. “They could be here in less than two years,” Corning Chief Technology Officer Jeff Evenson said. “We’re making the car much more active to set things up for these kinds of services.” Turning a car windshield into a billboard is part of broader efforts by automakers and tech companies to transform vehicles into connected devices. Many companies at CES announced deals and partnerships that use software, digital voice technology and cloud computing to handle everything from automatically scheduling a maintenance appointment to ordering a takeout pizza while on the road. Automakers including BMW, Hyundai and Toyota already offer basic displays near the windshield in some models that show information such as the vehicle’s speed. Alphabet, through its Waze navigation app, suggests nearby restaurants and points of interest during your drive, as does TripAdvisor. The next step is merging the two idea and projecting points of interest onto your windshield. Eventually, mapping and navigational data could be superimposed onto the road in front of the driver, much in the way that Google Street View displays information about an area on a static image. BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler acquired Nokia’s Here mapping unit in 2015 to ensure that they would not need to depend on Google for maps. Intel said this month that it has acquired a 15 percent stake in Here. “This is exactly the sort of thing the high-end carmakers are promoting as part of their highly integrated, immersive ‘cockpit’ concepts,” said Richard York, an executive at chip designer ARM who is responsible for automotive sales. The question of how the technology is regulated remains open, given concerns about driver distraction. For now, suppliers are eager to promote the displays as safety tools. For example, the speed and location of vehicles in a car’s blind spot might be projected onto the windshield. “We’re going to bring the safety aspect of the vehicles” into the augmented reality products, said Joseph Yoon, head of LG Electronics’ automotive research and development team. Boosters also say a windshield display is a safer alternative than drivers taking their eyes off the road to glance down and tap a dashboard system or check a smartphone. For many years BMW, Volkswagen and Jaguar Land Rover worked with Munich startup Metaio to investigate possible applications for augmented reality technology in cars, according to someone familiar with Metaio’s business. The main hurdle to superimposing an enhanced image for the driver was the “tracking problem” — establishing the direction of a driver’s gaze and adapting the image accordingly, the person said. Metaio was acquired by Apple last year, and ended its contracts with the carmakers. Panasonic’s Gebhardt said his company had mastered the technology and is seeking a customer willing to deploy it in a car. People usually understand information presented in an augmented reality format more quickly than on paper or a smartphone, according to Sunny Webb, who leads Accenture’s research and development efforts in augmented and virtual reality. That makes augmented reality an appealing medium through which to present location-based ads, as well as safety and contextual information to drivers. “Being able to overlay content in a windshield is a really interesting application,” she said. “There’s a lot of energy going into how to distribute content to passengers and drivers.” Meanwhile, Harman International, the in-car infotainment systems giant that is being acquired by Samsung Electronics, is moving into heads-up displays. In December it announced an investment in Navdy, a San Francisco maker of a projection display that sits on the dashboard in front of the windshield and provides navigation guidance, car behavior data and smartphone alerts. The two companies will start selling a heads-up display this year. Automotive supplier Magna International is reportedly expected to unveil an augmented reality product with a major German carmaker this year. Automakers also are considering the ability to push content such as video in front of passengers in addition to mapping or road services as a way to generate more revenue from each vehicle. “We want to have our direct customer relationship delivering premium services to them and being their direct contact,” Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s head of research and development, said. “That’s the clear goal for a premium car manufacturer.” Alex Webb is a Bloomberg writer.

Devos, a billionaire GOP donor, will take the first step toward a possible confirmation on Tuesday at a hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee that will put her face-to-face with liberal stalwarts Sens. Elizabeth WarrenElizabeth WarrenDemocrats denounce Trump's actions barring refugees Warren goes on tweetstorm over refugee ban Warren: I’m opposing Trump’s ’dangerous’ Education pick MORE (D-Mass.) and Bernie SandersBernie SandersSanders: Trump 'fostering hatred' with refugee ban Sanders: I will vote no on Tillerson Sanders applauds scientists 'fighting back' with planned DC march MORE (I-Vt.).  DeVos’s vocal support of school choice and charter schools is expected to get tough questioning at a hearing that promises to be contentious.  ADVERTISEMENT Warren just last week penned a scathing 16-page letter to DeVos, arguing that she’s unqualified to lead the Education Department and lacks public education experience.  “While past nominees for secretary of Education have served as teachers, school system leaders, and governors, and came to the Department of Education with deep executive experience in public education, you have held no such position,” Warren wrote. “As such, your nomination provides the Senate and the public with few clues about your actual policy positions on a host of critical issues.” Teachers unions loudly oppose DeVos’s nomination, with the American Federation of Teachers president called her “the most ideological, anti-public education nominee put forward since President Carter created a Cabinet-level Department of Education.” The National Education Association also opposes her nomination. DeVos needs just 50 votes to win confirmation, making it difficult for Democrats to block her nomination. No Republicans have signaled opposition to her confirmation. But she could also potentially face some heat from more conservative lawmakers over her past support for Common Core education standards. DeVos backed it when it was at the state level, but opposed it when it became a federal standard. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked Common Core, vowing to eliminate it and give back authority to the states. High-profile Republicans have gone to bat for DeVos, who didn’t endorse Trump during the GOP primary and has long been a leading GOP voice for education reform.  Senate Education Committee chairman Lamar AlexanderLamar AlexanderGOP lawmakers voice concerns over ObamaCare repeal: report Franken: No Dems will vote to confirm DeVos for secretary of Education Senators' ObamaCare replacement bills highlight GOP divide MORE (R-Tenn.) met with her prior to the confirmation hearing and announced his support. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney have endorsed DeVos, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice penned a letter to the HELP Committee supporting DeVos’s nomination. Former first lady Barbara Bush wrote an op-ed doing the same. DeVos’s original hearing was scheduled for Jan. 11, but Democrats argued that Republicans were rushing to hold hearings and were not giving the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) enough time to fully vet Trump’s nominees. A day before the initial hearing date, OGE was still reviewing DeVos’s paperwork. As a piece of the vetting process, MLive.com reported Friday that DeVos disclosed her $5.3 million in campaign contributions from the past five years. The total of 440 donations date back to 2012. End Citizens United (ECU), a campaign finance reform PAC, and Every Voice have been ramping up pressure for senators on the HELP Committee who have received campaign contributions from DeVos to recuse themselves from her confirmation hearing. They include GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy (La.), Tim ScottTim Scott5 reasons the Senate must reject Andrew Puzder as Labor secretary Haley slams United Nations, echoing Trump DeVos vows to be advocate for 'great' public schools MORE (S.C.), Todd YoungTodd YoungIndiana teachers hold sit-in to demand Young recuse himself from DeVos vote Trump education pick to face Warren, Sanders Government to begin calling Indiana residents Hoosiers MORE (Ind.), Lisa MurkowskiLisa MurkowskiOvernight Regulation: Liberal groups train their fire on Trump education, labor picks Anti-Devos calls jam Senate phone lines Senators move to nix Trump's ban on funding NGOs that provide abortions MORE (Ak.) and Richard BurrRichard BurrOvernight Cybersecurity: Trump using unsecured phone | Intel panels move forward with Russia probes | US leads world in data breaches Senate committee moving forward with Russia hacking probe Want to streamline government? Start with the Pentagon. MORE (N.C.). ECU spokesman Adam Bozzi said that the group has run ads against these senators in Washington, D.C., and their home states and plans to keep up the pressure even after the hearing. The group has received more than 23,000 petitions that will be delivered to those members’ offices next week. Ed Patru, a spokesman for the group Friends for Betsy DeVos, argued DeVos faces a double standard since the two teachers unions opposing her nomination have contributed to Democratic members of the HELP Committee. Another attack line to watch for on Tuesday from Democrats is related to a $5.3 million fine imposed on a political action committee run by DeVos that was found to violate Ohio’s election laws a decade ago.  At the time, DeVos ran All Children Matter, a school choice PAC, and was given the fine after it exceeded the contribution limit to its Ohio affiliate. The Ohio Elections Commission had previously warned the group that contributing over $10,000 would be breaking the law. Her PAC has since disbanded.  Sanders and three other Democratic senators sent a letter to DeVos last month calling on her to repay the fine. “If confirmed as Secretary of Education, you would be responsible for administering our nation’s student loan programs and ensuring that borrowers repay their loans in a timely manner,” the senators wrote. “However, the PAC that you chaired failed to pay fines that were imposed on it over eight years ago.”  Patru said DeVos wasn’t named in the lawsuit that came from the fine and called Democrats’ efforts a “transparently political maneuver” and a “witch hunt.” Tags Elizabeth Warren, Lamar Alexander, Lisa Murkowski, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Richard Burr, Todd Young, Tim Scott   View the discussion thread.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft warns Windows 7 support ends in 2020, recommends users upgrade early to Windows 10 4 by Surur  @mspoweruser Jan 16, 2017 at 21:32 GMT2 weeks ago Time flies and it’s already 2017, and Windows 7, the world’s most popular desktop OS, is now nearly 8 years old. Unfortunately for the aging software each passing year brings it closer to the official end of its support by Microsoft, which is set for January 14, 2020. In fact the software already passed out of mainstream support some years ago, and is currently on extended support, meaning it is only getting major bug fixes and security updates. Microsoft Germany have posted a blog post where they encourage Windows 7 users to upgrade to Microsoft’s newest and some say final operating system, which currently has close to 25% of desktop OS market share worldwide. End of life for Windows 7 means no more security updates, updates or technical support from Microsoft. Microsoft also warns that Windows 7 can’t keep up with today’s threats, and that using an old and especially unsupported OS adds increased maintenance costs. Microsoft also touts the advantages such as supporting the latest chipset features by Intel, AMD and Qualcomm . Microsoft notes Windows 10 offers maximum security, an easy upgrade path and a wide variety of enterprise security features and that 96% of companies worldwide were already evaluating Windows 10. “Windows 7 is slowly advancing in years. Already, it neither fits the requirements of the users of modern technologies, or meet the high security requirements of IT departments, ” said Markus Nitschke, Head of Windows at Microsoft Germany. “As earlier with Windows XP, we recommend that companies should take early steps to avoid future risks or costs.” Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

We guess there’s a certain appeal to it since it is a platform that many are familiar with, and with Microsoft kind of messing up with Windows 8, we guess some are still a bit skeptical about whether Windows 10 has fixed those problems, or if we’re just looking at another mess. Naturally Microsoft wants users to migrate to Windows 10, so much so in a post on their website (via Myce), the company has basically told its users that Windows 7 has outdated security that will no longer be able to keep up with today’s increased security requirements. So if you want your computer to be as secure as possible, at least from an OS point of view, then you definitely should upgrade to Windows 10. The blog post which was made in German reads, “Windows 10 is the only Windows version to provide support for the latest Intel, AMD and Qualcomm chips. In addition, many programs are already written or developed for newer versions of Windows.” They also say that companies who continue to use the operating system are taking “enormous dangers”. Markus Nitschke, Head of Windows at Microsoft Deutschland said, “Windows 7 slowly becomes old. It does not meet the requirements of today’s modern technology, nor the high security requirements of IT departments. We learned from Windows XP that companies should take early steps to avoid future risks or costs.” Filed in Computers..

Certifications that stand out Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Two Years After the Hack, Sony CEO Lynton Exits for Snap Inc. By Lindsey Bahr PUBLISHED: JANUARY 16 2017 Two years after guiding the company through an unprecedented email hack, Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton is leaving the company to become the chairman of the board for Snap Inc., the company behind Snapchat. Sony said Friday that Lynton, a 13-year Sony veteran who led both the music and entertainment group, will stay on for six months to ensure a smooth transition as Sony Corp. President and CEO Kazuo Hirai looks for a replacement. In a statement, Lynton said he had been involved with Snapchat since its early days and is choosing to focus on that company given its recent growth. Lynton started with Sony in 2004 as chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment and in 2012 was named CEO of Sony Entertainment. Sony Pictures Entertainment and its various film divisions have been struggling of late at the box office with underwhelming performances from higher budget fare such as "Ghostbusters," ''Inferno" and "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk." Lynton's highest-profile moments during his tenure came in the aftermath of the devastating November 2014 hack involving the leak of proprietary information, employee Social Security numbers and embarrassing emails from top executives such as Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chair Amy Pascal. Five Sony-produced movies, including the unreleased "Annie," appeared on file-sharing websites. The hack hindered Sony's business operations, including the release of the James Franco and Seth Rogen film "The Interview," and led to the departure of Pascal only three months later. "The whole series of events, not just for myself, but for everybody in the company, had so many twists and turns to it that every time you thought you were going down a path, every time people thought we got this in hand, the next thing you knew we'd have another threatening email come through two days later or another series of events," Lynton told The Associated Press at the time. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Lloyds Accounts Hit in Cyberattack 5. 5 Steps To Boost Your Safety Online Next Article > Security Fail: What Was 2016's Most Used Password? PUBLISHED: JANUARY 17 2017 According to a study released by a leading cybersecurity firm, top passwords used by netizens are so weak that it will take only few seconds to crack them. If you are using "123456" as your password you are not alone. Nearly 17 percent of users worldwide are safeguarding their accounts with "123456", one of the easiest passwords to crack. Keeper Security, a cybersecurity company, scoured 10 million passwords that became public through data breaches that happened in 2016, and has put out a list of most commonly used passwords. '123456789' and 'qwerty' completes the top three passwords used by people worldwide. The study also found that four of the top 10 passwords on the list are six characters or shorter. Passwords '12345678', '111111', '1234567890', '1234567', 'password', '123123', '987654321' were among the top ten list. "Looking at the list of 2016's most common passwords, we couldn't stop shaking our heads. Nearly 17 percent of users are safeguarding their accounts with "123456." What really perplexed us is that so many Web site operators are not enforcing password security best practices," Keeper Security said in their blog. The list of most-frequently used passwords has changed little over the past few years. That means that user education has limits. While it's important for users to be aware of risks, a sizable minority are never going to take the time or effort to protect themselves. IT administrators and Web site operators must do the job for them. Four of the top 10 passwords on the list -- and seven of the top 15 -- are six characters or shorter. This is stunning in light of the fact that today's brute-force cracking software and hardware can unscramble those passwords in seconds. Web site operators that permit such flimsy protection are either reckless or lazy. The presence of passwords like "1q2w3e4r" and "123qwe" indicates that some users attempt to use unpredictable patterns to secure passwords, but their efforts are weak at best. Dictionary-based password crackers know to look for sequential key variations. At best, it sets them back only a few seconds. Email providers don't appear to be working all that hard to prevent the use of their services for spam. Security expert Graham Cluley believes that the presence of seemingly random passwords such as "18atcskd2w" and "3rjs1la7qe" on the list indicates that bots use these codes over and over when they set up dummy accounts on public email services for spam and phishing attacks. Email providers could do everyone a favor by flagging this kind of repetition and reporting the guilty parties. © 2017 The Peninsula under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Earlier that summer, Clay had been detained by two policemen in then-all white Ferguson, Mo and told to never enter that town again. Upon graduation in 1951, Clay was invited to an interview with McDonnell Aircraft, only to be told when arriving “there are no jobs for professional Negroes.” Five years later, he would be hired, after Brown v. Board of Education, as programmer for McDonnell’s first computer. Bill Gates was two months old at the time. ADVERTISEMENT In 1958, Clay began programming the fastest computer in the world at the Lawrence Radiation Lab in northern California, helping to create our nuclear deterrent. When Glenn took off, Clay was manager of Fortran and Cobol programming for Control Data in Palo Alto, a job he held until David Packard recruited him as manager of computer research and development for Hewlett Packard in 1965. Like the women of “Hidden Figures”, Clay’s path to becoming a Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame member is all the more remarkable because it is largely unknown. In an opinion article for the San Jose Mercury News, he reflected on the death of Michael Brown and noted that it could have been him, back in 1947. When only 0.9 percent of African-American students take calculus, 70 years after Clay excelled in the field, we must take full advantage of the technology heritage they represent. As he related the police incident to his mother, Clay recalls that she told him, “You will face racism all your life. Never let it be the reason you don’t succeed.” More than 450,000 African-Americans have followed in Clay’s footsteps, including 24 percent of all federal technology employees and a similar proportion of military technologists. Yet, they often face the same roadblocks that Clay faced in the 1950s.  Silicon Ceiling 15: Equal Opportunity in High Technology reviewed recruitment web sites of 243 San Francisco tech firms and found that only 18 had a picture of an African-American among the employees.  Only 22 listed themselves as equal opportunity employers. In recognition of Clay’s service to national security, a new Western headquarters for the National GeoSpatial-Intelligence Agency in St. Louis should be named for him. Like the movie, this recognition will give young people the hope and confidence to soar past the barriers of intolerance and create the innovations that the future demands. Clay would go on to greenlight Intel, Compaq and Tandem. What would our society be like without the original coder? Reducing numbers like the more than 700 murders in Chicago requires teaching his story much more widely. We need to see the teenagers of today not as candidates for mass incarceration or murder but as the Roy Clays of the future. John William Templeton has tracked technology equal opportunity since 1998 in the annual Silicon Ceiling report.  He is former editor of the San Jose Business Journal , publishes the Journal of Black Innovation and currently heads Zenviba Capital in San Francisco.

We round up rumours of a new 12-inch MacBook, after no refresh in October 2016. by Lewis Painter | 25 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Is a 13in MacBook going to launch in 2016? When will the 2017 12-inch MacBook be released? What can I expect from the next 12-inch MacBook in terms of tech specs? How much will the 2017 12-inch MacBook cost? Will the 12-inch MacBook replace the MacBook Air range? Apple released the 2016 variant of the 12in MacBook back in April 2016, and almost a year on, we're looking to the future and what we could expect from this year's model, the 2017 12in MacBook. Here, we sift through the latest rumours surrounding the 2017 MacBook and also our personal predictions based on previous Apple events, and knowledge of the company. Those of you that want to find out more about the current 12in MacBook released in April 2016 can take a look at our 12in MacBook review, which covers everything from pricing to performance and design, sprinkled with our personal opinions of Apple's latest MacBook. Apple decided not to update the MacBook or MacBook Air line during its October 2016 event, and decided to cut the 11in MacBook Air completely. This suggests that the MacBook is set to replace the Air line. We suspect a refresh to the MacBook line in March 2017 to confirm the replacement.

So, when are we likely to see the next-generation 12in MacBook? Considering that Apple released the 2016 variant of the laptop in April, we assumed we wouldn't be seeing another upgrade until 2017 - and we were right. But 2017 is finally here, so when can we expect to see the new MacBook appear?  Apple has trademarked three new MacBook mode numbers, according to a Russian trademark filing. The three new model numbers, A1706, A1707 and A1708, were tipped to be a 13in and 15in MacBook Pro, and a MacBook with a 12in screen. This is all according to the reliable KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo - we aren't sure if these model numbers correspond with the new MacBook Pro models - but we will update this article once we confirm the model numbers. We had originally expected to see the 2016 variant of the MacBook announced during 2016's spring Apple event, which was one year on from Apple's unveiling of the very first 12-inch MacBook models. But instead, Apple revealed the iPhone SE, a 9.7in iPad Pro and new Apple Watch straps, with no mention of an updated MacBook. A few weeks later Apple surprised us by updating the MacBook without any bells and whistles or another event. According to Macrumors, a 12in MacBook will go into production in early Q2 2017, so about April time.  Apple is a company of habit - new iOS software is showcased every June (along with macOS, tvOS and watchOS) which is then released alongside the latest generation iPhone months later, in September. It has been that way for more than a few years now, with the only exception being with the launch of the iPhone 4. Following Apple's MacBook habits to date, it suggests to us that we'll be seeing the 2017 MacBook sat on our laps between March and May 2017.  New MacBook 2016 rumours: Will the 12in MacBook replace the MacBook Air? In October 2016 Apple showcased four new MacBooks, none of them an Air model. It seems Apple wants us to believe that it hasn't officially killed off the Air, but it all looks like an indirect confirmation of the 12-inch MacBook replacing the Air in Apple's affection and ongoing product portfolio. Apple's MacBook Air design is now eight years old, and it's quite possible that the MacBook is lining up to replace it in the near future. When the MacBook Air first launched, its biggest selling point was its thin and light design, hence the name; but the MacBook now outshines it in those areas. To be honest, barring a major and revolutionary redesign it seems unlikely that the MacBook Air has much of a future ahead of it. Plus, for those looking for ultimate portability there's the new iPad Pro with a 12.9in screen. Here's why it doesn't matter that the MacBook is expensive, underpowered and only has one port The last time there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (white and black, and then eventually aluminium). Those were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air reduced. It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models replacing the MacBook Air models at a lower price than they are now, at least eventually - especially considering the MacBook Air’s less-than-exciting 2016 update. According to trusted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the 12in MacBook is now Apple's best-selling computer, closely followed by the 13in MacBook Pro, which adds further fuel to the rumour that it'll soon replace the MacBook Air thanks to its popularity. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also claims that Apple is planning to introduce a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in model in the third quarter of 2016. Kuo is a goldmine for inside Apple information and has been called "the most accurate Apple analyst in the world", providing accurate rumours regarding the iPhone 6s months in advance of its release, along with a flurry of predictions about the upcoming iPhone 7 which many assume to be true. Current rumours suggest an October hardware event where Apple will announce the 2016 MacBook Pro - will the company announce a larger MacBook alongside it? However, while Kuo is usually accurate, we're not too confident about this one. The rumour hasn't been backed up by any leaks or other sources, and it seems like a pretty strange move to release a new MacBook only 1in larger than the current model, so it's best to take this with a pinch of salt. If true, we think it signals the end of the MacBook Air range. See more MacBook Air rumours here. New MacBook 2016 release date rumours UK: UK price While we’re still a way away from the official announcement of the 2017 MacBook, we can already speculate about the pricing as Apple rarely changes the price of its range from generation to generation, unless it’s a fairly hefty upgrade. Currently the base MacBook sells for £1,249. With that being said, the 2016 MacBook Pro will set you back £1,449 for the basic variant and £1,949 for a more powerful variant - and the prices have all gone up since Brexit too (Basic Air is £100 more, and basic MacBook is £200 more expensive!) New MacBook 2016 release date rumours UK: Design and features Looking at the change in design from the 2015 MacBook to the 2016 MacBook, it suggests that we won’t be seeing huge physical changes. In fact, the only change in design from the original MacBook and the 2016 MacBook was the addition of a new colour option, Rose Gold, to go alongside the readily available Gold, Silver and Space Grey options. Aside from that, the design hasn't changed for the MacBook. It's incredibly thin at 13.1mm, and it weighs just 0.9kg, making it 24 percent thinner than the MacBook Air, and we don’t expect that to change dramatically in future. Will the 2016 MacBook have a Force Touch keyboard? Update 14 October: According to 9to5Mac, Apple is in talks with the Foxconn startup, Sonder - a company that uses E Ink technology to display its keys (see a video here). This allows a way of customising keys and even adding symbols which would not be possible on a regular keyboard. It's rumoured that Apple will use this technology in their next MacBook. Back in autumn 2015, it emerged that Apple had filed a patent that appeared to show its design for a Force Touch capable keyboard. Along with the 2015 MacBook Pro, the 2015 MacBook has a Force Touch trackpad, which gave electric pulses that feel like clicks, but is a glass plate that doesn't actually move. Like on the iPhone 6s, you can press harder for a deeper click to access menus and options within certain apps. The new MacBook also has keys unlike any other Mac, which have very little travel in order to make the chassis ultra-thin. The newly discovered patent shows what seems to be a whole keyboard and trackpad area fit to house this technology. As this shows, the whole keyboard and trackpad, plus areas to the left and right of the pad, could theoretically be customised to the user's tastes and, for the first time, not have a physical keyboard. However, we have seen Apple file patents in the past that are to bookmark ideas for the future. It'd be amazing if this technology were included in the new MacBook next year, but we feel this is one for the coming years. It would potentially allow you to have several language keyboards saved and switch between them on the adaptable display. We can but dream. Imagine typing on a surface that felt like a keyboard, but was actually electric feedback telling your brain you're pressing keys? If this is Force Touch's future, we are excited. Will the MacBook feature an Apple Pencil-compatible trackpad? It's not the only new addition to the MacBook either, if the latest patent approval is anything to go by. According to a patent filed by Apple which was recently approved, an upcoming Mac could boast compatibility with the Apple Pencil - although the Apple Pencil depicted in the patent is far more advanced than the one on sale at the moment. The Pencil in question features a number of sensors that could detect movement, orientation and depth and, according to the patent, could be used with a Mac as an 'air mouse' or possibly even a joystick for gaming. The patent reads: "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." It doesn't end there, either - apparently an upcoming Mac trackpad will feature Apple Pencil support, allowing users to use and draw directly onto the trackpad with the precision of the iPad Pro. While the patent doesn't mention whether the trackpad will be built into a MacBook or offered as a standalone Mac trackpad, we imagine that if Apple plans on utilising the patent, it'll do so with its newest line of laptops - the MacBook.  Will Apple discontinue Thunderbolt? One question that has arisen is whether the introduction of USB-C spells the end of Thunderbolt. We don't think that Apple will drop Thunderbolt from its Pro Mac line up any time soon, but the standard may well disappear from the consumer level Macs eventually. The reason we think it will remain on the MacBook Pro, Mac Pro and the iMac is Apple's efforts to convince the industry to adopt it since its introduction in 2011. However, Apple also promoted FireWire to the industry and eventually removed that from its Macs. New MacBook 2016 release date rumours UK: Tech specs What can we expect to see from the 2017 MacBook in terms of design? While rumours are scarce at these early stages, there is one interesting rumour that, if true, could herald in a new generation of Force Touch-enabled keyboards for Apple's laptop line. Processors The next-generation MacBook is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors: that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But there's another, less predictable, possibility. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has spotted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE" being supported. This isn't a chip family that anyone has heard of, but it's probably an Apple custom ARM chip: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Apple might be about to put ARM chips in its new MacBooks. RAM Macrumors has recently quoted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo as predicting the MacBook will get a refresh towards the second half of 2017 with Kaby Lake processors, and thinks we'll see a 16GB RAM model too. This would double the current crop's 8GB.  Image courtesy of Techtastic Will the 2016 MacBook have LTE connectivity? It seems that sharing your iPhone's cellular connection with your MacBook wasn't enough for Apple, if the latest patent approval is anything to go by. The patent, as described by the US Patent and Trademark Office, will allow the company to embed LTE hardware in the 2017 MacBook, making it the first cellular-enabled Mac in Apple's range, past or present.  As well as LTE connectivity, the patent describes the use of Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth and satallite connectivity, and mentions ways to boost the signal without interference from the metal body of the MacBook. It's worth mentioning that this idea isn't new, though - it was originally filed on June 8 2015, and there was also talk of a 3G-enabled MacBook Pro back in 2008, but the idea was eventually rejected by Steve Jobs as he felt it'd tie the user down to a particular carrier.  Thinking of buying a Mac?

Or perhaps you can’t afford a new console, and want to kick back in the living room with your favorite PC shooter. Either way, you can’t. After all, your PC is not a game console, is it? It’s not like it supports wireless controls, motion detection, and has a HDMI connection, is it? Oh, hold on. Your PC probably does do all of that. And if it doesn’t, it definitely has VGA or DVI, which means that there’s a good chance of there being some way of converting that connection to one suitable for your HDTV. Make Sure Your Hardware Is Up to Date We’ll get to the main event of hooking your PC up to a nice, big, flat screen TV in a little while. First, we need to make sure that your computer — whether it’s a desktop, laptop, or even a self-build intended as a HTPC 9 Awesome Linux Media Center Distros for Your HTPC 9 Awesome Linux Media Center Distros for Your HTPC Linux distributions offer a flexible, more versatile solution to creating an awesome HTPC than Windows. Looking to build a HTPC? There's a slew of fantastic Linux media center distros awaiting. Read More — is up to the task. While pretty much any computer will run a video game, some older hardware may cause trouble. For instance, old CPUs and ancient, juddery hard disk drives will make the PC game console experience pretty frustrating. So, opt for new or recent hardware. Advertisement An Operating System and User Interface Naturally, you’ll need an operating system to run your games on to enjoy them on your TV. Windows, Linux and macOS are all suitable platforms, and if you’re happy to simply run your desktop through your TV without a dedicated interface, then this is fine. But you might also like the idea of a game-centered, controller-friendly user interface. Several are available, but perhaps the most popular is Steam, the biggest gaming digital distribution service. Whether you run this in “Big Picture Mode” or instead opt for the Linux-based SteamOS Gaming on Linux is Here: Install SteamOS Beta Today Gaming on Linux is Here: Install SteamOS Beta Today If you've become interested in gaming on Linux, using SteamOS as your Linux distribution of choice is a good idea.

Find the Best Controllers and a Wireless Keyboard With your hardware setup, you’ll need something to play with. While USB is always a good option for controllers, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are now more than adequate and offer more-convenient cable-free gaming.

You have various options here, depending on the output options on offer from your laptop or desktop (or your desktop’s graphics card). With HDMI Cable The HDMI cable option is the most obvious. A vast majority of TVs now ship with HDMI as the main (if not only) option, and HDMI cables are far more affordable than they were a few years ago. All you need to do is connect the HDMI out from your computer to your TV, then select the HDMI channel on your TV. On your PC, ensure that the signal is being sent to the TV. You can do this by opening the Project panel, either by pressing Windows + P or clicking the Project option in the Notifications area (your laptop may have a function key for this too).

With Other Cables Other cable solutions can be problematic. While many TVs still have VGA connectors, few have DVI (something typically reserved for monitors). The result is that you must find a way of converting the output on your computer to the input on your TV. Often this can turn out well, but with the wrong cables it can turn into a nightmare.

Wireless Streaming With a strong wireless network connection, you can take advantage of wireless streaming technology to enjoy PC games through your TV. An advantage of this is that you won’t even need a dedicated games console PC build: simply stream the game from your PC at one side of the house to your TV at the other side!

All you need to do is hook the Steam box to your TV, log into Steam on your PC, and the device will automatically connect. You’ll then be able to launch games through Steam on your TV! NVIDIA Gamestream The final option is NVIDIA Gamestream, which is available to you if you have a suitable NVIDIA graphics card and an NVIDIA Shield streaming media device. The principle is similar to the Steam In-Home Streaming option: you stream games from your PC to your TV through the NVIDIA Shield. While these are all good options for wireless game streaming, you may find that the best results are afforded with a good quality HDMI cable. So forget about the Xbox One, PS4, and the forthcoming Nintendo Switch. PC gaming is where it’s at. We’ve already seen 2016 as the year in which PC gaming overtook consoles, and with Windows, Linux and Mac all seeing increasing support from developers and distribution services, this shows no sign of slowing down. Now is the time to convert your PC into a games console. Any questions or thoughts? Tell us about it in the comments!

(PRWEB) January 16, 2017 Event technology startup Hubb today announced that its software platform has been selected by the Corporate Event Marketing Association (CEMA) for their annual event, CEMA Summit, in 2017. Hubb’s event content management solution will give CEMA Summit organizers a single location to collect, manage, and market the abstracts, speakers, and sponsors of CEMA Summit 2017, saving them two-thirds of the time they would normally spend on those types of tasks, and allowing them to get the event to market 29 percent faster. “CEMA’s annual summit is one of the events that we look forward to most every year, and to be selected as their content management vendor of choice truly validates the work that we’re doing at Hubb,” said Allison Magyar, CEO of Hubb. “We look forward to the opportunity to show some of the best in the business how our technology is improving the event management process.” Recognized as one of the leading providers of event content management technology, Hubb creates a “single source of truth” for event organizers to store and edit event content, such as speaking session information and sponsorship details. From this central point, event managers can make updates to event content that are automatically published across every source of event information (such as a website, mobile app or digital signage). Hubb also automates reminders to speakers to submit their information and session graders to evaluate submissions and allows event managers to control who on their team can access session data at any time. With less time needed to manually manage content, organizers can focus on thinking strategically about their events and create a better event experience for their attendees. Hubb works with customers such as Microsoft, Tableau, Atlassian and Intel to help their in-house event teams oversee the programs for their major conferences and meetings. CEMA is one of the premier professional organizations for event planners, offering strategic counsel and networking opportunities for more than 700 active members.

Dan Hutcheson, a veteran semiconductor equipment analyst who is chairman and CEO of VLSI Research Inc. “It may come back, depending on whether there can be consensus among semiconductor equipment companies.” The Global 450 Consortium (G450C)--a joint R&D program that involved Intel, TSMC, Globalfoundries, IBM, Samsung, the SUNY Polytechnic Institute--quietly wound down its work at the end of last year with member companies concluding that the timing was not right for an optional Phase 2.

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Shoot Em Up, a well-known Texas longhorn from Ellicott, was ready for his Twitter performance during the National Western Stock Show parade. The weather, however, was not. That didn’t faze Melissa Brandao, the woman behind the Longmont startup HerdDogg. The company has developed a small, rugged Bluetooth-enabled device designed to improve herd health and profitability by giving ranchers an easy-to-use, affordable tracking and data gathering system. Instead of the parade, which was clearly going to be a snowy challenge, HerdDogg systems debuted with Shoot Em Up’s assistance at the Wild West Show Saturday and Sunday at the National Western. At the same time, Brandao and her small team of tech gurus are pushing hard to send out the first batch of commercially available smart tags this spring. She describes them as the equivalent of a Fitbit, except for very large, non-verbal mammals. Social media savvy steers When Shoot Em Up, who weighs nearly 1 ton, showed off the new technology during the National Western Stock Show, he sent out tweets letting the audience know, for instance, how fast he’s walking, how many steps he’s taking and his internal temperature, among other things. This information once was collected manually by ranchers as they physically inspected their animals — often multiple times a day — looking for those who were ailing or who were preparing to give birth. The advent of Bluetooth technologies, which allow data to be gathered and stored locally, and cellphones have changed all that, according to Brandao. Now, using HerdDogg, a cow with one of the young company’s tags implanted in its ear can walk up to a watering trough in a far-flung pasture and take a drink of water. While the animal drinks, the data from the HerdDogg tag is being gathered by a device attached to the trough, which the young company calls a dog bone. The data stays at the trough in the rugged, plastic, bone-shaped device, ready for a rancher to collect it via an app on a cellphone. If the rancher is standing in a field, he or she simply taps the icon on the cellphone that reflects the numbered tag of the cow being monitored, and information on that cow appears. In addition, an LED light in the tag lights up. “Our goal is to create a technology that is rancher friendly,” Brandao said. “The data is stored and transmitted when the rancher needs it.” Ranch animals have been tagged for years. In the early days, the simple plastic tags held a number that was the animal’s ID. Then, as production became more sophisticated, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, began requiring radio ID tags. But HerdDogg is helping take the ag tag into a new world of precision agriculture, where animals can be tracked remotely, around the clock, without the use of tall radio towers or expensive networks. With more data, producers can make better-informed decisions that should help them improve herd health and profitability. Brandao said she believes the technology can allow small- and medium-sized producers to grow their herds without having to add staff, a critical factor in an industry in which family farms are shrinking in number and consolidation is rampant. Healthier cows, greener pastures Ryan Rhoades, a Colorado State University Extension specialist for beef producers, said devices such as the HerdDogg tag can help ranchers finely tune their operations, improving the health of herds and saving money by reducing the need for expensive drugs and veterinary visits required when animals go from simply feeling poorly to actually being sick. They can also help improve the sustainability of ranching by, for instance, helping ranchers track which areas of pasture land cattle are using for grazing, and then redistributing the cattle to ensure lands aren’t overgrazed. “Producers are looking for strategies to be more sustainable,” Rhoades said, “to increase their efficiency and to increase the bottom line. They’re also looking for tools to improve herd management and health.” Antibiotic resistance and medication use in feedlots is a big issue, Rhoades said. “Historically, we’ve not been very good at diagnosing sickness,” he said. “There is a consumer perception that we’re treating everything and mass medicating. This kind of tech allows us to be much more precise. With the price of drugs these days, there is probably a significant reduction in medication cost as well.” The White House and reality TV Shoot Em Up isn’t the only one who has been tracking HerdDogg’s progress, of course. The young company, which relocated to Longmont last summer after launching in Oregon in 2013, has already raised $750,000 and is seeking another $1 million to $2 million this year. It spent much of last year participating in an agriculture-based Techstars program in Minneapolis and Brandao and her team won a visit to the White House in 2015 as part of a demo-days program. They were also featured on Intel’s reality TV show, “America’s Greatest Makers,” in 2015. Rob Schultz is managing partner of Champaign, Ill.-based Serra Ventures, a venture capital company with an interest in ag technologies. Schultz and his partners invested $500,000 in HerdDogg and plan to participate in the next finance round as well. Prior to backing HerdDogg, Serra had invested in a data-gathering technology used on tractors, an investment that paid off when the company was acquired by the giant Monsanto Corp.

The next great frontier is livestock,” Shultz said. “Imagine you’re a rancher. All of your assets are roaming around outside your immediate access and control, and you have very little information on them. Being here in the Midwest, I talked to friends who are farmers and ranchers and was able to get their perspective. If they could save one cow or even detect illness earlier and treat it with one antibiotic shot rather than a vet visit, these are big deals for these farmers.” Pilot projects and social media As with all startups, much work lies ahead. For now, the chips that go into the tags are manufactured in Brooklyn, N.Y., and quality control is being done in Longmont. New algorithms are being developed almost weekly, including those that will measure how often a cow is eating, chewing and swallowing, or “ruminating” as they say in the ag world. The technology is being tested in California, Oregon, Colorado and Brazil, and HerdDogg has several notable partners, including Land O’ Lakes and Shoot Em Up’s home operation, the Silverado Ranch east of Colorado Springs in Ellicott. Gary Lake, who owns Silverado Ranch with Stan Searle, has 10 Texas longhorns in the pilot program. The full herd — 150 strong — graze on roughly 2.5 square miles of open pasture and Lake has attached the plastic dog-bone devices on watering troughs through the range area. While he’s impressed with the biometric data the tags gather, he loves the novelty of its interface with social media apps such as Twitter and Instagram. “Most people who buy Texas longhorn cattle have just a few head. They love them for their color and horns. These are the kind of people who will really enjoy getting a tweet from a cow as she is heading up to the house from the pasture,” Lake said. While Brandao is a big believer in social media, she has her eye on the worldwide livestock market, which is 2 billion animals strong. “I’m not a rancher,” she said. “But it is so exciting to be around animals who’ve never had a voice. Maybe this will help ranching become more common again.” “Our goal is to create a technology that is rancher friendly. The data is stored and transmitted when the rancher needs it.” Melissa Brandao, HerdDogg developer "Our goal is to create a technology that is rancher friendly.

Author By Dani Rodrik International Political Economy Professor, Harvard University Up Next Europe’s new “Indispensable Nations” Jan 16, 2017 Published 08:17 January 16, 2017 Updated 08:17 January 16, 2017 Trump’s defective industrial policy By Dani Rodrik International Political Economy Professor, Harvard University Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn + CAMBRIDGE – US President-elect Donald Trump has yet to take office, but his brand of flawed industrial policy has been on full display since his surprise win in November. Within weeks of the election, Trump had already claimed a victory. Through a mix of inducements and intimidation, he prevailed on the heating and cooling firm Carrier to keep some of its operations in Indiana, “saving” around 1,000 American jobs. Touring the Carrier plant subsequently, he warned other US firms that he would impose stiff tariffs on them if they moved plants overseas and shipped products back home. His Twitter account has produced a stream of commentary in the same vein. He has taken credit for Ford’s decision keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky, rather than move it to Mexico. He has threatened General Motors with import tariffs if it continues to import Chevrolet Cruzes from Mexico instead of making them in the United States. Trump has also hounded defense contractors for cost overruns, berating the aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin on separate occasions for producing planes that are too expensive. Trump’s policy style represents a sharp break from that of his predecessors. It is highly personalized and temperamental. It relies on threats and bullying. It is prone to boasting, exaggeration, and lies about actual successes. It is a type of public spectacle, staged on Twitter. And it is deeply corrosive of democratic norms. Economists tend to advocate an arm’s-length relationship between government and business. Public officials are supposed to insulate themselves from private firms, lest they be corrupted and engage in favoritism. This is a prized principle in the US – but one that is more often breached than observed. An obvious example is the undeniable influence over US government policy exercised by finance moguls during the last three decades. Yet close business-government interactions also lie behind many of America’s successes. The history of US economic development is one of pragmatic partnerships and collaboration between the public and private sector, rather than arm’s-length relationships and rigid rules. As historically minded economists and policy analysts such as Michael Lind, Stephen Cohen, and Brad DeLong have reminded us, the US is heir to a Hamiltonian tradition in which the federal government provides the investment, infrastructure, finance, and other support that private enterprise needs. US technological innovation owes as much to specific government programs, such as loan assistance or government purchases as it does to American entrepreneurs’ and inventors’ ingenuity. As Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner notes, some of the most dynamic technology companies in the US, including Apple and Intel, received financial support from the government before going public. The electric carmaker Tesla was a beneficiary of the same public loan guarantee program as Solyndra, the solar cell company that went bust in 2011 in a spectacular public collapse. As the Solyndra example illustrates, many public initiatives fail. But the ultimate test is whether the social return on the portfolio as a whole is positive, taking successes together with the flops. Such broad evaluations tend to be rare. But one analysis found that US programs to boost energy efficiency had produced positive net benefits. Interestingly, the bulk of the benefits were attributable to three relatively modest projects. Sociologists Fred Block and Matthew Keller have provided perhaps the best analysis of the US “developmental state” – a reality that they say the reigning market-fundamentalist ideology has obscured. Block and Keller describe how a “decentralized network of publicly funded laboratories” and an “alphabet soup” of financing initiatives, such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, work with private firms and help them commercialize their products. They and their colleagues have documented the extensive role of both federal and state governments in supporting the collaborative networks on which innovation rests – whether in biotech, green technologies, or nanotech. Such industrial policies, based on close collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors, have of course been the hallmark of East Asian economic policymaking. It is difficult to imagine China’s transformation into a manufacturing powerhouse – and the attendant success of its export-oriented model – without the Chinese government’s helping and guiding hand. It is ironic that the same people who extol Chinese gains from globalization are often alarmed that a US administration may copy the Chinese approach and explicitly endorse industrial policies. Unlike China, of course, the US purports to be a democracy. And industrial policy in a democracy requires transparency, accountability, and institutionalization. The relationship between the government and private firms has to be calibrated carefully. Government agencies need to be close enough to private enterprises to elicit the requisite information about the technological and market realities on the ground. For example, what are the fundamental reasons for the loss of manufacturing jobs in, say, automobile production, and how can the government help, if at all? But they cannot get so close to private firms that they end up in companies’ pocket, or, at the other extreme, simply order them around. And that is where industrial policy à la Trump fails to pass the test. On one hand, his appointments to key economic positions indicate he has little intention of severing government ties to Wall Street and big finance. On the other hand, his policymaking-by-tweet suggests he doesn’t have much interest in building the institutionalized dialogue, with all the required safeguards, that sound industrial policy requires. This means that we can expect the Trump administration’s industrial policy to vacillate between cronyism and bullying. That may benefit some; but it will do little good for the overwhelming majority of American workers or the economy as a whole. © Project Syndicate 1995–2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn + Load next: Europe’s new “Indispensable Nations” Related News EU Affairs EU’s finance ministers freeze Basel talks on Trump administration wait By Irene Kostaki Column Total eyes EU hydrocarbon exports from Cyprus, Greece By Kostis Geropoulos Issue 1196 Issue 1196: Trump-Brexit vs. EU (Print Edition) By New Europe Exclusive Mettler: Europe’s efforts ignored in Davos By Kassandra COPYRIGHT 2016 NEW EUROPE.

The giants were using walkie talkies on the sidelines to communicate. They were at home but for some reason they felt the need to ditch the NFL Bose equipment and use their own walkie talkies. They ended up beating dallas and I have no idea if they helped, one would think that if you were at home you would be able to control your own headsets. But after our last visit to Foxborough, with our headsets going out, it would be a good idea for Mike Tomlin to have some encrypted Walkie Talkies on the sidelines for this game. We all know the Patriots will be ready with a bag of tricks for the Steelers. I don't know what those bag of tricks entail but we have to be ready for it in some way. Tomlin and company shouldn't spend too much time but there should be some time spent on countering whatever shenanigans the patriots will employ. I remember returning home from an internship with Intel in California. I get home and I found my youngest brother had worn my brand new all white Jordan two lows. The problem was that they were now deformed and brown. Deformed because me youngest brother decided to squeeze his size 11 foot in those size 9 shoes and wear them without my permission anyways. After we fought I went to go complain to my dad, I asked him to make sure my brother didn't go in my room anymore while I went to college. He replies, 'if you know he's gonna do it then you take precaution and get a lock on your door, just make sure I have a key'. I think that bit of nugget of wisdom applies here for the Steelers. They can't wait for Goodell to just fine the patriots for whatever they do. Roger won't take the win away from the Patriots. Tomlin must be proactive and 'lock the door to his room' sort of speak. We must have our pactice facility combed for spys, use walkie talkies on the sidelines - eat the fine that Roger gives - we must be prepared for anything and everything the Patriots might do. Its our only hope. The opinions shared here are not those of the editorial staff of Behind the Steel Curtain or SB Nation.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Cholamandalam EXPAND TO VIEW ALL Budget 2017: Why a post-Budget fall won't mean achhe din are over for markets. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage MUMBAI: The high interest rate of over 7 per cent because of competition is unsustainable, Fino Paytech has said, stating clearly that it will not join the interest rate war for customer acquisition but focus on profitability once it launches its payments bank. "We do not subscribe to high interest rates and free offers and feel that the business has to make sense. We are sure people also understand that these are not sustainable and are short-term ploys," Fino Paytech MD and CEO Rishi Gupta told PTI. He was fielding a query about Airtel's venture, which has become the first operational payments bank offering an interest rate of 7.25 per cent on deposits. Gupta said interest rates are on way down and there is a negative return because the government securities in which 75 per cent of deposits need to be invested are yielding 6.3 per cent. There are also costs of operations additionally, he pointed out. "Fino, which applied for the final licence, is hopeful of launching its payments bank in the next 2-3 months with a network of 40,000 touchpoints and 400 branches," he added. The company already has 20,000 touchpoints through its legacy business correspondent network through which it serves universal banks, he said, adding that 10,000 additional points will come up through its strategic partners, including oil marketing company BPCL while it is putting up an additional 10,000 points. The touchpoints will operate through hand-held devices while the branches will be manned by up to four people each and spread across 300 square feet. Many of the branches are already running, but it is expanding headcount and the space, Gupta said. The company will also look at scaling up the recently-launched wallet service in the run-up to the bank launch. Earlier this week, it announced fund-raising of Rs 149 crore from ICICI Bank's insurance arms and two unnamed investors, clearing the decks for it to seek RBI's final nod as it becomes a majority domestic investor-owned entity. Other investors in the payments bank include BPCL, Blackstone, Intel Capital, HSBC, ICICI Bank, BPCL, IFC, Corporation Bank, Indian Bank, Union Bank of India and Headland Capital Partners. Fino, which had been operating as a business correspondent, was one among the 11 entities given in-principle nod to start a payments bank by RBI in August 2015. Other successful entrants included corporate houses Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla Group, the Mahindras, and telecom firms like Vodafone's M-Pesa and Airtel. Three applicants, including Mahindra, Cholamandalam and pharma entrepreneur Dilip Shanghvi, have backed out mid-way. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 16 January 2017 PCs on the rise by lee kah leng Handy: Samsung's Chromebook Pro allows you to install Android apps on Chrome OS. The PC has been on a downward slide for many years now due to the rising popularity of ­smartphones and tablets, but manufacturers have not given up on it. This year’s CES (Consumerh Electronics Show) saw many ­interesting models and even an 8K monitor. Here are the devices that stole the limelight at this year’s show. Samsung Chromebook Pro Samsung Chromebook Pro Samsung showcased the Chromebook Pro, one of the first few models that will allow you to install Android apps on Chrome OS. In other words, you will never be short of apps or games, as there are millions on the Google Play store. Even better, the Chromebook comes with a stylus so it’s much easier to use the apps. Of course, the stylus can also be used for ­taking notes and doodling, The first Samsung Chromebook made it to our shores in 2013 so it’s still too early to say whether the Pro model will be sold here but we are keeping our fingers crossed. Razer Project Valerie Razer Project Valerie The gaming hardware maker made headlines in Las Vegas with a mindblowing laptop which has a three ­displays. Yes, you read that right. The two additional monitors slide out from the side of the laptop chassis and are held by automated arms. Called Project Valerie, the laptop sports three 17.3in 4K displays side by side for “an expansive viewing ­experience” according to Razer. That’s 11,520 x 2,160 pixels, in case you are wondering. It’s powered by Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, the best graphics card available on the market but even that may not be able to handle such a high ­resolution. Intel Compute Card Intel Compute Card If you think the PC couldn’t get smaller, think again. Intel’s latest Compute Card, which is the size of a few credit cards stacked up, packs a processor, memory, storage and ­networking. This will allow manufacturers to design computers, fridges and all kinds of smart ­appliances that can take advantage of this tiny device. One of the biggest advantages of the Compute Card is that users can easily upgrade their appliances by replacing the Compute Card with a faster model. Dell UltraSharp 32 Ultra HD 8K monitor Dell 8K monitor You may just be getting used to 4K but Dell is getting ahead of the crowd by introducing an 8K monitor. The 32in monitor has a ­whopping 7,680 x 4,320-pixel resolution and is able to reproduce 1.07 billion colours. In terms of resolution it’s equivalent to four 4K panels or 16 full-HD displays. If you are interested in one, expect to pay through the roof as it comes with a hefty price tag of US$4,999 (RM22,000).

If you're trying to do adobe products (photoshop etc.) then this is likely not the best option for you, but I've managed just fine using products like Filmora for movie editing and Pixlr for photo editing. would highly recommend if you're on a budget and/or trying to save space," said one reviewer.

By John Solinap on January 15 2017 06:12 PM Share Tweet Share Share Email Apple’s iPad product line has branched out to several exciting products over the past years. Certainly one of the most popular models of the iPad though is the iPad Air. The thin and light tablet has been one of the hottest selling iPads in the market. Now, many tech fans are excited about the upcoming iPad Air 3 which is releasing soon. If the iPad Air 3 rumors are to be believed, a thinner iPad Air 3 could be coming as early as March of this year. The iPad Air product line boasts of being lightweight and portable, hence its name. This year though, Apple may very well make the device slightly larger without compromising on its weight and portability. iPad Air 3 Expected to Be Thinner Than iPad Air 2 According to MacWorld UK, the upcoming iPad Air 3 is rumored to be thinner than the iPad Air 2. This is certainly not a big surprise as Apple is constantly trying to outdo itself when it comes to releasing the latest gadgets. The iPad Air 2 was thinner than the original iPad Air so the upcoming iPad Air 3 will likely continue the trend. What is surprising though is that Apple intends to do this while reportedly increasing the screen size of the tablet. The same MacWorld UK report mentions that there could be a version of the iPad Air 3 which will have a 10.9-inch display. This certainly makes the iPad Air 3 slightly bigger but without adding too much weight and thickness to the device. iPad Air 3 Release Happening in March? These iPad Air 3 rumors are surely getting Apple fans very excited for the release of the tablet. Well, the wait is not going to be that much long now as a March 2017 launch is currently being predicted. Apple surely is going to have another media event this March and the iPad Air 3 could be the star of the show. Be sure to check back here soon to find out more news and updates on the iPad Air 3 as well as on the other great gadgets releasing soon.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   How much influence will pro-Erdogan voices have on President Trump? posted at 11:01 am on January 15, 2017 by Jazz Shaw Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES With the inauguration only days away, I have to admit that I’m growing increasingly concerned with the possible direction Donald Trump will be taking in terms of our relationship with Turkey and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Obama administration, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, has totally failed to respond to what amounts to the abject collapse of Democracy in that nation and the rise of tyranny under their current president. With a stronger leader like Trump (who pulls no punches on the foreign policy front, as we’ve already seen) I was hoping for a more robust response, but there are obviously a lot of forces at work behind the scenes. Trump’s getting plenty of input from the wrong people so far, and another example of this showed up this week in the form of an editorial at The Hill written by former Montana Congressman Denny Rehberg. Titled, “Resetting Turkey-US relations“, this piece could just as easily have been written by anyone on Erdogan’s staff. As the United States prepares for the incoming administration and President Donald Trump, there stands an opportunity for a reset of an important relationship – that of the United States and Turkey. The hope is that President Trump and his officials will cultivate more closely a diplomatic relationship with Turkish President Erdogan than President Obama had left fallow over the past eight years. In such a tumultuous time, there will be many issues that concern the two world leaders. And one of the issues hovering at the top of that list will be Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Imam and leader of the Fethullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) – the same person who orchestrated the failed coup attempt in Turkey on July 15 of this past year. Those opening paragraphs give you a feel for the entire piece, which goes on to continually denounce Fethullah Gulen as the author of last year’s coup in Turkey (a charge which has yet to be proven anywhere but in the mind of Erdogan), and demand that Trump extradite him in the name of improving relations with our historic ally. There is zero mention of the tens of thousands of people languishing in Erdogan’s dungeons, the closure of all media not approved by the state, the imprisonment of police chiefs, professors and political opponents, Erdogan’s attempts at cleansing the nation of Kurds or his efforts to rewrite their constitution to make him essentially a dictator for life. Also missing from Rehberg’s essay is a single mention of American pastor Andrew Brunson, who still remains locked up in one of Erdogan’s cells in the hope of using him as a bargaining chip against us. If you haven’t been keeping up with events in Turkey and the unfolding disaster of the Erdogan presidency, just scan the headlines of our previous coverage. It’s worth noting that the former congressman isn’t coming into this argument out of a vacuum. He’s been a pro-Turkey advocate for years and was formerly part of the Congressional Turkey Caucus. That group was stirring up trouble on the Hill for quite a while, prompting Michael Rubin to take to the pages of Commentary back in 2014 calling for the entire caucus to be disbanded. His analysis of the dangers of Erdogan, including his obvious history of antisemitism and antipathy toward Israel remains a must-read to this day. Unfortunately, it’s probably not just Rehberg who will be urging such passivity on Trump’s part. Erdogan himself has been showering praise on Trump, most recently for “putting the media in their place.” Now, I’ll be the first to note the many shortcomings of American mainstream media, but we deal with the problem through free market forces, not by throwing Wolf Blitzer in a dungeon and scheduling him for an acid bath. There may be other forces seeking to influence Trump on this score as well. His national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, has much to recommend him, but as Chuck Ross of the Daily Caller revealed back in November, Flynn has some deep ties on this score. His lobbying firm, the Flynn Intel Group, was hired by an obscure Dutch firm specifically to promote Erdogan and his agenda. He also wrote an op-ed (again, in The Hill by the way) just before the election which alarmingly mimics Rehberg’s piece, describing Turkey as being “in crisis” and in need of “our support” while calling for the extradition of Gulen with no mention of Erdogan’s many other sins. Trump himself has a history of seeming a bit too friendly with Erdogan as well. Shortly after the aborted Turkish coup last summer the President Elect gave an interview to the New York Times in which he seemed to be singing Erdogan’s praises and sounding as if he was ready to believe anything he had to say about Gulen, as recounted by Gregory Pappas. “I give great credit to him for being able to turn that around,” Mr. Trump said of the coup attempt on Friday night. “Some people say that it was staged, you know that,” he said in the interview. “I don’t think so.” When the interviewer asked Trump if he believed that Erdogan was exploiting the coup attempt to purge his political enemies, Trump deflected the answer and criticized the nation he wishes to lead in January of 2017, saying that the United States wasn’t a good messenger of moral authority over other countries. “When the world sees how bad the United States is and we start talking about civil liberties, I don’t think we are a very good messenger,” he said. Trump told the NYTimes reporter that he was convinced that he could convince Erdogan to spend more emphasis on fighting ISIS. As with all things, we won’t know Donald Trump’s final decision and course of action until he lets us know himself. But the early signs are more than worrying. I hope he’s getting a broad range of input from his team and listening to more voices than just the ones which seem to be in Erdogan’s pocket. We have a serious problem with Turkey but it’s not just the need to secure their further cooperation in fighting ISIS. That formerly democratic ally of ours is collapsing before our eyes. Erdogan is a thug who is no friend of Israel or the west. The purge he is currently carrying out should horrify anyone and now he’s brazenly taken an American hostage. He needs to be dealt with from a position of strength, not an immediate willingness to compromise.

The update is likely to bring long-awaited features for Windows users such as Paint 3D and virtual reality (VR) compatibility. In addition to being a major upgrade to Windows, the Creators Update is also expected to be Microsoft’s answer to all feedback and complaints it has received about Windows 10. Terry Myerson, Microsoft Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group, speaks about Microsoft's Windows 10 "Creators Update" at a Microsoft event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, Oct. 26, 2016. Photo: REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Here are 5 features of Windows 10 Creators Update that you should look out for: 3D features Windows 10 Creators Update will bring 3D enabled features, especially a 3D enabled version of its graphics program Paint. Microsoft stated on its Windows Blog that it will also add 3D creation features to other applications such as PowerPoint. Many companies including Lenovo and Dell would manufacture 3D accessories for Windows users, with price tags starting at $299, which will let users create their own 3D content. Gaming features Microsoft recently revealed that it will introduce an improved gaming experience with the Windows 10 Creators Update. In October, the company revealed that the update would have a Beam feature that would let players stream their gameplay. Beam will connect to players’ Xbox Live account and let them stream games using this account. Players won’t need to use an extra software for gaming on PC. A new "Windows+G" shortcut will pull up the Game bar with a broadcast button to start streaming. Players will also be able to record their own gaming videos in the form of GameDVR clips, adjust the recording length and access their video captures directly in the Guide section appearing on the right side of the screen. But the most important feature of the new update is the Game Mode, which Microsoft says will bring improved performance to PC gaming. Microsoft recently revealed that the Game Mode will run both legacy games (Win32) and modern games (Universal Windows Platform). Mixed Reality VR compatibility Microsoft announced at Computex 2016 that it will bring its Holographic Mixed Reality technology to Windows PCs. At the event, held in late May and early June, it also announced that it will be working with Intel to create head mounted VR displays compatible with regular Windows hardware. “Next year, we will be releasing an update to Windows 10, which will enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications,” the company said at the time. The Windows Holographic shell will enable multitasking in VR, blending 2D and 3D apps, and support different kinds of devices. Improved privacy settings and web browsing On Tuesday, Microsoft revealed its new web-based privacy dashboard, which lets users see and control their Microsoft activity data, including location, search, browsing, and Cortana Notebook data across multiple devices. Users can sign in with their Microsoft account and visit https://account.microsoft.com/privacy to review and clear their data. The company will also give users a simplified version of their diagnostic data, so that they can review their privacy settings and see what features they need to use and grant permissions to. The company will also add new features to its Edge browser, such as tab preview feature, which will give you information about open tabs in the form of thumbnails. Tabs can also be shared using the ‘share tabs’ options in the side menu. Related Stories Microsoft Announces Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 15002 For PC New Security Feature For Windows 10 Devices In The Works Users will also be able to scribble over or annotate web pages in Microsoft Edge using the browser’s Web Note feature. Edge will also allow users to deny Adobe Flash access to some sites while enabling it on others. In addition to this, users will be able to import favorites, browsing history, saved passwords, and data from other browsers to Edge using the ‘import from another browser’ option in the Edge settings menu. Microsoft Wallet Microsoft will come out with its own e-wallet to compete with services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. The feature is currently under development, but preview support for it has been included in the new payment request API for Edge. The feature will allow e-commerce sites to retrieve a user’s payment and shipping information using the Microsoft Wallet.

"We do not subscribe to high interest rates and free offers and feel that the business has to make sense. We are sure people also understand that these are not sustainable and are short-term ploys," Fino Paytech MD and CEO Rishi Gupta told PTI. He was fielding a query about Airtel's venture, which has become the first operational payments bank offering an interest rate of 7.25 per cent on deposits. Gupta said interest rates are on way down and there is a negative return because the government securities in which 75 per cent of deposits need to be invested are yielding 6.3 per cent. There are also costs of operations additionally, he pointed out. "Fino, which applied for the final licence, is hopeful of launching its payments bank in the next 2-3 months with a network of 40,000 touchpoints and 400 branches," he added. The company already has 20,000 touchpoints through its legacy business correspondent network through which it serves universal banks, he said, adding that 10,000 additional points will come up through its strategic partners, including oil marketing company BPCL while it is putting up an additional 10,000 points. The touchpoints will operate through hand-held devices while the branches will be manned by up to four people each and spread across 300 square feet. Many of the branches are already running, but it is expanding headcount and the space, Gupta said. The company will also look at scaling up the recently-launched wallet service in the run-up to the bank launch. Earlier this week, it announced fund-raising of Rs 149 crore from ICICI Bank's insurance arms and two unnamed investors, clearing the decks for it to seek RBI's final nod as it becomes a majority domestic investor-owned entity. Other investors in the payments bank include BPCL, Blackstone, Intel Capital, HSBC, ICICI Bank, BPCL, IFC, Corporation Bank, Indian Bank, Union Bank of India and Headland Capital Partners.

It seems like this would be useless and a huge waste of money to set up – a symptom of mad science becoming irrelevant to most people’s lives. Yet that electron is possibly the greatest discovery mankind has ever made. It can help us find a cure for cancer or find new prime numbers millions of digits long. The benefits of the so-called quantum computing that uses particles like electrons to compute faster than ever before are tangible and profound: they affect people’s lives every day. Why is that electron important? It can perform calculations. Any system which can be observed by a human to be in two or more states – let’s call them ‘on’ and ‘off’ – can be used in an arrangement to perform calculations: to do sums. These sums are the basis on which all society is based, because it’s how computers work, how they display information. An endless, meaningless string of 1s and 0s under the hood are commonly known to be how computers function, but what do they actually mean? Each binary digit (a 1 or a 0) is the output of a tiny electrical gate called a transistor. A small electrical current either flows through the gate or it gets stopped, and an ‘on’ or ‘off’ signal is carried through to the next gate. Millions of these little gates form vast networks of transistors on a circuit board (green plastic plates that control every piece of electrical equipment you own), and we’ve got to the point where we can make them so small that the electrical current – however tiny it is – can jump across from one gate to the other, causing errors in calculations. The odd jumps that the electricity can make are hardly surprising: the transistors are so small that you can fit billions on a 5p-sized chip (tiny wafers of silicon that house transistors). Companies like Intel are getting slower and slower at producing smaller chips, as the challenges with physics get tougher at the minute scale they work at. You don’t need microscopic silicon transistors to do sums, though. Remember: we can do calculations using any series of objects that you can put in those ‘on’ or ‘off’ states. Like a domino line, for example. Using just a few fallen or upright dominoes you can do all manner of simple – and even some complex – maths problems. That’s where we get to the electron from earlier. We are just beginning to pioneer an entirely new method of computing – and it doesn’t even use physical matter any more. Moving beyond the (albeit tiny, but still physical) silicon transistors that have been used from decades is a radical step, and one that requires software coders and physicists making the new computers totally rethink the way they work. It’s called quantum computing, and it uses single particles (or in some cases, pseudo-particles that don’t even really exist) like an electron, measuring their ‘on’ or ‘off’ states and using them to perform calculations. They are so fast at doing this because the electron, whilst unobserved, can be in both the on and off states at one time due to quantum theory (see Schrodinger’s cat). Whilst a silicon gate can only think in terms of 1 or 0, a qbit (quantum gate) can think in multiple ways at the same time. Technology is moving fast away from the realm of the physical that we mortals live and love in. But that’s no reason to stop the research. The benefits of faster quantum computers are massive in finding cures for diseases or simulating space travel. This science is relevant to everyone. --Will Allsopp is a student at King Edward VI School, Bury St Edmunds Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

The device will be created by the third party for Microsoft. A Chinese website has revealed that Pegatron will be making Surface Pro 5 for Microsoft. Microsoft has already given the manufacturing contract to Pegatron . The same brand had created Surface Studio. Microsoft will release Windows 10 update with Surface Pro 5. At present, fans are eagerly waiting for Windows 10 update. Microsoft purposefully withholding Windows 10 update, according to PC Advisor. Windows 10 update will be the most exciting feature of Surface Pro 5. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Features Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be powered by Kaby Lake processors. “The 7th Generation Core, formerly codenamed Kaby Lake, will be coming later this year. We have over 400 designs coming to market on the Seventh Gen Core, and you can expect lots of innovations from our OEM partners bringing this product to market,” said Shenoy during the company’s Computex keynote speech. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will have a high-resolution IPS Corning Gorilla glass protected display. There will be a 6 GB of RAM and 126 GB or 256 GB of internal storage capacity. According to Yahoo, the Surface Pro 5 will have an eSIM. This option will help the users to use the internet while traveling. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 price range will be between $899 to $1,599. “Instinctively, it makes more sense to wait a year since the last model, rather than rush a summer launch. Given that the Intel processors are just barely becoming available, it also makes sense that Microsoft would need some time to polish a product that includes the new chips. It?s certainly better for Microsoft to get the product right than to hit an arbitrary time frame,” Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 had some wonderful features like  The Stereo microphones and Stereo speakers with Dolby audio. Surface Pro 5 may also carry the same features.

The election of Donald Trump, for me, provides us another opportunity to review our democratic traditions as a country and begin the process of instituting traditions that limits discretion and enhance institutional framework. We copied the United States Presidential system of government in its flamboyance and high cost without any attention to the finer details and traditions that support the system. By our level of development and economic situation we had no business copying the bi-cameral legislation of the American Presidential system, fallout of their peculiar political experience. Future constitutional amendment should address issues of reducing the size and cost of our democracy. But I digress. Today we are concerned with the traditions and rules concerning election and transition of the American President and the lessons for us in Nigeria. In the last two months, we all saw the rigorous campaign and election of the US President-elect in clockwork manner displaying deep traditions and legal provisions that if we emulate will enhance our democratic experience. Some of the key lessons include the sacrosanct date of election, utilising the transition period for briefing by the outgoing administration and the bureaucracy, making key appointments of presidential staff and Senate approved positions and the nature of senate screening of appointees. We also saw the role of the General Services Administration in providing oversight and ensuring ethics compliance during the transition. Particularly we note the screening of the appointees by the Senate that received the nominations with the portfolio of the nominee stated allowing the relevant senate committee to hold detailed hearings and providing the public with insights about the nominee’s political views. The Nigerian senate should consider amending their rules to allow for committee hearings for screening. Also, Presidents should forward their nominations together with Portfolio to allow for detailed confirmation screening. My confirmation screening as Minister bears no resemblance to what I saw the Trump nominees go through either in rigour or depth. To manage transition in the United States Congress had passed legislations providing for the mechanics of transition. Providing an Overview of Federal Legislation Governing Presidential Transitions according to the GSA website https://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/105659 the following legislations govern the American transition. Presidential Transition Act of 1963, (Public Law 88-277, 3 U.S. C. 102 note) was enacted to provide for the orderly transfer of executive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office of a President and the inauguration of a new President. The objective of the Act is described succinctly in the first page of the 1963 Act thus “The national interest requires that such transitions in the office of President be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the faithful execution of the laws and in the conduct of the affairs of the Federal Government, both domestic and foreign. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the United States and its people.” The next Act passed by Congress was the Presidential Transition Effectiveness Act of 1998 which amended the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 to provide for a more orderly transfer of executive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office of a President. To control appointments by the President-Elect Congress passed The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 sets requirements for reporting to Congress and the Comptroller General actions related to Presidential Appointment with Senate Confirmation (PAS) positions as well as the qualifications for and term limits on acting PAS officers. Congress also passed the Presidential Transition Act of 2000, which amended the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. It authorizes the General Services Administration (GSA) to develop and deliver orientation activities for key prospective Presidential appointees, and requires GSA, in consultation with the National Archives and Records Administration, to develop a transition directory. The Intel. Reform & Terrorism Prevention Act, amended the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. It authorizes the provision of security clearances for prospective transition team members who will have a need for access to classified information to carry out their responsibilities as members of the President-elect’s transition team. Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010, amended the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 to provide that certain transition services shall be available to eligible candidates before the general election. The first thing we should deal with in building our electoral tradition is making our election date sacrosanct and removing the wide discretion that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) currently have as it pertains to election dates. American Presidential election was conducted on November 8, a date cast in stone and known to all. After four election cycles, INEC should grow up and stop shifting dates for elections.  I think time has come for the National Assembly to fix the dates for elections and stop the vague not more than 60 days’ provision of the electoral Act. Our recent history of transition from one party to another makes it imperative to articulate and define the process of transition and create a template for orderly transfer of executive power. The formation of transition teams, access to information and funding of the transition are issues crying for legislative attention. The strange and unnerving situation where a President is sworn in and does not constitute a Federal Executive Council for as long as he wishes requires urgent attention and clear legislative provisions. Since we aped the American Presidential system it will not be out of place if we adopt the process where all Senate approved appointees are selected and cleared before the swearing in of the President. The need for orientation and providing administrative support for incoming administration requires that an office under the Secretary to the Government of the Federation is made responsible for coordinating the transition activities and managing the budget appropriated for transition. Our democracy is still evolving and we need to continually legislate on key aspects to entrench good practices, reduce discretion and build institutions that can support our national aspirations of democracy, good governance and law governed rule.

"We believe that it is critical to have a full understanding of the scope of Russian intelligence activities impacting the United States," committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr and vice chairman Sen. Mark Warner said in a statement. Sen. Mark R. Warner, Vice Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Sen. Richard Burr, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, speak during the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill on Jan. 10 in Washington, D.C. Joe Raedle / Getty Images The inquiry will include "any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns," the committee said. The Senate committee plans to "interview senior officials of both the outgoing and incoming administrations including the issuance of subpoenas if necessary to compel testimony." The probe comes after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government was likely involved in a covert campaign to interfere in the U.S. election and carry out cyber-attacks on Democratic Party organizations.

Russia has denied any involvement. Related: FBI Comey's Told Trump About Russia Dossier After Intel Briefing The allegations of Russian attempts to interfere in the U.S. presidential election has caused some opponents to doubt the legitimacy of Trump's impending presidency, while Trump and other Republicans have repeated that any Russian campaign did not affect the outcome. On Friday Democratic Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights leader, told NBC's "Meet the Press" that "I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president," citing the alleged Russian campaign.

The implementation of secure large computing capability inside data center buildings provides economies of scale not matched by current state of the art enterprise data center standalone server technology. Building size cloud 2.0 computer implementations feature simplicity of design achievable only with scale. These data centers implement cloud 2.0 in a move that works better than much of the current cloud computing. The cloud 2.0 data centers have been reduced to two types of components, an ASIC server: single chip servers and a network based on a matching ASIC switch. Data centers are implemented with a software controller for that ASIC server and switch infrastructure. The major driving factors for Cloud 2.0 mega data center market are cost benefit, growing colocation services, need for data consolidation, and cloud. Amazon (AWS), Microsoft, Google, and Facebook data centers are in a class by themselves, they have functioning fully automatic, self-healing, networked mega datacenters that operate at fiber optic speeds to create a fabric that can access any node in any particular data center because there are multiple pathways to every node. In this manner, they automate applications integration for any data in the mega data center. Cloud 2.0 mega data centers are different from ordinary cloud computing. Mega datacenter networks deliver unprecedented speed at the scale of entire buildings. They are built for modularity. They are constantly upgraded to meet the insatiable bandwidth demands of the latest generation of servers. They are managed for availability. Key Topics Covered: 1.

Now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground,” said Airbus CEO Tom Enders this week. He was discussing his company’s Project Vahana, an attempt to bring autonomous flying taxis into the sky. “We are in an experimentation phase – we take this development very seriously,” he said, highlighting the need for ‘green’ technology, while also lauding the affordability of such a plan. “With flying, you don’t need to pour billions into concrete bridges and roads,” he said. AI and autonomous vehicle developments are helping Airbus along this aerial road, with a project update in September providing detail on what it is the company really wishes to achieve. Rodin Lyasoff, CEO of A3 at Airbus (the group behind the project), wrote on Medium of Vahana’s ‘passion for personal flight’, with this air taxi not needing a runway or pilot. Project Vahana. Image: Rodin Lyasoff/Medium Designed to carry a single passenger or cargo, “we’re aiming to make it the first certified passenger aircraft without a pilot”, he wrote at the time. While 2017 will hopefully see a prototype of the pilot-free vehicle, a “productisable demonstrator” is planned before the end of the decade. According to Reuters, Enders said that Airbus wanted to invest to make the most of new technologies to usher in an era of flying cars. Airbus is already the biggest manufacturer of commercial helicopters. “If we ignore these developments, we will be pushed out of important segments of the business,” he said. Concept images of the air taxis were revealed last year. Project Vahana. Image: Rodin Lyasoff/Medium Project Vahana seems to be almost entirely focused on addressing traffic concerns, which it claims are becoming more acute across the globe as a result of increasing urbanisation, particularly in megacities. “A good illustration is the Brazilian metropolis São Paulo, which set a new record in 2014: on the roads around the city, the rush-hour traffic stretched out for 344km,” it said. In response, Airbus experts across the organisation are looking skywards to develop three ambitious autonomous projects: helicopters, delivery systems and sky taxis. Before the skies are filled with taxis, the streets will see autonomous vehicles increase in presence, from almost non-existent to an expected dominant position. According to Fjord, which has a habit of getting its predictions right, 2017 will not see that influx to any great degree – but changes are coming soon. In the meantime, organisations will “focus attention on the car as a connected mobile environment”, and integrating the car with the home will be key. Mapping is playing a crucial role in this regard, with Intel showing its hand in the early days of 2017. Once owned by telecoms giant Nokia, Here was sold to a number of major German auto manufacturers back in 2015 for a sum of €2.5bn, as part of a future of connected cars and, more specifically, autonomous vehicles. Now Intel is getting in on the action, with news that the chip manufacturer is to purchase a 15pc stake in Here as part of a shared technology agreement.

The good news: Sunday’s Season 6 premiere, “Fair Game,” confirms that bad-ass CIA assassin Peter Quinn is indeed alive. (Yay!) The bad news: Yeah, he’s not in such great shape. After getting dosed with a chemical weapon last season and falling into a coma, Quinn somehow miraculously survived. (He is one tough cookie, after all.) But though he’s recovering in a VA hospital in New York City, Carrie discovers he’s not showing up for physical therapy like he should. When she does track him down, he looks terrible: weak, bleary-eyed and unshaven. She nags him to go back to therapy, but he doesn’t want to: “I’m not getting any better.” And even his nurses think Carrie’s visits are doing more harm than good, so she gives him some space. RELATEDHomeland Will Tackle the ‘Brody Question’ in Season 6 Bad idea, though: Quinn’s hooked on drugs, as we find out when a hospital staffer helps him sneak out to a drug den, where he smokes meth, hangs out with some sketchy girls and gets robbed by a male friend of theirs. (That’s how we know Quinn’s sick: A healthy Quinn would’ve beaten the hell out of that robber guy.) Carrie eventually finds him, looking half-dead, but he doesn’t want to go back to the VA: “I’m fine on my own… I’ll figure something out.” Carrie, wisely, doesn’t accept that and marches him back to the hospital. But after an ugly incident where Quinn tries to bolt and is aggressively subdued by hospital workers, she decides to take him in. He’ll live in the apartment below her and Franny in her Brooklyn brownstone, on the condition that he not bring any drug addicts down there. (Carrie has one other request for Quinn: Take a shower.) Later, Quinn tries to leave the apartment… but finds that Carrie’s locked him in. She loves you, man; she just doesn’t quite trust you right now. Let’s see what else went down in “Fair Game”: TERROR-VISION | Carrie’s new job is protecting the rights of Muslim-Americans, and she gets a fresh assignment in Sekou (Quantico‘s J. Mallory McCree), a young black man and devout Muslim living in the NYC projects. With a friend’s help, Sekou films videos at spots around the city where terrorist attacks have occurred, providing a history lesson… and a clear anti-American message. (“There are two sides to every story,” he says in one video. “Know that.”) You think these videos might attract the attention of the feds? Uh, yeah, probably! In fact, the feds — led by Special Agent Ray Conlin, played by Nurse Jackie‘s Dominic Fumusa — bust down the door of Sekou’s apartment, scaring the hell out of his mom and sister and leading him away in handcuffs. He’s charged with offering material support to terrorists; Conlin tells Sekou’s mom, “Your son has been radicalized by some very bad people.” PHOTOSWinter TV Preview: Your Scoop-Filled Guide to 30+ Returning Favorites! We learn that Sekou’s dad was deported as a terrorist following 9/11… but has he really done anything wrong? Carrie and a law-professor colleague visit Sekou in prison, where he defends his videos as free speech. Carrie agrees, and confronts Conlin at a press conference, telling him, “What I saw was an angry kid, at worst.” But Conlin informs her that when they searched Sekou’s apartment, they found a plane ticket to Nigeria and five grand in cash. Is he planning something much worse than an angry YouTube video? HAIL TO THE (LADY) CHIEF | Meanwhile, we have to check in on Saul Berenson, right? He and Dar Adal meet with the newly elected female president — oops! — Elizabeth Keane, played by House of Cards alum Elizabeth Marvel. They’re ready to brief her on the CIA’s covert operations, but she surprises them with her anti-war tone. She asks them about possible U.S. military action in Syria: “If the war isn’t winnable, what are we doing there?” And she wants to know all about the agency’s “lethal programs,” including drone and military operations. Later, over drinks, Dar Adal shares his theory: Keane’s son was killed in Iraq, and he’s worried that she blames the CIA for his death. (“I think she despises us.”) Saul remains hopeful… but Dar Adal isn’t one for optimism. He secretly plots with a woman from the Israeli government to act fast before Keane is inaugurated, and then has an ominous closed-door meeting with a U.S. senator. Dar asks the senator if Saul’s coming; the senator says no. “Probably for the best,” Dar says. Further Intel: * On the bright side: Franny looks healthy and happy! Brooklyn seems to agree with her, and Carrie’s lined up a good nanny, it looks like. Let’s just hope Quinn doesn’t bring around any drug-addled skanks to give the poor girl any (more) psychological scars. * German billionaire Otto Düring is back… and still wants to make Carrie his bride. Carrie pushes him away, but he encourages her to find someone to share her life with: “If it’s not me, Carrie… let it be someone else.” Maybe she should give him a shot? Let’s be real: Carrie’s choices in men haven’t been the best, historically. (RIP, Brody.) * Hey, no surreal free-jazz opening credits! At least not this week. But we did get a lazy-sax accompaniment to the opening scene, with Carrie on the bus. * That shot of Keane opening a locket: There’s a picture of her son in there, right? We didn’t see it, so we can’t be sure… but it looks like Dar Adal’s worst fears about the new president might actually be true. What did you think of the Homeland premiere?

Really hope Homeland should end after eight seasons and how good or bad Peter Quinn’s life will be whether or not he’ll make it through the rest of the season. Reply Wendy says: January 16, 2017 at 6:55 AM Glad Quinn lived! Amazing transformation of his character by Rupert Friend. Quinn is such a heartbreaking scary mess. Reply LK says: January 16, 2017 at 8:00 AM In some alternate universe President Elizabeth Keane is the older incarnation of Blacklist’s Elizabeth Keen. Seriously? A slight difference in spelling is all you got? Surely they could have come up with a different name? Reply Dave says: January 16, 2017 at 8:02 AM Episode … solid B. Preview for what’s coming up this season … A. It’s cute when someone tells Carrie not to take matters into her own hands. Reply Mitsotakis says: January 16, 2017 at 8:06 AM F: even though it was spoiled about Quinn, they lost any credibility they had left. Reply LK says: January 16, 2017 at 8:07 AM I actually wish they had let Quinn die.. his character had run its course and i dont know if this is the right show to follow a season long rehab journey. Reply funnibone31 says: January 16, 2017 at 8:14 AM It wasn’t the best premiere they’ve done but I am looking forward to the season! Quinn is still their punching bag but I’m glad to see Rupert Friend flexing his acting chops. He did a great job. Reply Virgil says: January 16, 2017 at 8:45 AM Oh the irony of Hollywood and black Muslims. I’m sure they know what they are doing and playing to the general ignorance and stupidity of our population when it comes to anything resembling reality. The modern day Muslim sects that have pretty much taken over (thanks to our dumbass media parroting whatever they are told to say) hate black people almost as much as they hate gay people and more than they hate women. The ignorance of people when it comes to the “religion of peace” is ridiculous. Does anyone do their own research anymore? “Therefore the Negro nations are, as a rule, submissive to slavery, because [Negroes] have little [that is essentially] human and have attributes that are quite similar to those of dumb animals, as we have stated.” -Ibn Khaldun (1377) – still called one of the greatest Arab minds ever….and oh yeah they are still slaves in multiple Islam dominant countries in the Middle East/Africa. But I’ll probably just be banned or put on a list for knowing history too well. Reply Yosef says: January 23, 2017 at 3:16 AM You cannot hope that the PC Amerika understands that. Reply Alichat says: January 16, 2017 at 10:37 AM Carrie didn’t lock Quinn in the apartment. She locked him out of her brownstone. The apartment has a separate entrance. While I expected them to kill off Quinn at the end of last season, I’m glad that they didn’t bring him back whole. Not sure how compelling the story will be (although it was a bit more compelling than the new president/Dar Adal conflict……election burnout I think), but at least it’s realistic that he’d be pretty messed up after surviving that. I was rather hoping to see Carrie rip into the orderly that helped him sneek out. And I have to admit, there was a moment when Quinn was drunkenly fumbling with that beer can to get his money out where I thought ‘he’s about to beat the s**t out of this jerk with the gun’. I was all prepared for the swaying, intoxicated Quinn to suddenly become laser sharp and snatch that gun away……a la Jason Bourne on the park bench in Zürich. Totally unrealistic, but it’s a reflex assumption when it comes to Quinn. Reply Dwight says: January 17, 2017 at 4:39 AM To me, it seemed like Quinn was having moments of clarity and strength, (ie. when he yells out to the babbling patient in the next room to “shut the F up”. ) yes he is having some type of hallucinations, but I’m wondering if he is faking his mental impairment to a degree as part of a plan. Would be nice, the show needs a badass character like (the old) Quinn. Let’s hope for a full recovery. Just saying. Reply Sabrina says: January 16, 2017 at 12:44 PM This was an interesting premiere and I’m looking forward to seeing how the rest of the season plays out. Reply Earl Tilford says: January 16, 2017 at 1:26 PM Female president…guess shooting for Season Six started last winter. Jewish CIA director and DO plotting with Mossad to the detriment of the probably two-state solution Hillaryesque president. What happens when PC writers do wishful thinking. Homeland goes irrelevant. Reply Julie says: January 22, 2017 at 5:52 PM This President is nothing like Hillary…and it’s fiction. (Of course.) Reply Yosef says: January 23, 2017 at 3:18 AM Yes somehow irrelevant. Reality goes beyond fiction…. Reply Samantha says: January 16, 2017 at 2:18 PM You have now made “Homeland” politically correct and ruined the show. Reply Yosef says: January 23, 2017 at 3:19 AM Agree. Reply Sam says: January 16, 2017 at 9:22 PM It was a train wreck. Not one scene contained drama anywhere near the last 5 seasons. I was bored with how poorly it was written — sophomoric! What a let down…I hope it gets better otherwise…I’m done with it. I don’t know how they could mess it up so much… Reply Liz says: January 17, 2017 at 4:48 AM Wasn’t the best episode but it does show Carries growth as a character- locking out Quinn from her brownstone was probably one of the only acts of responsible parenting she’s shown. Reply Tom says: January 17, 2017 at 9:43 AM Best part was the west wing reference, “when hoynes kicked her ass in the first debate”. Reply Harvey says: January 18, 2017 at 11:25 AM What was that music in the opening scene Carrie on the bus? Reply Joe says: January 20, 2017 at 5:04 AM Now that Trump is the new president, you’ll need to figure out a way to find a man to replace Madam President…..too bad Showtime. You took a great show and turned into Politically Correct excrement! What a disservive to your customers. Cancelling my subscription in about 5 minutes.

Over the next decade, accelerating autonomous driving technology, including advances in artificial intelligence, sensors, cameras, radar and data analytics, are set to transform not only how we drive (or, indeed, are driven), but the notion of car ownership itself. “Autonomous driving has become the next major battlefield for the car industry,” says Luca Mentuccia, automotive global MD at Accenture. The six levels of automation, defined under international standards by the Society of Automotive Engineers, range from “no automation” to “full automation”, explains Sven Raeymaekers, of tech investment banker GP Bullhound. “If you look at the most recent predictions, the majority of car manufacturers estimate the first highly to fully automated vehicles [AVs] will hit the market between 2020-2025,” he says.  When they do, regulatory approval permitting, their most significant impact is likely to be in the area of urban mobility. “AVs will enable new service configurations where consumers are delivered door to door with virtually no stops in a comfortable vehicle with just one to three other passengers,” says Stan Boland, CEO of FiveAI, which builds AI-driven software for AVs and is one of the companies testing autonomous vehicles on UK roads in 2017, alongside major manufacturers including Volvo and Ford.  Such services will be safer, reduce pollution and congestion, and will also bring about a paradigm shift in personal vehicle ownership rates, which are likely to decline steeply, he says. A recent survey of car manufacturing executives by KPMG similarly revealed that 59% of industry bosses believe that more than half of all car owners today will no longer want to own a car by 2025. So how exactly will we be getting about by the end of the next decade? Will automation really “solve” crashes, and what other sorts of AVs are we likely to see on our roads? The Observer asked a panel of experts about the likely realities and practicalities of driving in the year 2030. Will I be a driver or a passenger? You’ll have a choice, says Dr Nick Reed, academy director at transport consultancy TRL. “If you want to drive an MG and enjoy that, you’ll be able to. Or if you want to prepare for a business meeting during your two-hour journey, you’ll be able to do that too. Automation systems give us choices.” Nikolaus Lang, of the Boston Consulting Group’s Centre for Digital in Automotive, argues it will depend on the vehicle you’re in. “By 2030, you’ll be a ‘controlling passenger’ in your private self-driving car and you’ll be a ‘complete passenger’ in a robo-taxi.” Will it still make sense to own a car or will I rent one (on demand)? Instead of today’s car ownership model, we are far more likely to rely on “mobility as a service” by 2030, says Boland. “Imagine an Uber-like service you can summon at the touch of a button, but without a driver. Renting is not necessarily the right word – consumers will buy a service like using an Uber today, but with a wider range of vehicle configurations to suit different types of travel – family outings, long-distance sleeper travel, or shared commutes.” However, Lang points out that there’s a clear difference between a young urban population, for whom owning cars makes little sense, and the millions of suburbanites with families, who will probably still opt to own. Will there still be crashes? A 2008 survey by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that human error is the critical reason for 93% of crashes, says Boland. “When you eliminate human error, our roads become dramatically safer: no more drink-driving, phone calls at the wheel, carelessness, inattention or plain bad driving. Clearly there needs to be adequate industry testing to ensure that AVs are safe for all other road users, but we can look forward to far safer roads as human drivers become a thing of the past.” Will all cars be electric? “I don’t think all of them will be electric by 2030,” says Danny Shapiro, senior director at NVIDIA, whose AI computer platform powers the supercomputer in Tesla vehicles. “Virtually every startup is looking at electric, and you have ever greater electric and hybrid focus from German, Japanese and US [manufacturers]. But at the same time there’s still a huge oil infrastructure. And, at least for the next four years, there’s a very pro-oil administration in the US.” Yet Bosch is developing a lithium iron solid state battery that they hope will double the range of electric vehicles at half the cost of today’s batteries, which Steffen Hoffmann, the corporation’s UK president, believes will increase take-up among those who live in the suburbs and beyond. “We have a projection that by 2025, globally 15% of vehicles are going to have an electric component, whether that’s a pure electric vehicle, a plug-in hybrid or full hybrid,” he says. “For western Europe, that percentage would obviously be higher.” Will there still be driving tests? “Yes,” says Reed. “But they might be very different, with different layers. Just as you have an automatic and a manual gearbox test today, there might be an automated driving test which may only entitle you to ‘drive’ a certain type of vehicle that has certain automation systems, rather than any vehicle. Drivers will need to understand how to operate those systems – so there may also be different skills required as part of the test.” Will there be less gridlock? “With a heterogeneous mix of vehicle configurations and on-demand service delivery, autonomous vehicles will enable a higher density of passengers per road mile,” says Boland. “Also, because AVs can travel safely closer together, and with less braking and accelerating than human drivers, traffic will flow more smoothly and congestion will decrease. On motorways more vehicles will be able to fit safely into the same length of road, effectively increasing capacity”. Shapiro adds that another key cause of congestion is accidents. “Even if [the accident] isn’t blocking lanes, the traffic slows down to see what’s going on. So self-driving cars will not only enable more efficient flow, but they’ll remove the accident side of congestion [as there will be fewer of them].” Will automated vehicles be vulnerable to hackers? By definition, a driverless car has more control units, computing power, lines of code, and wireless connections with the outside world than a regular car today, which is why it’s more vulnerable to hackers, explains Andy Birnie, systems engineering manager at NXP Semiconductors. “A hacker can potentially take control of the car, through exploitation of a weakness, and could cause the vehicle to refuse to start, or to crash, or it could exploit the privacy of the driver, and [their] data, including financial information.” However, a shift in the approach to security is under way, he says. “There is now more focus on the basics – applying good fundamental security to the critical areas including the interfaces that connect the vehicle to the external world; gateways, which separate safety critical systems from other car and infotainment systems; and networks that provide secure communication between control units – there can be over 150 in an autonomous vehicle.” In addition, major advances to security include “over-the-air” software updates that can patch vulnerabilities seamlessly in real time, Birnie says. Will I still need insurance (as a vehicle owner)? “Yes,” says Niall Edwards, partner at international law firm Kennedys. Fully autonomous vehicles are likely to be considered a different class of vehicle that requires additional compulsory insurance cover, he says. “The most likely product will be a package underwritten by a motor insurer that the manufacturer offers at the point of purchase, use or hire.” One possibility is that new vehicles fitted with advanced-driver technology will automatically come with a form of product liability and extended cover provided by the manufacturer. The good news, says Allianz UK’s Glen Clarke, is that because semi- and fully autonomous cars are expected to lead to a fall in accidents, we are likely to see a drop in premiums. “The price you pay will be much more influenced by the technical capabilities of the car as opposed to estimations of the riskiness of the driver.” How will the law adapt to autonomous vehicles? Currently, UK law anticipates the existence of a “driver” who is in control of the vehicle at all times, says Rachel Moore, also a partner at Kennedys. Regulations on vehicle use will therefore need to be revised to allow the use of automotive technology without a driver and – crucially – to ensure that the technology is maintained correctly. To start with, Moore continues, the Road Traffic Act (1988) is likely to be amended to include product liability for automated vehicles. “Other changes will be required, including to the Highway Code and international regulations on vehicle use. We may also see changes to the MOT to check roadworthiness.” Do AVs reduce the risks for pedestrians and cyclists? We’re only at the start of understanding how pedestrians and cyclists will interact with a vehicle that doesn’t have a human driver at the controls, says Reed. “Whether a pedestrian will be able to detect whether a car is automated or not, and adapt their behaviour accordingly, we still don’t know.” Lang argues that there’s a risk, initially at least, that pedestrians and cyclists may try to “test” AVs to see how they react. “In Singapore, they are currently testing autonomous vehicles in public parks and they tell us that the large majority of incidents [near misses] are not due to the vehicles malfunctioning, but to people jumping in front of the cars to test whether they stop in time.” Mixed traffic carries risk, he continues, just as there may be risks associated with behavioural patterns we cannot foresee. “As with any new technology, there will be failures and even fatalities, but the overall benefits – in terms of [estimated] 90% fewer accidents, 40% less congestion, up to 80% less emissions, and 50% of parking space saved – are so substantial that the technological development will prevail.” What other autonomous vehicles might we see on our roads? From vertical take-off and landing “flying car” prototypes to “sidewalk robots” and delivery drones, by 2030 our roads and pavements may have begun to resemble a scene from Blade Runner. “Driverless trucks are already being tested around the world, with Daimler testing on public roads in the US and Germany in 2016,” says Boland. Bosch meanwhile, envisages that a truck will become “a 40-tonne smart device on wheels” by 2025. “[The trucks] will receive all the data they need in real time from the Bosch IoT cloud, including information on the route, congestion, detours, and unloading facilities at the destination,” says Hoffmann. “This will allow the driver to get on with other things [such as processing shipping documents], while the truck drives itself.” Car v tech giants: who will win? Today’s AV sector is a crowded space. It’s estimated that at least 33 tech and auto corporations, ranging from Apple to Chinese bus manufacturer Yutong – via the likes of Audi, BMW, Google, Honda, Intel, Tesla, Uber and Volkswagen – are currently developing AV technology. With the $2tn global car industry in the throes of transformation due to a perfect storm of digitisation, AI/automation and changes in consumer behaviour – such as the rise of on-demand taxi services in urban centres – it’s not difficult to see why car manufacturers, tech companies and investors are scrambling for territory, fearful of being left out. “All this change creates both risk and opportunity for incumbents,” says GP Bullhound’s Sven Raeymaekers. So who does he see coming out on top? “Some pundits claim that since the car industry has historically only focused on the internal combustion engine and shell design, it has no chance against the tsunami of software moving towards their shores. But so many industries have already suffered from this onslaught, and the automakers have no plans to see history repeat itself,” he says. “Across the board, major players – Renault-Nissan, Ford, BMW, Daimler and GM, to name a few - are investing in and developing their own technologies, hiring talent or acquiring startups. From GM investing $500m in Lyft to the creation of Ford Smart Mobility, every single big manufacturer is looking to innovate and adapt.” Besides, any notion of a race between tech firms and traditional car makers is a false perception, argues Accenture’s Luca Mentuccia. He predicts a surge of strategic cooperation instead. “We will see even more cross-industry partnerships for autonomous driving in the future in which car makers and a large range of tech firms from chipmakers to big data specialists, telcos and mobility platforms will work together.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Over the next decade, accelerating autonomous driving technology, including advances in artificial intelligence, sensors, cameras, radar and data analytics, are set to transform not only how we drive (or, indeed, are driven), but the notion of car ownership itself. “Autonomous driving has become the next major battlefield for the car industry,” says Luca Mentuccia, automotive global MD at Accenture. The six levels of automation, defined under international standards by the Society of Automotive Engineers, range from “no automation” to “full automation”, explains Sven Raeymaekers, of tech investment banker GP Bullhound. “If you look at the most recent predictions, the majority of car manufacturers estimate the first highly to fully automated vehicles [AVs] will hit the market between 2020-2025,” he says.  When they do, regulatory approval permitting, their most significant impact is likely to be in the area of urban mobility. “AVs will enable new service configurations where consumers are delivered door to door with virtually no stops in a comfortable vehicle with just one to three other passengers,” says Stan Boland, CEO of FiveAI, which builds AI-driven software for AVs and is one of the companies testing autonomous vehicles on UK roads in 2017, alongside major manufacturers including Volvo and Ford.  Such services will be safer, reduce pollution and congestion, and will also bring about a paradigm shift in personal vehicle ownership rates, which are likely to decline steeply, he says. A recent survey of car manufacturing executives by KPMG similarly revealed that 59% of industry bosses believe that more than half of all car owners today will no longer want to own a car by 2025. So how exactly will we be getting about by the end of the next decade? Will automation really “solve” crashes, and what other sorts of AVs are we likely to see on our roads? The Observer asked a panel of experts about the likely realities and practicalities of driving in the year 2030. Will I be a driver or a passenger? You’ll have a choice, says Dr Nick Reed, academy director at transport consultancy TRL. “If you want to drive an MG and enjoy that, you’ll be able to. Or if you want to prepare for a business meeting during your two-hour journey, you’ll be able to do that too. Automation systems give us choices.” Nikolaus Lang, of the Boston Consulting Group’s Centre for Digital in Automotive, argues it will depend on the vehicle you’re in. “By 2030, you’ll be a ‘controlling passenger’ in your private self-driving car and you’ll be a ‘complete passenger’ in a robo-taxi.” Will it still make sense to own a car or will I rent one (on demand)? Instead of today’s car ownership model, we are far more likely to rely on “mobility as a service” by 2030, says Boland. “Imagine an Uber-like service you can summon at the touch of a button, but without a driver. Renting is not necessarily the right word – consumers will buy a service like using an Uber today, but with a wider range of vehicle configurations to suit different types of travel – family outings, long-distance sleeper travel, or shared commutes.” However, Lang points out that there’s a clear difference between a young urban population, for whom owning cars makes little sense, and the millions of suburbanites with families, who will probably still opt to own. Will there still be crashes? A 2008 survey by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that human error is the critical reason for 93% of crashes, says Boland. “When you eliminate human error, our roads become dramatically safer: no more drink-driving, phone calls at the wheel, carelessness, inattention or plain bad driving. Clearly there needs to be adequate industry testing to ensure that AVs are safe for all other road users, but we can look forward to far safer roads as human drivers become a thing of the past.” Will all cars be electric? “I don’t think all of them will be electric by 2030,” says Danny Shapiro, senior director at NVIDIA, whose AI computer platform powers the supercomputer in Tesla vehicles. “Virtually every startup is looking at electric, and you have ever greater electric and hybrid focus from German, Japanese and US [manufacturers]. But at the same time there’s still a huge oil infrastructure. And, at least for the next four years, there’s a very pro-oil administration in the US.” Yet Bosch is developing a lithium iron solid state battery that they hope will double the range of electric vehicles at half the cost of today’s batteries, which Steffen Hoffmann, the corporation’s UK president, believes will increase take-up among those who live in the suburbs and beyond. “We have a projection that by 2025, globally 15% of vehicles are going to have an electric component, whether that’s a pure electric vehicle, a plug-in hybrid or full hybrid,” he says. “For western Europe, that percentage would obviously be higher.” Will there still be driving tests? “Yes,” says Reed. “But they might be very different, with different layers. Just as you have an automatic and a manual gearbox test today, there might be an automated driving test which may only entitle you to ‘drive’ a certain type of vehicle that has certain automation systems, rather than any vehicle. Drivers will need to understand how to operate those systems – so there may also be different skills required as part of the test.” Will there be less gridlock? “With a heterogeneous mix of vehicle configurations and on-demand service delivery, autonomous vehicles will enable a higher density of passengers per road mile,” says Boland. “Also, because AVs can travel safely closer together, and with less braking and accelerating than human drivers, traffic will flow more smoothly and congestion will decrease. On motorways more vehicles will be able to fit safely into the same length of road, effectively increasing capacity”. Shapiro adds that another key cause of congestion is accidents. “Even if [the accident] isn’t blocking lanes, the traffic slows down to see what’s going on. So self-driving cars will not only enable more efficient flow, but they’ll remove the accident side of congestion [as there will be fewer of them].” Will automated vehicles be vulnerable to hackers? By definition, a driverless car has more control units, computing power, lines of code, and wireless connections with the outside world than a regular car today, which is why it’s more vulnerable to hackers, explains Andy Birnie, systems engineering manager at NXP Semiconductors. “A hacker can potentially take control of the car, through exploitation of a weakness, and could cause the vehicle to refuse to start, or to crash, or it could exploit the privacy of the driver, and [their] data, including financial information.” However, a shift in the approach to security is under way, he says. “There is now more focus on the basics – applying good fundamental security to the critical areas including the interfaces that connect the vehicle to the external world; gateways, which separate safety critical systems from other car and infotainment systems; and networks that provide secure communication between control units – there can be over 150 in an autonomous vehicle.” In addition, major advances to security include “over-the-air” software updates that can patch vulnerabilities seamlessly in real time, Birnie says. Will I still need insurance (as a vehicle owner)? “Yes,” says Niall Edwards, partner at international law firm Kennedys. Fully autonomous vehicles are likely to be considered a different class of vehicle that requires additional compulsory insurance cover, he says. “The most likely product will be a package underwritten by a motor insurer that the manufacturer offers at the point of purchase, use or hire.” One possibility is that new vehicles fitted with advanced-driver technology will automatically come with a form of product liability and extended cover provided by the manufacturer. The good news, says Allianz UK’s Glen Clarke, is that because semi- and fully autonomous cars are expected to lead to a fall in accidents, we are likely to see a drop in premiums. “The price you pay will be much more influenced by the technical capabilities of the car as opposed to estimations of the riskiness of the driver.” How will the law adapt to autonomous vehicles? Currently, UK law anticipates the existence of a “driver” who is in control of the vehicle at all times, says Rachel Moore, also a partner at Kennedys. Regulations on vehicle use will therefore need to be revised to allow the use of automotive technology without a driver and – crucially – to ensure that the technology is maintained correctly. To start with, Moore continues, the Road Traffic Act (1988) is likely to be amended to include product liability for automated vehicles. “Other changes will be required, including to the Highway Code and international regulations on vehicle use. We may also see changes to the MOT to check roadworthiness.” Do AVs reduce the risks for pedestrians and cyclists? We’re only at the start of understanding how pedestrians and cyclists will interact with a vehicle that doesn’t have a human driver at the controls, says Reed. “Whether a pedestrian will be able to detect whether a car is automated or not, and adapt their behaviour accordingly, we still don’t know.” Lang argues that there’s a risk, initially at least, that pedestrians and cyclists may try to “test” AVs to see how they react. “In Singapore, they are currently testing autonomous vehicles in public parks and they tell us that the large majority of incidents [near misses] are not due to the vehicles malfunctioning, but to people jumping in front of the cars to test whether they stop in time.” Mixed traffic carries risk, he continues, just as there may be risks associated with behavioural patterns we cannot foresee. “As with any new technology, there will be failures and even fatalities, but the overall benefits – in terms of [estimated] 90% fewer accidents, 40% less congestion, up to 80% less emissions, and 50% of parking space saved – are so substantial that the technological development will prevail.” What other autonomous vehicles might we see on our roads? From vertical take-off and landing “flying car” prototypes to “sidewalk robots” and delivery drones, by 2030 our roads and pavements may have begun to resemble a scene from Blade Runner. “Driverless trucks are already being tested around the world, with Daimler testing on public roads in the US and Germany in 2016,” says Boland. Bosch meanwhile, envisages that a truck will become “a 40-tonne smart device on wheels” by 2025. “[The trucks] will receive all the data they need in real time from the Bosch IoT cloud, including information on the route, congestion, detours, and unloading facilities at the destination,” says Hoffmann. “This will allow the driver to get on with other things [such as processing shipping documents], while the truck drives itself.” Car v tech giants: who will win? Today’s AV sector is a crowded space. It’s estimated that at least 33 tech and auto corporations, ranging from Apple to Chinese bus manufacturer Yutong – via the likes of Audi, BMW, Google, Honda, Intel, Tesla, Uber and Volkswagen – are currently developing AV technology. With the $2tn global car industry in the throes of transformation due to a perfect storm of digitisation, AI/automation and changes in consumer behaviour – such as the rise of on-demand taxi services in urban centres – it’s not difficult to see why car manufacturers, tech companies and investors are scrambling for territory, fearful of being left out. “All this change creates both risk and opportunity for incumbents,” says GP Bullhound’s Sven Raeymaekers. So who does he see coming out on top? “Some pundits claim that since the car industry has historically only focused on the internal combustion engine and shell design, it has no chance against the tsunami of software moving towards their shores. But so many industries have already suffered from this onslaught, and the automakers have no plans to see history repeat itself,” he says. “Across the board, major players – Renault-Nissan, Ford, BMW, Daimler and GM, to name a few - are investing in and developing their own technologies, hiring talent or acquiring startups. From GM investing $500m in Lyft to the creation of Ford Smart Mobility, every single big manufacturer is looking to innovate and adapt.” Besides, any notion of a race between tech firms and traditional car makers is a false perception, argues Accenture’s Luca Mentuccia. He predicts a surge of strategic cooperation instead. “We will see even more cross-industry partnerships for autonomous driving in the future in which car makers and a large range of tech firms from chipmakers to big data specialists, telcos and mobility platforms will work together.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!
