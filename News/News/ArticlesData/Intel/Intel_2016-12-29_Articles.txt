The first set of products with Kaby Lake-U were ultrabooks. However, ultra-compact form-factor (UCFF) PCs were not long behind. There are already three vendors in the market with Kaby Lake UCFF PCs - ASRock (Beebox-S), GIGABYTE (BRIX), and MSI (Cubi 2). MSI was the first to launch KBL-U UCFF PCs in the North American market under the Cubi 2 tag. This review focuses on the build and performance of the Cubi2-005B - the KBL-U UCFF PC from MSI featuring the Core i7-7500U. Introduction Ultra-compact form factor (UCFF) PCs have become quite popular after Intel introduced the NUCs. They have become powerful enough to be the primary computing platform for many households. In addition to the Intel NUCs, many system vendors have come up with their own approach to UCFF PCs. These include ASRock (with the Beebox series), ECS (LIVA), GIGABYTE (BRIX), and MSI (Cubi) amongst others. Kaby Lake-U, as per Intel's claims, is fabricated on a much more mature 14nm process and brings about a 11% improvement in performance for the same power consumption. The GPU's media engine has also been updated. On the whole, the performance improvements look good for UCFF PCs - particularly for those upgrading from the first or second-generation systems. MSI's take on the UCFF PC market with the Cubi an Cubi 2 is interesting from two perspectives - Rather than having separate SKUs for units with / without support for 2.5" drives (like the GIGABYTE BRIX) or compromising on the thickness of the system to include 2.5" drives (like the ASRock Beebox), MSI allows for interchangeable bottom plates. The default one doesn't come with 2.5" drive support and results in a system thickness of 3.7 cm (while the extension bay / thicker bottom plate version makes the system 4.9 cm thick). The extension bay is also included with the Cubi 2 package. The second aspect is that MSI is targeting the Cubi 2 towards effectiveness for the average consumer. While a M.2 NVMe SSD can do wonders in terms of performance, the reality is that the high-performance versions come in the M.2 2280 form-factor. Rather than sacrificing the size of the unit, MSI has decided only to have a M.2 2242 slot in the PC. Even though it is connected to the PCIe lanes from the PCH, we believe it is likely that consumers will be using M.2 2242 SATA SSDs in that slot, or, end up using a 2.5" drive with the extension bay. Similar to other UCFF PCs in the market, the Cubi 2 also comes in a version without memory or storage. The Cubi 2 can take up to two DDR4 SO-DIMMs (operating at 2133 MHz) and a 2.5" drive and/or a M.2 2242 SATA / PCIe SSD. We completed the hardware build to result in the following specifications for our MSI Cubi2-005B review configuration. MSI Cubi2-005B Specifications Processor Intel Core i7-7500U Kaby Lake, 2C/4T, 2.7 GHz (up to 3.5 GHz), 14nm PLUS, 4MB L2, 15W TDP Memory Micron 16ATF1G64HZ-2G1A2 DDR4 15-15-15-36 @ 2133 MHz 2x8 GB Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Disk Drive(s) Crucial MX200 CT500MX200SSD1 (500 GB; 2.5in SATA 6Gb/s; 16nm; MLC) Networking Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3168 (1x1 802.11ac - 433 Mbps) 1x Realtek RTL8168 Gigabit LAN Display 1x mini-Display Port 1.2 (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz) 1x HDMI 1.4b (4096x2160 @ 24 Hz) Audio 3.5mm Headphone Jack, 3.5mm Microphone Jack Capable of 5.1/7.1 digital output with HD audio bitstreaming (HDMI) Miscellaneous I/O Ports 3x USB 3.0 (Type-A) 1x USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Type-C) Operating System Retail unit is barebones, but we installed Windows 10 Pro x64 Pricing $499 (barebones) / $787 (as configured) Full Specifications MSI Cubi2-005BUS Specifications Buy MSI Cubi2-005B on Amazon.com The MSI Cubi2-005B kit doesn't come with any pre-installed OS, but does come with a CD containing the drivers. In any case, we ended up installing the latest drivers downloaded off the component vendors' product support page. In addition to the main unit, the other components of the package include a 65 W (19V @ 3.42A) adapter, a US power cord, a VESA mount (along with the necessary screws), a 2.5" drive extension bay, SATA data and power cables, user's manual and a quick-start guide. The gallery below takes us around the various chassis features.

You mean Broadwell here instead of Kaby Lake, don't you? Reply ganeshts - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link bad typo, with the link in it correctly linking to the Q3 2016 article. It has been fixed. Reply Voldenuit - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link No tear down? Cooling system? System layout? Noise measurements? Reply Great_Scott - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link It doesn't really matter anyways. This kind of system is a waste of time: laptops have greater functionality for less price, and the same components. The U-series doesn't distinguish between the i5 and i7 beyond clock speeds. You can go to any site online and get a U-series laptop for ~$400 US that also includes RAM and Storage. Reply barleyguy - Saturday, December 31, 2016 - link For an HTPC, a NUC or UCFF is a lot more convenient than a laptop. They generally have less fan noise, fit in less space, and boot up with the TV (or projector) as the primary monitor. (I'm typing this on a Zotac Z-Box in my living room.) That said, I'm really skeptical of the U-series processors in general. My Z-Box has an i5-4200u, and I've had some issues with throttling under load. Hopefully they've improved from the 4200u to the 7500u. Reply kmmatney - Monday, January 02, 2017 - link and the laptop will have an OS as well... Reply ganeshts - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link You guys are hard to please. In any case, this is a bog standard NUC, nothing special about it. Cooling system - all that matters is effectiveness, and I hope readers agree when I say that we have the most comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of the cooling solution of mini-PCs in the review circuit. Look at the graphs in the 'Power Consumption and Thermal Performance' section. Noise measurement - we only do subjective eval in these reviews. Providing noise numbers for these types of PCs (i.e, non gaming mini-PCs) is pretty much useless because the noise floor is too high and these types of PCs are too quiet in our evaluation setup. Creating a noise measurement lab is not worth the investment for the number of PC reviews that I do per year. You can find dedicated guys like SPCR ( Silent PC Review - http://www.silentpcreview.com/ ) who fill that market niche with excellent reviews and articles. (I would imagine even they would not find the Cubi 2 and other similar PCs interesting enough to do noise measurements) Reply voicequal - Saturday, December 31, 2016 - link I just spent 20 mins looking at the power & thermal charts. It's fascinating to see how the CPU & GPU clock respond to the shared 15W power and thermal budget of the integrated package. Time 1800-3600 shows how the GPU steals performance from the CPU, resulting in the CPU clock dropping to 1.2 GHz, far below the Core i7-7500U spec of 2.7 GHz. I've always thought it misleading to claim this a 15W 2.7GHz CPU, when this is only the case if GPU utilization is negligible. Reply Robalov - Saturday, December 31, 2016 - link If it's same as cubi 1, the heat sink fan mounts are soldered onto the pcb. They're weak and fall off. The system will barely last to warranty and is difficult to repair. Reply Kakti - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link "We didn't evaluate 4K Netflix streaming on this PC because there is no HDCP 2.2 support." Intel really dropped the ball in regards to their Y and U chips not being able to decode HDCP 2.2 streams. Do we know if the 200-series chipset for LGA 1151 Kaby Lake processors will include native HDCP 2.2 support, or will it be the same story there?

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll focus on 3-4 broad areas of interest. We will work with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Products e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics Emerging Technologies e.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access People e.g. teamwork & collaboration; community-building; communications Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from general “TED”-like inspirational talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: Currently a senior advisor to Google, from 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge. Host: Larissa Shapiro Questions: In advance submit questions here During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #mozSS Previous Speakers November 16: Failure: The Hard Part about Innovation, with Ashley Good, Fail Forward Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, November 16 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Failure: The Hard Part about Innovation When you start a new job or project, you envision exciting things you and your team will accomplish together. When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014. Mozillian Host: Aurelia Moser Presentation deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS September 1: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 1 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Hashtag: #mozSS July 20, 2016: The Invention Cycle with Tina Seelig, Stanford University Location: Mozilla MV + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, July 20 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Invention Cycle: Going From Inspiration to Implementation Are you stuck on where to go with your product and need an infusion of creativity? Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015). She’s been honored to receive significant recognition of her work, including the Gordon Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the National Olympus Innovation Award, the SVForum Visionary Award, and several university teaching awards.

Hashtag: #mozSS Deck materials also in this post May 26, 2016: Twelve Technology Forces Shaping the Next 30 Years with Kevin Kelly, Wired Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 26 @ Mozilla SF - 10:30am PT / 1:30pm ET / 6:30pm UTC Topic: Twelve Technology Forces Shaping the Next 30 Years Much of what will happen in the next thirty years is inevitable, driven by technological trends already in motion. Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Hashtag: #mozSS #theinevitable April 27, 2016: When Change is the Only Constant, with Kirsten Wolberg, PayPal Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, April 27 @ Mozilla SF - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: When Change is the Only Constant, Org Structure Doesn’t Matter While it may be true in tech that “change is the only constant,” some changes are bigger than others. Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split.

Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | December 30, 2016 -- 19:04 GMT (11:04 PST) | Topic: Innovation Getty Images/iStockphoto With 2016 drawing to a close, here is a look at some of the things -- tech, as well as a number of industry metrics -- that you should be keeping an eye on over the coming year. CES thoughts What's Hot on ZDNet The future of robotics: 10 predictions for 2017 and beyond White House AI report calls for 'aggressive' policies to help workers Encryption backdoors are against US national interest, say lawmakers DIY-IT: Top 10 how-to articles of 2016 Before I begin, I want to mention the first big tech shindig of 2017, which will be CES. I pay very little attention to CES these days, not because there isn't some interesting stuff demonstrated there, but because it's a pretty poor indicator of what's going to be important throughout the year. Also, a lot of stuff is unveiled at CES that never seems to see light of day, so it's easy to get distracted by stuff that you'll never see again. With that out of the way, here's what I think you should be paying attention to over the coming year. iPhone 8 (or whatever it will end up being called) The iPhone 8 will be Apple's tenth-anniversary smartphone, and it's expected to offer a big sales hurrah before sales start going weak again. How Apple approaches and handles this launch -- and whether it can create a situation where supply meets demand, especially during the first few weeks -- will be critical. PC sales Will there be a rebound in sales occur as the long-awaited upgrade cycle kicks in, or has the rot set in to such a point that the recovery is never going to happen? Can new form factors shift the needle in any meaningful way? Intel vs. AMD AMD has, for perhaps the first time in a couple of decades, some interesting silicon that could give the company an edge over Intel. But it remains to be seen whether AMD's Ryzen has what it takes in the real world to gain the edge over Intel's Kaby Lake. Will there be an iPhone SE 2? Will Apple update the low-cost 4-inch iPhone during 2017, or will it allow it to mature for another year or so in the hopes of preventing it from cannibalizing sales of higher-priced iPhones? This will be an interesting test of Apple's courage. What about a "Made in the US" iPhone? President-elect Donald Trump pledged that he would "get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China," and now he's put this to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Problem is, not only would it be hugely complex to move the manufacturing operating to the US, but could add significantly to the cost. iPad Will the iPad Air and iPad mini lineup get a refresh, or is the iPad Pro the way forward now? Also, can Apple do anything to make sales pull up from their decline or is iPad headed for irrelevance? iPad sales are already at their lowest since 2011, so things aren't looking good. iMac and Mac Pro Will they get a long-overdue refresh, or is Apple going to allow them to wither on the vine? Apple's high-performance Mac Pro is now three years old, which in tech terms is eons. Are these just low-selling distractions from the iPhone? Surface Studio This was a big, bold, innovative move from Microsoft, so it will be interesting to see whether we get any real sales data, and whether there will be a refresh towards the end of the year. Can Microsoft bring more innovation to the table? Surface Phone Can Microsoft get back into the smartphone game, and this time make it work, or is it too late to enter the fray given the size of Android and iOS? Hardware hits such as the Surface Studio and Surface Book show Microsoft can innovate, and "Windows 10 on Qualcomm" makes it clear that Redmond sees unification of desktop, tablet, and smartphone operating systems is the way forward. But the market is a fickle one, and Apple and the Android gang currently have the sales channels pretty much to themselves. Can Samsung put the Galaxy Note 7 behind them? The Galaxy Note 7 fires were a huge blow for Samsung. It might be the Android maker that's pulling in the most dollars, but in an attempt to make the Note 7 as thin as possible, the company pushed the envelope of what was possible to do safely. Smartglasses Can Apple make a success of smartglasses when Google failed? The failure -- at least consumer failure -- of Google's Glass project will no doubt be at the forefront of Apple's mind if it's planning to venture into this area. Will all the Android players survive? There's almost no money in making Android handsets. While low prices and razor-thin margins are good for consumers, it's bad for the hardware makers. 2017 could see players -- especially the ones that are losing money -- exit the game. So long, 3.5mm headphone jack Now that Apple has dropped the headphone jack from the iPhone, expect others to follow suit in 2017.

News and Press Release Distribution, Since 1995 Deliver Your News to the World Sign In Create a Free Account Home News How We Work Compare Services FAQ All WebPost WebPost PPC WebRelease Targeted Media Wire Service Intel Experts Share Insights on Tech Trends for 2017 and Beyond WEBWIRE – Thursday, December 29, 2016 Intel is inventing foundational technologies for amazing new experiences from merged reality to 5G communications and from autonomous driving to artificial intelligence. As 2016 draws to a close, we asked five Intel leaders, many new to the company, for their thoughts on these tech trends that will shape the future of Intel and our industry. Here are some of their insights: In 2017, AI-powered systems will go from exploration to adoption in the enterprise The digitization of nearly everything has produced mountains of data. More data than human beings can consume, synthesize and put to use. But, with artificial intelligence technologies (cognitive computing and deep learning, as examples), were gaining the ability to more effectively understand, interpret and act on all that information. Gayle Sheppard, who joined Intel with the acquisition of cognitive computing company Saffron Technology, believes 2017 will be the year that AI-enabled decision systems move from exploration to enterprise adoption across a variety of industries. Saffron unifies what Sheppard calls more chaotic, unstructured data with manicured enterprise data to surface insights from patterns impossible to see before. This capability helps industries such as financial services improve the detection and prevention of fraud or helps retailers individualize product recommendations to achieve better outcomes for their customers. Artificial intelligence, she said, will ultimately give all of us intelligent assistants for our professional and personal lives. With AI we have the opportunity to move beyond traditional thinking about decision-support systems to build systems that see, hear, understand and collaborate with us to help make decisions faster, more relevant and better informed.   Gayle Sheppard, general manager of Saffron Technology 3-D collaboration will emerge as a driving use case for AR/VR Today, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) are most commonly associated with gaming or entertainment. While these uses will undoubtedly gain in popularity, another potential killer app for AR and VR has more in common with the rise of spreadsheets, word processing and e-mail. According to Remi El-Ouazzane, chief executive of Movidius, a company Intel acquired in 2016, workplace collaboration is likely to propel the adoption of augmented reality (or what Intel calls merged reality). Companies today are bound by two-dimensional collaboration, El-Ouazzane said. But, with merged reality, you immerse yourself in an environment where, for example, engineers at different sites around the world could walk around an engine, working together as if physically in the same place at the same time. To get us there, computers will need to process visuals with the speed and accuracy of the human eye. Thats where Movidius comes in. The company was founded with the bold vision of giving sight to machines. Its leading vision processing unit combined with Intel® RealSense depth-sensing technology is a powerful combination toward realizing that vision. In merged reality, we are confronting two worlds, the actual world we can see with our eyes and a computer-generated world. The display where those synthetic elements are rendered needs to be good enough for your brain to accept them as being real, said El-Ouazzane. Augmented reality is nothing less than tricking the brain to believe that synthetic elements and real elements can coexist.  Remi El-Ouazzane, chief executive of Movidius, an Intel company Function will overtake form in automotive Intel is dedicated to transforming the future of driving and designing the next generation of advanced driver assist systems and autonomous driving solutions. Intels General Manager of the Automated Driving Solutions Division, Kathy Winter, joined Intel from Delphi where, in 2015, she was credited with achieving the first cross-country drive by an autonomous vehicle. In 2017, she expects more autonomous cars on the road, gathering data to pave the way for the broad adoption of safe and reliable autonomous vehicles. Winter says the technology industry is accelerating the pace of innovation in the automotive industry, and changing how we value cars. What youre seeing is a change in the industry with less focus on what vehicles look like and more focus on what can they do.  Kathy Winter, Intel vice president; general manager, Automated Driving Solutions Division With function trumping form, the industry is ripe for the many foundational computing and communications technologies Intel offers. Another Intel business unit with compelling technology for the future of transportation is Intels Programmable Solutions Group (PSG), formerly Altera. PSG General Manager Dan McNamara says that because field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can be customized and reprogrammed on the fly, they are a great fit for many of the specialized computing tasks automated driving requires. In 2017, he expects to begin shipping a new automotive-grade Arria 10 FPGA that offers the highest performance processing by an FPGA at 20nm and will give automakers a head start on their ADAS systems. The autonomous driving revolution provides not only an increase in driver and pedestrian safety, but an interactive experience for the driver that will continue to evolve. We are focused on providing automakers with scalable technology to meet their customers needs.  Dan McNamara, Intel vice president; general manager, PSG In 2017, 5G prototypes start to take shape Unlocking the true potential of automated driving requires a reliable, robust and pervasive wireless network. These requirements are the basis of 5G networks, which are expected to become available starting in 2020, though trials are already underway. Rob Topol, General Manager of 5G business and technology within Intels Communications and Devices Group, expects these 5G trials will pick up steam in 2017. One big advancement will be the prototype devices used for testing. You will see us move from testing with larger trial platforms, to using more mobile and segment-specific form factors, Topol said. While 5G form factors will, ultimately, be limitless, thats a sure sign of progress. Unlike 4G wireless, which largely focused on making smartphones faster, industry leaders look to 5G to provide the higher data rates (1-20 Gbps), lower latency and capacity needed for the blossoming Internet of Things (IoT), new service models and immersive new experiences.

By: Steven Bassiri | Touchscreen Laptops in Laptops | Posted: 4 days, 10 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 94%Manufacturer: Lenovo Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Physical Overview] Page 3 [Physical Overview Continued] Page 4 [Software and BIOS] Page 5 [System Performance Benchmarks] Page 6 [System IO and Battery Performance] Page 7 [Thermal Performance] Page 8 [What's Hot, What's Not & Final Thoughts] Introduction     Just like the Dell XPS 13 I reviewed a week ago, the Lenovo Yoga 910 is a 13-inch laptop equipped with the latest Intel mobile processor series; Kaby Lake. Both devices use the same i7-7500U CPU, but apart from that, they are much different devices. The latest Intel microarchitecture brings to the table many enhancements in the CPU's integrated graphics core; one of those is much better 4K support. Lenovo offers the Yoga 910 with both 1080p and 4K panels and is one of the first notebooks capable of streaming Netflix in 4K. The Yoga 910 is also a 2-in-1 notebook, meaning it can act as a laptop, flip 360 degrees into tablet mode, or even sit up like a tent.     Kaby Lake might be up in the air when it comes to desktop level improvements, but in the mobile arena, it does bring in bigger integrated graphics muscle. If you suffer from FOBO (fear of better options), I would say it is safe to upgrade your mobile device now to one with an Intel 7th Generation Core processor. Luckily, almost all major vendors are on board with refreshed models, and competition is fierce.   Let's see what the Yoga 910 has to offer.     Specifications     Our configuration uses an i7-7500U, 8GB of DDR4, Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A 2x2 Wireless AC/BT 4.1, a 13.9" 1920x1080 300-nit IPS display, Samsung PM951 256GB M.2 NVMe SSD, 720p 1MP camera, fingerprint sensor, and a 78Wh battery. It weighs in at 3.04lbs and is 12.72x8.84x0.56" WxDxH. It has one of the biggest batteries in its class and a screen that is almost 14".   Regarding connectivity, you get one USB 3.0 type-A (normal) port, a USB 3.0 type-C port (that supports DisplayPort functionality), and a USB 2.0 type-C port that acts as a charging port. It doesn't have Thunderbolt 3 support, which should lower its price tag.     The i7-7500U has a base frequency of 2.7GHz with a 3.5GHz Turbo and operates at a 15W TDP which can be configured up or down by the vendor (Lenovo). While Dell used slightly faster DDR3 memory, Lenovo opted to use DDR4, which offers higher density and increased power savings.   The difference in performance should be negligible between the XPS 13 and Yoga 910 in real life, but benchmarks will show how the RAM choices, power limitations, and screen selection will affect scores and battery life.     Pricing   The Yoga 910 starts at $1,179.99; our configuration is the base configuration.

McIntyre December 29, 2016 7:35 am EST Print Email Tweet Most of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average have risen by double-digit percentages this year. Five are up over 30%. These double-digit stocks have helped push the Dow up almost 13% this year to 19,833. However, these five stocks will keep it from topping 20,000. Pfizer Even though the huge pharmaceutical company raised its dividend by 7%, it has disappointed investors with three quarters of poor guidance. In its most recently reported quarter, at $0.61 per share, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) missed Wall Street earnings estimates by two cents. Looking forward, management was more pessimistic than expected. Pfizer chopped its earnings forecast for the year from a range of $2.38 to $2.48 per share to a new range of $2.38 to $2.43. Whatever rally the Dow stages, Pfizer will be a boat anchor. Investors have no reason to believe its prospects will improve until early next year, if at all. Coca-Cola Coke’s old CEO is out and another Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) executive is in. That probably has little to do with Coke’s major problems, which will not be easy to solve. The first is a relentless drum beat from health experts about the dangers of sugar. As obesity and diabetes grow across most of the developed world, the old snacks are being replaced by healthier foods. In the emerging markets, slowing economies may undermine consumer spending. Coke has few large markets to turn to for growth. Intel This huge chip company restructured early this year. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) plans to fire 12,000 people, which is over 10% of its global workforce. More recently, it let go the employees from its wearable division. Intel has shrinking opportunities as it moves away from the low-end PC chip market and toward mobile and server markets, which are already awash in competition from firms that have been in those businesses for years. Note that chip maker and rival NVIDIA is among the S&P 500 stocks that are up the most so far this year. Apple Between fights with the European Union over billions of dollars in taxes and worry that the iPhone 7 will not have a holiday home run, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has reached a near-term cap. In addition, its offshore manufacturing has been a perfect target for President-elect Trump’s plans to punish American companies with workforces or supplier workforces that are largely overseas. There is also a growing body of evidence that Apple is struggling in China, largely because of competition from local mobile companies Huawei, OPPO and Xiaomi. CEO Tim Cook says Apple’s success hinges on sales in China. General Electric The world’s largest conglomerate has failed at a series of reinventions, one of the biggest of which is a recent plan to move away from the financial services business that nearly swamped General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) during the financial crisis. Management recently backed its guidance for the year ahead. And the company plans to sell its water business and part of its industrial division. GE’s aviation business worries investors as the market for large commercial planes slows. GE’s mining and drilling infrastructure operations have a limited future, unless oil exploration and commodities metals prices have a large bounce back.

In the first nine months of the year Israeli high-tech companies raised a total of $4 billion in 510 deals, 27 percent above the $3.15 billion raised in 491 deals in the first nine months of 2015, and only 7% below 2015’s record of $4.3 billion, data provided by IVC Research shows. Fifty-seven percent of these deals included at least one foreign VC investor. And while the IPO market stalled this year as fewer companies sought to raise money on the financial markets, merger and acquisition deals abounded, with investors buying Israeli companies and Israeli companies buying local and foreign companies. The election of Donald Trump has injected a degree of uncertainty into the market’s prospects, and there are some concerns that his policies may give “less tailwind to globalization,” making investments by US funds and corporations in foreign markets less attractive, according to PwC’s Liat Enzel Aviel. It is clear, however, that Israel’s tech industry will continue to be on the global map — both for local R&D activity and company acquisitions, to help multinationals stay ahead of the competitive game. A delegation of Chinese CEOs and businesspeople visiting Israel. November 22, 2016. (Courtesy) Chinese investors, who flocked to Israel in 2016 to snap up technologies and learn about the startup ecosystem, will continue to play a key role, with the pace of Chinese investment rising next year as well, said Haggai Ravid, CEO of Cukierman Investment House. And even if there are some new restrictions on money transfers and on the purchase price Chinese companies can pay, “it is unclear at this stage whether these regulations will slow the flow of investments.” Ran Senderovitz, Vice President, General Manager- Intel Israel Development Centers (Courtesy Intel) In the past four years alone Chinese investors have invested over $15 billion in Israeli companies, data provided by the Catalyst Fund Research 2016 shows. The cloud, increased connectivity, “smart” items, cybersecurity and self-driving cars will continue to dominate Israel’s high tech scene in 2017, said Ran Senderovitz, vice president, general manager at Intel Israel Development Centers. “We are moving fast to a world where everything connects — and a big amount of data is moving to the cloud,” he said in an email. “This trend of an uber-connected world — with all of its challenges and opportunities, is going to continue to positively disrupt the way we experience the world.” An Intel drone (Courtesy Intel) In this world where everything computes and connects, Israel can leverage three key talent pools, he said, to stay ahead of the game: its computing power, for example in Intel’s Israeli teams; its communication engineers, grown out of the universities and the army; and its proven prowess in cybersecurity. Cybersecurity and security, fintech, the Internet of Things (IoT) and automotive technologies will be among the trends that will lead Israeli industry going forward, Yoram Yaacovi, the general manager of Microsoft Israel R&D Center, recently told the IATI’s annual multinational R&D Centers conference in Tel Aviv. All of Microsoft’s cyber work is done in Israel, he said, with some 20% of global investments in the security sector flowing into the country. “Microsoft wants to invest in areas in which Israel is strong,” he said. As vehicles go high-tech, Israel, which has expertise in security, communications, machine learning and IoT, can be in the driver seat, enjoying “unparalleled dominance” in a field it played no part in until recently, Yaacovi said. There are around 150 startups and research groups active today in Israel in the automotive ecosystem, he said, up 100% from 2013. As vehicles go high-tech, Israel can be in the driver seat. Image of a self-driving car (Courtesy Intel) “Every industry is going through the digital transformation. It changes our economies, society and environment,” said Orna Kleinmann, managing director of SAP Labs Israel, in an email message. Three-dimensional printing will continue to disrupt manufacturing and product development; bots, smart personal assistants and augmented and virtual reality are changing the user experience; and cybersecurity threats are growing, leading to smarter solutions led by big data and machine learning advances, she said. Orna Kleinmann, managing director of SAP Labs Israel (Courtesy) “Israel is well positioned for these trends, taking the lead in security, machine learning and natural language processing,” she said, alongside its leadership in big data technologies and IoT. But greater digitalization also means greater challenges, leading to the need for more safety and collaborations. “How do we protect our digital lives, how do we mobilize the huge amount of data to the cloud?” asked Intel’s Senderovitz. “The markets are driving for economy of scale — and it is harder to be a single point of technology in this space — companies need to collaborate more than ever.” Start innovators young One of the greatest hurdles that faces Israel’s high tech scene is its shortage of skilled manpower, Senderovitz and SAP’s Kleinmann said. “We definitely see a challenge here. There is growing competition for top talent, and candidates have more demands — and more options,” said Kleinmann. “It is very clear that we are now lacking more qualified engineers — and with the flow of innovation and exploration taking place, this is going to impair the ability of Israel to grow its impact,” Senderovitz said. The government must improve science and math education, and help the universities increase their capacity. Yuval Matalon – eBay Israel General Manager (Courtesy) “If we don’t do a good job investing in the Z generation now and drive them to select technology majors and become our future innovators, researchers and engineers, we will find that the lack of talent will grow and hinder us from advancing as fast as we need to,” said Yuval Matalon, eBay Israel general manager. “There needs to be more investment in good teachers for the young grades who are able to encourage and drive kids that have a technical orientation to choose science and math as they grow, and motivate them to become entrepreneurs and innovators at a young age.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Israeli startups,  Intel Israel,  eBay,  Orna Kleinmann,  SAP Labs Israel,  PWC 2016 M&A report,  IVC Research Center,  Haggai Ravid,  Ran Senderovitz,  Cukierman & Co More in Israel Inside Immigration to Israel slumps as French influx tapers off Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Start-Up Israel Current top stories Israel’s Behalf uses algorithms to vet for credit By Shoshanna Solomon   Israeli biotechnology startup Nurami Medical raises NIS 2.5m By Luke Tress   US-Israel citizens in a tizz over new kids’ savings plan By Shoshanna Solomon   ‘Virtual breathalyzer’ lets you check if you’re over the limit By Times of Israel staff   Israel M&A activity surged 34% to $16.8b in 2016 — PwC By Shoshanna Solomon   Start-Up Israel Blogs January 2, 2017, 12:38 pm Israel Up and Down Two pieces of economic news came out of Israel recently showing both the ups and downs of......

The Top GNU News Of 2016: Hurd, Libreboot, GCC, GRUB Written by Michael Larabel in GNU on 29 December 2016 at 06:30 AM EST. Add A Comment Continuing in our various annual recaps this week as we end out 2016, here is a look at the most popular GNU/FSF news of the year. This year saw updates to GNU Hurd, the successful GCC 6 release, the GNU Compiler Collection 7 marching along for its release in a few months, the drama over Libreboot, Glibc updates, and over one hundred new GNU program updates/releases. Here's a look at the GNU happenings that topped 2016 by popularity on Phoronix: Libreboot Leaves The GNU, The Free Software Foundation Denounced It was only in May that Libreboot became an official GNU project but now this free software Coreboot downstream has parted ways. FSF, RMS Issue Statements Over Libreboot's Accusations Thursday night we wrote about Libreboot leaving the GNU and denouncing the GNU and FSF with rather harsh words. That thread generated more than 120 comments with differing views while now the Free Software Foundation issued a statement as well as Richard M Stallman. GCC Might Finally Drop The GNU Compiler For Java (GCJ) The GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) while made a lot of progress in its early years as a free software Java compiler, in recent years it's basically been in maintenance mode and might now be removed entirely from GCC. FSF Issues Fresh Statement Over ZFS On Linux With GPL Enforcement The Free Software Foundation has issued a fresh statement today concerning the recent ZFS file-system efforts on Linux, driven in large part by Canonical's plans for shipping ZFS support in Ubuntu 16.04. Developer Warns Of "Uncorrectable Freedom & Security Issues" For x86 A developer long involved in Coreboot/Libreboot development is trying to call attention to "uncorrectable freedom and security issues" on x86 platforms with nearly all post-2009 Intel systems and post-2013 AMD systems. FSF Issues Statement Against Intel's Management Engine (ME) The Free Software Foundation is a bit late to the party, but have finally come out publicly against Intel's Management Engine (ME). GNU Taler 0.0.0 Released: GNU Tries To Get Into Electronic Payments GNU Taler "v0.0.0" was announced today as the initial alpha release of this project aiming to be a free software electronic payment system but so far just fits alongside some of the other obscure or early-on GNU projects. GNU Hurd Is Working On Sound Support, Still Lacks 64-bit & Good USB Support One year ago was a status update on GNU Hurd where it was mentioned that GNU Hurd lacks 64-bit, audio, and USB support among other features for this micro-kernel free software project alternative to the Linux kernel. Sound support for Hurd is now in the works, but other features remain missing. GCC Compiler Finishes Nuking Java Support (GCJ) The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is finishing up the removal of Java / GCJ support ahead of next year's GCC 7 release. There Are Many Features Coming For GRUB 2.02 After writing yesterday about F2FS support being worked on for GRUB2, I decided to explore what features are coming for their GRUB 2.02 release. GNU Bash 4.4 Released With Wide Variety Of Changes GNU Bash 4.4 was released today with a wide variety of new features and changes. Libgcrypt 1.7 Adds New Algorithms, Performance Improvements Werner Koch announced the release today of libgcrypt 1.7, a major update to this general cryptographic library. GNU Rates GitHub & SourceForge With "F" Ratings The Free Software Foundation today announced their evaluations of major code repository-hosting services per the standards of the GNU Ethical Criteria for Code Repositories. The Free Software Foundation Is Trying To Figure Out Its Future The Free Software Foundation is more than 30 years old now and in charting a potential new course for the organization, they are looking for your help by filling out a survey. Gneural Network: GNU Gets Into Programmable Neural Networks The inaugural release of Gneural Network is now available, a new GNU Project to implement programmable neural networks. Libgcrypt/GnuPG Hit By Critical Security Problem Since 1998 Werner Koch today publicly announced that Libgcrypt and GnuPG have a "critical security problem" with all versions released prior to today and it affects all platforms. Recapping The New Features Of GCC 6: OpenMP 4.5, HSA, C++14, AMD Zen & More As GCC 6 should be officially released soon, here's a quick overview of the improvements and new features for this yearly free software compiler update. Libreboot, Coreboot Downstream, Becomes A GNU Project Libreboot, the downstream of Coreboot that doesn't permit any closed-source microcode/firmware blobs as part of the hardware initialization process for this alternative to proprietary BIOS/UEFI, has become an official GNU project. GNU C Library 2.24 Released Glibc 2.24 was released today as the newest version of the GNU C Library.

Now speculated for a possible Q1 2017 launch instead, Microsoft would have a couple more months to polish up and work out all the kinks in its upcoming enterprise-grade hybrid device before its release. Considering that the Surface Pro 5 will be entering the market a bit later than expected, it would need to have a number of notable features to make it truly stand out from the competition. Fortunately, this seems to be the case. The enterprise-grade hybrid device market has been quite saturated lately, especially with the launch of Apple’s most recent powerhouse machine, the revamped 2016 MacBook Pro, as well as the upcoming release of its own hybrid device, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2. From what could be determined from recent Surface Pro 5 rumors, however, it appears like Microsoft has a few aces up its sleeve. Here are some killer features that have the capability to make the Surface Pro 5 into the hybrid device to beat in 2017. Intel Kaby Lake Processor By moving the Surface Pro 5’s release date to Q1 2017, Microsoft has managed to ensure that its next enterprise-grade hybrid device would be equipped with Intel’s most advanced and most powerful processor on the market. Being Intel’s last 14nm chip, Kaby Lake processors provide a significant performance boost over its 6th generation Skylake chips, according to Tech Radar. So far, Apple’s most powerful and updated laptops, the MacBook Pro 2016, are equipped with 6th-gen Intel Skylake processors. This means that once the Surface Pro 5 enters the market, it would inherently have a more powerful chipset than one of its biggest rivals. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] The Surface line has managed to make a reputation for itself by being hybrid devices that offer uncompromising performance to its users. This is one of the main reasons why the Surface Pro 4, the Pro 5’s predecessor, became such a huge hit. While the machine was sleek and extremely portable, it was nonetheless a powerhouse device capable of performing desktop-grade tasks without any problems. With the Surface Pro 5, Microsoft could easily do this again, and if it does, the SP5 would surely be one of the devices to beat in 2017, at least in terms of raw power. eSIM Technology/LTE Connectivity One thing that the Surface line of devices has always lagged in is cellular connectivity. While Surface devices are extremely potent when connected to the internet, the fact that they are unable to take advantage of mobile data computing is something that has always been an Achilles Heel of the entire line. In fact, LTE connectivity is exactly where the Surface Pro line has lagged against its competition, such as the iPad Pro and even Google’s marginally successful Pixel C tablet. If rumors are to be believed, however, the Surface Pro 5 is set to change all of this. Popular German Microsoft blog Dr. Windows recently published a report stating that the Surface Pro 5 might be the tech giant’s fist hybrid device to feature eSIM technology. This means that for the first time since the Surface line was introduced, it would finally have a device that is capable of connecting to the internet on its own without being dependent on Wi-Fi or mobile hotspots. Unsurprisingly, the idea of the Surface Pro 5 having LTE connectivity has been welcomed very warmly by Microsoft fans, with many stating that cellular capabilities might very well be the upcoming device’s true killer feature. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] Free And Improved Accessories Hybrid devices such as the Surface Pro 5 are capable of optimum performance once linked to their respective accessories. For the Surface line, these come in the form of a dedicated Surface Pen and a keyboard case. With these accessories, the hybrid device becomes what it really is designed to be – a portable powerhouse machine capable of desktop-grade computing. While these accessories are great, however, the fact that they do not come with the initial product is something that is extremely inconvenient for users. Thus, with the Surface Pro 5, Microsoft would have the chance to fully address this issue. While unconfirmed, speculations have emerged over the last few months stating that the Surface Pro 5 might come with a higher price than its predecessors. Apart from this, rumors have also stated that that upcoming hybrid device would come with the Surface Pen and the keyboard cover out of the box. Doing so would raise the price of the Surface Pro 5 significantly, but considering what consumers would be getting, most users would likely deem the additional price for the device worth it. The Surface Pro 5 is Microsoft’s chance to establish itself as a leader in the enterprise-grade hybrid device market. Though the competition is fierce, the momentum the built up by the Surface Pro 4 and its predecessors has established a pretty good starting point for the upcoming power device. If Microsoft plays its cards just right and equips the hybrid machine with these rumored killer features, the Surface Pro 5 might very be hailed as the machine to beat in 2017, despite strong competition from rivals in the enterprise-grade mobile industry.

SEOUL: South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales, a decision the U.S. chipmaker said it will challenge in court. The fine, the largest ever levied in South Korea, marks the latest antitrust setback for Qualcomm’s most profitable business of licensing wireless patents to the mobile industry, at a time when the business is facing headwinds from a cooling smartphone market. Shares in Qualcomm fell 1.7 percent on Nasdaq. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled on Wednesday Qualcomm abused its dominant market position and forced handset makers to pay royalties for an unnecessarily broad set of patents as part of sales of its modem chips. Qualcomm also restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing of its standard essential patents related to modem chips to rival chipmakers such as Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and MediaTek Inc (2454.TW), the regulator said, hindering their sales and leaving their products vulnerable to lawsuits. The regulator ordered Qualcomm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers if requested — measures that would affect the U.S. firm’s dealings with major tech companies including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Intel, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] if upheld. The KFTC said it began its investigations into Qualcomm’s practices in 2014 following complaints from industry participants, but did not name specific companies. Foreign companies including Apple, Intel, MediaTek and Huawei expressed their views during the regulator’s deliberation process, KFTC Secretary General Shin Young-son told a media briefing in the country’s administrative capital. “We investigated and decided on these actions because Qualcomm’s actions limit overall competition,” Shin said, adding that the ruling was not about protecting domestic companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS). Qualcomm said it will file for an immediate stay of the corrective order and appeal the decision to the Seoul High Court. The firm will also appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it. “Qualcomm strongly disagrees with the KFTC’s announced decision,” it said in a statement. The decision in Seoul could mean lower costs for mobile phone makers and others in the tech supply chain who source Qualcomm chips, said a Taiwanese industry executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. IN REGULATORY CROSSHAIRS The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with AB Bernstein, said the fine itself was large but also said the KFTC’s orders for Qualcomm to alter its business practices have bigger future implications for the chipmaker. A major challenge for Qualcomm, he said, would emerge if the ruling forces the company to license patents for some of its chips to rivals such as Intel, which has been competing hard to land its modem chips in mobile phones. The dispute could take years to play out in South Korean courts, he said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won in 2009 for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips, which were then used in handsets made by Samsung and LG. Regulators in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm. The KFTC move could serve as a benchmark for some of them. “Korea’s decision will serve as an important reference point for us,” Chiu Yung-ho, vice chairman and spokesman for Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters. He gave no timeline on when Taiwan’s own year-long investigation would be concluded. Even if the Korean decision sets a precedent for regulatory proceedings in other countries, Qualcomm’s move to purchase chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) for $38 billion cuts its reliance on mobile phones, said Bill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones. NXP takes Qualcomm into the fast-growing market for automotive chips and puts it into the chip manufacturing business. “The strategy of diversifying the company’s business lines may prove to be the most prudent strategy of all,” Kreher said. “Since Qualcomm has moved its dependence from royalties, further decisions from other countries such as the U.S. in the future would not impact the company much, relative to in the past.” Shares of Qualcomm were down $1.16 to $66.09 in early afternoon trade.

Stock Market Today Stocks End Down, But Up For 2016; Apple, Microsoft Drag On Dow, Nasdaq The stock market fell Friday but ended the year with decent gains. Will the Dow hit 20,000 in the new year? (Richard B. Levine/Newscom) NANCY GONDO 12/30/2016 Reprints The stock market wrapped up 2016 with a whimper Friday, as the key indexes posted moderate losses. But for the year, they ended with decent gains after a post-election rally. The Nasdaq fell 0.9%, the S&P 500 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.3%. Volume was slightly higher on both the NYSE and Nasdaq, according to preliminary data, likely due to "window dressing" by fund managers as they adjust their portfolios. The Dow, up 13% for the year, closed well below 19,800 after recently flirting with the 20,000 level. The S&P 500 notched a 9.5% gain, while the Nasdaq advanced 7.5%. Gold miners, telecom and chip stocks led the downside in the stock market today. Banks, property REITs and insurance stocks were among the few industry groups that posted small gains. Tech stocks, among the biggest losers on the Dow, took a hit. Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) all shed about 1% each. Three of the four big-cap techs outperformed the Nasdaq for the year, but fell short of the Dow. Microsoft rose 12%, Cisco 11%, Apple 10% and Intel 5%. Microsoft remains just out of the 5% buy zone from a 58.80 flat-base buy point. Cisco is trying to hold support at its 50-day moving average as it works on a flat base; Intel has shaped a cup with handle with a 37.44 buy entry. Apple may form a handle as it continues to build the right side of a cup base. The buy point for now stands at 118.79. Though shares are still 14% below their May 2015 peak, they made an impressive run in the back half of 2016, rising 33% from a May 2016 low to an early October high. Apple dipped 0.8% in below-average volume Friday amid a Nikkei Asia Review report it's cutting back on iPhone production due to weak demand. In other news, Apple reportedly plans to start making iPhones for the Indian market at a Bangalore factory in April. In the IBD 50, graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) suffered the biggest loss, down more than 4% in heavy trade. Friday's action serves up the second big-volume drop in three sessions, a bearish sign. The stock plunged 7% Wednesday after reversing from a new intraday high. While it's due for a slowdown after a torrid 227% YTD gain, the heavy-volume reversals are alarming. SVB Financial (SIVB) was the biggest IBD 50 gainer for the day, picking up nearly 0.8% in tepid trade. The holding company for Silicon Valley Bank is far extended from a 112.93 buy point first cleared in October. Other financials with small gains included Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Goldman Sachs (GS) and East West Bancorp (EWBC).

That could trigger an even larger selloff, and there could be a sizable correction to start the year. Where does that leave Nvidia , Tesla and Netflix , three stocks that moved sharply earlier this week and have been in the news for a variety of reasons. Each company offers compelling reasons for investor to buy shares, but each also raises questions. Video provided by TheStreet Media: Brandpoint When Paulina Sliwinska, a fund manager at Baillie Gifford & Co., made the trip to Silicon Valley looking for the next big thing in technology, she found it — not in a hot startup run by a 23-year-old whiz kid just out of Stanford, but in a 23-year-old semiconductor maker that’s had the same chief executive officer since its founding. Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of graphics-chip maker Nvidia, has won over Sliwinska and many other investors this year with claims that his products, once confined to the niche of computer-gaming machines, are breaking out to become key components of nascent technologies from voice recognition to self-driving cars. “He’s so engaging,” said Sliwinska. “Even from this point the opportunities in front of it over the next 10 years are astonishing.” After she met Huang in August, the fund added to its position and is now the 10th-largest holder. The company was the best performer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index this year, outpacing the No. 2 stock by a multiple of almost three. Under Huang, Nvidia has built itself into the leading supplier of graphics processors, the chips that deliver the ever-more-realistic images that make computer games so immersive and addictive. For most of its history, that’s been a relatively small market, with the much bigger businesses of computer processors and smartphone chips dominated by Intel and Qualcomm. Photo: Jae C.

Hong, AP Nvidia stock soars on power of graphics chips 1 / 1 Back to Gallery This year, though, Huang’s longtime belief that the fundamental advantages of his graphics chips would give them a broader role in fast-growing fields such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars has begun to pay off — and is buoying Nvidia’s earnings. In the third quarter, demand for chips used in data centers and cars helped fuel a 54 percent rise in sales, and profit doubled to a record. That performance was the result of years of investment in the hardware and software that enables computers and cars to think for themselves, according to Huang. The stock rose 30 percent on Nov. 11, the day after the earnings report. Yet there was no victory lap from the CEO — his company is going to battle in markets served by Intel, whose annual research and development spending is twice Nvidia’s revenue, and Qualcomm, which has the largest cash balance in the chip industry. “The only thing we can guarantee is the velocity with which we innovate,” Huang said at the time. Nvidia declined to make Huang available for comment for this story. Huang runs Nvidia like it’s still a startup, making snap decisions and demanding fast execution, according to those who have worked for him. For a semiconductor maker, that’s no small feat: Designing a chip, getting it ready for market and then having it manufactured can take years and costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Chip companies publish road maps that reflect those intricate details, and they build their organizations around it. Decisions on what to make in multibillion-dollar plants requires extensive planning. At Nvidia, things can happen a lot faster. In the space of a short meeting hosted by Huang, an executive trying to give an update on progress of a new chip design might find himself silenced as Huang calls an engineer to check on a technical question — then instantly decide that the project is dead or make the call to head in a different direction. Huang has long clung to the belief that graphics chips would play a key role in technological innovation. But past efforts to spread their use, such as in phones, have failed to catch on or taken a lot longer to deliver tangible results. While the annual advent of a new high-end GeForce chip from Nvidia has long been viewed as a gift from above for computer gamers — many of whom think nothing of paying more for one component than most ordinary users would for a whole computer — Nvidia as a company had been less revered until this year. Its stock has struggled to rise higher than $35 in the 17 years since it first went public. Friday, the shares closed at $106.74. Some investors and analysts who follow Nvidia the most closely missed cashing in on the stock. The reason: They’ve heard Huang’s pitches before and initially wrote off his predictions about artificial intelligence and self-driving cars as no different from previous forays that fizzled. “Jen-Hsun didn’t dial it up or dial it down — he was just as enthusiastic about the automotive opportunity as he was for Tegra,” said Ian Ing, an analyst at MKM Partners, referring to the company’s mobile phone chip announced in 2008. The Tegra line of chips was Nvidia’s attempt to get into smartphones, which Huang correctly pointed out were on the cusp of transforming computing and communication. Yet because he and others underestimated the importance of an integrated cellular connection, Nvidia’s offering failed to win significant business. Unlike other companies that lost out to Qualcomm, Huang didn’t close down the project — instead Nvidia fielded its own game console, called Shield, as a way to try to create a market for Tegra and showcase its abilities to potential customers. While Shield never challenged the dominance of Xbox or PlayStation, the product led to orders for Tegra from Nintendo, which made the chip the heart of one its new game systems. “It was more or less a science project internal to Nvidia, and now Nintendo has adopted it,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “That’s another example of them pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, creating a market and then giving it to their customer.” Ian King is a Bloomberg writer.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Zotac will show off a Kaby Lake Zbox and more at CES 2017 by Eric Frederiksen  2:22 PM on December 30, 2016 With CES not even a week away, hardware companies are announcing their lineups for the show. Zotac has plans to show off a new model of Zbox mini-PC, a Thunderbolt 3 graphics dock, a GTX 1080 Mini graphics card, and more. The newest iteration of Zotac's Zbox CI549 Mini PC will pack one of Intel's new Kaby Lake processors, cooled with a passive heatsink to keep noise down.  This new Zbox will also feature Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, complete with all the protocols that offers, including full USB 3.1 10Gbps transfer rates, the USB Power Delivery fast-charging spec, and DisplayPort 1.2. Also new are the additions of Intel's UNITE and vPro, which will add secure conferencing and remote management capabilities. Zotac's External Graphics Dock continues the Thunderbolt 3 theme. The dock features a PCIe x16 slot inside, three USB 3.0 ports and one USB 3.0 Quick Charge port, as well as one Thunderbolt 3 Type-C connector. The External Graphics Dock will allow the user to add desktop-level graphics capabilities to just about any Thunderbolt 3 device, in addition to powering the device and adding more ports—all potential boons for gamers who want to add more graphics power at their desks. Finally, Zotac also plans to show off the GeForce GTX 1080 Mini. The 1080 Mini packs the same 2560 CUDA cores as its bigger cousins and a base clock speed of 1620 MHz. It retains the the same 8GB of GDDR5X memory as bigger cards, as well. Its primary claim to fame is its tiny size. Zotac says the Mini is the smallest GeForce GTX 1080 card on the market. CES runs January 4 through 7, so prices and availability info for all of these new products should be revealed soon.   Tags: Graphics Systems Register | Remember me View options x Subscriber options: E-mail me when people reply to my comments Comment sorting order: Flat, chronologicalNo threading.

AI AI will make stored data - and therefore storage- more valuable. When you can take - as we can today - a grainy surveillance video or a blurred face and read a license plate number of determine someone's identity using AI, the value of stored data rises, for good or ill. The year ahead Meet 2017's hot new smartphone brands The future of robotics What's top of mind for the CIO So much change in store for storage Smartphones: What's in the pipeline? Make your digital strategy a success in 2017 Catastrophic botnet to smash social media networks Can more meta thinking free us from current malaise? Why businesses can't ignore the cloud market IT spending to rebound in 2017, led by software, services As the AI revolution gathers force, expect that researchers will discover even more ways to use machine intelligence to generate value from stored data. In our democracy, I hope, citizens will have some say in the ways AI is used by intelligence agencies and corporations. NVRAM We'll see the first NVRAM (non-volatile RAM) in notebooks. This is the year that we'll see the first mainstream NVRAM products from Intel and, I hope, others. Intel's NVRAM SSDs won't be a thousand times faster, but they will be faster, more durable, and, yes, more expensive than NAND flash based SSDs. But more importantly, we'll see the first notebooks with NVRAM used in conjunction with standard RAM to expand main memory, or, as the industry puts it, as storage class memory (SCM). This is an old idea - remember IBM's System 38? - given new relevance by NVRAM's speed, cost, and density. It's the higher density that will pave the way for servers and notebooks with hundreds of gigabytes and even terabytes of main memory. Active archives. Active archives will continue to gain performance and popularity in enterprise IT, as CIOs find they're much cheaper and faster than cloud services. IaaS vendor ClearSky Data has already demonstrated that with smart caching, object storage can be as fast as NAS boxes. The greater data integrity, lower OpEx, and simpler operation of object storage systems then seal the deal. NAS won't go away, as the setup costs for object storage remain higher, but the withering of RAID-based NAS will begin in 2017. Cloud Cloud services will get much more competitive as Microsoft, Google, and IBM continue to work their unique advantages to chip away at Amazon's early lead. Amazon's early dominance of IaaS suggested a continuing lead over all comers, but unlike IBM in the 1960s, Amazon Web Services faces a trio of large, profitable, and uniquely advantaged competitors. Google's brainpower, Microsoft's desktop and research footprint, and IBM's enterprise stronghold are advantages that AWS's early lead won't be able to overcome. That's good news for the rest of us, as cloud services continue to grow and improve. Weep not for AWS, as the market is growing fast enough for all of them to prosper - for now. Super fast PCIe/NVMe PCIe/NVMe SSDs will be almost universal on pro notebooks be year end. Apple's new PCIe/NVMe MacBook Pros may have their troubles, but storage performance isn't one of them, and the rest of the industry is jumping on the bandwagon. With read and write performance well over 2 gigabytes per second, PCIe/NVMe storage leaves SATA SSDs in the dust. That, in turn, boosts the notebook's virtual memory system, giving you a much snappier tool. The Storage Bits take Sadly, 2017 won't be wonderful for everyone in the industry. I'm expecting more layoffs from storage companies that have slow to adapt to the accelerating changes in technology and competition. But for those of us who rely upon and/or manage storage, big improvements keep coming. Now, if the rest of the world could improve as well. . . . Courteous comments welcome, of course.

The iPhone 7 was released without a headphone jack, an unpopular choice that's now been somewhat ameliorated by the launch of the AirPods, and the MacBook Pro has been plagued by battery issues, graphics problems, and complaints about the high price of the device. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple also saw its first decline in iPhone sales in 2016, but 2017 could potentially turn things around for the company. We're expecting the biggest iPhone revision we've seen since the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launched in 2014, plus we're also expecting major iPad changes, refreshed desktop Macs, and software improvements. iPhone 8 - September 2017 Rumors about the 2017 iPhone started ramping up before the iPhone 7 was even released, so there's a lot of information out there, and at this point, quite a bit of it conflicts, so it's difficult to get a clear picture of what Apple is planning for the iPhone's 10th anniversary. If you read all of the rumors and suss out some common themes, there are a few concrete details that hint at what likely to see in the next-generation iPhone. We're assuming it's going to be called the "iPhone 8" due to design changes that are more radical than we'd expect for an "iPhone 7s," but it's entirely possible Apple will go with another name. It looks like there's going to be at least three iPhone models, and one of those will have an OLED display. It's sounding like we're going to get one premium OLED iPhone somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 inches, with either a flexible curved display that wraps around the edges like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or an edge-to-edge display more in line with the current design of the iPhone 7. These seem to be mutually exclusive concepts, but we've heard rumors suggesting both possibilities. A display that wraps around the sides of the phone seems to suggest we'd continue to have some kind of top and bottom bezels, but information coming from sources like KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seems to point more towards a less curved 2.5D edge-to-edge display that does away with bezels entirely. Edge-to-edge iPhone concept image via ConceptsiPhone Of course, it's possible some "edge-to-edge" rumors refer to the removal of the side bezels rather than the top and bottom bezels, but it's not entirely clear. Either way, it seems the iPhone 8 will do away with the Home button, incorporating a Touch ID fingerprint scanner directly into the display. Ambient light sensors, microphone, and camera may also be located under the display for a true single piece of glass look. Along with that OLED model, rumors also suggest we're going to get two other iPhone models, perhaps in standard 4.7 and 5.5-inch configurations. These would presumably be less expensive and would use easier to obtain standard LCD display panels. Either the OLED model or all three iPhone models rumored for 2017 will include a glass body, doing away with the aluminum-style body that Apple has used for several years in a row. The glass back and the display may be housed in an aluminum frame for stability, but the glass itself will mean a significantly different visual aesthetic. A glass body will bring a fresh look, but there's another reason behind the materials switch -- wireless charging. Apple is rumored to be developing long-range wireless charging techniques, which could make their debut in 2017. An aluminum body can interfere with wireless charging speeds, while a glass body offers less interference. It's not entirely clear if Apple is developing its own wireless charging solution or working with a company like Energous, nor do we know exactly how wireless charging will be implemented, but it is looking like a feature we can expect to see in all 2017 iPhone models. Other features rumored for the 2017 iPhone include a faster A11 processor, more advanced biometric features like improved facial recognition techniques or perhaps even iris scanning, and an upgraded Taptic Engine able to create "more complex tactile vibrations." Dual cameras are expected to be offered in some iPhone models, but optical image stabilization could be added to both lenses (instead of just the wide-angle lens) in the next-generation iPhone. Apple is rumored to be considering upwards of 10 different prototypes for the 2017 iPhone, which explains why we may be hearing so many different rumors about the device at this point in time. As we get closer to the September launch date of the 2017 iPhone and as Apple's own plans solidify, we'll get a better idea of what to expect. Read full iPhone 8 roundup iPad Pro - Spring 2017? Apple is working on a revamped version of the iPad Pro, and as with the iPhone, the rumors are all over the place. Apple is said to be planning on introducing three models in 2017: a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and a new mid-range model with a display that's somewhere between 10.1 and 10.9 inches. The 10-inch iPad Pro is rumored to feature an edge-to-edge nearly bezel-free display much like the iPhone 8, and its actual body size will be identical to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. For that reason, rumors suggest the 10-inch iPad Pro will be replacing the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but Apple plans to keep the 9.7-inch iPad Pro around as a low-cost tablet option. The 10-inch and 12.9-inch models will reportedly be the new flagship models, upgraded with faster A10X processors. The exact size of the 10-inch iPad hasn't been sussed out yet. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who often reliably predicts Apple's plans, says it will measure in at 10.5-inches. Japanese site Mac Otakara has a more mixed track record and has released two reports pointing towards both 10.9 and 10.1 inches. Rumors out of the Taiwanese supply chain have suggested 10.5 inches, and research conducted by Barclays Research says it'll be 10.9 inches. One rumor from Mac Otakara also suggests Apple will introduce a smaller 7.9-inch iPad Pro to succeed the iPad mini, but that information has not yet been confirmed by another source. With Apple planning to introduce new iPads in 2017, there may also be more of a focus on iPad-specific software during the year. Apple is said to be aiming to enhance the iPad Pro with new hardware and software features that cater specifically to professional users, such as a faster display for smoother on-screen zooming, panning, and scrolling, and expanded iOS support for the Apple Pencil that will allow it to work in more areas. Mac Otakara and Barclays Research have both predicted an early 2017 launch for the new iPads, perhaps in March or April, but if a radical edge-to-edge redesign is in the works, it is questionable as to whether Apple will upstage the 2017 iPhone 8 that's expected in September with an edge-to-edge iPad launching earlier in the year. Read full iPad Pro roundup iMac - Spring 2017 New iMacs didn't debut alongside the MacBook Pro at Apple's October 2016 event, but there's rumored to be an update in the works. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, we will see iMacs in "mid-1H17," which translates to sometime around March or April. A refreshed iMac will likely include Intel's Kaby Lake chips and AMD graphics (in models that use discrete graphics options). The iMac is potentially due for a design refresh, but there have been no rumors suggesting anything more than a minor spec update is on the horizon. In fact, information from Bloomberg suggests all we'll see in a 2017 is a shift to USB-C and improved processors. Kaby Lake chips appropriate for the iMac are set to come out in late December to early January, perfect timing for a spring release. We could potentially see a new keyboard that could ship alongside an iMac. Apple is rumored to be considering a standalone keyboard that incorporates a Touch Bar much like the keyboard of the MacBook Pro. Such a product might accompany a future iMac. Read full iMac roundup MacBook - Spring 2017 After introducing the 12-inch Retina MacBook in the spring of 2015, Apple launched a refreshed version in the spring of 2016, so it stands to reason we'll see yet another upgrade in the early months of 2017. Low-power Kaby Lake chips appropriate for the MacBook are already available, so that's a safe bet for what we might see in an upgraded machine. No design changes are expected. Read full MacBook roundup MacBook Pro - Fall 2017 New MacBook Pro models with a Touch Bar came out in 2016, and if Apple sticks to a traditional upgrade cycle, we'll see a refresh with upgraded internal components in the fall of 2017. Upgrades could include Kaby Lake processors and slight price cuts, but no external design changes are expected for the next several years. Read full MacBook Pro roundup Mac Pro The Mac Pro is overdue for an update, having last been updated in 2013, and we don't know when it's going to get a refresh. There are no concrete rumors suggesting an update is in the works, and no hints on what a new machine might include. Processors and graphics cards appropriate for an updated machine have long been available, but Apple could be waiting for the latest technology from companies like Intel and AMD before presenting a new Mac Pro. If a Mac Pro is planned for 2017, it could come in the spring alongside refreshed iMacs or, if Apple is waiting for cutting-edge current-generation chips, it could come in the fall. Read full Mac Pro roundup Mac mini Like the Mac Pro, the Mac mini has not seen an update for multiple years, with the last update coming in October 2014. Unfortunately, we've heard no rumors on whether or not we can expect to see an upgraded Mac mini in 2016, but if it does come, it could include Kaby Lake chips, faster SSD options, better graphics, and other improvements that have been brought to the Mac lineup over the last two years. Read full Mac mini roundup MacBook Air - Never With thinner, lighter MacBook and MacBook Pro machines now available, we don't expect to see another MacBook Air update. Apple will likely keep the MacBook Air around for a while as a low-cost option until it's able to cut the price on more expensive machines, but a new MacBook Air probably isn't going to happen. We could, however, potentially see small spec boosts and minor internal upgrades if Apple wants to keep its low-cost machine relevant for a longer period of time. Read full MacBook Air roundup Apple Watch - Fall 2017? If Apple is working on a third-generation Apple Watch for the fall of 2017, it's being kept tightly under wraps. We haven't heard any rumors suggesting a new Apple Watch is in the works for 2017, but if we are going to get one, it could come in the fall alongside the iPhone 8. Potential features we could see in a new Apple Watch include the first significant design changes, upgraded processors, and perhaps sensors that Apple was not able to build into the first and second-generation versions. Cellular connectivity, a feature Apple has wanted to incorporate into the watch but hasn't been able to add due to battery life concerns, could also come in a 2017 model. We've also heard rumors of a potential switch to micro-LED displays for the Apple Watch, which can be thinner and lighter with improved color gamut and brightness. At this point, it's too early to tell if we're going to get a new Apple Watch in 2017, so we'll need to wait for additional rumors to surface over the first few months of the year to figure out what's going on with Apple's wearable. Read full Apple Watch roundup Apple TV - Unknown While it's possible Apple could introduce an Apple TV update in 2017, we don't think it's likely to happen. There are no recent rumors suggesting an update is in the works, and there's no real reason for the Apple TV to be updated. Prior to the introduction of the fourth-generation Apple TV, Apple went several years without introducing a new version of the device, so historically, it is not on an every-year or every-other-year update schedule like Macs and iOS devices. That said, rumors suggest a future Apple TV could include a better processor and perhaps some features that would allow it to compete with products like the Amazon Echo and the Google Home, but there are other rumors that make it unclear whether these are features that would go into an Apple TV or another standalone product also rumored to be under development in Cupertino -- a home hub. Read full Apple TV roundup Home Hub - Late 2017? Rumors suggest Apple is working on a connected smart home device that's similar to the Amazon Echo. It would be equipped with a speaker and microphone and powered by Apple's Siri voice assistant. The hub, which has been in development for two years and is in the prototype testing phase, is said to be able to control HomeKit-connected accessories like lights, locks, window shades, and more through voice activation. It may feature "more advanced microphone and speaker technology" than the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, products it will compete with. The Amazon Echo Information on the hub is a bit nebulous at this point, and it's not clear if it's going to be a new standalone speaker-only product or something in the AirPort or Apple TV families, both of which are possibilities. Facial recognition capabilities may be built into the device, and Apple is also working on Siri advancements that will allow it to do more. Because the hub is still in the prototyping phase, it's not entirely clear when it will launch. It could come in the later months of 2017, but it may not be ready until 2018. Apple could also scrap the project entirely. iOS 11 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) Apple introduces a new version of its mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads on a yearly basis, and in 2017, we're expecting to see iOS 11. There aren't many details on what will be included in iOS 11, but we've heard some hints suggesting there could be more of a focus on the iPad, with features like improved Apple Pencil support that cater to professional users. Apple is said to be planning on allowing the Apple Pencil to work more widely across the operating system. Apple is also rumored to be developing its own social networking app to compete with Snapchat and Facebook, allowing users to record video, edit video, and add filter and doodles. Such an app, if development continues, could debut alongside iOS 11. Apple has also been exploring augmented and virtual reality with a dedicated AR/VR team, and some kind of augmented reality feature could potentially be introduced in iOS 11. Maps and Photos are two areas where Apple could take advantage of augmented reality with the iPhone's camera, offering features like mapping overlays of real-world views or Snapchat-style photo filters. macOS 10.13 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) The next-generation version of macOS (10.13) will come in the fall of 2017, introducing new features and refining the macOS operating system. There's no word yet on what features we might see in macOS 10.13, but details will likely leak out as it gets later in the year. Apple will preview macOS 10.13 at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which typically takes place in June. watchOS 4 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) Alongside iOS 10.11, we're likely going to get watchOS 4, an updated version of the operating system that runs on the Apple Watch. There's no word yet on what new features could be included in watchOS 4, but we'll get our first glimpse of the new software in June. tvOS 11 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) The final software update we're expecting in 2017 is tvOS 11, a new version of the tvOS software that runs on the fourth-generation TV. Apple is still working to refine the tvOS experience, so we can likely expect to see some interface improvements and other usability changes as the company gets a better handle on how people are using their set-top boxes. tvOS 11, along with macOS 10.13, watchOS 4, and iOS 10.11, will be previewed at WWDC ahead of a fall launch.

Rating: 37 Votes radiology 3 days ago at 11:58 am This is going to be the best year in the history of the company. The products Apple will realease are just unbelievable. They will blow people's mind. You will see the the widest range of colors in the entire tech industry. There will be new watch bands that will make YSL envy. Needless to say, all the products will be thinner and thinner as unnecessary ports are removed from the devices. The new emoji collection will have the most comprehensive ethnicity ever created. The number of online orders for each product category will be the largest in Apple's history and will outpace the competition by many folds. The company will continue to make efforts to improve safety and privacy. On top of that, they will continue to make sure we live in a better planet. For all that, I thank you Tim, for ruining Apple computers. Happy 2017, everyone! Rating: 31 Votes Cineplex 3 days ago at 11:56 am What to expect from Apple in 2017? One word. Disappointment!

I wouldn't hold my breath these days :( I'll be blue by next November Rating: 23 Votes Altivec88 3 days ago at 08:57 pm When I look at what Apple is doing in its entirety, I see a company who is slowly but surely gravitating towards what they believe will be the next big thing. The things we are criticizing Apple for, I feel they are simply growing pains as Apple prepares to leave older markets behind and enter new ones. And I feel we need to be understanding in this area. . As an enterprise customer that has built their entire business on Apple products the past 30+ years, We do not have the luxury of being understanding in this area. Unfortunately, for us pro's, "the next best thing" doesn't put food on our plate. For the time being we must rely on those old things called computers. The point of paying a premium for Apple products is the problem free (well less problem free lately) ecosystem between all products. From our iPhones and iPads, to our Mac mini servers and airport routers, right down to our work horse MacPro's. Allowing us to concentrate on our work rather than the technology more than makes up for the extra costs we pay Apple. The problem is we've been waiting 6 years to update our aging and dying 12 core 2010 MacPro's. We purchased one 2013 MacPro to try out and there was virtually no improvement in rendering speeds, yet they were double the price of our 2010 models. So month by month we kept waiting for a speed bump. Both Dell and HP have updated their workstations twice since 2013 and currently offer 44 core systems. When Apple announced their Mac Event at the end of 2016, we were sure a Mac Pro update was imminent. Nope, not even a mention... That silence was deafening to us and triggered a stop order on all future purchases of any Apple product. We use iPhones and iPads to automatically sync notes and photos to our pro machines. If we have to switch our Mac Pro's to Dell or HP workstations, we have no reason to buy Macbook Pros, iMacs, iPads or iPhones. We will be switching those to surface's and window phones for easier integration and lower cost. I know, windows sucks and we don't want to leave, but as other pointed out, Apple is pushing us out the door by neglecting us. So I get that consumers who are okay with outdated tech and slow updates get upset at seeing all the negativity. Trust me, I use to be a die hard fan boy too. But when your PC using competition is blowing you out of the water because their tech is far far superior to yours and it starts costing you big dollars, you would show a little displeasure too. 2017 is the year that things better start popping out this long dragged out pipeline or I really won't care any more. More specifically, no Mac Pro by March and you can put a fork in it. Thanks Tim for ruining Apple.

If Apple delivers satisfactory products, then people will stop stating their dissatisfaction, or "whining" and "trolling" as some call it. Rating: 21 Votes gertruded 3 days ago at 12:24 pm We are Apple users since our first Apple 2 plus through iPhone 6splus, we are finally through. Our 2007 iMac, our 2009 mini, and our 2012 air are all aging and need replacement soon. We purchased a Windows machine for Christmas and it seems to be OK. Apple is clearly abandoning their Mac line. The difficult conversion of files has begun. Apple left us, not the other way around. Rating: 20 Votes BreadofWonder 3 days ago at 11:13 am No reason to update the Apple TV? Really? I can think of two really good ones: 4K and HDR. Every other streamer has it at this point and I'd be shocked if Apple doesn't do it too before the end of the year.

Let's take a close look.

We haven't been happy with SMI-controlled SSDs since back in the SM2246 days when everything was still MLC-based. We've tested a ton of SMI SM2256-powered SDDs, and none have earned a TweakTown recommendation, simply because none could sustain write transfers of more than about 125 MB/s, which is slower than a typical mechanical HDD.   We recently reviewed the SMI SM2260-powered Intel 600p NVMe SSD, and it had the same issue even though it is a Gen3 x4 PCIe NVMe SSD with 3D flash. We will go ahead and tell you up front that the SM2258-powered SU800 does not have this issue. Even the 128GB model delivers over 350 MB/s with our write transfer test.     ADATA's SU800 has a Micron 3D TLC flash array under the hood. This is the same 384Gbit 3D TLC flash that powers Crucial's MX300 and Intel's 600p. The SU800 will be competing directly with Crucial's popular MX300 for market share. They both have the same flash array but employ different controllers. Crucial's MX300 is powered by Marvell's 88SS1074 4-channel flash controller, the SU800, as mentioned, is powered by SMI's SM2258 4-channel controller. The SM2258 is armed with an advanced LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) ECC engine. LDPC error correction significantly extends the endurance of SU800's flash array netting the SU800 more than double the endurance of the MX300 at similar capacity points.   As with all modern TLC SSDs, the SU800 employs pSLC caching to boost burst performance. SMI calls the SLC caching scheme used by the SM2258 "Intelligent SLC Caching." We don't know a whole lot about the technical details of SMI's Intelligent SLC Caching technology, other than it seems to be dynamic in nature and that it functions far better than what we've seen previously from SMI-controlled SSDs. Unlike what we see from the MX300 series, the extra capacity that is inherent to Micron 384Gbit flash isn't rolled into extra user capacity or OP, but rather into the SU800's SLC cache capacity, which should be very good from a performance standpoint. Let's take a close look at that performance.     Specifications     ADATA Ultimate SU800 SATA III SSD:   Sequential Read: up to 560 MB/s Sequential Write: up to 520 MB/s Max 4K Random Read Speed: up to 80,000 IOPS Max 4K Random Write Speed: up to 80,000 IOPS Endurance: up to 800TBW MTTF: 2 Million Hours Warranty: 3-Year Limited Warranty DEVSLP ECC: LDPC SMART TRIM Garbage Collection Software: SSD Toolbox, Migration Software   Current Pricing: 128GB = $49.99, 256GB = $69.99, 512GB = $129.99, 1TB = Unknown Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find the ADATA Ultimate SU800 512GB SATA III SSD for sale below.

Beignet Now Implements Enough OpenCL 2.0 To Support It For Skylake+ Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 30 December 2016 at 08:00 AM EST. 1 Comment Intel's open-source Beignet OpenCL project for implementing CL/GPGPU support for Intel graphics hardware is on the edge of a big milestone. We've been seeing more OpenCL 2.0 code land in Beignet while over night there was yet more code to land: for OpenCL 2.0 there was device enqueue work, cl_kernel pointer to GPGPU, and other work. One of the final commits though is what excited us this morning: add an option to enable OpenCL 2.0. With the latest Git code, Intel users can now officially expose OpenCL 2.0 support rather than just OpenCL 1.2. The OpenCL 2.0 support isn't enabled by default currently but -DENABLE_OPENCL_20 must be set for the CMake build system. Additionally, the OpenCL 2.0 support is just for Intel Skylake "Gen 9" graphics and newer. As well, Beignet must be built against LLVM 3.9+ and libdrm 2.4.66+ for meeting the requirements for being able to expose OpenCL 2.0 for Intel GPUs on Linux. Great milestone to end the year for this open-source OpenCL project, I'll be trying to run some fresh Beignet OpenCL benchmarks shortly. Meanwhile the Clover Gallium3D-based OpenCL implementation is basically abandoned at OpenCL 1.1, AMD is still working on open-sourcing their newer ROCm code, the AMD binary driver currently advertises OpenCL 1.2 as does the NVIDIA proprietary Linux driver. Hopefully there will be a more fruitful open-source OpenCL ecosystem in 2017. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 29, 2016 at 2:45PM Image source: NVIDIA. Generally speaking, I'm not a huge fan of Citron Research, the often short-oriented commentary site run by Andrew Left. I consider Citron one of those market prognosticators that makes constant calls, and on occasion, some of them turn out to be fantastic, well-researched picks. And the street credit earned from a subset of correct calls overshadows the incorrect calls based on poor theses that no one pays attention to. Regardless, Citron certainly does have the power to move the market in the short term, which incidentally helps its positions and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy -- at least for a day or two. (I've always strongly suspected that Citron front-runs its own picks.) That being said, I don't necessarily disagree with Citron's latest note, which targets high-flying graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Following an incredible year of gains, Citron took the company down a notch yesterday with a single tweet, with shares falling 7%. The $4.3 billion tweet NVIDIA's drop wiped out $4.3 billion in market value, so yeah, Citron can move the markets. In the tweet, Citron pointed to six risks that it believes NVIDIA investors are discounting, which combined with the soaring valuation this year could be a recipe for a pullback.  Citron readers know we have long been fans of $NVDA,but now the mkt is disregarding headwinds. In 2017 we will see $NVDA head back to $90 pic.twitter.com/n4U7f6eV7G — Citron Research (@CitronResearch) December 28, 2016 I don't disagree -- just a couple weeks ago I expressed some concern over stretched valuation multiples, even while acknowledging that NVIDIA has executed extremely well on many of its growth initiatives. Still let's dig through Citron's concerns. Growth and market share: It's true that a lot of NVIDIA's top-line growth has been driven by market share gains, mostly from primary GPU rival AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). AMD clawed back a little bit of market share in Q2, as NVIDIA had been gaining ground for a string of quarters. But AMD gave that back in Q3 following NVIDIA's launch of Pascal-based products. Remember that the PC market hasn't been a growth market in years, nor has the PC gamer niche within it, and the core GPU business accounts for over 80% of sales. The best ways to grow revenue under those circumstances are to steal market share or increase prices; NVIDIA is doing both. NVIDIA is growing into new addressable markets, just not by much as those businesses are still very small compared to the GPU segment. I don't see this as a "risk." If anything, I see it as evidence of strong execution.  Data center competition: NVIDIA has made some progress in the data center, which it hopes will be a growth avenue going forward. There is potential, but Citron is right that competition will only intensify further. This is a relatively small part of the business currently, so while the downside risk may be somewhat limited if competition starts to eat into NVIDIA's results, the issue is valuation. If investors are pricing in data center growth that fails to materialize, shares could be punished from multiple contraction. At the very least, competition could erode gross margin, and the data center business is quite profitable relative to NVIDIA's overall corporate average (56%). Intellectual property and licensing revenue: NVIDIA and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) signed their patent cross-licensing deal back in January 2011, settling years of litigation between the two companies. It's true that Intel's royalty payments will end soon and that revenue will be missed, but investors have known about this for half a decade. This should all already be priced in by now, and you can't argue that NVIDIA's valuation is predicated on royalty revenue. NVIDIA collected $66 million in licensing revenue from Intel last quarter, or just 3% of sales. Gross margin sustainability and competition: As mentioned above, concerns around gross margin are completely valid, given the expected intensification of competition in many of the growth areas that NVIDIA is enjoying right about now. Intel's vertical integration with silicon fabrication does give it cost and strategic advantages, which it will surely leverage. It wouldn't be particularly surprising if NVIDIA does pull back to $90 in 2017. Stocks that run up as fast as NVIDIA has in 2016 often do pull back if the market got ahead of itself, which is entirely possible given the significant multiple expansion that NVIDIA experienced this year. Some of Citron's concerns are worth acknowledging, but others are probably already priced in. Evan Niu, CFA, has no position in any stocks mentioned.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums The Tech Report System Guide: December 2016 edition Man, it feels good to be a gamer by Bruno Ferreira  2:07 PM on December 29, 2016 Welcome to the December 2016 edition of The Tech Report System Guide. Since our last installment, AMD made a big splash by taking the wraps off its Ryzen CPUs. Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs are now inside many laptops and convertibles, and the rumor mill says that the desktop variants of Kaby will be arriving soon. AMD's Ryzen chips also shouldn't be too far behind. The company has said its next-gen parts will launch in the first quarter of 2017. CES is just around the corner, in any case, so you'll probably want to hold off buying a motherboard or CPU until after the dust from that show has settled. Should you need a machine right now, though, we did our best to select the cream of the crop from the current-generation lineups. powered by In the graphics card arena, there's been some major shifts in the $250-and-under segment of the market now that both AMD and Nvidia have revealed basically their entire next-generation graphics-card lineups. While we previously lamented the fact that AMD's originally-promised pricing for its Radeon RX 470 and RX 480 cards didn't materialize in stores, we're now happy to report that supply seems to have increased and prices have fallen. For example, you can grab a Radeon RX 470 4GB card for around $170, and its bigger brother the RX 480GB 8GB goes for about $240. This all means that the fight in the entry-level and budget graphics card segments is fierce indeed. Nvidia isn't sitting still, though, and it's launched the wallet-friendly GeForce GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti to take the fight to the entry-level graphics-card market. The GTX 1050 is a solid enough performer for its price, but our preliminary testing has shown that the 2GB of RAM on board limits its appeal. The GTX 1050 Ti and its 4GB of RAM, on the other hand, are more interesting. Although the slightly-more-expensive RX 470 4GB boasts superior performance, the GTX 1050 Ti sips barely any power, runs dead-quiet, and often doesn't even need a 6-pin power connector to do its thing. That makes it a near-perfect choice for a living-room PC or upgrading a prebuilt system. As for the remaining components that make up a PC, there hasn't been much in the way of new releases. Along with its next-generation CPUs, there are indications that Intel will be releasing new chipsets to go with them, which are reportedly going inside motherboards from all manufacturers as we speak. However, those motherboards have yet to hit the market. Given the rather large amount of uncertainty about these products, we'd be wary of buying a motherboard or CPU right now. When it comes to memory, we'll put it plain and simple: buy it right now, and buy as much as you can. From what we can see, RAM prices have been climbing like crazy, sometimes in the range of 30% or more per kit. Even though our recommendations for specific kits won't be changing all that much, the price tags are rising by the minute. According to some reports and our own observations, SSD prices are on the rise, too. Although we've actually yet to see this phenomenon in most retail listings, the recent dearth of promotional deals and the apparent steadiness of the current prices (instead of the expected continued drop) may be a sign that your flashy new SSD will soon become more expensive. The Tech Report System Guide is sponsored by Newegg. We'll be using links to the site's product pages throughout this guide. You can (and should!) support our work by purchasing the items we recommend using these links. A big thanks to Newegg for their continued support. In the rare cases that Newegg doesn't stock an item we want to recommend, we'll link to other retailers as needed. Despite its sponsorship, Newegg has no input on the components included in the System Guide. Our picks are entirely our own. Rules of the road The System Guide is our list of recommended parts for building a new PC. If you've never built a PC before and want to, that's great. Just be sure to read through our guide to building a PC, or kick back and watch the handy video below, before proceeding. In the following pages, we'll discuss our picks for the critical components that make up a PC, including processors, motherboards, memory, graphics cards, storage, cases, and power supplies. We've picked parts to fit budgets of all sizes, without compromising on quality or performance. Those picks are divided into three categories: budget, sweet spot, and high-end. We'll also make a note of good choices for those readers who are looking to get in to a VR ready system. Our budget picks will get you up and running with solid components that won't break the bank. Stepping up to our sweet spot parts gets you even more bang for your buck. At the high end, we've chosen parts that represent the pinnacle of performance, without falling into the trap of spending money for its own sake. Each part will have a link to a TR review where possible. We also include a notable needs section for each item with any critical information that you need to know before putting together a parts list. Finally, we've put together some sample builds if you have no idea where to start. If you like this article, don't miss the rest of our guide series: our how-to-build-a-PC guide, where we walk readers (and viewers) through the PC assembly process; our mobile staff picks, where we highlight our favorite devices for on-the-go computing; and our peripheral guide, where we pick the best monitors, mice, keyboards, and accessories to make your PC experience even better.

I’m really leaning on Cade Webb and Cowboys Ride for Free for knowledge on the Cowboys. Luckily, he was nice enough to answer my questions. Mason Rudolph is obviously a great quarterback, one of the top 3 that CU has faced this season. Based on what I saw, he has a strong arms, deceptive legs, and good command of the offense. What are his weaknesses? I saw some intermittent accuracy issues and panic under pressure during the OU game, are those consistent in his career or a product of circumstance? I think you hit his strengths on the head. He's an accurate quarterback and can make every throw on the field. I think he does struggle with accuracy at times, but it's usually when he comes under pressure. When he is under duress in the pocket, he tends to panic. However, he's gotten better about that as he's become a better running quarterback of late. Against OU, I think his accuracy issues were a product of the weather, and poor pass protection. OSU seems like the prototypical Big 12 team. Prolific offense, softer defense. Is this is an accurate description? What are their strengths and weaknesses? I don't think "soft" would be the word I would use to describe the defense, but I think you're spot on about the OSU offense. They throw the ball down the field incredibly well, and they're starting to run the ball at a pretty nice clip. On offense, they struggle with complex blitz schemes and a good defense can take them out of their game. When that happens, OSU tends to shell up on offense. They can't do that against CU. On defense, their strength is in the defensive line, specifically the interior defensive line. They're usually able to defend the run with their front seven. They don't defend the pass as well as they defend the run, but they still do a decent job of limiting downfield opportunities. Justice Hill and Chris Carson have been very effective in the latter part of the season. How do the Buffs stop this running game? How about the offense in general? I'm not sure how the Buffs can stop the OSU running game. I think they'll have to pick their poison with OSU. Not many teams are able to completely take them out of their game. If CU decides to limit the vertical passing game, then expect OSU to run the ball successfully. They're generally able to do both well, but I think it's pretty tough to say that CU would be able to contain both aspects of this Cowboy offense. It seemed like the defensive line was the strong point of the Cowboys defense, is that accurate? How do you move the ball on OSU? It absolutely is. As I mentioned above, they're typically able to defend the run with their front 6 or 7. They did that incredibly well against TCU, who is a very prolific running team. If they do that against CU, I expect CU to try to air it out. One thing that has historically given OSU trouble is dual-threat quarterbacks. From watching the Buffaloes, it seems like Liufau prefers to make plays with his legs, but has the arm to make defenses pay if they key too hard on that. I think CU will find more success through the air than they will on the ground. Who are some players to watch on offense? On defense? The OSU offense goes as Mason Rudolph goes. As I said above, he makes all of the throws and when he's on, he's nearly impossible to stop. That said, he can be rattled with pressure. Something to watch there. You also need to be aware of James Washington and Justice Hill. Washington is the top receiver for the Cowboys and is an incredibly dangerous deep threat. OSU loves going to him in one-on-one situations. Hill, the true freshman running back for the Pokes, has led the resurgence of the running game. He is a downfield runner with deceptive speed. If he gets an inch, he can make you pay. On defense, watch for Vincent Taylor and Jordan Sterns. Taylor is a future NFL guy at the DT spot, and is incredibly athletic for a guy his size. Not many teams have been able to slow him down, so expect to hear his name a few times. Sterns, a first-team All-Big12 safety, is a punisher. He's exceptional in run stop defense, but is athletic enough to help out in the pass defense. What is your prediction for the game? I like OSU in this game. I think CU has a really good secondary, but OSU does enough on offense that if CU slows the passing game, OSU should still be able to move the ball on the ground. OSU is fighting for 10 wins, but CU has a lot on the line too. I expect a very physical, very close game. Give me OSU 31-27. Ok, hypothetical: the Big 12 blows up in 10 years like some predict, will you join the ex-Big 12 club in the Conference of Champions? Conference of Champions? When did Colorado move to the SEC? *winks* But seriously... I think the Pac-12 would be a great fit for Oklahoma State. I've been a proponent of blowing up the conference (at least when expansion was a hot-button topic), and I thought the Pac-12 or SEC would've been the most likely landing spot. I think OSU would thrive in either of those conferences.

MIL-STD-810G tested and IP54 water and dust resistant. Convenient keyboard and kickstand. Includes 4G LTE cellular radio with GPS. Cons Bluetooth keyboard takes a few seconds to wake from idle. Heavy for one-arm use. Lacks USB-C ports. Bottom Line With an excellent display, strong components, and solid design, the Xplore XSlate R12 is a powerful rugged Windows tablet that will serve you as well outdoors as it will in the office. By Joel Santo Domingo The Xplore XSlate R12 (starts at $2,649; $3,699 as tested) is a rugged slate Windows tablet with useful features like an Intel Core i7 processor, a full HD display that's visible in sunlight, and a removable kickstand that also acts as a carrier for a wireless keyboard. It's protected by a rubberized case, and has been tested for drops, extreme environmental conditions, and resistance to blowing dust and water. This is the best tablet we've tested recently for use in nonconventional workspaces. //Compare Similar Products Compare Getac F110 (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Microsoft Surface Pro 4   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Amazon Fire HD 8   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Amazon Fire   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Asus Transformer Book T100HA   %displayPrice%%seller% see it HP Pavilion x2 (10-n123dx)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet (7202)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Nvidia Shield Tablet K1   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Xplore XSlate B10   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple iPad Pro (9.7 inch)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 700   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Acer Switch Alpha 12   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Dell Latitude 13 7000 Series 2-in-1 (7350)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it HP Spectre x2   %displayPrice%%seller% see it HP Elite x2 G1 (1012)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 310   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Microsoft Surface Book (2016, Intel Core i7)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Asus Transformer Mini (T102HA-D4-GR)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo Miix 510   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Design and Features The XSlate R12 looks like a muscular slab clad in a black rubber protective coating. It measures 0.75 by 12.93 by 8.17 inches (HWD), which is thinner (but a smidge wider and deeper) than the 2015 version of the Getac F110, our last top choice. There are implanted guides and pogo plugs for attaching the tablet to mounts in vehicles or its optional desktop docking station. With all its connectors and mounts, the XSlate R12 is meant to work equally well in the office or out in the field. For example, a police officer could use it to look up a potential suspect's criminal record during a traffic stop, then unlatch the tablet and use it in a dock at her desk to finish filling out the paperwork later. View All 10 Photos in Gallery I have no doubt that the R12 will survive use in an auto repair garage or a large-scale warehouse, as it's rated for 4-foot drops onto plywood over concrete (though we didn't copy those conditions). In addition, it has been through MIL-STD-810G testing for extreme temperature swings, vibration, 20g shocks while operating and 40g shocks while off, humidity, altitude, liquid spills (including bleach and oil), and blowing sand and rain. It's rated IP54 for resistance to dust and water; the Getac F110 and Xplore XSlate B10 are both rated a more-resilient IP65, but the XSlate R12 should have no trouble surviving most indoor and many outdoor environments. The tablet weighs in at 3.09 pounds alone, and 4.09 pounds with its kickstand and wireless keyboard magnetically attached to the back panel. It weighs about the same as the Getac F110 (3.1 pounds alone), and less than the Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet (4.46 pounds). It's easy enough to carry in a bag, though holding the full 4-pound tablet in one arm will become tiring after a few minutes. The kickstand swings out, so you can use the tablet on a desk or counter, and opening the kickstand's framework frees a limpet-like wireless keyboard that rides on the tablet's back. The kickstand is also held in place by magnetic clasps, but it is easily removable for those times you don't need it. The innovative keyboard charges itself from contacts on the back of the tablet, so you won't have to carry a micro USB cable around all the time (if you're not carrying the keyboard clipped to the tablet, you can also charge the keyboard with a micro USB cable back at your desk). Since it uses Bluetooth, it's not dependent on being physically attached, like the keyboard on the Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet. The keyboard has a touchpad built in, so you wont have to carry an extra mouse, but note that it takes a second or two of tapping the keyboard or touchpad before they "wake" for input. Included with the R12 is a tethered active stylus, which stows in the right side of the tablet's body. You can use the stylus for tasks like filling out forms or sketching on blueprints. Next to the stylus holder you'll find a Windows Hello–compliant fingerprint reader. Two non-locking doors on the right side cover I/O ports. The first has a port for an optional Ethernet and serial port (both are on a y-shaped cable). The second door covers the jack for the AC adapter, a headset jack, a USB 3.0 port, and an HDMI port. Like most specialized business PCs, the R12 lacks a USB-C port, but that's not a deal breaker. Underneath the hot-swappable battery is a microSD card slot, a SIM card slot for the built-in 4G LTE radio, and a smart card slot that supports government-issued common-access cards (CAC) used by the military. Bluetooth 4.2 and 802.11ac handle short-range wireless communication. The 4G LTE adapter is carrier unlocked, and has GPS built in. The 12.5-inch full HD (1,920-by-1,080-resolution) display is a nice addition. In the past, rugged tablets were kept to 1,366-by-768 resolution because manufacturing portable displays with both 1080p resolution and 800-nit backlights was extremely expensive. This screen's high visibility outdoors, even in full sunlight, is obviously nice for architects and construction workers, but someone in a clerical role will also benefit from being able to see more information on the display at once. Our tested configuration hits the current sweet spot for most business users. The 8GB of RAM is more than enough to keep an instant messaging client, dozens of Web browser tabs, multiple Microsoft Office apps, and information retrieval software utilities active at the same time. And the 256GB of space on the solid-state drive (SSD) is enough for all of the above apps, plus every word processing and spreadsheet document you can generate in the next few years. The memory isn't expandable, though you can replace the SSD with a larger-capacity drive in the future. Xplore covers the R12 with a three-year warranty. Performance and Conclusion The system is equipped with an Intel Core i7-7500U processor with Intel HD Graphics 620. The quad-core processor is more powerful than the usual Core i5 CPU found in most rugged tablets, as proved by the XSlate R12's top scores across the board on our performance benchmark tests. It was excellent on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test (3,282 points), ahead of the other rugged tablets we've seen, from the Panasonic ToughPad FZ-M1 (1,470) to the Getac F110 (2,833). The XSlate R12 also led our multimedia test scores. HandBrake took 2 minutes, 11 seconds, while the other tablets took 3 to 6 minutes, and its CineBench (340 points) and Photoshop (3:34) results were the best we've recorded for this category. The 3D results at our Heaven and Valley tests (at 1,366-by-768 resolution, using the Medium graphics quality preset) didn't signal playability, but they were at least 10 frames per second (fps) faster than rivals'. You're not going to be playing Call of Duty in a squad car, but otherwise the R12 is one of the fastest rugged tablets we've reviewed. See How We Test Tablets The XSlate R12 lasted 8 hours, 59 minutes, on our battery rundown test. That certainly qualifies as all-day computing. That's only 15 minutes less than the Getac F110, our class leader, and several hours longer than any other tablet in this group. The Xplore XSlate R12 is a powerful and sturdy Windows tablet made for harsher conditions than the average business PC. It can handle high-stress environments where it has to survive being dropped, and with double the memory and storage, a much higher resolution screen, and good components, it's a strong performer now that you won't need to worry becoming obsolete anytime soon. For that reason, the XSlate R12 leapfrogs the Getac F110 as our new Editors' Choice for rugged Windows tablets.

Running The Intel NUC6i7KYK On Linux With Skylake Iris Pro Graphics Written by Michael Larabel in Computers on 29 December 2016. Page 1 of 2. 15 Comments I've managed to get my hands on an Intel NUC6i7KYK "Skull Canyon" NUC featuring the Core i7 6770HQ Skylake CPU with Iris Pro Graphics 580. When paired with 32GB of RAM and a Samsung 950 PRO 500GB NVMe SSD, it makes for a very speedy, small form factor Linux-friendly PC. This week I've started out testing the NUC6i7KYK under Linux. Many more benchmarks will come in the days ahead, just wanted to share some initial thoughts for those that may be looking at a post-holiday PC upgrade. This latest Intel NUC comes in a 211 x 116 x 28 mm sized enclosure, making it very slim while offering a lot of potential with the i7-6770HQ CPU, dual M.2 SATA3/NVMe SSD slots, dual channel DDR4-2133+ SO-DIMMs, Thunderbolt 3 / USB 3.1 Gen 2, Wireless-AC 8260 WiFi onboard, and HDMI 2.0 / mini DP 1.2 / DisplayPort 1.2 Type-C. This Core i7 Skylake NUC currently retails for $525 USD on Amazon without any storage or RAM. The Core i7-6770HQ is a quad-core CPU with Hyper Threading (eight logical cores), 2.6GHz base frequency, and 3.5GHz turbo frequency with a 45 Watt TDP. The onboard Iris Pro Graphics 580 have a base frequency of 350MHz and a maximum dynamic frequency of 950MHz. The Iris Pro Graphics 850 can support 4K displays -- 24Hz when using HDMI or 60Hz with DisplayPort. So far in my testing of this NUC6i7KYK, it's been working well with Linux. Ubuntu 16.10 has been my primary target thus far but will be running other distribution benchmarks in the days ahead -- in fact, will be using it for my year-end desktop/gaming distribution comparison on the Intel side. The wireless, Ethernet, UEFI, DP / HDMI, Iris Pro SKL 3D graphics, and all other key functionality has been working in my tests thus far with the only feature I haven't tested as of writing yet is the Thunderbolt 3.

Intel SGX Patch For GCC - Software Guard Extensions Written by Michael Larabel in Compiler on 29 December 2016 at 07:36 AM EST. 3 Comments Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) has been supported since the launch of Skylake CPUs while finally support for it is being added to the GCC compiler. Software Guard Extensions allow user code to allocate private regions of memory that becomes protected from higher-level processes too. Those wishing to learn more about SGX and their protection "enclaves" can visit software.intel.com to learn more. Going back to earlier this year has been SGX patches for the Linux kernel while now there's a patch adding the SGX intrinsics to the GNU Compiler Collection. The patch for now can be found here while the Intel developer awaits permission to land it in trunk for GCC7. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

(Client Computing Group). New Delhi: The last time Navin Shenoy, senior vice-president and general manager, Intel Corp. (Client Computing Group), was in India in 2012, Paytm was an unknown commodity. On a visit this month, he realized he can make payments to a fruit vendor instantly, which he thought was not possible in India 2-3 years ago. Such dramatic changes, including India’s adaptation of 4G and Digital India, make him an “unabashed India bull”. In an interview, Shenoy talked about the Indian IT industry, advent of Reliance Jio and technology evolution in India. Edited excerpts: How do you see growth in Indian IT especially with the current situation in this financial year? I’m an unabashed India bull as it pertains to prospects for technology in India and I am probably more of a bull than I have ever been largely because of the fact that India has even such a notion as the Digital India initiative from the prime minister and proliferated through the rest of the country. As I travel around the world, there are very few countries that have a digital initiative from the head of the country and so I think the recognition of the government that the digitization of the country is the only way to advancement for the next couple of years, decade is something obviously that we are aligning ourselves to… But if I think what is next for the Indian IT industry, it is really about much like other countries, a much broader proliferation of technologies. The cloud infrastructure in India is not ultimately where it needs to be, the computing infrastructure—many people have mobile phones but still don’t have computers. So I think as I look at the next few years, development in these areas is going to be important… I remember the last time, it’s been four years since I have been here, the fact that you can go to a fruit stand now and use PayTm to buy something, I would never have imagined we will be here so soon one or two or three years ago. So, I am bullish I guess and I guess the conditions are right for the technology industry to continue to grow here. It is the only way India will continue to grow at 7-8% in terms of GDP. What kind of impact do you see of Donald Trump winning US presidential elections on Indian IT industry? It is way too soon to say. It is a pretty broad leap to think of impact right now. There are a lot of unknowns. So we will see how it goes. At the end of the day, India has so much potential that political events are going to happen around the world all the time and there are going to be bumps but if you look in the long term, there is no doubt in my mind that technology is going to be inextricably linked with the progress in India. The two will go hand in hand, and like I said before I am an unabashed bull about how Intel will do in India and the course of how industry will develop in India. We are at a tipping point in India where the next 5-10 years are incredibly bright. You just talked about Paytm at a fruit shop. A lot of it is happening because of demonetisation, so what is your take on that especially considering digital and e-payment revolution that will step in? You think it’s positive for technology? I am not an expert on the demonetization policy. I can tell you that I think from a government point of view, it’s a bold step and probably the right step for India in the long run. But with as most bold steps, there is going to be some bumps. Ultimately it’s inextricably linked with technology, you cannot do demonetisation and not also apply technology in a much broader way. I think it will accelerate the adoption of e payment and modernization of banking system. The fact that 90% plus of the transactions in India are done through cash is not how you build a technology economy, you have to be able to leverage technology. This new company Reliance Jio is bringing its network entirely on 4G LTE. What is your take on it? I think they have been incredibly disruptive, I think they chose to do it in a way that is going to at some point be written about in business school case studies because they did a pan-India service, free voice service, they did their own hardware devices. They really thought it through really well. And I think they have probably accelerated it, it was inevitable that it was going to happen at some point but they have acted as an accelerator. When do you see 5G coming to India? I have that conversation with Reliance. You know the prime minister here is pretty progressive when it comes to technology and I think it will be interesting to see how quickly India moves but I don’t have an exact date but based on everything I have seen so far, it certainly won’t lag the rest of the world like 4G did. I think India will be closer to the 5G evolution and transformation as opposed to kind of later on as perhaps it was on 4G. And what would 5G mean to your business in India? It will accelerate our business in a major way—5G will be much different than the 4G transition. The 4G transitions were largely about mobile phones and computers. The 5G transition will have a much bigger impact because it will be about infrastructure that will get deployed, it will be about automobiles being connected to the Internet, it will be about hospitals being connected to the Internet, it will be about drones being connected to the Internet and literally about every electronic device being connected to the Internet in some way, IOT (Internet of Things) devices and so I think will have a much broader impact on transformation which will be one of the reasons why government and enterprises in India will adopt 5G much faster.

Oh, and it was thirsty for power requiring 2V of power.   Intel and AMD have a massive CES ahead of them next week, but a 7700K at 7GHz does sound delicious. Now give me that with all cores enabled, less power consumption, and an AIO cooler that keeps it cool enough and I'm happy.

Reuters/Robert Galbraith Lenovo is doing one better than its competition by offering Intel’s Optane solid state drive, which boasts to be better than current SSDs and DRAM. The upgrade will be optional for several products, including the ThinkPad Yoga and ThinkPad 13, as well as the upcoming ThinkPad T570. READ: Lenovo ThinkPad laptops getting Windows Precision trackpads, Kaby lake processors & Windows Hello; Business laptops to offer Intel Optane SSDs Lenovo is going to be one of the first companies to offer products with Intel’s Optane SSD option. This piece of technology uses Intel and Micron’s 3D XPoint technology, which reportedly allows for faster and more long-term storage when compared to traditional SSDs. The company promised that various items will begin shipping out before the end of the year. At this point, however, the Optane storage technology is still more expensive than standard options, so Lenovo is offering the same as a choice for 16GB worth of additional cache. The update is possible with the ThinkPad Yoga, ThinkPad 13, T, L and X units. The same will also be fitted into the ThinkPad T570, which is one of the company’s upcoming products. The upcoming laptop boasts of stellar specs and features, which Computer World has reported to include a configuration for 4K touch display. It will also house Nvidia’s GeForce 940 MX discrete graphics chip and will be powered by Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processor. The screen will be 15.6 inch. However, Intel’s Optane technology is what will really set it apart.

The three targeted at least seven major international law firms that had been retained by companies to advise on deals and successfully got into the e-mail accounts of senior lawyers at two of the firms, according to the indictment unsealed yesterday. They profited on deals and speculation involving the drug maker Intermune, chipmaker Intel Corp. and business services company Pitney Bowes Inc., the U.S. said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also sued and is seeking an asset freeze. The case places law firms among the widening group of targets for cybercriminals seeking to profit from insider information. Last year, the U.S. broke up an international ring of hackers who allegedly infiltrated the computer servers of PRNewswire Association LLC, Marketwired and Business Wire and stole market-moving press releases before they were published. According to the SEC, the group, which included Ukrainians and a Georgian, made more than $100 million from trading on the information. “This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in the statement. The three men – Iat Hong and Chin Hung, 50, of Macau, and Bo Zheng, 30, of China – worked at a robotics company that was started by Zheng, according to the government. Hong, 26, was arrested in Hong Kong on Christmas Day and is awaiting extradition. The SEC is also seeking to freeze an account registered in Hong’s mother’s name. In addition to the law firms, they also hacked other robotics companies, the U.S. said. They allegedly stole schematic designs of a robot vacuum cleaner made by a U.S. company. The three generally used the same tactics to get the information, according to the U.S. They would get the log-in credentials of an employee and place malware on a server that allowed them to access the e-mails of key people at the firms and companies, according to the indictment. In a one-day period in 2014, they took 10 gigabytes of confidential data from one law firm’s server, the U.S. said. They weren’t always successful, the U.S. said. During one six-month period in 2015, the three men allegedly tried on more than 100,000 occasions to break into the networks of five law firms. The law firms weren’t identified in the complaints. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP and Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP were among the targeted law firms. Amy Fantini, a Weil, Gotshal & Manges spokeswoman, declined to comment on the charges. Cravath Swaine & Moore didn’t respond to a request for comment. The three men allegedly bought shares of Intermune based on the information gleaned from the hacked data. Though the deal didn’t close, they still made money as shares rose on media reports that the company was seeking a tie-up, the U.S. said. Intermune was ultimately purchased by Roche AG. Cravath advised Intermune on the deal. In another deal, the group allegedly bought shares in chipmaker Altera Corp. after Intel had retained one of the law firms to advise on an acquisition. They scored $1.4 million in profits on the trade amid media reports of the pending deal, and sold their shares before it was publicly announced, according to the indictment. Weil Gotshal was one of the law firms advising Intel on the deal. Using information gleaned from a second law firm, the trio also bought shares of Borderfree, an online commerce site that was an acquisition target of Pitney Bowes, the U.S. said. They made a profit of $841,000 on the trades after the deal was announced on May 18, 2015, according to the indictment. Prior to the Borderfree takeover, Hong and Chin bought so much of the company’s stock that on certain days the two accounted for 25 percent or more of the company’s trading volume, according to the SEC complaint.

This apparently has to do with the company waiting for Intel's Kaby Lake processors to become available, since they will draw less power hence aiding battery life. Months have passed and today we get a new rumor on the matter, which goes into a little bit more detail. The Surface Pro 5 is now said to be launching in the first quarter of next year, so before the end of March. Additionally, the device will reportedly have a 4K UHD touchscreen and magnetic charging stylus. Pegatron Technology will manufacture the new Surface for Microsoft, and it should have a starting price of $899 - though for that amount of cash you might not be getting the 4K screen, which could be relegated to only the top of the line model costing $1,599.

For the year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 13.5 percent, the highest increase since 2013. The Dow finished just under the 20,000 milestone at 19,763 after hitting a record high of 19,988 on Dec. 20. On Friday the index of 30 blue chips declined 57.18 points. The S&P 500 closed with a gain of 9.4 percent for the year to end at 2,238.83, a 10.43 points drop from Thursday's close. The Nasdaq finished the year with a gain of 7.5 percent at 5,383.12, a decline of 48.97. In light trading, the information technology sector led the declines, dropping 1 percent Friday, including Apple, Microsoft and Intel. The top sector this year was energy, which was up 23.4 percent, follow by financials at 19.1 percent and telecommunications services at 17.1 percent. Health care was the only sector at close the year down -- 4.2 percent -- as President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-dominated Congress vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. Earlier in the year, the stock market was hurt by a recession scare, Brexit and the U.S. presidential campaign. But stocks have rallied 8 percent since Trump's election on Nov. 8. "U.S. equities are ending 2016 in a reasonably good position," Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, wrote in an email to CNBC. "Prices have been remarkably resilient throughout the year, overcoming early-year weakness and ongoing uncertainty to end the year near all-time highs; the U.S. economy appears to be in a Goldilocks zone; and earnings are on the cusp of increasing." The Dow industrial have nearly tripled since the financial crisis when it hit a low of 6547.05 in March 2009, two months after Barack Obama took office. "Now comes the hard part," said Lew Piantedosi, portfolio manager at Eaton Vance, told The Wall Street Journal. "What are these policies actually going to look like? That's where the true uncertainty lies." U.S. crude oil is now at $53.72 a barrel, up 45 percent in 2016 and its best year since 2009. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show crude oil inventories in the United States increased 614,000 barrels last week. The Federal Reserve didn't raise interest rates until Dec. 14 for the first time since the end of 2015. The target is half to three-quarters percent and the Fed plans to increase rates by another three quarters of a point in three stages in 2017.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Rumor: Unlocked Core i3 CPU will be late to the Kaby Lake party by Zak Killian  12:30 PM on December 30, 2016 Remember that Intel Core i3-7350K that the rumor mill was talking about a while back? According to a post on Japanese tech news site Hermitage Akihabara, if that CPU exists, it won't be joining the rest of Intel's seventh-generation processors at launch time. The site says that shipments of the new chips have already arrived in shops, but that certain models, including the 7350K, are absent from the lineup. The site seems quite confident that desktop Kaby Lake CPUs will be going up for sale next Friday on January 6. Earlier rumors pegged the Core i3-7350K at around $175, but Hermitage Akihabara lists the chip at 25,000¥ ($214). However, the site also says that the prices it lists are higher than expected due to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen. We're enthusiastic about the prospect of an unlocked Core i3 processor here at TR. We've long felt that higher clocks are superior to more cores for most scenarios, and we keep recommending the Core i3-6100 in our System Guides as the budget CPU to have. However, the purportedly high price of the Core i3-7350K makes the rumored chip look a little silly when a Core i5-6600K can be had for just a few dollars more.

Broadwell HD Graphics 5500 Delivering Similar Vulkan/OpenGL Performance Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 30 December 2016 at 11:41 AM EST. 7 Comments With having out a Core i7 "Broadwell" ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptop for the MoCA 2.0 network tests, I decided to run some end-of-year graphics tests on this Core i7 5600U system with OpenGL and Vulkan. The last time I had out this particular system with i7-5600 CPU sporting HD Graphics 5500, the Vulkan experience wasn't really working out at that time. But a half-year has passed and now it's in better shape for this low-power ultrabook. I ran tests with the Linux 4.10 and Mesa 13.1-devel Git stacks atop Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64. The HD Graphics 5500 on this i7-5600U ultrabook aren't the fastest, but at 800 x 600 for Dota 2 we see the performance is about the same between the Vulkan and OpenGL drivers. Still close at 1280 x 1024. The performance is rather low, but those are the numbers for those always craving fresh Intel graphics results. Unfortunately no Talos Principle results for Vulkan as the game was hanging in this configuration. Still working on some other fresh tests with Iris Pro Graphics as well as the Skylake HD Graphics that provide for more playable Linux OpenGL/Vulkan gaming experience. Great to see overall though how the Intel "ANV" Vulkan driver has matured this year and is quite a competent driver while the i965 Mesa driver has also advanced in 2016 to supporting OpenGL 4.5, performance optimizations, and other improved functionality. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Dec 30, 2016 at 11:50AM Stephen Hawking calls it the "biggest event in human history." So why are "in-the-know" investors so excited that hardly anyone has heard about "Tier Zero" yet? Because it means they believe there is still time to profit wildly from the global phenomenon that's about to take off. But you should hurry – because after 18 months of extensive research into the subject it's clear that this opportunity may not be around much longer. People are starting to catch on quickly. After traversing the globe from Norway to Las Vegas, meeting with dozens of CEOs and thought leaders, losing countless hours of sleep to research papers and SEC filings, it hit me. All signs were pointing to one little known company at the center of this opportunity. I'm sure you'll share my excitement at this discovery soon. But first, have you ever heard the expression "History doesn't repeat itself. But it rhymes"? Well I think it's hogwash. History DOES repeat itself. I've seen it, and you have, too. As you know, the world has experienced three major tech revolutions over the last 50 years. Each one looks identical. There is a phase of early development, then early adoption, and suddenly skyrocketing usage. Meanwhile early investors get wealthier, and wealthier, and wealthier as the technologies go mainstream. The first was the explosive growth of computer sales. And as you already know, earlier investors in companies like Intel and Microsoft did very, very well, For every $1,000 you put into Intel in their IPO , you'd have over $275,000 today  (and a nice stream of dividend income to boot!). Microsoft IPO investors have done even better, turning $1,000 into over half a million dollars.    Second came the growth of the Internet, connecting our homes, devices, and the world around us. Meanwhile Internet-based companies like Amazon.com and Netflix soared over 40,000%  and nearly 10,000%,  making early investors (I know a few) extremely happy. Most recently we've seen the mobile revolution, which has led to smartphones, tablets, and other countless devices that rely on microchip transistors. Early investors in this revolution (I know a few more!) made a killing on companies like Intuitive Surgical (up more than 3,000%) and Salesforce (up almost 2,000 %). I've spoken with some of those early investors, and after showing them the chart below they all agree – Tier Zero is the next revolution that's taking off. And in many ways it may be the last. By now it's obvious why this opportunity is so thrilling, and you're probably ready to learn the name of the company these early investors think is at the white-hot center of this revolution. Because if Stephen Hawking, my 18 months of research, and those other early investors I spoke to are correct... Tier Zero is going to be an absolutely incredible opportunity – IF you act before mainstream investors catch on.

Aside from our routine and original kernel feature overview articles each cycle, here is a look at just the most popular news items pertaining to the Linux kernel that were published on Phoronix in 2016: Btrfs RAID 5/6 Code Found To Be Very Unsafe & Will Likely Require A Rewrite It turns out the RAID5 and RAID6 code for the Btrfs file-system's built-in RAID support is faulty and users should not be making use of it if you care about your data. Is The Linux Kernel Scheduler Worse Than People Realize? A number of Phoronix readers have been pointing out material to indicate that the Linux kernel scheduler isn't as good as most people would assume. Linux 4.7 - Btrfs vs. EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. XFS vs. NTFS Benchmarks Continuing on from yesterday's Linux 4.4 To 4.7 - EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. Btrfs Benchmarks comparison, here is a wider look at mainline file-systems on the Linux 4.7. File-systems tested on the NVMe SSD included Btrfs, EXT4, F2FS, XFS, and NTFS. Well Known Linux Kernel Developer Recommends Against Buying Skylake Systems Well known Linux kernel developer Matthew Garrett who has led the charge for a number of years about UEFI/SecureBoot issues, poorly secured devices, and more, has taken aim now at Intel's latest-generation "Skylake" systems. Some Distributions Are Already Making Changes To Linux's Scheduler Already it's looking like the research from the recently covered The Linux Scheduler: a Decade of Wasted Cores that called out the Linux kernel in being a poor scheduler is having an impact. The Best Features Of The Linux 4.8 Kernel If all goes according to plan, the Linux 4.8 kernel will be officially released this afternoon by Linus Torvalds. OrangeFS Lands In Linux 4.6 Kernel A new file-system has been merged for the Linux 4.6 kernel. The Thousands Of FIXMEs & TODOs In The Linux Kernel Canonical's Colin King has looked at the number of FIXME and TODO comments within the Linux kernel tree. The Features That Landed So Far In The Linux 4.6 Kernel We are a little more than half-way through the Linux 4.6 kernel merge window so here's a quick look at the new changes and features that have made it into the code-base for this next major kernel release. How Ubuntu 16.10 With Linux 4.8/4.9 Compares To Early 3.x Kernels When having out the Core i5 "Sandy Bridge" HP EliteBook this weekend besides comparing fresh OpenGL numbers to early Sandy Bridge results going back to 2012, I also compared Ubuntu 16.10 / Linux 4.8 and Linux 4.9 compared to older kernel benchmarks I did with the same system. A Stable Linux Kernel API/ABI? "The Most Insane Proposal" For Linux Development For some lighthearted weekend reading and sure to make for some interesting discussions in the forums is what was volleyed today onto the kernel mailing list: "The most insane proposal in regard to the Linux kernel development." It's about shaking up the way the Linux kernel development happens, but almost surely the proposal won't end up resulting in changes. Six Interesting Features Of The Linux 4.6 Kernel If all goes well before the day is through will be the release of the Linux 4.6 kernel. If you've been behind on your Phoronix readings the past few weeks, here are the highlights to look forward to with Linux 4.6.

DJI led the way with Mavic Pro, a gadget that made huge improvements on the size and simplicity of a powerful camera drone. It fits into a jacket pocket while delivering four miles of range and advanced autonomous features. While DJI was climbing to new heights, a lot of its competition stumbled Unfortunately, while DJI was climbing to new heights, a lot of its competition stumbled badly. 3D Robotics, which last year seemed like the most promising competitor to the throne, more or less abandoned the consumer drone market after its Solo drone delivered disappointing sales. The heavy investment and manufacturing snafus that came with creating this product put 3D Robotics on the ropes. GoPro was the other big name company based in the US to try its hand at a drone. There was a lot to like about its Karma drone. It offered a package that combined an action camera, handheld stabilizer, and aerial capture system. And it had the marketing muscle and retail experience to move a lot of product. Sadly, when its drones started falling out of the sky, GoPro quickly recalled the Karma. Drones became a staple prop in YouTube videos and branded experiences Yuneec, a Chinese startup backed by Intel, managed to put out a unit that could autonomously sense and avoid obstacles, putting it on par with DJI. But its Typhoon H, a bulky, six-rotor aircraft that comes in a massive carrying case, was simple too much, too late, to compete with the smaller, more sophisticated units coming to market from DJI. Drones stayed in the public eye, becoming a staple prop in YouTube videos and branded experiences. Disneyland is planning to put them in the sky as a high tech light show, and Samsung paid Casey Neistat to be airlifted by drone around a ski slope. Delivery drones completed a lot of firsts, from a 7-Eleven run in Nevada to a burrito drop in Virginia. Amazon got a package to customers in Cambridge, claiming a total time of 13 minutes between a customer clicking purchase and the package arriving in their backyard. And drones were used for humanitarian missions, helping to move blood across Rwanda and antivenom in rural Australia. 2016 in drones averages somewhere between A+ level successes and some C- stinkers. I’ve got high hopes for 2017, especially if the industry can find ways to continue shrinking the form factor of consumer quadcopters so they feel more like smartphones. It also might be time for some of these companies to think outside the box, bringing what they’ve learned in the sky to land and sea. Drones, like driverless cars, are really an expression of the advances happening in robotics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Their killer use case for the average consumer is still waiting to be discovered.

Then again, 2016 itself started on a highly optimistic note, having succeeded the bland 2015 and started with the traditional gala event of the tech calendar that was the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. CES 2016 was the January harbinger of what was to come: we thought it'd be a fresh dose of techno optimism, with a shot or two of smarter cars and homes, but it ended up a distressing series of unhappy events. So let's look back on it! (If only for the sake of closure.) HP EliteBook Folio Amelia Holowaty Krales Laptops promised much, but delivered a great deal less When we, The Verge's editorial staff, were having our Verge Awards debate for CES 2016, the richest field of candidates was laptops. There were just so many appealing and attractive new options, each one of them thinner than the other, each a little bit sleeker and more refined. We liked Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Yoga a lot, especially with its gorgeous new OLED screen. Then we were charmed by the HP EliteBook Folio, which looked like a very legitimate Windows alternative to Apple's MacBook - only with the added benefit of two USB-C ports rather than just one. Progress, we thought. My personal highlight from among the bunch was the Razer Blade Stealth, the gaming company's first ever ultrabook, which also capitalized on USB-C's greater bandwidth to introduce an awesome concept: a universally compatible graphics card dock, which would allow mobile gamers to hook up a full-bloodied desktop GPU to their ultraportable laptop. With a pretty, high-resolution display and a handsome matte-black finish, the Blade Stealth promised to be a modular realization of one of the oldest dreams in PC-land: a gaming laptop without performance limitations or enormous size. Related Lenovo’s X1 laptop line gets even better with OLED screens and a folding hinge HP's EliteBook Folio is like a MacBook that runs Windows Razer’s first ultrabook wants to be your only gaming PC Razer Blade Stealth Tom Warren Alas, as 2016 ticked on, it became clear that none of our favored laptop heroes would live up to their initial hype. The Blade Stealth suffered from substantial delays to the Razer Core, the GPU dock that made it more than just another ultrabook, and the Core was mightily priced at $499 ($399 when purchased alongside a Razer laptop). Expected around April, it wasn't until the latter half of the year that the Core was properly available, by which point there was already a fresh revision of the Blade Stealth, though even the September update didn't improve the ultrabook's battery life to the point of competing with better alternatives in the ultralight category. HP's EliteBook Folio turned out to be a case study in the compromises inherent in building such an exceedingly thin machine. Intel's Core M was an inadequate processor for what this 4K laptop was trying to do, and the battery was a letdown too. Together with software issues and a high price tag, these factors combined to make the Folio, the eventual product, a major disappointment relative to the Folio as a CES exhibition item. One trait shared by the EliteBook and Blade Stealth was the absence of an SD card slot - so we can blame these computers for kickstarting the trend that would eventually infect Apple's updated MacBook Pro range later in the year as well. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Tom Warren The ThinkPad X1 Yoga that we coveted at CES offered the fewest unhappy surprises of the bunch. Its OLED display remained a highlight, but it was surrounded by a machine with unsatisfying battery life and a series of smaller issues. With a price tag north of $1,800 just to jump on the OLED bandwagon, the X1 Yoga remained a positive step toward the future of laptops, but not something any of us could feel comfortable recommending as a purchase. Related Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga review: tomorrow's display in yesterday's laptop HP EliteBook Folio review: chasing the MacBook Razer Blade Stealth review: What happens when gamers make a regular laptop? Faraday Future Cars took over the vaporous hype crown Wanna hear a CES joke? Faraday Future. This Chinese-funded EV company came to steal the show at CES, and it promptly did, but that was mostly through bemusement. It didn't have a car to show, other than a hyper-stylized supercar concept, and it only floated a bunch of visionary promises about our future electric mobility. CES 2017 is supposed to be the stage where Faraday finally unveils something approximating a production vehicle, but the company’s buildup to the show has been calamitous. Executives are leaving, funding is dwindling, and the project that appeared transparently vaporous during CES 2016 seems set to completely fizzle out at some point in 2017. Related Behind the scenes at Faraday Future, an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse Two top Faraday Future executives just resigned Another shake-up at Faraday Future, as ‘global CEO’ departs Audi contributed to the sense of unreality around CES autos with its VR car configuration experience. To be fair, that looks like a very compelling application of virtual reality — having people soak up the most realistic visuals of their anticipated future car — though it’s destined for a rather small audience in high-end auto showrooms. For now at least, the VR experience of designing your own Audi is a niche utility for a small group of moneyed individuals. The positive way to look at this, though, is that these VR additions to the acts of purchasing and owning a car seem destined to grow in number and availability. So while this is another example of ephemeral autos, at least it’s a good one. Chevy Bolt The biggest exception to the downbeat notes coming out of CES 2016 has been Chevy’s Bolt. It took The Verge’s Best in Show award by combining affordability with practicality and long range — it’s the closest we’ve yet come to a hassle-free electric vehicle that can truly replace the traditional everyday petrol guzzler. Mind you, the jury’s still out on the Bolt, whose first delivery only just arrived in December 2016, and a full national rollout across the United States won’t happen until the middle of 2017. Related The Chevy Bolt will start at $29,995 after federal tax credit The Chevy Bolt is electric, but that's not the really good part First Chevy Bolt is delivered in Tesla’s backyard Misfit Ray James Bareham Wearables failed to answer the "why does this exist?" question Each and every year at CES, wearable technology has been the court jester of the show. Whether it’s clunky plastic 3D glasses, (bad) Android smartphones transmogrified into enormous Android smartwatches, or a billion of dubious fitness and health-tracking gadgets, you can rest assured the clowniest products will be wearable. The best we could muster during CES 2016 was a roundup of wearables that aren’t ugly. Most trends in 2016 were moves away from wearables. As good as GoPro’s adventure cameras were, it turned out that there weren’t all that many extreme-action enthusiasts, and so the undisputed leader in a nascent category — with an undoubtedly good product — found itself floundering financially. Nikon arrived at CES 2016 with its own action camera, the KeyMission 360, but that spent most of the year as just a promise, and it was only in September that the company announced a price: $499. Let’s just say that the category of wearable action cams isn’t set to grow dramatically anytime soon. Related Don’t expect battery life miracles in wearables anytime soon Those 'mind-reading' EEG headsets definitely can't read your thoughts Three CES wearables that actually aren't ugly The typical CES fodder of weird stuff like EEG headsets was also apparent, but the biggest subset of wearables was the wrist-worn fitness tracker. We most liked the Misfit Ray, primarily because it was stylish enough to be worn without embarrassment, however a major hurdle still holds most other wrist gadgets back. Battery life. The smaller and more elegant a piece of technology becomes, the less space it has to fit a battery on the inside, and our findings from CES 2016 confirmed that this universal rule wasn’t being broken. Until we figure out even more exceptionally power-efficient technology, or one of those magical battery breakthroughs that we keep waiting for, wearables will remain compromised. Dieter Bohn in Fallout 4 It wasn’t all terrible Just like 2016, CES wasn’t a simple black canvas of despair. On the TV front, OLED and HDR technologies stepped forth as the confirmed standards of our future, higher-fidelity visual delights. Netflix announced a major expansion. LG rolled out a rollable display that portends well for our more distant future. Failed mobile operating systems found a new home on TVs, truly wireless earbuds got a year of growth and improvement started on a positive note, and the weird fridges that make life worth living were back in vogue. CES is still the destination to visit when you want to let your imagination about the future of technology run wild, and even as the number of successful commercial products coming out of it remains low, the auguries about where the industry is headed are always there to be found. Here’s hoping 2017 can retain the weird and fantastical edge while delivering a few more products that we can, and actually want to, buy.

Tech Culture by Sean Hollister December 27, 2016 5:00 AM PST @starfire2258 Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Here's a New Year's resolution for tech companies: Stop ruining things by releasing them early. Yes, I know it's tempting to test the waters and beat competition to the punch, but what if things go bad? What if your drone falls out of the sky? What if your smartphone explodes? What if someone dies using your app? What if your pocket-monster-chasing game is actually a huge global sensation, but software bugs and missing features keep it from being more than a fad? Enlarge Image The infamous Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Photo by Josh Miller/CNET In 2016, every one of those things actually happened. So maybe 2016 is the year we all learn the lesson. These days, companies expect us to buy unfinished "beta" products and then spend our time helping them work out the kinks. Usually, this pays off because we don't notice minor flaws in the products, or aren't bothered enough to get our money back. We instead just lust after new gadgets, buy into the hype, throw so much money at the next big thing that companies promise even more products and features that they can't deliver on time. Not without taking a few shortcuts, that is. But this year, a whole lot of rushed, unfinished products failed in some pretty spectacular ways -- ways that may make people think twice about trusting the companies that made them. For instance: Would you buy a drone from GoPro, knowing that the company's first drone got pulled from shelves in November for a tendency to fall out of the sky? GoPro recalls Karma drones because of power problems Less than three weeks after going on sale, GoPro's first drone is pulled as the company offers refunds and searches for a fix. by Bridget Carey 1:16 Close Drag How many years do you think it will be before Samsung recovers from the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, when apparently a too-big, too-tight battery caused over 100 phones to burst into flames? (Particularly after the supposedly safe replacement phones also caught on fire?) Would you give your children a McDonald's Happy Meal gadget, after the company's cheap-o fitness tracker, introduced in August, was found to irritate some people's skin? How about buying a Samsung or GE washing machine -- after some Samsung models shook themselves to pieces or in the case of GE, caught fire? With so many examples like these in 2016, maybe companies will think twice about rushing their products to market. Galaxy Note 7 fires may be to blame on tight battery An independent engineering consultancy firm says Samsung was too aggressive in the design of the Note 7, taking design risks that led to the phones overheating. by Bridget Carey 1:31 Close Drag Particularly companies that use lithium-ion batteries; between the devastating hoverboard fires, the embarrassing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fires and Intel's overheating Basis Peak fitness tracker -- all three were recalled this year -- you'd best believe brands are going to be extra careful with products that use flammable energy cells. But 2016 wasn't just the year of huge consumer recalls. (Also see: exploding Takata airbag inflators and Cuisinart food processor blades.) Plenty of unfinished products shot themselves in the foot without consumer protection agencies needing to get involved. Would you rely on Tesla's Autopilot self-steering car feature, after this driver's fatal crash while using the beta in May? As one backer put it, "Seriously, @scanadu? So you effectively charged me $200 for the privilege of participating in your private study. #scam" Photo by Scanadu Would you ever buy anything from Scanadu, the company that shipped a $200 (roughly £160 in the UK or AU$280 in Australia) smartphone-connected medical sensor without first getting FDA approval -- meaning those $200 devices are about to become useless paperweights? (The company isn't offering refunds, either.) Will you rush to download the latest Apple software updates, now that you know they can occasionally brick your watch, tablet or phone? Do you trust your Samsung water-resistant phone to actually be water-resistant, after the first batch of Samsung Galaxy S7 Active phones weren't? Do you think maybe Electronic Arts wishes it hadn't shipped an early beta of its big new game, Titanfall 2, only a couple months before launch -- which convinced some of the original games' biggest, most vocal fans to write it off? (Reports suggest the game has sold poorly.) And do you think the creators of Pokemon Go wish they hadn't squandered its massive global popularity on server issues, bugs and missing features that drove players away? Do you think Uber should maybe have tried to work with regulators before it built a fleet of self-driving cars that are now banned from California roads? Enlarge Image Uber had to pull its fleet of self-driving cars from California roads, after the DMV revoked their registrations. Photo by James Martin/CNET It didn't have to be this way. With a little more time in the oven and a little more thought in 2016, these brands might have saved their products, their reputations and maybe even lives in the process. (The creators of Pokemon Go didn't respond to concerns about road safety until two Japanese pedestrians were allegedly hit and killed by truck drivers playing the game -- despite their previous game, Ingress, already having a speed limit feature which could have saved them.) I'm not saying every product has to be fully tested before it gets released to the public. Some, like the voice recognition software that powers the Google Home voice-activated speaker, genuinely need real people to use it for years before it can work well -- and video games like Titanfall 2 can genuinely benefit from player feedback in an early beta release. But too many games use their "betas" as just one more marketing vehicle to help sell people on the final product -- and too many companies aren't testing their physical gadgets properly. (I'm also willing to bet that if Google Home had waited for Netflix support, it would have been much better received.) For their own sake, these companies need to slow down and build better products, but we also need to reward the ones that do. We need to stop throwing our money at ideas, and only spend it on finished products with excellent reviews and solid customer support. We need to be willing to pay extra for a finished, quality product instead of jumping on an early bird deal.

Laptop news site LaptopMedia spotted the device listed as having won a Taiwan Excellence Award for 2017. The new Asus ROG laptop offers a most impressive specification with a surprisingly slim profile. The machine is dubbed the GX501, so it's a refresh of an older model. However, the pictured device doesn't look much like its ancestor. Inside the new Asus ROG GX501 there is a latest generation Intel CPU, likely to be a Core i7-7700HQ thinks the source publication. This machine is built around a 15.6-inch screen with 4K UHD (3840 x 2160 pixels) resolution and Nvidia G-Sync support. Previously people pondered over the value of such high resolution screens in gaming laptops but Asus is leveraging an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU which will definitely be up to some 4K gaming action. As per the headline, probably one of the most eye catching specs of this impressive laptop is its thickness. Asus has managed to create the 'thinnest laptop ever with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU' installed. It is said to be just 16.65mm thick. Compact form factors usually need special cooling considerations, and looking at the picture there's what looks like a large perforated area above the keyboard which is probably designed to let warm air rise quickly away from your PC. In other specs revealed we see that the system supports up to 24GB of DDR4 RAM and is equipped with a PCIe x4 NVMe SSD. The picture also shows a very interesting keyboard / numpad layout where a numpad grid can be toggled to function within the touch-pad area to the right. At the time of writing the Taiwan Excellence Award website designers seem to have removed details concerning the Asus ROG GX501. Pricing and availability are as yet unknown.

Posted by Myss_tree - Fri 30 Dec 2016 16:37 Too much (and dated looking) bezel. Posted by Slogbelly - Fri 30 Dec 2016 22:37 I agree that the huge space between the keyboard and the screen is a bit odd. No touchpad either? That's odd. Posted by RT-XD - Sat 31 Dec 2016 02:28 I think the touchpad is put together with the numpad. Doesn't look like any buttons are there, just a faint print of a numpad… That space between the keyboard and screen is very odd as well. Posted by Xlucine - Sat 31 Dec 2016 13:15 There is a touchpad, and a numpad.

Deze crossplatform-mediacentersoftware wordt ontwikkeld voor Windows, macOS, Linux, Android en iOS. In versie 17.0 is de mogelijkheid voor het afspelen van 10bit- en hevc-materiaal toegevoegd, in combinatie met gpu's van Intel of Nvidia die daar ondersteuning voor bieden. Ook de standaardskin is gewijzigd naar Estuary en voor apparaten met een aanraakscherm is dat Estouchy geworden. Een uitgebreid overzicht over de veranderingen die we in versie 17 kunnen verwachten is op deze pagina te vinden, dit is de aankondiging voor deze uitgave: Kodi v17.0 “Krypton” Release Candidate 1 We want to close the year 2016 with a blast and as such we are happy to announce this Release Candidate of Kodi v17.0 Krypton. This final Kodi v17.0 will be action packed with a lot of features, changes and bug fixes and we left no stone unturned. Nearly every section had at least some maintenance done to make Kodi better than it already was. First and foremost we sure would like to thank every one involved with either development, testing or simply helping out others with answering their questions. Now that is done lets look at the biggest changes that were done.

Dat was een draak van een skin. Het navigeren met de afstandsbediening vind ik soms wel wat vaag. Reageer +1 gjmi @Dalike • 30 december 2016 13:38 Dat logo is van een add-on waarmee je tweakers.nl video's kunt bekijken Dat hoeft niet van het Kodi-team te komen.

Reageer +1 kibje @faxityy • 30 december 2016 16:40 Installeren over je huidige installatie heen, de databases worden dan geupgradet.

Reageer +1 __Kevind__ @faxityy • 30 december 2016 21:41 Anders maak je met de backup addon ff een goede backup. Zelf al diverse keren gedaan. Werkt prima Reageer +1 dvdmeer 30 december 2016 15:13 Nog steeds een mooi systeem. Heb het nog steeds met veel plezier draaien op m'n Cubox. Alleen jammer dat 'ie nog wel eens crasht. Videos die 'ie niet afspeelt. Teller loopt dus lijkt alsof 'ie aan het spelen is maar sta dan nog steeds op het menu en kan ook browsen. Vervolgens druk ik nogmaals op de video en dan hangt het systeem. Of bij sommige foto's dan reboot m'n hele libreelec systeem gewoon spontaan.

Ja die zullen even het verschil niet meer begrijpen. Is dat de schuld van de Kodi developers of van die lui die werkelijk alles aanpassen aan de software behalve het enige wat ze móeten aanpassen ? Tijd voor alle gebruikers om eens luidkeels te gaan klagen bij de producenten van die streaming troep, dat ze gewoon een keer lekker de applicatie hernoemen. [Reactie gewijzigd door kibje op 30 december 2016 16:50] Reageer +1 foxathome @kibje • 1 januari 2017 19:00 Sorry hoor, maar ook ik pas mijn Kodi aan en dat hoeft dus zeker niet altijd te gaan om een piracy-box model! Het is nu eenmaal zo dat je rekening moet houden met al je gebruikers toch? Dus nee, het gaat hier zeker niet alleen om streaming troep, maar gewoon het gebruik van ADD-ONS en daar is Kodi juist groot door geworden... Jammer dat mensen dan gaan minnen terwijl het gewoon klopt wat ik zeg... Te snel je conclusies trekken en niet verder doordenken dan dat die optie voor ADD-ONS er niet voor niets in zit.... Reageer -1 t0mt0m18 30 december 2016 19:10 +1 Ortep @t0mt0m18 • 30 december 2016 23:12 Ik gebruik het al jaren op mijn laptop (Windows) en op mijn HTPC (OpenElec) en ook op mijn tablet (Android) . Ik krijg dat soort meldingen nooit. Waar heb jij de software vandaan? i een of andere vage bron? Reageer +1 JackDashwood @t0mt0m18 • 31 december 2016 01:57 Het is de bedoeling dat je Kodi gebruikt met eigen (legale) content, die bijvoorbeeld op een NAS staat. Niet met die add-ons die je illegale bagger streams geven. Als je dus Kodi gebruikt op de manier waarvoor het gemaakt is dan is het wel degelijke de perfecte en stabiele media-center voor je woonkamer.

[x] Countdown to 2017 with HEXUS and ARM [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Tablets Laptop System Builders News 3 Microsoft Surface Pro 5 planned for Q1 2017 says report by Mark Tyson on 30 December 2016, 11:05 Tags: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadcon Add to My Vault: The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet hybrid was launched alongside the first Surface Book 2-in-1 laptop back in October 2015. These two Microsoft designed devices have proved popular with their flexibility and portable power, based upon the Intel Skylake architecture. With the launch of Intel's Kaby Lake mobile processors in August many were expecting a thorough refresh of the Surface portable range within short order but Microsoft has yet to satisfy its enthusiasts' new tech hunger. Today a report from Taiwan suggests that the launch of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is planned for Q1 2017. DigiTimes is reporting that Pegatron Technology has been hired to make the new device. However, it notes that Quanta Computer has also been considered as a manufacturer for the next generation Surface tablet hybrid. Quanta's fate regarding the possible contract is not known at this time. There are very few details about what the new Surface Pro 5 might deliver. An obvious upgrade would be the move from the Skylake to the Kaby Lake architecture and we can assume that will happen. As for features, DigiTimes quotes a Chinese-language Economic Daily News report as suggesting Microsoft will equip the Surface Pro 5 with an UltraHD display. A new stylus is expected too, which this time around will be magnetic and wirelessly charged. A couple of days ago it was noted by the same source that Microsoft's top end Surface Studio AiO has sold better than expected. Industry planners estimated the AiOs would sell about 15,000 units in its first period of availability (Q4 2016). The expectation was down to the premium pricing of Microsoft's debut AiO machines. However it looks like double that number have been ordered, so for Q1 2017 Microsoft has ordered a further 30,000 units to be produced.

May finally be the time to buy one this time around if they can improve on the battery life side of things. I'd love a surface book ideally..time to start saving! Posted by TheAnimus - Sat 31 Dec 2016 04:41 I wouldn't hold your breath too much on the battery side of things. This device is still going to be one of those “works for 8 hours if you do nothing” type devices. Even on my 30 month old SP3 I get a good enough battery life with Edge and ABP. The problem is run chrome and it drops by a third, run VS,R#,WebPack,SqlS and it drops to an hour or two. Posted by excalibur1814 - Sat 31 Dec 2016 23:21 Imagine that… a device that uses the battery when you're using it! My ipad mini 4 has x battery life doing y but drastically reduces when doing z.

The leaked photos show a white coloured smartphone with design elements lifted straight from the Lumia lineup, complete with a Lumia-like round camera hump on the rear. The term “Surface Phone” being used here is not a theoretical name that the internet has been waiting for, but the images show the smartphone with the mentioned branding. ‘Surface Phone’ is pegged as the ultimate mobile device that a smartphone user will ever need according to the concept. It is rumoured that Microsoft has been working on perfecting the device ever since they stopped working on the Lumia devices as reported by NokiaPowerUser. Image Credit: NokiaPowerUser We can only predict that the latest image renders belong to the cancelled Intel SoC-based Surface Phone, but it will be amazing if this is the ARM, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 along with Windows 10. Microsoft recently demoed its work on bringing the full Windows 10 experience to ARM chipsets with a live demo using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 device. The company further detailed that the full experience will come to devices running Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. According to reports by Softpedia, the company also started a trial production run for the Surface Phone to test out the new model for a possible launch later in 2017. According to the company, it does not want to create just a passable smartphone that has been tried and tested in the market by other manufacturers. Instead, the company wants to focus on products that define a new category and is genuinely exciting for people to use. Something on lines of what Surface Pro, Surface Book and Surface Studio aimed to achieve. The company has not issued any statement confirming or denying the presence of the Surface Phone and should be taken as all other rumours are. According to previous reports, we might finally get our hands on the dream mobile device after the tentative launch of Microsoft Surface scheduled for 2017, but we will have to wait and watch for any new developments.

It’s powered by the long-term supported Linux 4.4 kernel and comes with support for Bluetooth Audio and VPN (Virtual Private Network) through OpenVPN. This is also the first release of the HTPC-oriented OS to add new AMDGPU video driver for newer AMD Radeon GPUs, but it also updates the graphics drivers for Intel and Nvidia cards, the latter being provided as a mix between Nvidia and Nvidia Legacy drivers, thus supporting old and new Nvidia GPUs. The WLAN drivers and firmware have been updated, too, and the graphics stack is now based on the X.Org Server 1.18 and Mesa 11.2 3D Graphics Library. Other updated components include ALSA 1.1, FFmpeg 2.8, libva 1.7, systemd 229, connman 1.31, libnfs 1.11, libressl 2.2, GNU Binutils 2.26, GCC 5.3, Python 2.7.13, LLVM 3.8, and Glibc 2.23. Being a major release and all that, OpenELEC 7.0.0 introduces official support for the WeTek Core platform by creating a separate build of the OS for this type of Android TV boxes. Other than that, users of OpenELEC 6.0 series are urged to use the Generic build of the distribution if they used the Nvidia_Legacy build before.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print SAN FRANCISCO — Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon — massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organizations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company’s announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack — one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government — that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. “The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise,” said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. Government attackers Of course, it’s not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. “Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. “We’re increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments.” Yahoo’s security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. Two hacks, more than a billion accounts Yahoo didn’t say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn’t been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled twice — once by encryption and once by another technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can’t be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you’ve changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn’t appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn’t the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don’t have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. Questions for Verizon News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo’s plans to fall into Verizon’s arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company’s services wouldn’t be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the “new development before reaching any final conclusions.” Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses “definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,” Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn’t negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon,” the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo’s shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack.

The unannounced mid-size Chromebook looked like a fantastic option for Chromebooks, especially with Android apps, but shortly after its first appearance, the listing was taken down. Now, the same model has popped up on Best Buy, this time confirming a few more details and offering up a possible release date. As you may recall, the ASUS C302CA is presumed to be a successor to the ASUS Chromebook Flip from last year, which this listing does confirm. As for specs, it confirms the same Intel Pentium 4405Y chipset (Core m3), 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage as we saw in the previous leak. The display also measures in at 12.5-inch with a 1080p resolution. Like the previous Flip, it also offers a 360-degree hinge which allows users to use the laptop in a tablet mode. The listing also confirms a few other details, such as the dual USB-C ports for charging and data transfer, two full-size USB 3.0 ports, HDMI port, microSD slot, and backlit keyboard. As for pricing, it lands at $499. Unfortunately, the listing was taken down just minutes before the publishing of this article. However, the crucial detail here is that the Best Buy listing gives us a potential release date ─ January 5th. When attempting you purchase the Chromebook with store pickup, the earliest option is January 5th, which is right in the middle of CES 2017, and just a day after the company’s press briefing. Odds are, we’ll see this machine debut at CES 2017, so stay tuned for our hands-on coverage of the device in the coming days.

After decades of Arab-Israeli diplomacy, the idea of a one-state solution looms anew, as conservative elements in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition see the arrival of Donald Trump and his new ambassador to Israel as an opportunity to push their agenda. If it is realized, it would reduce Israel’s Palestinian population to a permanent underclass and mean, in the not-too-distant future, that a Jewish minority would be ruling a Muslim majority, with the world on the side of the oppressed majority. The United States would be its only friend and ally — relegating Washington to a role equally isolated from mainstream opinion throughout the region and far beyond. This seems to be the role that President-elect Trump is carving out for America, and the role that Netanyahu is skirting perilously close to for Israel. Trump’s ambassador-designate, David Friedman, the President-elect’s longtime friend and bankruptcy lawyer, has spent much of his career advocating and raising money for the one-state concept. His arrival in Israel will only reinforce the dramatic shift toward the more extreme parties in Netanyahu’s ruling coalition that now seem to be calling the shots. It was not always this way. Three months after taking office, on June 14, 2009, just 10 days after a recently inaugurated President Barack Obama gave his landmark Middle East speech at Cairo University, Netanyahu, in a televised speech to his people, embraced a two-state solution. Over the next eight years, Israel has solidified its position as one of the world’s most technologically innovative countries, a bastion of democracy surrounded by an ocean of autocracies or theocracies. Five years ago, World Policy Journal used a basket of indicators to identify Israel, alongside Finland and Singapore as the world’s three most innovative countries. At the time, Israel had the largest number of startups in the world outside the United States — 3,850, or one for every 1,844 Israelis, according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center. It had more companies listed on America’s tech-heavy Nasdaq than the entire European continent. The pace has only accelerated since then. More importantly, today Israel has more than 250 research units owned by or doing business for multinationals, the vast majority American companies such as IBM, Apple, Intel, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Cisco and HP. All of which makes Israel uniquely vulnerable. If Israel pursues the one-state solution, integrating ever larger stretches of Palestinian territory and population, while disenfranchising the people who live there, demographic realities will all too quickly make Jewish people a minority in their own country. Already, Israel’s own census bureau shows a virtually equal number of Jewish and Arab people sharing the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. And Arab people, largely Palestinians, are expected to outnumber Jewish people by 2020. Neither choice of what would follow under a one-state scenario is particularly appealing. John Kerry described the alternatives in his Wednesday speech: “If the choice is one-state, Israel can either be Jewish or Democratic, it cannot be both. And it won’t ever really be at peace.” But Kerry did not go far enough in painting the horrors that would result from Israel’s efforts to maintain a Jewish-ruled state, for this Jewish minority would be controlling an increasingly unruly and oppressed majority. The world, apart from the United States, will no longer be on its side. At this point, the South Africa example is most instructive. Recall the state of that country as the campaign to abolish apartheid built up steam — a privileged white minority ruling a black majority in a violent and brutal system. Economic and trade sanctions gradually beginning to strangle this nation that had historically been Africa’s most prosperous. The arrival of worldwide consumer boycotts, campaigns to sell off stock of any company doing business with this pariah state. Recall the list of American companies currently operating in Israel; they would find themselves vulnerable to boycotts and sanctions. Their departure would quickly back Israel into a corner even more isolated than South Africa. Inevitably, a Palestinian Nelson Mandela would emerge — a symbolic freedom fighter who Israel would have to demonize or imprison. I served as speechwriter to Mandela during his first visit to the United States after his release from prison. He was lionized from New York to Los Angeles and confided in me that he had no doubt his suffering was key to the end of apartheid in his country. But if apartheid was toxic merely to South Africa, a one-state solution and a globally blacklisted Israel threatens to be toxic to the entire Middle East. Already, the United States has been marginalized in the latest Syrian ceasefire and peace process — with Turkey and Russia taking the lead. An apartheid system in Israel would risk leaving Russia to assume its long-sought role of dominance across the region, a position as peacemaker that would leave it paramount. On the outside, nose pressed against the glass, would stand a newly powerless United States, with only a single, deeply ostracized friend in the region. The text of the latest Security Council resolution calls on all UN member states “to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967” — language that Netanyahu fears could lead to a surge in boycott and sanctions efforts. The resolution passed the UN Security Council 14 to 0 — with countries from Britain and France, to Russia, China, New Zealand, Egypt, even Ukraine, voting to approve. Trump has set the US on this perilous path — hardly one that would seem calculated to end with the Middle East peace he hopes to broker. His initial statements in support of Netanyahu, along with a series of tweets, have been accompanied by the designation of Friedman as his new ambassador. As it happens, Ronald Reagan, who dined with Friedman’s father, Rabbi Morris Friedman, in 1984 — his son, David seated at his side — was not seduced by the one-state solution. Today, most liberal Israelis also recognize this concept for what it is — an impossible dream. The United States must seek to pull the region back from the brink and come to a similar realization.

The call comes as police patrols have been stepped up in major cities across the world in the wake of the recent truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market which killed 12 people. Seven people were also arrested in Moscow on suspicion of planning ISIS New Year's Eve attacks allegedly involving automatic weapons and explosives. Islamic State-linked group Nashir Media Foundation published propaganda warning revellers: "Prepare your coffins as well. Your celebrations have become a battlefield" - according to terrorism watchdog SITE Intel Group.

Revellers in New York City on Saturday will find 65 large sanitation trucks filled with sand placed in strategic positions to block potential truck attacks, as well as about 100 other smaller "blocker" vehicles, officials said.

The current terror threat level in the UK remains at 'severe' - meaning an attack is "highly likely".

Bill Gates embraces Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg during an announcement of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to ‘cure, prevent or manage all disease’ by the end of the century. Beck Diefenbach/Reuters Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn A new kind of philanthropist is emerging in the 21st century. They show little interest in the old philanthropic model - attending galas and endowing their alma mater. Today, relatively young technology billionaires are creating a new paradigm of philanthropy, one that arguably sets a new standard of ethical practice in the non-profit sector. Their purpose is to use their influence to push the boundaries of science and technology for the creation of social benefit. In a growing trend, in 2014, more than US$5 billion was donated by wealthy technologists for this purpose. A cynic might say it is about lining their own pockets, yet there is ample evidence to suggest they are motivated by a kind of win-win altruism. These are men and women who think global and want to leave a legacy. Who are we talking about? It is a long list indeed, with names like Gordon Moore (Intel), Bill Gates (Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg & Priscilla Chan, Sean Parker (Facebook), Paul Allen (Microsoft) and Michael Dell, to mention a few. Shortfalls in government funding One factor in the rise of the new philanthropy is that government spending on science in the US has been dropping in recent times. Research institutes are closing, projects being put on hold or abandoned for want of funding. Increasingly, science philanthropy is stepping up to address the shortfall. It is not surprising that wealthy technologists would want to invest in pushing the boundaries of science. Technology is, after all, applied science. Without the research, technological progress slows to a crawl. As a result, we are seeing the priorities of science being influenced less by government policy and academia, and more by the priorities of the philanthropic giver. After all, who pays the piper calls the tune. It is a trend giving rise to some disquiet in the science establishment. With pressure on government budgets from other priorities, the trend towards the outsourcing of science funding is likely to continue. The Gates Foundation Even the wealthiest of governments would be hard pressed to match the funding of some of the larger new “venture philanthropists”. With assets of around US$44 billion, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a prime example of the new philanthropy. To date it has spent roughly US$10 billion on a range of programs in developing countries to improve health care, provide education and reduce poverty. It has funded efforts to control infectious diseases, malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. It also funds family planning, basic health care, nutrition and sanitation. It would be difficult to criticise such efforts, though it will not stop some from claiming they are only giving back what they had no right to take in the first place. Being a philanthropist today can be a thankless business. Is there a dark side? Silicon Valley billionaire and philanthropist Peter Thiel incurred the wrath of his peers by strongly supporting Donald Trump, donating money and making speeches for his election. Thiel has since been named a member of the President-elect’s transition team, indicating that he is not just a supporter but a trusted friend. What does Thiel expect in return? Time will tell, but it is likely he will be most valuable serving as a mediator between a Trump White House and the largely left-wing Silicon Valley establishment to implement a new policy agenda. Not an easy job. The new philanthropy is diversifying It is a measure of the hyper-partisan nature of politics today that would call participation in the political process a bad thing. It’s actually a good thing. We need more intelligent, capable people with technology skills to enter a field that has been brought into disrepute in recent times.

Opinion: this will be a pivotal year for the Mac By Gary Marshall | Dec 29, 2016, 10.13 PM IST FacebookLinkedinTwitterGoogle+Reddit Continue reading In December, Microsoft made a surprising announcement: more Mac users are switching to Surface devices than ever before, partly due to “the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro.” It’s important to take rivals’ claims with a huge pinch of salt, of course, but at the same time the ever popular MacRumors’ Buyer’s Guide was only willing to recommend a single Mac, the same new MacBook Pro. The MacBook was labelled with "caution", and the MacBook Air, iMac, Mac Mini and Mac Pro were – and at the time of writing, still are – labelled with big red “don’t buy” buttons. You can see why. All of those Macs are massively overdue updates, assuming Apple intends to update them at all. The worst offender is the “innovation my ass” Mac Pro, which hasn’t been touched since its debut three years ago. In computing, that’s an eternity. After years of rising sales, Macs are in decline. According to Strategy Analytics, the decline increased from a 3% year-on-year drop in the fourth quarter of 2015 to a 17% drop in the third quarter of 2016. Strategy Analytics’ senior analyst Eric Smith has an explanation: he says that Apple “pretty much forgot about the Mac” in 2016. He’s not the only person who thinks that Macs aren’t Apple’s top priority, and that they haven’t been for some years now. Are we seeing the last gasp of the Mac? It just doesn’t work You can pin some of the blame for the lack of exciting new Macs on chip suppliers, who haven’t delivered what Apple’s hardware needs to make updates necessary or attractive. Mac updates were similarly sluggish just before Hell froze over and Apple moved from PowerPC to Intel processors. But people’s concerns aren’t just about the lack of hardware excitement. The software is making some Mac fans nervous, too. Here’s a genuine example: we’d have started this piece earlier, but a minor update to macOS Sierra borked our iMac’s boot disk and took most of our morning with it. The last update killed Boot Camp on our MacBook Pro. We’re battling intermittent Finder errors on our MacBook Air. And don’t get us started on iCloud Drive, Siri or iTunes. Our experience is not unusual. Legendary tech commentator Walt Mossberg wrote early in 2016 that “I’ve noticed a gradual degradation in the quality and reliability of Apple’s core apps, on both the mobile iOS operating system and its Mac OS X platform,” he wrote. While the core apps generally still work beautifully, the “it just works” mantra no longer applies.  We share the LA Times’ exasperation at Preview’s endless crashes, and we’ll happily echo Marco Arment’s lament that “just a few years ago, we would have relentlessly made fun of Windows users for these same bugs on their inferior OS, but we can’t talk anymore.”  How to fix common macOS problems Even John Gruber, aka Daring Fireball, was moved to write that “Maybe we expect too much from Apple’s software. But Apple’s hardware doesn’t have little problems like this.”  The reason is obvious. Apple’s concentrating most of its resources on the iPhone, which is where it makes most of its money and which requires significant annual updates, and on the iPad, which it sees as the future of general purpose computing. New Macs are coming in 2017 – the iMac, at least, is due to be updated imminently – but it’s clear that Apple’s attention is elsewhere. Will it come back? In many respects, Apple’s Mac business looks very much like its Mac business of the 1980s: solid but uninspiring, and focused on maximising profits rather than finding the next insanely great thing. The current product range echoes that too: Apple no longer sticks to Steve Jobs’ grid of four distinct Mac lines (consumer desktop, consumer laptop, pro desktop, pro laptop).  But what’s different this time around is that the Mac isn’t Apple’s core business any more. Mobile is.  Since 2009, the iPhone has jumped from 25% of Apple’s revenues to 68%; while Apple shipped 4.2 million Macs in Q3 2016, it shipped 40.4 million iPhones and 9.9 million Macs.  You don’t need to be an accountant to recognize that Apple without the Mac would still be one of the most successful and highly profitable companies in the world. Macs in a post-PC world “The Macintosh line of computers is 32 years old”, writes former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée. “It has a venerable past… but what kind of future does it have in a declining market?” As Gassée rightly points out, the Mac is still big business: $22 billion in annual revenue for the year just gone isn’t bad at all, and of course Apple’s profit margins remain huge. But is it a business Apple wants to keep, when the future increasingly looks ARM-powered and iPad shaped? Industry analyst Horace Dediu is well known for his perceptive analysis of Apple. While he’s quick to applaud the Mac’s continued success, he argues that thinking in terms of Macs vs PCs is a distraction. It’s Macs vs mobile now. “What exactly is the purpose of the Mac in the age of the mobile device?” he asks.  It’s a rhetorical question. “It cannot take on the role of being the future,” - that’s the iPhone’s job. And “it will not morph into a touch device any more than a teen’s parent will become cool by putting on skinny jeans.” For Dediu, “What it will do is become better at what it is hired to do.” And that’s to deliver non-touchscreen input in jobs where it makes sense to do so. Touch interfaces can be great, but there are some tasks for which the good old keyboard and mouse (or trackpad) and perhaps Touch Bar are better suited. “Alternative ways of doing the jobs it does will with direct input are emerging, but they are not yet good enough,” Dediu argues.  For as long as that’s the case, there will still be Macs.

Monday, January 2, 2017 A look inside San Jose politics and culture Twitter Facebook San Jose Inside San Jose Inside is made possible through support by: San Jose Inside (http://_/2016/12/28/the-departure-lounge-we-lost-some-great-people-in-2016/) More News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly Categories News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly News The Departure Lounge: We Lost Some Great People in 2016 By Silicon Valley Newsroom / December 28, 2016 1 Clockwise from left: Natalie Cole, Gene Wilder, David Bowie, Thom Steinbeck, Paul Kantner, Muhammad Ali and Prince. We were so traumatized by the deaths of David Bowie, Prince, Muhammad Ali, Leonard Cohen and George Michael (maybe less so by Fidel Castro’s) that passings that might have attracted attention in a normal year failed to get the attention they deserved. Like America’s greatest astronaut, John Glenn, or the fifth Beatle, George Martin. Or Gene Wilder. Jazz great Bobby Hutcherson died at his home in Montara, near Half Moon Bay. David Bunnell, the founder of PC, PC World, Macworld and Upside magazines, who helped shape the personal computing revolution, died in Berkeley. Author Thomas Steinbeck, son of John, who presented awards annually at San Jose State’s Steinbeck Center, had his ashes spread in Big Sur. San Jose’s retired planning director, Joe Horwedel, was remembered fondly, and with the demise of Santa Clara’s colorful ex-Mayor Eddie Souza, local journalists have less to write about. Monsignor Eugene Boyle was a longtime local champion of social justice. Silicon Valley said goodbye to longtime Intel CEO Andy Grove and Bill Campbell, who had run Intuit and filled key roles at Apple and its spinoff Claris. We lost the creator of email’s “@” symbol, Ray Tomlinson, and Henry Heimlich, who invented that maneuver. Eye patch-wearing editor Warren Hinckle, who helped introduce gonzo journalism to the world, succumbed in San Francisco. Fellow new leftie turned California politician Tom Hayden, who stopped by Metro’s office for a chat when he ran for governor in 1994, slid off the coil in Santa Monica, the same place where Mexican musical treasure Juan Gabriel took his leave. Also in that city, synthesizer great Keith Emerson exited the stage, followed by fellow band member Greg Lake, leaving Carl Palmer as the sole survivor of the once formidable ELP. Nine Inch Nails keyboard player James Woolley died after a ladder fall, 25 years after his unforgettable Lollapalooza performance at Shoreline Amphitheatre. Parliament/Funkadelic, Talking Heads and Mos Def keyboardist Bernie Worrell met the Great Spirit. And electronic synthesizer pioneer Don Buchla, who engineered the sound system for Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters’ Further bus, fell silent. Other noteworthy musicians who played their final notes included Rob Wasserman, bassist with Bob Weir’s Ratdog, Lou Reed and Elvis Costello, Merle Haggard, who wrote Grateful Dead staple “Mama Tried” and Paul Kantner, who began his Jeffersonian journey in the South Bay. Crack-smoking former Toronto mayor Rob Ford died of cancer at 46 and Harambe the Gorilla was fatally shot a day after his 17th birthday at the Cincinnati Zoo after he fished a three-year-old boy out of a moat. Natalie Cole, who had an unforgettable voice, came to San Jose for Cinequest four years ago and wanted to see the city’s nightlife. After a doorman at Fahrenheit turned her away because it was past what San Jose considers late, er 11pm, we apologized as we walked a block in the chilly night to the only nearby open spot, The Loft. “That’s okay. I’ve been thrown out of nicer places than that,” she graciously assured us.

Lenovo's latest ThinkPads ship bloatware-free Engadget 4 days ago Jon Fingas © Provided by Engadget It's virtually a tradition for Lenovo to unveil new ThinkPads around CES time, but this year it's doing something a bit different: its systems are defined by what they don't have. The PC builder has just unveiled a slew of mid-tier ThinkPad laptops that all run Microsoft's Signature Edition image of Windows 10 -- that is, you shouldn't expect bloatware bogging things down or introducing security holes. While ThinkPads have had cleaner software than Lenovo's non-pro systems as a general rule, this is good news if you're more interested in getting to work than dealing with unwanted apps. Of course, there are plenty of hardware updates. All of the new systems use 7th-generation Core processors, and some of the larger models (the ThinkPad T470, T470p, T570, L470 and L570) have the option of using Intel's extremely fast Optane 3D storage. You can only have up to 16GB of the cutting-edge memory, so it won't replace the main drive in your system, but it should help in those situations where even a fast SSD isn't enough. You should also expect improved trackpads (using Microsoft's Precision TouchPad spec) and protection against dodgy USB-C cables. As for the specific systems? The headliner is the ThinkPad Yoga 370 2-in-1 (shown at top). As its numbering scheme suggests, it slots neatly between the 200- and 400-series Yogas with a brand new 13.3-inch design that's tough enough to meet MilSpec certifications. Its 3.2-pound weight, 1080p screen and 10-hour battery life aren't huge breakthroughs, but it touts Thunderbolt 3 support to connect to Lenovo's new docks and displays (more on those later). It ships in February starting at $1,149. © Lenovo Lenovo ThinkPad T570 The remaining systems are mostly the customary performance updates, although there are a few highlights: the 15.6-inch T570 has an optional 4K non-touch display (up from "just" 3K in the T560). Thunderbolt 3 is common across most T-series laptops, and the 12-inch X270 adds USB-C. It won't shock you to hear that prices and ship dates will vary widely. The most affordable rig is the updated ThinkPad 13, which begins at $699 when it arrives in January, but you can drop $1,149 on the 14-inch T470s (also arriving in January) if you're determined to meld Ultrabook portability with an abundance of ports. And yes, Lenovo is upping the ante on its docks and displays. The $280 ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 Dock gives you power, two DisplayPort connectors, HDMI, VGA, five USB 3.0 ports, gigabit Ethernet, audio and another Thunderbolt 3 port using a single cable attached to your PC. It ships in February. If that's overkill, you can get a $200 ThinkPad USB-C Dock in January; it ditches Thunderbolt 3 (naturally) and HDMI, and downgrades two of the USB ports to 2.0. Prefer to hook things up to a display? The 24-inch ThinkVision P24h and 27-inch P27h both support charging, video and 4 USB 3.0 ports through a solitary USB-C cable. There's no pricing on the smaller screen as of this writing, but the P27h will sell for $329 when it and its sibling launch in March.

OpenELEC 7.0 Linux OS Out Now with OpenVPN & Bluetooth Audio, Based on Kodi 16.1 GO Includes ALSA 1.1 and Linux kernel 4.4 LTS Dec 29, 2016 15:42 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, December 29, 2016, the OpenELEC development team proudly announced the release of a new stable build of their HTPC (Home Theater PC) Linux-based operating system for embedded devices. OpenELEC 7.0.0 is now the latest stable version of the GNU/Linux distribution built around the well-known open-source and cross-platform Kodi 16.1 (formerly XBMC) media center. It's powered by the long-term supported Linux 4.4 kernel and comes with support for Bluetooth Audio and VPN (Virtual Private Network) through OpenVPN. This is also the first release of the HTPC-oriented OS to add new AMDGPU video driver for newer AMD Radeon GPUs, but it also updates the graphics drivers for Intel and Nvidia cards, the latter being provided as a mix between Nvidia and Nvidia Legacy drivers, thus supporting old and new Nvidia GPUs. The WLAN drivers and firmware have been updated, too, and the graphics stack is now based on the X.Org Server 1.18 and Mesa 11.2 3D Graphics Library. Other updated components include ALSA 1.1, FFmpeg 2.8, libva 1.7, systemd 229, connman 1.31, libnfs 1.11, libressl 2.2, GNU Binutils 2.26, GCC 5.3, Python 2.7.13, LLVM 3.8, and Glibc 2.23. WeTek Core platform now officially supported with a separate build Being a major release and all that, OpenELEC 7.0.0 introduces official support for the WeTek Core platform by creating a separate build of the OS for this type of Android TV boxes. Other than that, users of OpenELEC 6.0 series are urged to use the Generic build of the distribution if they used the Nvidia_Legacy build before. "Users running OpenELEC 6.95.1 or later with auto-update enabled will be prompted on-screen to reboot and apply the update once it has been downloaded and enabled in some hours. Users running older OpenELEC releases or with auto-update disabled will need to manually update," reads today's announcement. If you're using OpenELEC from the 6.x series, you are encouraged to perform a full backup of your installation before attempting to upgrade to OpenELEC 7.0.0, which you can download right now from our web portal or directly from the official homepage of the project, where you'll find all the information you need to get started with using OpenELEC on your device(s). #OpenELEC 7.0#Kodi 16.1#HTPC#Linux distribution#embedded subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Here's Ubuntu Budgie 16.10 Linux Operating System Running on an Onda Tablet PC KDevelop 5.1 Promises LLDB Support, Analyzer Run Mode, and Perforce Integration Wine-Staging 2.0 RC3 Adds AES-GCM Support and Fixes DOOM 2016 Multiplayer Mode Linux Kernel 4.9 Now Unofficially Available for Slackware 14.2 and Derivatives New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    OpenELEC 7.0.0 released Other Linux Distros Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Netrunner Rolling Edition / Desktop: A special edition of the Netrunner Linux distribution based on Arch Linux and designed as a rolling-release operating system Reader comments Gentoo-Based Calculate Linux 17 Launches with KDE Plasma 5.8.5 LTS and MATE 1.16 more on: Calculate Linux 17 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

News Windows 10 Windows 10 Anniversary Update Gaming About LG to soon release the PJ9, a levitating bluetooth speaker WE RECOMMEND: Click to free scan your PC for malware & improve performance 0 0 0 CES 2017 is going be one hell of a tradeshow. Some of the biggest names in the tech world, including HP, Lenovo, Microsoft, Intel and LG will parade their latest gadgets and contraptions on January 5th in Las Vegas. One of these companies, LG, has been working on a powerful electromagnet device for quite some time and we now know for sure what the device really is: A PJ9 levitating portable bluetooth ppeaker. LG says that it collaborated with DTS to bring a “realistic theater-like sound for a cinematic experience wherever you may be”. The magical hovering gizmo contains electromagnets that levitate the speakers and on top of that, there is 360° of omnidirectional sound and a 10-hour battery life, descending to its base station to charge wirelessly when low on juice. The le PJ9 is equipped with Multipoint technology, giving users the ability to connect two Bluetooth devices at once. There is also an embedded subwoofer for deep bass and IPX7-certified speakers for water resistance conditions. The PJ9 also features Dual Passive Radiator technology to reproduce “flush mid-range tones and crisp highs”. Apart from hovering over its dock like some futuristic doodad, it produces booming sound in every direction to give your guests something to talk about at your New Year’s party. Which makes sense: LG is the first major electronics brand to put out such an outlandish product. To find out more of its features, you’ll have to wait till the CES 2017 event where LG will also be unveiling its full lineup of wireless audio products. As for pricing, LG hasn’t shared any details regarding the matter.

The Secretary of State's office audit found that property tax breaks for Intel and similar exemptions for data centers consumed the lion's share of Business Oregon's incentives. "We recommend that Business Oregon develop additional metrics and targets for incentive and loan performance, using them to evaluate the awards and report performance to policymakers and the public," the auditors wrote. Oregon's biggest tax incentives, 2015-2017 Strategic Investment Program: Large manufacturers received property tax exemptions worth $406.3 million. Intel received 80 percent of those tax breaks. Standard Enterprise Zone: Property tax exemptions for three to five years saved employers $71.9 million. Rural Enterprise Zone: Data centers received most of these incentives, worth $56.8 million altogether. Oregon Production Investment Fund: Tax credits for film and TV productions, worth $22.9 million. Manufacturing Business Energy Tax Credit: Manufacturers received tax credits for using renewable energy worth $22.6 million. Source: Audit by Oregon Secretary of State's office Data centers' tax exemptions received particular scrutiny: For each job the tax breaks brought in, the auditors found, local communities gave up property tax revenue between $87,000 and $800,000. Beneficiaries of those exemptions include Amazon (in Morrow County), Google (The Dalles), Facebook and Apple (both in Prineville). Local cities and counties decide whether to grant the exemptions under Oregon's enterprise zone program. "State and local jurisdictions need to periodically examine the zones in-depth to identify potential improvements and weigh the tax breaks against the zone benefits," the auditors wrote. "An evaluation of data center tax incentives could also include a broader range of community benefits and costs tied to these projects." Oregon offers some of the nation's most attractive incentives for data centers, providing broad property tax exemptions coupled with the absence of a state sales tax. That combination can save individual projects several million dollars a year. Tax deals financed a new industry formed by pairing rural America and Silicon Valley. Even large data centers, though, typically employ no more than several dozen people. State auditors said Oregon should undertake a more careful analysis to weigh the size of the tax breaks against the jobs created. Roger Lee, executive director of Economic Development for Central Oregon, said the data centers would never have come to small towns like Prineville and The Dalles without the tax breaks. So those communities aren't giving up anything when they grant the incentives, he said. "It doesn't take away from the tax base, the existing tax base," Lee said. "It's only on new investment." The state audit notes that community service and franchise fees offset some of the data centers' property tax breaks, but says Oregon doesn't adequately quantify those benefits. Other findings in the audit: Oregon granted $680 million in tax incentives through Business Oregon during the state's last two-year budget cycle. Three-quarters of that was awarded to programs under local control, including the data center and Intel tax breaks. Oregon's incentives are relatively small compared with those in other states. For example, Texas distributed $86 million through its enterprise fund in 2015, compared with $4 million in the comparable Oregon program. Most awards during 2011 and 2012 went to businesses that paid average wages below that of the county where they operated. Enterprise zone property tax breaks were concentrated on relatively well-off regions, in contrast to the program's initial aim to help poorer parts of the state. Oregon's enterprise zone programs haven't had a thorough review since 2009, and aren't scheduled for another until 2025. Most Business Oregon incentives aren't subject to a "sunset" review to determine whether the state should continue offering them. Oregon's history with tax incentives has been poor. The Business Energy Tax Credit was little short of a catastrophe, gobbling up 40 times more than lawmakers expected when they approved the program. A recent state audit found nearly a quarter of all projects funded by that tax credit "seemed improper, violated statutes or rules, or exhibited suspicious activity." The Oregon Energy Department administered that program, however, and it was separate from the Business Oregon tax incentives cataloged in this month's audit. In a formal response, Business Oregon said it "generally agrees with the audit recommendations." The agency committed to update its website with more information, but said sunset reviews are beyond its mandate and said additional transparency must "balance the public's right to know with individual businesses' rights to privacy." -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

Let's go live to the White House now okay Karen Travers was where those in Washington Karen just what can the president do. Looking at the White House today. For economic sanctions against us and we need before of course would be different fresh round. Using there's also a possibility of diplomatic measures sanctions against diplomats restrictions on travel things like that one thing we're not expected here today is. Any discussion about Covert actions taken by US intelligence agencies that's not surprising of course but it is something and the president has talked about. As part of this response and experts are saying you know the US is very good at this of course it. The won't have a footprint we won't know about it but the issue there is when you start doing it back when you start hacking back. Then what happens next in what happens next and what chain reaction get sent off. With only 23 days left Intel Donald Trump becomes president. How much of this can be reversed how much of this matters. We know that the White House would like to do this in such a way that makes it very difficult for Donald Trump to. Watered down or scrap all together now we're reading here. But that is something that administration officials have indicated to us is. A priority as they lay this out because they do you only have three weeks left and it's also important to note that this is not. The conclusion of that broad review that the president asked for after the election looking into the whole issue of the cyber attacks after the intelligence agencies. Came to this conclusions about Russia. We will expect that sometime next month that review is still ongoing in the administration that. Not Donald Trump who's named Tom Bonser to be his chief cyber security advisor on the president elect those elevated to the admiral put into this guy at the same level. As the incoming national security advisor Michael Flynn. Bob served as a kind of guy who can resolve this. Resolve this sword making it a top priority. In terms of figuring out response and not sure he could. Stop it and have for instance but I think what I think it's interesting is that. As you say will be elevated to the same level as the national security advisor and busters coming in with. Public and private sector experience he's a former official in the George W Bush Administration. Focusing on these issues and he's been in the private sector at a consulting firm doing security issues for the last couple of years now we don't. Here a lot from him and he's not a member of congress who's given a lot of speeches or press statements so it's unclear. Worry now where he comes down on the issue which is certainly going be one of the most pressing for the trump administration on day one. All right Karen we must dash thanks for your time this morning. That's ABC's Karen Travers at the White House. advertise with us Poll How confident are you that Doug Whaley is the right GM to lead the Buffalo Bills back to the playoffs?   Very confident   Somewhat confident   Not confident   View Results Top Stories Audio Get it Now 03/23/11 10:06 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 38 mins ago WBEN iPhone App 03/23/11 10:06 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 38 mins ago Perks 03/23/11 10:06 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 38 mins ago Contests 03/23/11 10:05 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 39 mins ago Photo Galleries 03/23/11 10:07 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 37 mins ago RSS Center 03/23/11 10:07 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 37 mins ago Contact Us   |   Advertise With Us   |   Jobs   |   EEO Public File   |   Privacy Policy   |   Terms & Conditions   |   Contest Rules   |   Internships   |   Copyright Notice

There has been a lot of change in IT this year, but the one constant has been the continued decline of the PC industry. In March, Computer Weekly reported Windows 10 had done little to stimulate upgrades in business. According to analyst Gartner, the annual selling price of ultramobile premium devices will have a negative 5.3% compound annual growth rate of 5.9% until 2019.

And in this highly competitive market, the strong US dollar combined with Brexit has meant IT budgets were squeezed as some device prices increased, rather than fell. Looking at the major IT companies, this was the year of the Dell/EMC merger, making the newly formed Dell-EMC a strong player in the datacentre market. But it remained the third largest PC manufacturer, according to IDC’s Q2 2016 market share report. HP Inc, the PC and printers arm of post-split HP, was second, with a share of 20.8% while Lenovo was the biggest PC maker, with 21.2%. Chip technology has continued to follow Moores’ Law, but, given the current state of the PC market, it was no real surprise to see Intel expanding into new areas such as IoT during its annual IDF conference in August. The PC industry appears to be shifting towards “personal systems”, which covers any device used for computing; from smartphones and tablets, to laptops, notebooks and hybrid devices. USB C made headlines at CES this year in Las Vegas, promising a universal connector for all devices, including those from Apple. It has the potential to make a radical change to the way office work space is organised. As Computer Weekly noted in January, a single cable for monitors, keyboards and mouse simplifies desk clutter. From an operating systems perspective, Microsoft released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, and the open source community reflected on 25 years since Linus Torvalds released the first Linux kernel. What has been truly remarkable about Linux is not the operating system itself – although most web-scale organisations probably run their infrastructure on Linux systems – but the fact that it opened up the possibility of open source, as an alternative model to commercial software licencing. Apart from Canonical with its Ubuntu Linux distribution, Linux has not really made a massive direct impact on the consumer and desktop computing. But Android, currently the most widely used operating system, is derived from Linux, and many popular websites are powered by Linux back-end systems. It may have started with Siri, but the true artifiicial intelligence star of 2016 has been the recently launched Alexa voice-controlled assistant from Amazon. The idea of a personal digital assistant harks back to early 1990s, with classic devices such as the Palm Pilot and Psion Organiser. But artificial intelligence offers the potential to revolutionise smartphones. “Alexa is the future of search, and smart agents have the potential to be the main user interface,” said Gartner research director Roberta Cozza. Smartphone makers need something to boost sales. Apple released iOS 10 and the iPhone 7, and introduced a professional tablet with extras that include an add-on keyboard and smart pencil aimed squarely at the niche Microsoft has forged with its Surface Pro hybrid device. But many experts believe iPhone users will delay upgrading until next year when the iPhone 8 is released. Samsung, which seized market share from Apple to become the dominant smartphone player, has had a terrible end of year, thanks to its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphone devices. In the summer, Samsung was forced to recall 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphone devices worldwide because a number were found to have faulty batteries that made them vulnerable to overheating and catching fire. In the coming year, IT departments will need to come to terms with aging Windows 7 desktop computing, and the dilemma of whether to invest in another major PC refresh or try something else. Windows applications are the mainstay of desktop IT, but corporates are increasingly turning to Saas, delivered as mobile apps or browser based. Apple set about to change end user computing in 2010, with the first generation iPad. This has been joined by a multitude of Android tablets at different price points and hybrid PC devices like Microsoft’s Surface. At the same time, cloud-based software has meant applications can lean on powerful servers to do the heavy lifting. This means devices do not need to be as powerful from a computational perspective. So the manufacturers are focusing instead on areas like collaboration, offering features such as Skype for Business and integration with Intel’s RealSense cameras.  1. United Utilities protects field engineering deployment with AirWatch United Utilities deploys mobile device management software AirWatch to secure Samsung devices running a SAP workforce management app. 2.

Qualcomm has said it will fight the massive fine in court. The Korea Fair Trade Commission, or KFTC, held that Qualcomm refused to license certain standard-essential patents on its chips to rival chipmakers including Intel, Samsung, and MediaTek. The commission ordered Qualcomm to renegotiate those licenses in good faith, according to a Reuters report on the matter. The fine is the largest ever issued in Korea. In its report on the Korean fine, Bloomberg notes that Qualcomm makes most of its profits, about $ 6.5 billion in its most recent year, from selling the rights to its chip technology. Qualcomm “has violated its agreement to license patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms, known as FRAND,” the Commission said in a statement.

Join For Free Evolve your approach to Application Performance Monitoring by adopting five best practices that are outlined and explored in this e-book, brought to you in partnership with BMC. An important consideration when moving to the next generation of multi/manycore systems is striving to create a refactored application that can run well on available systems. There are numerous similarities between the multi/manycore systems of today. Today’s systems have very powerful nodes, and the application must exploit a significant amount of parallelism on the node, which is a mixture of MIMD (multiple instruction, multiple data) and SIMD (single instruction, multiple data). The principal difference is how the application utilizes the MIMD parallelism on the node. Multicore Xeons and many-core Intel Phi systems can handle a significant amount of MPI on the node, whereas GPU systems cannot. There is also a difference in the size of the SIMD unit. The multi/manycore systems’ vector units are less than 10 and the GPU is 32. Since longer vectors on the multi/manycore systems do run better than shorter vectors this is less of an issue. All systems must have good vectorized code to run well on the target systems. However, there is a problem: “Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.” – Niklaus Wirth, 1995 The Other P There is a trend in the industry that goes against creating a performant portable application: the attempt to utilize high-level abstractions intended to increase the productivity of the application developers. The movement to C++ over the past 10 to 15 years has created applications that achieve a lower and lower percentage of peak performance on today’s supercomputers. Recent extensions to both C++ and Fortran to address productivity have significantly contributed to this movement. Even the developer of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, has indicated that C++ can lure the application developer into writing inefficient code: “C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.” “Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.” – Bjarne Stroustrup The productivity argument is that the cost of talented labor is greater than the cost of the high-performance computing system being utilized, and it is too time-consuming to improve the performance of the application. On the other hand, time spent optimizing application performance not only makes better use of expensive machines, it also reduces operational costs as energy costs continue to rise for future systems. Several years ago, a team led by Thomas Schulthess and Oliver Fuhrer of ETH Zurich refactored the production version of COSMOS, the climate modeling application used by MeteoSwiss, and found that not only did the application run significantly faster on their current GPU system, the cost of the effort would be more than repaid by the savings in energy costs over a couple years. The charts below show the performance increase and power consumption decrease for the refactored application. The work on COSMOS employed C++ meta-programming templates for the time consuming dynamical core, which resulted in the instantiation of CUDA kernels on the GPU and optimized assembler on the x86 systems. This work is an example of the developers understanding the architecture and restructuring the application to utilize its features with the high-level C++ abstractions. The bulk of the code – the physics – was Fortran, and OpenACC was used for the port to the accelerator. This is an excellent example that shows how an investment of several person-years of effort can result in an optimized application that more than pays for the investment in the development cost. Data motion is extremely expensive today and will be more expensive in the future, both in energy and time, and many of the high-level abstractions in the language can easily introduce excessive memory motion in an application. Retrofitting a large C++ framework with a high-level abstraction requires application developers to move data into a form acceptable to the abstractions and/or refactor their applications to have the abstraction manage their data structures. The first approach introduces too much data motion, and the second approach often requires a significant rewrite. Once such a rewrite has been performed, the application is dependent upon those interfaces making efficient use of the underlying architecture. Additionally, most complex multiphysics applications are a combination of computations that flow from one set of operations to another, and breaking that flow up into calls to the low-level abstractions could result in ineffective cache utilization and increased data motion. Much of the blame of this productivity movement has to be placed on the Language Standards Committee that introduces semantics that make the application developer more productive without thinking about compilation issues. Considering the recent additions to the language, both Fortran and C++, it seems that the Committee really does not care about how difficult it might be to optimize the language extensions and that their principal goal is to make programmers more productive. When users see an interesting new feature in the language, they assume that the feature will be efficient; after all, why would the Committee put the feature in the language if it wouldn’t run efficiently on the target systems? At some point, this trend of achieving productivity only at the expense of performance has to stop. Most, if not all, of the large applications that have taken the productivity lane have implemented MPI and messaging outside of the abstraction and they have obtained an increase in performance from the parallelism across nodes. Increased parallelism must be obtained on the node in the form of threading and/or vectorization, with special attention paid to minimizing the movement of data within the memory hierarchy of the node. At some point, application developers have to put in extra work to ensure that data motion on the node is minimized and that threading and vectorization are being well utilized.

A team of NIA operatives have been assigned to  President elect Adama Barrow, and his Transition Team have been under the radar of the brutal National Intelligence Agency for surveillance, the Freedom Newspaper can reveal. A team of NIA operatives have been assigned to monitor the movements and activities of President elect Adama Barrow. It’s a covert operation approved by the outgoing dictator Yahya Jammeh. Mr. Barrow, and his team should be aware of their surroundings now towards inauguration day. The NIA surveillance team attached to President elect Barrow, have been divided into two units:  Ebrima Badjie, a senior Intel officer, is commanding the four men unit of surveillance officers. Kebba Jasseh, another senior member of the Agency, is also heading another four men unit. One of the surveillance team has been stationed outside Barrow’s residence. Their job is to infiltrate and monitor Barrow’s daily activities and movements. The other unit, has been tasked with monitoring Barrow’s motorcade. Both  surveillance team have been allocated double cabin pickup trucks by Jammeh. We are compiling the names of the other NIA agents working with Ebrima Badjie, and Kebba Jasseh. We will publish their names in due course. Meanwhile, the Inspector General of police, has issued a statement asking people interested in using convoys to apply for police permit. The goal is to prevent President elect Barrow and his team from driving around town. In annother development, Staff Sergeant Samba Jawo, and Staff Sergeant Jahateh are still detained at the NIA gutter cell Bambandingka. The men were arrested recently. Bakary Fatty, a GRTS, agricultural reporter is also detained at Bambadinka. Mr. Fatty, was given D50,000 and a double cabin truck by Jammeh prior to his arrest. Businessman Abdou Njie, who was detained since October, is languishing at Bambadinka together with former Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Sarjo Jallow. Momodou Sabally, the former GRTS MD, has been moved to the mile two prison. Omar Malleh Jabang, the guy, who used to be in charge of Jammeh’s sand mining in Kartong, is also detained.  Mr. Jabang, recently got arrested after dictator Jammeh received information that he was campaigning for the former Independent Candidate Isatou Touray. Mr. Jabang, has been held at the seized home of Fatou Nickle Touray, in Brusubi .Written By Pa Nderry MBai Source : Freedomnewspaper Sulayman Ceesay Many thanks Essa, Pa Nderry, Baba Galleh, Bamba Mass, Fatu, Fatou Jaw and other heroes of Gambian online newspapers. You guys are true heroes and when all is done and the dust settles, I hope we Gambians, with the leadership of the new administration, can find the moment to specially honour you all and pay our tributes. At this crucial time of the Gambian people’s struggle to enforce their spoken voices through the polls, we need more security around our chosen President-elect Barrow. In that context, it will help immensely if the photos of these NIA hoodlums can be obtained and posted on your online papers for all Gambians to know and make them out facially. With our eyes on them, we will be better able to add to Barrow’s security. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to 19833.68, down 113.36, or 0.56%. The S&P 500 also declined, down at 2249.92, a decline of 18.96, or 0.84%. The Nasdaq drpped a bit, a slip of 48.89, or 0.89%. The Russell 2000 also went south, but the VIX was up. Travelers Companies group up on the day, the leading gainer among equities on the Dow index. Industrials like Boeing (NYSE:BA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) led declines on the Dow. Analysts are now saying that the market may have been too optimistic, in the wake of the election of Donald Trump, and raced up toward the 20,000 mark too quickly. There now is a refining of expectations for the Dow and for stocks traded on other markets too, analysts said. President-elect Trump is poised to release an economic statement for U.S. workers after the close of the markets, and the transition team members told members of the media this morning on a teleconference call that the message was expected to be "positive" in tone. Trump is on a working vacation at his home in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, where he has in recent days released additional names of appointees to his incoming White House team.

Shares of Buy rated Dow Chemical have gained 9.5% over the past three months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Chemicals-Diversified industry, which has gained 7.4% over the same period. The Zacks analyst likes the company’s sustained strong growth fundamentals in its core end-use markets, which is believed to have played a major role in boosting the company over the past few months. Dow should continue to benefit from its cost-cutting and aggressive portfolio management actions. The company is also moving forward with its planned mega-merger with DuPont, which is expected to create significant synergies. (You can read the full research report on Dow Chemical here.) Alphabet’s shares have increased 3.1% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Internet-Services industry, which has rose 2.3% during the same time frame. Alphabet has shown good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market. The Zacks analyst likes its focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS, which should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, growing competition and legal hassles remained as major concerns. Also, the tech giant is speculated to witness escalation in costs following significant investment in mobile, cloud, devices and digital goods. (You can read the full research report on Alphabet here.) Shares of AT&T have surged 24% year to date, slightly underperforming the Zacks Wireless National sector, which has gained 24.4% over the same period. AT&T operates in a saturated wireless market where spectrum crunch is a big issue. Moreover, loss in access lines, stringent regulatory measures and union issues are major headwinds. However, the Zacks analyst likes the launch of its DirecTV Now, which enabled the company to foray into the OTT space. Moreover, if the acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T goes through, the combined entity will become a major player in the consolidated telecom-media space. Collaboration with Intel Corporation will also develop new software-centric network technologies. (You can read the full research report on AT&T here.) Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Apple (AAPL), Franklin Resources (BEN) and T-Mobile (TMUS).

American Airlines (AAL) Gains on Bullish Q4 Unit Revenue View Though positive on American Airlines' bullish view on unit revenues in Q4, the covering analyst expects the recent labor deals to hurt the company's near-term earnings. T-Mobile's (TMUS) Network Plans Bode Well, Risks Remain The Zacks analyst believes that T-Mobile will benefit from its solid network expansion plans. However, lawsuits and fines by regulatory authorities remain as concerns. Apple's (AAPL) IPhone 7 and India Expansion Plans Promising Per the covering analyst, though Apple's iPhone demand remains troubled, Apple's expansion in India and growing Apps Store and Services business hold promise. Baxter's (BAX) Cyclophosphamide Sales Hurts Amid Acquisition Plans The covering analyst thinks that the deal of acquiring Claris Injectables is a positive. However, lower cyclophosphamide sales is likely to hurt the company's top line in the near term. Read More Moody's (MCO) Focuses on Growth, Legal Woes Persist Per the Zacks analyst, diverse operations & acquisitions will aid Moody's growth. Yet, a key hurdle remains that DoJ may file a suit against it tied with RMBS & CLO ratings assigned before crisis. Southwestern Energy (SWN) Raises 2016 Output Guidance The covering analyst appreciates Southwestern Energy's increased 2016 production guidance as oil & gas prices have started gaining momentum. However, the company's high debt load raises concern. New Upgrades Dick's Sporting (DKS) Gains on Solid Growth Strategies Per the Zacks analyst, Dick's Sporting has been gaining from its growth strategies that are focused on expansion of store base as well as eCommerce footprint, which will further boost its top line. SunTrust (STI) Focuses on Revenue Growth, Rises Prime Rate According to the covering analyst, SunTrust's several initiatives to improve revenue growth are commendable. Also, the company raised its prime lending rate to 3.75%. Life Point Health (LPNT) Poised to Grow on Strategic Buyouts The Zacks analyst believes Life Point Health to grow on acquisitions of well-positioned hospitals in faster growing areas of the U.S.; strong balance sheet, cost control measures are other positives New Downgrades St. Jude's (STJ) May Get Affected by Sluggish CRM According to the Zacks analyst, sluggish conditions in the Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) markets and steep market competition might poise major headwinds to St Jude's performance in the near term. Altria (MO) Faces Declining Volumes; Loses Share in Vapor The covering analyst believes that declining volumes, high excise taxes and strict anti-smoking regulations will hurt Altria's business. Altria is also losing market share in the smokeless category. Crane Co. (CR) Faces Macro Headwinds Over the last month, Crane Co.'s shares underperformed Zacks categorized Diversified Operations industry due to issues like strong U.S. dollar, stiff rivalry and uncertain global economic conditions.

The new SFF PC not only packs high-performance components, such as the latest-generation CPU and GPU, but it uses desktop-class components and could be upgradeable. High-performance PCs in small form-factor are not rare nowadays: various PC makers use mobile CPUs and GPUs to build such systems. Such computers demonstrate high-performance out-of-the-box, but their upgrade strategy is tricky because it is not easy to get MXM GPUs or mobile CPUs in retail. When developing the GIGABYTE Gaming GT desktop (GB-GZ1DTi7-1080-OK-GW and technically this PC belongs to the Brix family), engineers from GIGABYTE wanted to create a product that could use widely available processors and graphics cards and thus potentially offer an upgrade path to the owners. The GIGABYTE Gaming GT desktop is not really a miniature system: it measures 276×384×128 mm and is approximately 10 liters in volume, which makes it just larger than Sony’s first-generation PlayStation 3. The PC is based on a custom motherboard (210×205 mm) that is a bit larger than Mini-ITX, but is still smaller when compared to microATX or FlexATX. The system uses a dual-chamber design (CPU, DRAM, SSD are located on  one side of the PC, graphics card and other 2.5” storage devices are on the other side), but the chambers are not isolated completely because they use the same airflows generated by two system fans (we do not know how large they are, but theoretically they may be of 90 mm in diameter). It is noteworthy that the PC has an automated exhaust system that opens up exhaust flippers at the top of the computer when it needs to cool down the components. The chassis can accommodate any double wide graphics card with a maximum size of 280 mm in length and 41 mm in depth, but nothing too custom with regards heatpipes and backplates because the space is constrained. GIGABYTE will ship the Gaming GT desktop with its own GeForce GTX 1080 G1 Gaming 8 GB card, but they say the key thing is that it can be updated later. Since the card faces downwards, it has to use custom cables (bundled) to connect to displays. Audio and Ethernet cables also have to be angled, but at least it is not a big problem to find such cables in retail. On the bright side of things, the Gaming GT desktop uses a 400 W FlexATX PSU, which could be upgraded if needed.

The manufacturer will ship the system with the Intel Core i7-6700K CPU (so, overlocking seems to be possible, but keep in mind temperatures and noise), but eventually the chip might be switched to something more powerful. The GIGABYTE Gaming GT PC will come with 32 GB of dual-channel DDR4 memory, a 240 GB SSD (M.2 form-factor, but no word on performance), a 1 TB HDD with a 7200 RPM spindle speed and an additional 2.5” bay for an extra drive. For those, who are not satisfied with an M.2 SSD and two 2.5” HDDs/SSDs, GIGABYTE even installed one Thunderbolt 3 port to connect external high-performance storage devices or special-purpose hardware. When it comes to other I/O, then the Gaming GT desktop offers a dual-band 1×1 802.11ac + BT 4.2 wireless module, Gigabit Ethernet (Killer E2400), five USB 3.0 Type-A ports, one USB 3.1 Type-A (10 Gbps) port, 5.1-channel audio (the Realtek ALC1150 with the TI Burr Brown OPA2134 amplifier) and so on. Finally, to give its Gaming GT system a distinctive look, GIGABYTE installed a series of RGB LEDs on top of it. The LEDs can work in different modes and can be controlled using the company’s Ambient LED application.   Pricing and availability dates for the GIGABYTE Gaming GT SFF PCs were not available at press time. Keep in mind that actual configuration of the PC will differ based on the regions, which means that their prices will vary as well. Chances are we'll see it at CES next week.

Reply SodaAnt - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link Probably. The CPU doesn't even crack 100W, the mobo and drives and assorted other things probably use 20-30W, which leaves a bit over 250W of headroom for the GPU, which should be just about fine with a GTX 1080. No real headroom for overclocking, but otherwise should be fine. Reply ImSpartacus - Saturday, December 31, 2016 - link A 1080's tdp is only 180W, right? Even if the actual power limit is a little higher (I know Nvidia has done that I the past), it seems like everything is good. You might not want to cram a 250W-class card in there like a hypothetical 1080 Ti. Reply Byte - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link So do I need to open those top flaps when I game!?!?!

The measures announced Thursday by President Barack Obama, who accused Moscow of "efforts to harm US interests," include the expulsion of 35 intelligence agents and financial sanctions on Russia's top intelligence agencies. Obama also warned of additional, unspecified actions "at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized." Analysts say Washington is seeking to punish Russia and warn other nations against taking similar action. "While the direct impact of the actions may be limited, it puts a marker in the sand (or silicon) that hostile cyber activity targeting the US has consequences," said Frank Cilluffo, who heads the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University. "In addition to responding to Russia's activities, it also puts others on notice, signaling that one cannot turn to significant cyber attacks with impunity," he said. "It also serves as a starting point for articulating a set of strategies and policies we desperately need... a cyber deterrence strategy." - Avoiding escalation - While US officials have boasted of their ability to use "cyber weapons" when appropriate, security analysts say such a course of action is unlikely because of the risk of escalation -- from more dangerous cyberattacks into the possible use of traditional, deadly weapons, or "kinetic" warfare. "I don't think you'll see the use of cyber weapons," said James Lewis, a senior fellow specializing in cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. "There is a strong desire to avoid escalating this conflict." Lewis said Obama's actions are appropriate "as a first step" and in light of Russia's actions, and that any further measures -- which Obama said may be forthcoming -- could be restrained. "The Russians didn't attack us -- they used coercion, espionage, politics -- and we could do the same thing," he said. Susan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution fellow and editor of the national security blog Lawfare, said she expects a further "nonpublic" response, possibly in the cyber domain, to send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The White House announcement "is a welcome and sufficient move, but only if it is paired with some additional nonpublic countermeasure," Hennessey said. She added that while Washington may want to demonstrate to Moscow its capacity for cyber actions, it also would want to avoid establishing a norm for cyber disruption that other nations could follow. This would likely rule out a spectacular hack attack or release of embarrassing information. But Hennessey said she expected a response "to be potentially scary to Kremlin officials to let them know we can reach places they didn't think we could reach." Steve Grobman, chief technical officer at Intel Security, agreed that Obama's measures are intended to send a message without sparking a crisis, and added that if any cyber measures are implemented, they should be carefully calibrated. "The covert offensive cyber component must be well thought out and executed such that it is precise and does not inflict collateral damage on non-target systems," he said. "Escalation of offensive cyber activities by either party could lead to a kinetic conflict." - What happens now? - It remains unclear what impact the actions will have as Obama prepares to leave office in three weeks, when Donald Trump takes the oath of office. Claude Barfield, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, argued that Obama's "dawdling and agonizing for months over Russian cyber intrusions" could have "damaging consequences for cyber deterrence policy." "The Obama administration had claimed that it did not want to retaliate against the Russians before the election for fear of provoking further disruption of the campaigns," Barfield said in a blog post. "But it waited a full month after the election before the president finally ordered a full review of the Russian attack by the entire US intelligence apparatus." This suggests "that the president and his security advisers aim to make such a tight case that it will be impossible for the next administration to ignore the evidence or back away from the sanctions," Barfield said. But he noted that "it will be critical for the government to improve US cyber defenses moving forward if we are to prevent similar incidents from happening in the new year and beyond."

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff: Trump damaging his credibility by talking about Russian hacking Top Dem lawmaker sees bipartisan support for stronger sanctions on Russia Five hot issues for the CIA confirmation hearings MORE (D-Calif.) said Friday that Russia's decision not to retaliate against the U.S. over new sanctions are a "shrewd" way to attempt to curry favor with President-elect Donald TrumpDonald TrumpHouse GOP votes to rein in independent ethics watchdog Alums of historically black college upset band marching in Trump's inaugural parade Trump on North Korea missile threat: ‘It won’t happen’ MORE.   "The Russians hope to get everything they want from Donald Trump merely by flattering the man. So far, it's been successful," Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on MSNBC.   "He's talked about weakening NATO, potentially doing away with the Ukraine sanctions, which is what the Russians care about the most. So if they can get what they want just by saying nice things about the man, why risk upsetting the apple cart over a few expulsions?" Schiff said.   President Obama announced a series of sanctions and diplomatic expulsions Thursday in response to findings by intelligence agencies that Russia directed the hacks of Democratic groups during the presidential election.   ADVERTISEMENT The administration also shuttered Russian diplomatic compounds in New York and Maryland reportedly used for intelligence purposes.   But Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Friday morning that Russia would not kick out any American diplomats in response to those moves, despite Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov publicly recommending a response.    Putin's statement specifically offered his "season's greetings also to President-elect Donald Trump and the American people," according to a translation by CNBC.    Trump has called for a more friendly approach to Russia on issues such as counterterrorism and has said America should "move on" from the discussion about the hacks.   But those calls have drawn concerns from both Democrats and some Republicans who have pushed for the Obama administration to stand up to Russia over the hacking.

MUST WATCH Back-to-back speeches from the US and Israel. 02:23 Story highlights David Andelman: One-state solution could reduce Palestinians to a permanent underclass Jewish minority would be ruling Muslim majority, with the world siding with oppressed majority, he writes David A. Andelman, editor emeritus of World Policy Journal and member of the board of contributors of USA Today, is the co-author, with the Count de Marenches, head of the DGSE, of "The Fourth World War: Diplomacy and Espionage the Age of Terrorism." Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN)Israel, and by extension the United States, are poised at the entrance to a dangerous path. The model democracy of the Middle East risks transforming into a global pariah on the scale of South Africa when it was in the depths of its apartheid nightmare. After decades of Arab-Israeli diplomacy, the idea of a one-state solution looms anew, as conservative elements in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition see the arrival of Donald Trump and his new ambassador to Israel as an opportunity to push their agenda. If it is realized, it would reduce Israel's Palestinian population to a permanent underclass and mean, in the not-too-distant future, that a Jewish minority would be ruling a Muslim majority, with the world on the side of the oppressed majority. David A. Andelman The United States would be its only friend and ally -- relegating Washington to a role equally isolated from mainstream opinion throughout the region and far beyond. This seems to be the role that President-elect Trump is carving out for America, and the role that Netanyahu is skirting perilously close to for Israel. Read More Trump's ambassador-designate, David Friedman, the President-elect's longtime friend and bankruptcy lawyer, has spent much of his career advocating and raising money for the one-state concept. His arrival in Israel will only reinforce the dramatic shift toward the more extreme parties in Netanyahu's ruling coalition that now seem to be calling the shots. It was not always this way. Three months after taking office, on June 14, 2009, just 10 days after a recently inaugurated President Barack Obama gave his landmark Middle East speech at Cairo University, Netanyahu, in a televised speech to his people, embraced a two-state solution. JUST WATCHED Keyes: Israel committed to two-state solution Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Keyes: Israel committed to two-state solution 07:45 Over the next eight years, Israel has solidified its position as one of the world's most technologically innovative countries, a bastion of democracy surrounded by an ocean of autocracies or theocracies. Five years ago, World Policy Journal used a basket of indicators to identify Israel, alongside Finland and Singapore as the world's three most innovative countries. At the time, Israel had the largest number of startups in the world outside the United States -- 3,850, or one for every 1,844 Israelis, according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center. It had more companies listed on America's tech-heavy Nasdaq than the entire European continent. The pace has only accelerated since then. More importantly, today Israel has more than 250 research units owned by or doing business for multinationals, the vast majority American companies such as IBM, Apple, Intel, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Cisco and HP. All of which makes Israel uniquely vulnerable. If Israel pursues the one-state solution, integrating ever larger stretches of Palestinian territory and population, while disenfranchising the people who live there, demographic realities will all too quickly make Jewish people a minority in their own country. Already, Israel's own census bureau shows a virtually equal number of Jewish and Arab people sharing the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. And Arab people, largely Palestinians, are expected to outnumber Jewish people by 2020. JUST WATCHED Israel plans more settlements Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Israel plans more settlements 07:07 Neither choice of what would follow under a one-state scenario is particularly appealing. John Kerry described the alternatives in his Wednesday speech: "If the choice is one-state, Israel can either be Jewish or Democratic, it cannot be both. And it won't ever really be at peace." But Kerry did not go far enough in painting the horrors that would result from Israel's efforts to maintain a Jewish-ruled state, for this Jewish minority would be controlling an increasingly unruly and oppressed majority. The world, apart from the United States, will no longer be on its side. At this point, the South Africa example is most instructive. Recall the state of that country as the campaign to abolish apartheid built up steam -- a privileged white minority ruling a black majority in a violent and brutal system. Economic and trade sanctions gradually beginning to strangle this nation that had historically been Africa's most prosperous. The arrival of worldwide consumer boycotts, campaigns to sell off stock of any company doing business with this pariah state. Future of US relationship with UN in doubt (Opinion) Recall the list of American companies currently operating in Israel; they would find themselves vulnerable to boycotts and sanctions. Their departure would quickly back Israel into a corner even more isolated than South Africa. Inevitably, a Palestinian Nelson Mandela would emerge -- a symbolic freedom fighter who Israel would have to demonize or imprison. I served as speechwriter to Mandela during his first visit to the United States after his release from prison. He was lionized from New York to Los Angeles and confided in me that he had no doubt his suffering was key to the end of apartheid in his country. But if apartheid was toxic merely to South Africa, a one-state solution and a globally blacklisted Israel threatens to be toxic to the entire Middle East. Already, the United States has been marginalized in the latest Syrian ceasefire and peace process -- with Turkey and Russia taking the lead. An apartheid system in Israel would risk leaving Russia to assume its long-sought role of dominance across the region, a position as peacemaker that would leave it paramount. On the outside, nose pressed against the glass, would stand a newly powerless United States, with only a single, deeply ostracized friend in the region. What did John Kerry's parting shot on Middle East mean? The text of the latest Security Council resolution calls on all UN member states "to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967" -- language that Netanyahu fears could lead to a surge in boycott and sanctions efforts. The resolution passed the UN Security Council 14 to 0 -- with countries from Britain and France, to Russia, China, New Zealand, Egypt, even Ukraine, voting to approve. Trump has set the US on this perilous path -- hardly one that would seem calculated to end with the Middle East peace he hopes to broker. His initial statements in support of Netanyahu, along with a series of tweets, have been accompanied by the designation of Friedman as his new ambassador. As it happens, Ronald Reagan, who dined with Friedman's father, Rabbi Morris Friedman, in 1984 -- his son, David seated at his side -- was not seduced by the one-state solution. Today, most liberal Israelis also recognize this concept for what it is -- an impossible dream. The United States must seek to pull the region back from the brink and come to a similar realization.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 2, 2017 2016: As The Hardware World Turns 22 Comments by: Brian Benchoff December 30, 2016 Soon, the ball will drop in Times Square, someone will realize you can turn ‘2018’ into a pair of novelty sunglasses, and the forgotten mumbled lyrics of Auld Lang Syne will echo through New Year’s Eve parties. It’s time once again to recount the last 366 days, and what a year it’s been. Arduino got into an argument with Arduino and Arduino won. We got new Raspberry Pis. Video cards are finally getting to the point where VR is practical. The FCC inadvertently killed security in home routers before fixing the problem. All of this is small potatoes and really doesn’t capture the essence of 2016. It’s been a weird year. Want proof 2016 was different? This year, Microsoft announced they would provide a Linux ‘shim’ with every version of Windows. By definition, 2016 was the year of the Linux desktop. That’s how weird things have been in 2016. Man, 2016 Sucked, Didn’t It? By all accounts, 2016 wasn’t a good year. David Bowie, Alan Rickman, Carrie Fisher, Antonin Scalia, Morley Safer, George Martin, Marvin Minsky, Keith Emerson, Doctor Heimlich, George Michael, Prince, Muhammad Ali, Gordie Howe, Janet Reno, Elie Weisel, Gene Wilder, Kimbo Slice, Erik Bauersfeld (voiced It’s a Trap), Anton Yelchin, Kenny Baker, Arnold Palmer, Leonard Cohen, Harambe, Fidel Castro, John Glenn, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Alan Thicke all passed away this year. Former Toronto mayor Rob Ford died at the predictably young age of 46. Lemmy lived harder and faster than anyone and beat this terrible year by three days. In the political sphere, 2016 will go down as the start of something. It’s far too early to tell what the end result will be, but between Brexit, the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, the release of the Panama Papers, a failed Turkish coup, and the presidential election in Gambia, 2016 was a year without parallel. Historians and sociologists are beginning to opine on this year, with the first drafts of the history books citing 2016 as the beginning of a populist revolution. Right now, only one thing is clear: Twitter somehow played a part. I would like to point out we had absolutely no political coverage at all. You’re welcome. The absence of anything political was an editorial prerogative, and by our judgment was the best thing to do. Like our conscious decision not to embed tweets into posts, it’s one of the many editorial decisions we make that goes without thanks or recognition. It would have been so easy and very profitable to pump out a few half-baked opinion pieces on the US presidential election this year. The word ‘trump’ is a verb, and could be easily dropped into a few very clever headlines. This level of restraint deserves, I think, a few pats on the back. Oh yeah, the Cubs won the World Series, Dylan won the Nobel Prize in Literature, we’re going to get a great NOFX album real soon, and the trend of over-hopped beer is finally coming to an end. It doesn’t balance the rest of the year, but it’s something, right? 2016 In 3D Printers 2016 was the year 3D printing started to recover from Makerbot, with advances seen in both very low-end printers and the slow but steady rise of dual (and quad) extrusion. Last year, a good $200 3D printer would have been inconceivable. At CES last January, Monoprice announced a $200 3D printer. The Monoprice MP Select Mini was really just a rebadge of the Malyan M200, but holy crap this thing is awesome. This printer is cheap at just $200, but it’s more than capable of handling anything you could throw at it. It has a 32-bit controller board, and save for a few upgrades (PEI sheet for the bed, maybe throw a larger stepper in the extruder), this printer would be worthwhile at twice the price. 2016 was the year we started to see usable dual extrusion on desktop 3D printers. Dual extrusion isn’t a new thing — it was available on the plywood Makerbots back in the day. Dual extrusion that worked well is another thing entirely. At this year’s MRRF, E3D released Scaffold, a water-soluble filament that is best described as, ‘the stuff gel-cap pharmaceuticals are made out of’. Unlike HIPS or PVA, Scaffold is easy to print with, non-toxic and can be dissolved in water. Dissolvable filament is one of the best use cases for dual extrusion, and with E3D’s Scaffold, dual extrusion makes sense now. Of course, dual extrusion traditionally means two extruders and two hotends. If you want quad extrusion, that’s four extruders. This design is ultimately impractical; it’s either too much mass to move around, or there aren’t enough pins on a controller board. Prusa turned these ideas on their head this year with the release of the quad material upgrade for the i3 Mk2. Instead of four different hotends, the Prusa multi-material upgrade only uses one hotend to print in four different colors. The results are spectacular, and it does it using only three extra stepper motors and a simple, cheap breakout board. In 2017, you’re going to see a lot of companies bring a Prusa-style multi-material machine to market. Last year’s review of the state of 3D printing lamented the lack of a mainstream CoreXY printer. This year brought us the D-Bot by [spauda], the first CoreXY printer to be picked up by the community. MakerBot sold the Smart Extruder – a part that should not fail – in packs of three. Makerbot is dead. We knew this last year, but we had to wait for the yearly financials to be released. Makerbot stopped manufacturing their printers in Brooklyn, and now the easy break ovens are manufactured in China. Every other manufacturer of 3D printers is now selling more units than Makerbot. Still, Makerbot released their sixth generation of printers this year, and Makerbot seems to be transitioning to a software company. I have said time and time again that the public perception of 3D printing is tied directly to Makerbot, and no writings on the state of consumer 3D printing mention this basic fact. The graph of the hype cycle matches shares of SYSS. The general public is a few years behind the enthusiast market, so 2018 or 2019 should see a resurgence of 3D printing in the public’s mind. Will Makerbot be around then? Yes, and they might even be making printers a few years from now. 2016 In Embedded ESP32 [Sprite_tm])’s keychain Game BoyIn 2014, a weird chip showed up on Seeed Studio. It was the ESP8266, and while initially this chip was simply a WiFi chip with a UART, hackers got their hands on this tiny little module and turned it into one of the most interesting electronic building blocks in recent memory. 2016 saw the release of the ESP32, the successor to the ESP8266. The first info for the new ESP32 dribbled out around this time last year, and the specs were amazing. The ESP32 is a dual-core WiFi and Bluetooth powerhouse that’s available for peanuts and shows awesome promise. Right now, the ESP32 is fairly rare, but it is available in quantity one. If you want to, you can build the tiniest Game Boy in the World with it. We welcome 2017 and all the ESP32 hacks it will bring. The Raspberry Pi Zero Does Not Exist Cattywampus. The chip layout on the Orange Pi is cattywampus. In November of last year, the Raspberry Pi Zero was released. Idiots on the Internet suggested the Pi Zero didn’t exist operating under the theory that since you can’t buy a Ferrari right now, Ferraris don’t exist either. Disregarding that derailed train of thought, there was a very good reason for the limited production of the Pi Zero. The Pi Foundation was busy manufacturing the Raspberry Pi 3. The Pi 3 was released in February of this year, and is proving to be one of the best single board computers available. It’s fast, has amazing support, and yes, you can just go out and buy one, just like a Raspberry Pi Zero. In other single board computer news, Orange Pi figured out how to rotate parts on a PCB. Intel did something, but not documentation. The DEF CON badge was an x86 chip, and there’s a really, really small x86 system. This year, Microchip acquired Atmel for $3.56 Billion. The PIC vs AVR microcontroller holy war is over. What will become of our ATMegas? At the very least, AVRs will still be around. There’s a new version of “the Arduino”, the ATMega328. It’s the ATMega328PB. There are new ATtinys.  There is, however, a lot of speculation over what will happen to Atmel and the chips we love so dearly. Microchip released a statement. This statement said, basically nothing. That’s good news. “Microchip will continue their philosophy of customer-driven obsolescence,” and Microchip is very good at keeping parts in the catalog long after they have been rendered obsolete. Don’t count on the DIP ‘Tiny85 disappearing anytime soon. Microchip did screw up the Atmel social media today, but at least the chips will be alright. 2016 saw the release of the first Big-O Open microcontrollers. Finally, there’s a glimmer of hope that our silicon will be unencumbered by patents and licenses. Open-V is the first Open Microcontroller, and the HiFive 1 brings the RISC-V core to the Arduino form factor. The RISC-V ISA isn’t a big deal now, but take a look around and see how many ARM microcontrollers are around you. All of those chip manufacturers pay a licensing fee to ARM. RISC-V doesn’t have that. Kids, this is one to put on your resume. 2016 In Hardware Computing Since the dawn of computing, we have all wanted one port. We needed something to attach microphones, hard drives, keyboards, printers, and phones to our computers. It would be nice if this port could supply power. The ability to connect an external device directly to the PCI bus would be neat, and connecting a display through the same cable would be really cool.In 2016, we sort of have it. The USB Type-C port, with Thunderbolt 3, is the closest we’ve ever gotten to this dream. Apple is the standard bearer of new ports. Just look at the original iMac. In an age filled with serial, parallel, and joystick ports, Apple took their ADB cables and turned them into USB ports. The industry quickly adopted USB, and 20 years later, Apple decided to do it again. Apple’s new MacBook Pros are rightly called out for being too expensive, but there is one huge advancement here: the only ports on these machines are Thunderbolt 3 with USB-C. Donglepocolapse is now a word, but it’s not going to last long. My cache of Griffin iMates tell me that. Look forward to fewer ports on your machines in the coming years, thanks to Apple and their support of Thunderbolt 3. Just don’t cheap out on the cables. The Galaxy Note 7 sold like hotcakes in 2016. Wait, I have another one. Samsung was on fire this year with the Galaxy Note 7. This year, Samsung’s flagship phone, the Galaxy Note 7 blew up. The problem was with the battery, and a few devices turned into bombs while charging. Samsung recalled the Note 7, and it’s illegal to take this phone on a commercial airline in the US. With this many lithium-powered devices, something like this was bound to happen sooner or later. Despite being outlawed by the FAA and kicked off cellular networks, the Note 7 is still selling for about $200 on eBay. I kind of want one. Microsoft and Apple If 2016 wasn’t weird enough, Apple and Microsoft swapped places. Now the Evil Empire is based out of Cupertino and innovation is coming out of Redmond. Microsoft started this whole mess in March (two days before April Fools) by saying Cygwin Can Suck It. Ubuntu will run with native Windows libraries. In reality, everything is still Windows, but Microsoft is providing a ‘shim’ that will allow Linux binaries to run. Apple Sucks Now, Here’s A Thinkpad Buyer’s Guide. For the past few years, Apple hasn’t been paying attention to the Macintosh. Really: go look at the MacRumors Buyer’s Guide and note the release schedule. Desktops are forgotten, the flagship Mac desktop hasn’t been updated in three years, and the recent update of the MacBook Pro was poorly received. In contrast, Microsoft recently released the Surface Studio PC, a neat piece of hardware that’s even better than an iMac and a Wacom Cintiq. Microsoft will soon require manufacturers to use ‘precision touchpads’ in laptops, giving Windows users an experience similar to the excellent Apple touchpads. The world has turned upside down, and soon we may see bog-standard Windows laptops with the same high-quality hardware found in Apple machines. 2016 wasn’t all bad for Apple. Pressured by the FBI to build a new version of iOS with a backdoor, Apple CEO Tim Cook did something amazing. He said no. The eleventh largest company in the world stood up for civil liberties and user privacy. Around here we swing anti-corporate and anti-establishment, but we have to give Tim Cook the respect he deserves for this action. Of course, a backdoor in iOS wouldn’t have done anything, and the FBI eventually cracked the phone in question, but still, Apple deserves a lot of respect. There’s a lot of real courage over there. Actual Hardware We’ve had desktop CNC mills forever, and the RepRap project is still a noble pursuit. 2016 brought some very cool new machines to market, allowing weekend warriors access to the same tools the big boys have. Wazer is a real waterjet machine that fits on your workbench. For a few thousand dollars, you can cut glass into any shape you want. You can cut metal without heating it. You can cut carbon fiber without wearing out a blade. A waterjet has a lot of requirements — you need high-pressure pumps, nozzles that can withstand abrasion, and a consumable medium. It took several years, but Wazer finally released their machine with a successful Kickstarter. Although the Shaper isn’t fundamentally different from a ShopBot, this hand-held CNC router is technically the largest CNC router on the planet. Instead of an XY gantry, Shaper uses computer vision and an attentive human operator to keep a bit where it should be. It’s amazing technology that’s been years in the making, but in 2016, this neat piece of kit was finally released. What does 2017 have in store? It’s a bit too early to tell, but desktop injection molding might be a thing next year. Everything will be bigger, better, and cheaper. Looking Forward How does 2017 look like for Hackaday? This year was great for the entire Hackaday family. Editorially, we could have sold out so hard. So hard like you wouldn’t believe. We didn’t. You’re welcome. We’re producing more and better content than we ever have before. Tindie, our ever-faithful robotic dog, is going gangbusters. Every day, more people are selling their electronic and ‘maker’ paraphernalia on Tindie. Hackaday.io is likewise going crazy. Growth is huge, and we continue to have the best hardware community on the Internet. This year was the third Hackaday Prize The entries were amazing, the work was fantastic, and someone even found a use for ferrofluid that wasn’t just artsy-fartsy stuff. We gave away a lot of prizes, and learned a lot from the hundreds of submissions. The SuperConference was a blast, and we already have a theme for next year: “SuperCon IV – Because ‘Zoso’ was already taken”. What does 2017 have in store for Hackaday? More. More of everything. The third edition of the Hackaday Omnibus is in the works, and thanks to our fantastic community managers, we’re doing more events than ever before. 2017 is going to be a great year, and it’s all thanks to you, our readers.

Hot button topics are easy because no one knows how to handle them…including the audience. But boy do they make the servers burn. As for the waterjet and glass, does that introduce any stress in the cut edges that needs to be treated out? And the Note 7 maybe a third supplier can fix the “too big for the space” battery assuming that was the problem. Report comment Reply SOI Sentinel says: December 30, 2016 at 7:56 am The waterjet will not add any additional stresses. This doesn’t mean that already existing stresses won’t make trouble, though. I have a friend who had a Note 7. I think he would have gone for a slightly smaller battery as long as the pen related software stayed the same (which as far as I know means you’re still using the stock ROM image). He wouldn’t have liked that, but if an external battery-case would have offset it, I think he would have lived with it. I’ve not messed with my Android phones, so I don’t know how easy it would have been to disable the auto updates that are disabling Note 7’s currently. It STILL would have not been allowed on a plane (or other public transportation?), however, which would continue to reduce its audience. Report comment Reply Internet says: December 31, 2016 at 12:19 pm “Wazer finally released their machine with a successful Kickstarter.” Umm, might want to reword that to read: Wazer finished a Kickstarter campaign. That doesn’t mean they have or are going to actually release a machine or that the machine is actually going to be any good. It’s a niche machine in a niche market with major drawbacks and it still is very much a manual machine in terms of the amount of work you have to do to operate it, clean it, etc. Plus, waste disposal and just buying the raw abrasive materials are not easy at all either. It’s basically a “no frills” machine that can produce about as much (still undisclosed) pressure as a pressure washer that happens to be able to erode materials but does so at a much slower pace than anything commercially available, while using significantly more abrasive per minute. There remain a significant amount of unanswered questions about the machine and until those are answered, I am still reserving judgement on exactly what this machine can actually do. It’s a neat toy for sure and it has a very small user base that would appreciate what it can do but I am reserving overall judgement until they actually, you know, release something (machines, actual specifications) to customers.

It’s still not a 3d printer though. “If your Glowforge was pre-ordered before October 25th, 2015, it will be ready to ship July 2017” “If you choose to receive a pre-release unit, it will remain our property.

Mostly the newer graphics technologies are not only relevant to the game development field but more specifically the game engine development. It reveals the complex workings that used to be driver domain and leaves it up the programmer to do all the code leading to a lot of bloat where unless your making a engine you probably aren’t going to use it. Hackaday seems to focused on hardware and hardware hacks. Vulkan and DirectX seem a bit out of scope.

Report comment Reply Internet says: December 31, 2016 at 12:34 pm As much as I would like it to be, I remain a bit reserved that desktop injection molding is going to be a huge game changer in 2017 unless I am missing something about the mold production process being made cheaper and easier? I could see it happen by combining a few automated 3d design tools with JIT aluminum milling, bringing the costs of the mold down to maybe a few grand, tops without requiring huge amounts of mold design work, combining that with a $10,000ish machine with a high degree of automation that can use off the shelf nurdles. Who handles mold post finishing and polishing work? You are not going to get a high polish finish without somebody or something rubbing the heck out of the mold first. But they are quoting a mold cost of $250. “Mold cost by using CNC machine your own $250 (Tormach).” That feels a bit… optimistic. And a Tormach, while a decent machine, is not cheap nor automated. The $250 quoted “mold cost” would be for mostly the cost of the material and maybe wear on the tooling but nothing else. Report comment Reply The Snob says: January 2, 2017 at 10:04 am Protomold can pretty much do what you’re referring to–upload a CAD file and quote you a cost to produce X units in Y material. As you say, you see right away that much of the cost of a tool is how nice a finish you want. As-machined tools are pretty cheap. As for the cost of making a tool on a Tormach, a couple nice chunks of 6061 bar is maybe $30, so unless you’re snapping endmills regularly, most of the cost is going to be labor. If you’re making your own prototypes, then I suppose it depends on how you value your time and whether you’re amortizing the ~15k cost of the mill and tooling. I’m also a little curious about the volume:clamp pressure ratio. I have a Morgan G55T which has a 2oz shot size which is a little bigger than this, but the max clamp pressure is 20 tons versus about 6.5 on this one, and it has more than twice the injection pressure. So I wonder about the limitations there. That said, the controls and automation on this machine look very nice. I’m a bit skeptical of the price given that a new Morgan is ~20k for a much simpler machine whose R&D costs were paid off decades ago, but I guess Chinese controls and mechanicals are pretty cheap nowadays… Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Wearable makers want you to want them USA TODAY 3 days ago Mike Feibus © USA TODAY Still image of wearables Most of you still don’t have a smartwatch or fitness tracker, recent surveys reveal nor do you want one. Worse, many of you who received them as gifts got bored and gave up on them. Which means it’s time for smartwatches and fitness trackers to take the next step. Stagnant growth is now adding urgency to the message that counting steps has taken wearables about as far as they can go. So as consumer electronics suppliers prepare to jet off next week to Consumer Electronics Show, the industry’s annual gathering in Las Vegas, wearables companies like Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Misfit and Samsung find themselves confronting the uncomfortable truth that their products still aren’t compelling to normal people. I expect 2017 will be a make-or-break year for wearables makers as they retool to extend their market beyond techno-geeks, professional athletes, fitness freaks and other early adopters. We’ll start seeing changes beginning next week at CES, with more accurate hardware, more interesting metrics and more helpful insight. Can they succeed?  Too early to say. I’m seeing positive developments in hardware and metrics, and I expect a lot of those building blocks to fall into place in 2017. But I worry about whether they are paying enough attention to the last, most vital component: engaging insight. It’s difficult — and, frankly, foreign — for wearables makers to venture beyond technology and into psychology. But it’s critically important to the future of this $10 billion business. If they can’t come up with creative ways to keep normal people interested, then next year’s wearables are destined for the sock drawer, along with millions of other trackers from Christmas Past. Better hardware, more meaningful metrics The wrist may be one of the easiest spots on the body to strap a wearable. But it’s also one of the toughest places to collect measurements, because there is so much extraneous activity. Take step-counting, for example. When we walk, our arms typically sway back and forth. But we might also grab something from our pocket. Or scratch our heads. Or wave to friends. Weeding out those confounding movements is no small task. Heart rate is also difficult to measure on the wrist because of all the movement. Most wearables shine light into the skin and use sensors to detect changes caused by blood flow. Pretty straightforward, provided we’re sitting perfectly still. Which we almost never are. Movement can cause wearables to shift a little on the skin, and change how much ambient light seeps in. Companies like Analog Devices, Intel, Philips, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Valencell have made great strides in filtering out all the noise to deliver more accurate results. That, in turn, is giving rise to new metrics that go well beyond simple step counts and heart rate. Like heart-rate variability, or HRV, for example. HRV tracks the time between individual heart beats. Though your heart may pump at a steady rate of 72 beats per minute, the time between each of those 72 beats are all a little different. The variations are typically larger when you’re calm and relaxed, and shorter when you’re active or tense. HRV is proving to be a critical indicator of stress, fitness and overall health. Which is why companies like Firstbeat, LifeQ and NeuroSky are offering heart-rate variability along with a wealth of other new measures, including stress levels, calorie intake, sleep quality and even blood pressure. Getting people to care So how do they make wearables useful to normal people? Even with so many new metrics, this may be the most difficult hurdle to overcome. Like most tech industry players, wearables suppliers are so focused on delivering the next capabilities, improving the display and extending battery life that they sometimes lose sight of what will make people put on their devices – and keep them on. I certainly don’t qualify as one of the normal people they’re trying to reach. I’m one of those early adopter types. I’ve already logged more than 10 million steps tracked by nearly 20 different wearables. Being an early adopter means I’m willing to do what most normal people won’t: put up with the time and aggravation of force-fitting new technology into my life for limited and sometimes questionable gain. I do it to get an early glimpse into what’s possible. Normal people won’t tolerate that. They are interested in wearables that can nudge them onto a healthier path. But they must be quick and easy to set up, gain insight as they learn about you, and offer up recommendations for fine-tuning our activity at a time when we’re interested in hearing them.

As per sources, an unidentified source claiming to be ‘Dark Hacker’ identified itself as ‘Distrucktor Dipu’ had maliciously seeped into the hospital website rendering it useless. It had deleted the entire database on the website. It had reportedly posted some lewd comments and abusive statements while uploading a Bangladesh flag also. Meanwhile, the hospital authorities have blocked the website and filed a complaint at the local cyber police station. The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Post Graduate Institute of Paediatrics, popularly known as Sishubhawan hospital is a renowned institute for child care in eastern India. Recently Odisha has witnessed sharp increase in hacking and other cyber related crimes. From governmental to private, hackers have been able to manipulate weak database of the websites and destroy crucial information while putting Intel at risk as cyber police is yet to take any noticeable action in this regard. On April 20 OSSC website was hacked by Philippines Cyber syndicate, Utkal University’s website was similarly hacked on May 3 by a Pakistan branded source. Earlier on September 30, the website of Odisha State Agricultural Marketing (OSAM) Board was hacked by pro-Pakistan hackers.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search The “Dogs Of The Dow” Strategy Worked Incredibly Well In 2016 December 30, 2016 7:05am INDEXDJX:.DJI NYSE:DIA ShareTweet From Mike Burnick: It has been a volatile, difficult year for most stock market investors, as you can see in the chart of the Dow shown below. But one time-honored investment strategy absolutely smoked the indexes in 2016, the venerable Dow Dogs. 2016 began with an 11% Dow dive in January, then after see-saw price action in February, stocks bungee-jumped right back, with a 16% rally into spring. But alas, from mid-April through October, investors were greeted with more frustrating see-saw action as the Dow settled into an uneven trading range. If you look to the far right hand side of the chart above, you can see that really ALL of the gains for the Dow this year came in the final two months, with the Dow up just over 14% year to date. The basic strategy of simply buying the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average – known as the Dogs of the Dow – beat the Dow, and most other stock market indexes, by a wide margin in 2016. An equally weighted portfolio of the Dow Dogs, constructed on December 31, 2015, gained nearly 21% this year, compared to a gain of just 14.4% for all 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and a gain of just 10.7% for the S&P 500 Index. What’s more, you would have started 2016 already ahead of the game, with a hefty average dividend yield of 3.85% from the 10 Dow dogs – nearly twice the yield of the overall stock market! And last year’s performance isn’t just an aberration either. The Dow Dogs have beaten the Dow Jones Industrials in five out of the last six years, including 2016. Over the past five years alone, the Dogs’ average annual gain is 14.9%, compared to just 11.7% for the Dow itself, a sizeable performance advantage for these stock market mutts. So to see which high dividend yielding Dow stocks make it into the dog pound for 2017, see the table below… There are quite a few returning mutts for the year ahead, and two new dogs entering the list. The top five performing Dogs of 2016 (Caterpillar, Chevron, IBM, Verizon and Exxon Mobil) remain on the list for next year too, which is quite an accomplishment. Typically, superior price performance reduces the dividend yield and lets last year’s dogs graduate from the pound. Caterpillar (CAT), for instance, gained 44.6% in 2016, topping all the other dogs (and the other 29 Dow stocks too), but its dividend yield of 4.1% is still the second-highest among the Dow 30 stocks. Also, returning for 2017 are Cisco Systems (CSCO), Pfizer (PFE) and Procter & Gamble (PG). Two new dogs join them for 2017: Intel (INTC) and Coca-Cola (KO), which replace Wal-Mart (WMT) and Merck (MRK) in the dog pound next year. Bottom line: While relatively few stock investment strategies stand the test of time, the Dogs of the Dow has a very good track record at beating the market. Plus, there aren’t many strategies as easy for you to execute as buying and holding ten blue-chip stocks that pay attractive dividends while waiting for price appreciation. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was unchanged in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, DIA has gained 15.73%, versus a 11.19% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. DIA currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #3 of 76 ETFs in the Large Cap Value ETFs category. This article is brought to you courtesy of Money And Markets.

A Bay Area resident herself, Kohli has completed 200+ hours of community service during her high school years, volunteering for several organizations that aid the homeless, such as West Valley Community Services and Family Supportive Housing. She even received the Presidential Volunteer Service Silver Award to commemorate her efforts in 2016. Her work compelled her to research homelessness in the Bay Area, using interviews with homeless people and nonprofit workers to explore the pervasive issue. The project highlighted the funding needs of agencies aiding the homeless, motivating Kohli to do her part in combating the issue. By contributing all of the proceeds from her debut art showcase, Kohli was able to raise $1000+ for West Valley Community Services, an organization providing resources to the homeless in Santa Clara County. Regarding her efforts, the budding artist and activist said, “I hope my journey, shaped by the many homeless people I have met, will make people realize that they need to help the homeless and that they have the power to change someone’s life.” Kohli’s extensive work with the homeless community left an itching desire to understand how such poverty could exist, even in one of America’s richest neighborhoods. As she compiled her own research project, she discovered the high-housing costs and lack of awareness regarding homelessness were the main culprits. Kohli wants to combat all the problems she can, using the art fundraiser for the homeless of Santa Clara County to combat the issue of agencies lacking funds. Last month at the Winter Art & Craft Fair, organized for their employees by American technology company Intel, in Santa Clara, Pankhuri Kohli participated along with her mother and artist Sujata Tibrewala to exhibit some of her paintings. Encouraged by the stupendous response her paintings got, Kohli decided to continue her efforts to raise funds through online showcase of their works. The artists were able to meet their target of raising $1000, all of which assists the homeless in the Santa Clara county. About the event: Artist Pankhuri Kohli along with her mother Sujata Tibrewala raised funds through the sale of their art, art prints and bookmarks with their art on it by participating in the annual Winter Art Fair organized by Tibrewala’s employers Intel in Santa Clara. The artists continued their exhibit online and successfully reached their target of $1000 to raise funds for West Valley Community Services, Inc. (WVCS), a private non-profit, community-based agency that has been providing direct assistance and referral services to the west valley communities of Santa Clara County for over 40 years. About Pankhuri Kohli: Pankhuri Kohli is a high school senior student and an emerging artist who pursues art as a hobby and to help make a difference to the lives of others. She aspires to raise awareness towards the problem of homelessness and has just completed an extensive research on the subject.

Mr. Obama plans to rent an office in Washington, as history repeats itself, sort of. It was Woodrow Wilson who became the last president to remain in Washington after his term was up. Americans were not sold on Wilson's advocacy of U.S. membership in the League of Nations. Moreover, our World War I president's long illness had unofficially made his First Lady the de facto President during the last two years of her husband's term. But Obama In our day – since the Constitution barred Mr. Obama from a third term on top of his ruinous and lawless eight years – our current president used as an excuse to hang around Washington the fact that one of his daughters wanted to finish her schooling. Yeah, right. His real aim is clear. The mainstream media will treat him as the fountainhead of all wisdom, as of course he knew they would, and he will now be in a perfect position to second guess (by then) President Trump, who can't get to that White House soon enough to rescue America. Constitution? Since Mr. Obama disregarded the Constitution while in office, what makes anyone think he will respect that precious freedom-preserving, tyrant-unfriendly document now that he is safely beyond the wrath of the mere voters? Many of them are steaming because of the uncountable illegal aliens who may have given Hillary Clinton her edge in the popular vote, as he openly urged them to do. This situation is precisely the ultimate example of why the Founding Fathers gave us the Electoral College. We don't know whether illegals tipped the scales to enable Hillary to carry the heavy vote count in California and New York. UN Supposedly "on his way out the door," Mr.Obama has stabbed Israel, our reliable ally in the Middle East, by making it even easier for the terrorists there to inflict permanent damage on that lone democracy in the neighborhood. Even though the settlements have been built, for which Israel is roundly criticized, what really does it matter? Many of those objecting the loudest do not believe Israel has a right to exist. So what are we talking about here? Stop hitting my fist with your face (again)? Hypocrisy But don't worry. On January, the betrayal of an ally will mean even less to our outgoing president who imitates a whiny autocrat when he's not only beyond the voters, but also beyond the reach of impeachment. Somewhere, there is a need to make an official "on the record" statement about him. Dereliction of duty? Failure to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"? Even worse? Does anyone dare utter the "t" word (as in traitor)? What's more... Our friends at Judicial Watch have issued a report that "Islamic terrorists operate [and] raise cash in Latin America to attack [the] U.S." Chris Farrell's report from Judicial Watch is based on a document released by Spain's Defense Ministry, which informs us that Latin America "is a hotbed of terrorism where groups like ISIS and Hezbollah operate freely and raise large sums of money to finance terrorism in other countries, mainly the United States." Judicial Watch cites cooperation between Islamic terrorists and Mexican drug cartels, and the Spanish Intel report says, "The ignorance involving the threat of jihadist terrorism in Latin America has been such that some governments have refused to cooperate with U.S. authorities." Millions of Muslims, including some from nations that are rife with terrorist activity, have flooded nations south of the U.S. border. This column has previously reported that we in the U.S. are surrounded – literally, politically, militarily, and ideologically. This peril to our nation comes at a time when our lame duck Commander-in-Chief is giddy exhibiting the swagger that has sometimes characterized bullies. He betrays not only the people who twice elected him, but, as with his betrayal of Israel, has no compunction about abandoning allies. It requires no genius to be concerned that all this threat and danger can lead to war on our own soil. 9/11 may have been a prelude. Again we are reminded of the tongue-lashing delivered bluntly on the floor of the British Parliament to the hapless Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who had appeased Hitler – "In the name of God, go." But Chamberlain was a dupe. Obama shows every sign of knowing exactly what he is doing. © Wes Vernon   The views expressed by RenewAmerica columnists are their own and do not necessarily reflect the position of RenewAmerica or its affiliates.

Wearable makers want you to want them USA TODAY 3 days ago Mike Feibus © USA TODAY Still image of wearables Most of you still don’t have a smartwatch or fitness tracker, recent surveys reveal nor do you want one. Worse, many of you who received them as gifts got bored and gave up on them. Which means it’s time for smartwatches and fitness trackers to take the next step. Stagnant growth is now adding urgency to the message that counting steps has taken wearables about as far as they can go. So as consumer electronics suppliers prepare to jet off next week to Consumer Electronics Show, the industry’s annual gathering in Las Vegas, wearables companies like Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Misfit and Samsung find themselves confronting the uncomfortable truth that their products still aren’t compelling to normal people. I expect 2017 will be a make-or-break year for wearables makers as they retool to extend their market beyond techno-geeks, professional athletes, fitness freaks and other early adopters. We’ll start seeing changes beginning next week at CES, with more accurate hardware, more interesting metrics and more helpful insight. Can they succeed?  Too early to say. I’m seeing positive developments in hardware and metrics, and I expect a lot of those building blocks to fall into place in 2017. But I worry about whether they are paying enough attention to the last, most vital component: engaging insight. It’s difficult — and, frankly, foreign — for wearables makers to venture beyond technology and into psychology. But it’s critically important to the future of this $10 billion business. If they can’t come up with creative ways to keep normal people interested, then next year’s wearables are destined for the sock drawer, along with millions of other trackers from Christmas Past. Better hardware, more meaningful metrics The wrist may be one of the easiest spots on the body to strap a wearable. But it’s also one of the toughest places to collect measurements, because there is so much extraneous activity. Take step-counting, for example. When we walk, our arms typically sway back and forth. But we might also grab something from our pocket. Or scratch our heads. Or wave to friends. Weeding out those confounding movements is no small task. Heart rate is also difficult to measure on the wrist because of all the movement. Most wearables shine light into the skin and use sensors to detect changes caused by blood flow. Pretty straightforward, provided we’re sitting perfectly still. Which we almost never are. Movement can cause wearables to shift a little on the skin, and change how much ambient light seeps in. Companies like Analog Devices, Intel, Philips, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Valencell have made great strides in filtering out all the noise to deliver more accurate results. That, in turn, is giving rise to new metrics that go well beyond simple step counts and heart rate. Like heart-rate variability, or HRV, for example. HRV tracks the time between individual heart beats. Though your heart may pump at a steady rate of 72 beats per minute, the time between each of those 72 beats are all a little different. The variations are typically larger when you’re calm and relaxed, and shorter when you’re active or tense. HRV is proving to be a critical indicator of stress, fitness and overall health. Which is why companies like Firstbeat, LifeQ and NeuroSky are offering heart-rate variability along with a wealth of other new measures, including stress levels, calorie intake, sleep quality and even blood pressure. Getting people to care So how do they make wearables useful to normal people? Even with so many new metrics, this may be the most difficult hurdle to overcome. Like most tech industry players, wearables suppliers are so focused on delivering the next capabilities, improving the display and extending battery life that they sometimes lose sight of what will make people put on their devices – and keep them on. I certainly don’t qualify as one of the normal people they’re trying to reach. I’m one of those early adopter types. I’ve already logged more than 10 million steps tracked by nearly 20 different wearables. Being an early adopter means I’m willing to do what most normal people won’t: put up with the time and aggravation of force-fitting new technology into my life for limited and sometimes questionable gain. I do it to get an early glimpse into what’s possible. Normal people won’t tolerate that. They are interested in wearables that can nudge them onto a healthier path. But they must be quick and easy to set up, gain insight as they learn about you, and offer up recommendations for fine-tuning our activity at a time when we’re interested in hearing them.

The G5 successor is also believed to debut sans the modular design its predecessor introduced to the market this year.  LG is putting its past behind it. While its G4 handset debuted with a plastic body, the G5 launched with an all-metal design. As the South Korea brand moves on with its next flagship, it intends to use a different material for its body. Information from insiders based in its home country claims the upcoming G6 flagship device is sporting a curved all-glass back and an all-glass front.  Android Authority has learned that for the front of the handset, LG is going to use a 2.5D glass panel that’s being manufactured by Biel Company. The front glass won’t be curved like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, but it will resemble the panel found on the regular Galaxy S7.  Related Stories Ransomware Ruins Holiday By Hijacking Family's LG Smart TV on Christmas Day LG G6 Won't Come With G5's Modular Design LG to Supply Apple, Google and Microsoft with Foldable Displays At the back is a different story. Apparently, LG is reportedly making a handset that will come equipped with a 3D glass panel. It will have curved sides for better grip. This panel is rumored to be manufactured by C&S Glass. For many consumers, ditching the all-metal body found on its predecessor is quite puzzling. However, sources say that LG has decided to ditch metal for glass because it intends to add a seamless wireless charging feature to the G6. This just corroborates previous intel that LG is giving up on its modular design.  Using glass for the G6 is all the more not surprising knowing that Samsung and Apple are also preparing glass smartphones for 2017. It remains to be seen if other brands are following suit. Nonetheless, it’s clear that industry giants are going for edgier technologies with their upcoming releases next year.  The new information comes a day after renders of the LG G6 leaked online. Based on the renders, the handset could sport a 5.3-inch QHD display with 2560 x 1440 screen resolution. The device is also rumored to come with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset, as per MobileSyrup. Since nothing has been set in stone so far, the specs and features of the G6 could be different when it is revealed at CES 2017.

The curved monitor Samsung CH711 will be officially launched at CES 2017 with the details on price and availability. While Samsung says the monitor is designed keeping gamers in mind, a look at the monitor would also make it seem at home in a professional setup and even Mac users. The Samsung CH711 quantum dot curved monitor would be selling in the 27-inch and 31.5-inch form factor with a QHD or 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. The monitor features an 1800R radius curvature and will be offering a viewing angle of around 178-degrees with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It claims to offer 125 percent of sRGB coverage as well. The monitors are expected to start selling in early 2017. (Also Read: CES 2017: Qualcomm, Samsung, Intel, Xiaomi and other company keynotes you need to keep a track of) The Samsung CH711 can be adjusted vertically as well as horizontally and can also support a three-sided ‘Boundless’ design. This means that you can place three CH711s beside each other in case you want a really wide display. This is helped by the fact that the CH711 has extremely thin bezels on the sides as well as the top. Quantum Dots do not suffer from lag issues as say an OLED panel does, which makes it ideal for gamers. But having said that, the picture quality and contrast offered by an OLED display is currently claimed to be superior to quantum dot monitors. Samsung hasn’t clarified if the panel will be an 8-bit one or a 10-bit one. Also no details are out on the refresh rate either. Samsung will let us know more details in its CES 2017 keynote address. It will also be announcing availability and pricing details of CFG70 and CF791 Quantum dot monitors at CES.

How China Built 'iPhone City' With Billions in Perks for Apple's Partner The New York Times 4 days ago By DAVID BARBOZA < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 6NEXT SLIDE > The Zhengzhou government pledged to spend more than $10 billion on an airport just a few miles from the iPhone factory. © Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times ZHENGZHOU, China — A vast, boxy customs center acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China. Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes — counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 115.82 -0.91 -0.78% Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd HNHPF ▼ 5.05 -0.25 -4.72% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% New York Times Co NYT ▼ 13.30 -0.10 -0.75% The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter It all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City.” The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” American officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country. Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. In this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world. But the reasons behind their choices are not always transparent. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate — and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves. China’s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to China to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world’s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners like Foxconn. While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to American technology companies — and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple’s consumer sales. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation, or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. The confidential government records obtained by The Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their “support” for iPhone production, calling the benefits a “preferential policy.” The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, like infrastructure, labor, taxes and exports. As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale — and the sway that they afford in China — is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer. The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the American technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here. In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the government’s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner. Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was “no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments.” A growing backlash against globalization puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the United States and China. President-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on American companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to “build their damn computers and things in this country.” China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of Western influence, particularly American technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security. China, no longer content with just being the world’s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programs that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny. Regulators shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring, just six months after the services were introduced in China. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant for failure to fully pay its taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country. Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met with Mr. Trump in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. It followed a similar good-will tour in China in August, when Mr. Cook sat down with the country’s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government’s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing’s Imperial City. The two countries are playing a high-stakes game. Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages — a complexity that is often lost in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports two million jobs in the United States. As China and the United States both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs. As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store. Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totaled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone. The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation. The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn’s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year. The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers. Pursuing the iPhone Apple was late to China. In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest American technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company’s co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated. Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them — in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Mr. Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Mr. Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity. “This is a machine that is made in America,” Mr. Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer. Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Mr. Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Mr. Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how. Under the direction of Mr. Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big American brands like Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths — design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost. “They have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple’s growth,” said Joe O’Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia. When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. Foxconn’s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones. “The reason Foxconn’s so big is Terry Gou,” said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.” After the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China — unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations. “These have become like Olympic competitions,” said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China’s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant laborers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters. City officials lavished money and favorable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers. The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory. “We know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,” said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego. The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licenses were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park. “I was impressed,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. “They were very focused.” Made, and Sold, in China When Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world’s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers. But Apple initially had to take the “Hong Kong U-turn” to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers. Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government’s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands. Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports — hence, the U-turn employed by many companies. In 2005, Apple’s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country’s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China. “This was really a legacy of China’s old export-oriented economy,” said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Walmart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. “Back then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.” Apple and other multinationals wanted a better system. By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centers inside the country. In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city’s airport, to expedite Apple’s global shipments. Although it wasn’t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world’s largest iPhone manufacturing facility. A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country, or out to the rest of the world. As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple’s global tax strategy. In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically. The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale, according to a 2013 American congressional report on the company’s tax practices. It is a practice commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China. “U.S. multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “In doing so, they create stateless income — income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.” According to the congressional report, the process allowed Apple to move tens of billions of dollars offshore and substantially reduce its tax bill, which one senator called the “holy grail of tax avoidance.” The European Union in August ordered Ireland to claw back more than $14.5 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period. Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering a subsidiary in Ireland that previously had no tax jurisdiction. It is appealing the ruling in the European Union. In Zhengzhou, local officials have lauded the package of incentives provided to Foxconn, confident that the city’s iPhone production will continue to pay huge dividends. In August 2014, the city’s top leaders held a special meeting to discuss “deepening collaboration” with Foxconn, according to the government records obtained by The Times. They crowed that Zhengzhou was the “biggest production base for Apple iPhone worldwide.” There were 94 production lines producing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, and the government said about 230 million smartphones had already been exported from Zhengzhou, making it one of the nation’s crucial export centers. Production capacity had reached half a million iPhones a day. The city’s tax revenue was rapidly rising. Officials had a name for it all: “Zhengzhou Speed.” A State-Recruited Army A crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab. They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones — up to 350 a minute. Apple’s labor force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government. As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers. “Every city’s department of labor and ministry of human resources is involved,” said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting center in Zhengzhou. The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Mr. Liu said. “If the demand is high, then they will pay more,” he said. “If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.” Cities like Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don’t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China. As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology. To advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, China’s State Council, the country’s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any preferential treatment, including subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters. The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue. But the broad trend lines are clear: Overseas companies will no longer get the welcome they once received. The Chinese government is tightening access to its huge market and pressuring Western technology companies to advance domestic goals — in a coordinated action that one congressional study in the United States called a new form of “techno-nationalism.” “The government wants to know what you can give to China,” said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised American companies operating in China. “And they have the market and the muscle. They’re not playing around anymore.” Chinese regulators have been penalizing overseas companies, like the American mobile chip giant Qualcomm, which was forced to reduce prices for companies that sell smartphones within the country. It is a market increasingly dominated by Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi that undercut Apple and Samsung on price. China is also scrutinizing Western technology companies over national security issues. Beijing has increased oversight of the internet with new cybersecurity rules and forced state companies to reduce spending on overseas technology. It pressed Apple to hand over its source code. Apple said it refused. Apple has agreed to the government’s request to store more of its local data on Chinese servers. It must also undergo “security audits” on new models of the iPhone before gaining approval to sell the product. Beijing also expects American companies to help develop China’s own capabilities. Apple is teaming up with UnionPay, a state-backed financial services company. It has invested $1 billion in the Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, which has significant backing from state companies. Mr. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has also carefully cultivated Apple’s image as a big employer, a good corporate citizen and a major economic contributor. He comes to China regularly. He has donned factory uniforms and walked the assembly line in Zhengzhou. He has courted regulators, the heads of state telecom giants and the country’s top leaders, including Mr. Xi. In an interview with Chinese state television last year, Mr. Cook explained how Apple was planting trees in the country, calling the effort a “pillar of its environmental strategy.” He detailed plans to build a massive solar project to power Apple’s stores, headquarters and offices throughout the country. He also boasted about creating over three million jobs in China, half of them in manufacturing. At the Hall of Purple Light in the government’s walled leadership compound in Beijing, Mr. Cook promised in August to build the company’s first research and development center in the country and to support the government’s big focus on high-end manufacturing. Opposite him sat the vice premier, Zhang Gaoli. Beside him sat his partner. There was the chairman of Foxconn, Mr. Gou. Also present was the party leader of the province where Zhengzhou is located, Xie Fuzhan.

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Dec 29, 2016 at 5:19PM Image source:  Flickr user BagoGames In 2012, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) began a capital return program. This program intended to return cash to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. In November 2012, Nvidia announced its first quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share. Based on the closing price on the day of the announcement, this represented an annual dividend yield of 2.4% -- a healthy yield for a nimble, relatively small, tech company with above average growth prospects. In 2013, Nvidia began repurchasing significant amounts of its own stock. The effect of Nvidia's share repurchases can be seen in the growth of earnings per share (EPS). When a company repurchases, or buys back, its own shares, the number of shares is reduced. This, in effect, increases EPS as net income is divided by fewer shares.  From fiscal 2013 through the end of fiscal 2016, Nvidia reduced shares outstanding from 624 million to 569 million, or 8.8%. Over the same period, net income increased $562 million to $614 million, or 9.2%. But earnings per share increased $0.90 to $1.08, or 20%, thanks to a lower share count. Taking advantage of being undervalued What is particularly noteworthy about Nvidia's share repurchases is that Nvidia purchased less shares as the stock price climbed to higher levels. In fiscal 2014 (or calendar year 2013), Nvidia repurchased $887 million worth of stock. In fiscal 2015, Nvidia repurchased $814 million. Beginning in fiscal 2016, that figure dropped to $587 million. Nvidia repurchased more stock at lower valuation levels and less stock as its valuation increased. When Nvidia began its capital return program in November 2012, the stock was trading around $12.50 per share. Nvidia repurchased more than $1 billion worth of shares through January 2015 with the stock trading below $20 for most of that time. Nearly all of those share repurchases were made at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of less than 20, a valuation many investors consider attractive for a business with above average growth prospects. Nvidia also used share repurchases to offset share dilution, as Fool writer Timothy Green discussed. The use of repurchases to offset share dilution from stock options and other equity awards is common practice, and though some investors feel this is wasteful, stock options are an essential tool in attracting top talent in technology.  Whatever the motivation, the opportunism and foresight of Nvidia's management with the timing of share repurchases shouldn't be overlooked. When Nvidia announced it would return $1 billion to shareholders in 2013, its stock was trading for a P/E of 14 -- meaning investors were paying only $14 for every $1 in earnings. Since then, the stock has seen a seven-fold increase. It's clear that investors in 2013 were not adequately valuing Nvidia's stock price, management had the foresight to realize this and were shrewd enough to repurchase shares when the stock is undervalued.  The company began repurchases as it was finding tremendous momentum and opportunity to leverage its GPUs across different industries. Many growth opportunities have emerged in datacenters and automotive since 2013, and the company's capital allocation plan suggested management foresaw this growth. When Nvidia announced an expansion of the capital return program, in April 2013, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang stated as a reason: "NVIDIA's strategies are gaining traction in the market and make us confident in our ability to continue generating cash". This statement underlines that the repurchases were an effort to capitalize on what management saw as an undervalued stock price. Taking advantage of a strong balance sheet Because of the intense competition in the technology sector, it's important for tech companies to keep plenty of cash on the balance sheet. Yet, it's remarkable that Nvidia -- a company with a fraction of the revenues and cash flows of competitors like Intel and Qualcomm -- distributed to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends approximately 100% of its free cash flow between fiscal year 2013 and fiscal 2016. Nvidia borrowed about $1.5 billion at an interest rate of only 1% to help finance share repurchases. The company had more than $4 billion of cash on its balance sheet which more than offset this debt, so it wasn't hurting itself financially. Because of its annual cash flow of approximately $1 billion and the $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, Nvidia had enough to eventually pay down the debt and invest in its core business -- developing graphics processors -- as well as in initiatives like self-driving cars, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These pursuits have ultimately helped to fuel the company's rapid rise over the last few years. These investments were made while keeping the balance sheet cash-rich with $6.7 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the most recent quarter, and only $1.9 billion in long term debt. A company that can distribute 100% of its free cash flow, keep a sound balance sheet, and deliver significant capital appreciation in the face of intense competition ultimately indicates a very strong business.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 29, 2016 at 2:45PM Image source: NVIDIA. Generally speaking, I'm not a huge fan of Citron Research, the often short-oriented commentary site run by Andrew Left. I consider Citron one of those market prognosticators that makes constant calls, and on occasion, some of them turn out to be fantastic, well-researched picks. And the street credit earned from a subset of correct calls overshadows the incorrect calls based on poor theses that no one pays attention to. Regardless, Citron certainly does have the power to move the market in the short term, which incidentally helps its positions and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy -- at least for a day or two. (I've always strongly suspected that Citron front-runs its own picks.) That being said, I don't necessarily disagree with Citron's latest note, which targets high-flying graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Following an incredible year of gains, Citron took the company down a notch yesterday with a single tweet, with shares falling 7%. The $4.3 billion tweet NVIDIA's drop wiped out $4.3 billion in market value, so yeah, Citron can move the markets. In the tweet, Citron pointed to six risks that it believes NVIDIA investors are discounting, which combined with the soaring valuation this year could be a recipe for a pullback.  Citron readers know we have long been fans of $NVDA,but now the mkt is disregarding headwinds. In 2017 we will see $NVDA head back to $90 pic.twitter.com/n4U7f6eV7G — Citron Research (@CitronResearch) December 28, 2016 I don't disagree -- just a couple weeks ago I expressed some concern over stretched valuation multiples, even while acknowledging that NVIDIA has executed extremely well on many of its growth initiatives. Still let's dig through Citron's concerns. Growth and market share: It's true that a lot of NVIDIA's top-line growth has been driven by market share gains, mostly from primary GPU rival AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). AMD clawed back a little bit of market share in Q2, as NVIDIA had been gaining ground for a string of quarters. But AMD gave that back in Q3 following NVIDIA's launch of Pascal-based products. Remember that the PC market hasn't been a growth market in years, nor has the PC gamer niche within it, and the core GPU business accounts for over 80% of sales. The best ways to grow revenue under those circumstances are to steal market share or increase prices; NVIDIA is doing both. NVIDIA is growing into new addressable markets, just not by much as those businesses are still very small compared to the GPU segment. I don't see this as a "risk." If anything, I see it as evidence of strong execution.  Data center competition: NVIDIA has made some progress in the data center, which it hopes will be a growth avenue going forward. There is potential, but Citron is right that competition will only intensify further. This is a relatively small part of the business currently, so while the downside risk may be somewhat limited if competition starts to eat into NVIDIA's results, the issue is valuation. If investors are pricing in data center growth that fails to materialize, shares could be punished from multiple contraction. At the very least, competition could erode gross margin, and the data center business is quite profitable relative to NVIDIA's overall corporate average (56%). Intellectual property and licensing revenue: NVIDIA and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) signed their patent cross-licensing deal back in January 2011, settling years of litigation between the two companies. It's true that Intel's royalty payments will end soon and that revenue will be missed, but investors have known about this for half a decade. This should all already be priced in by now, and you can't argue that NVIDIA's valuation is predicated on royalty revenue. NVIDIA collected $66 million in licensing revenue from Intel last quarter, or just 3% of sales. Gross margin sustainability and competition: As mentioned above, concerns around gross margin are completely valid, given the expected intensification of competition in many of the growth areas that NVIDIA is enjoying right about now. Intel's vertical integration with silicon fabrication does give it cost and strategic advantages, which it will surely leverage. It wouldn't be particularly surprising if NVIDIA does pull back to $90 in 2017. Stocks that run up as fast as NVIDIA has in 2016 often do pull back if the market got ahead of itself, which is entirely possible given the significant multiple expansion that NVIDIA experienced this year. Some of Citron's concerns are worth acknowledging, but others are probably already priced in. Evan Niu, CFA, has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Photo: Misfit Wearables) Three things they’re adding in 2017 to make trackers and smartwatches compelling to normal people Most of you still don’t have a smartwatch or fitness tracker, recent surveys reveal, nor do you want one. Worse, many of you who received them as gifts got bored and gave up on them. Which means it’s time for smartwatches and fitness trackers to take the next step. Stagnant growth is now adding urgency to the message that counting steps has taken wearables about as far as they can go. So as consumer electronics suppliers prepare to jet off next week to CES, the industry’s annual gathering in Las Vegas, wearables companies like Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Misfit and Samsung find themselves confronting the uncomfortable truth that their products still aren’t compelling to normal people. I expect 2017 will be a make-or-break year for wearables makers as they retool to extend their market beyond techno-geeks, professional athletes, fitness freaks and other early adopters. We’ll start seeing changes beginning next week at CES, with more accurate hardware, more interesting metrics and more helpful insight. Can they succeed?  Too early to say. I’m seeing positive developments in hardware and metrics, and I expect a lot of those building blocks to fall into place in 2017. But I worry about whether they are paying enough attention to the last, most vital component: engaging insight. It’s difficult – and, frankly, foreign – for wearables makers to venture beyond technology and into psychology. But it’s critically important to the future of this $10 billion business. If they can’t come up with creative ways to keep normal people interested, then next year’s wearables are destined for the sock drawer, along with millions of other trackers from Christmas Past. Still image of wearables  (Photo: USA TODAY) Better hardware, more meaningful metrics The wrist may be one of the easiest spots on the body to strap a wearable. But it’s also one of the toughest places to collect measurements, because there is so much extraneous activity. Take step-counting, for example. When we walk, our arms typically sway back and forth. But we might also grab something from our pocket. Or scratch our heads. Or wave to friends. Weeding out those confounding movements is no small task. Heart rate is also difficult to measure on the wrist because of all the movement. Most wearables shine light into the skin and use sensors to detect changes caused by blood flow. Pretty straightforward, provided we’re sitting perfectly still. Which we almost never are. Movement can cause wearables to shift a little on the skin, and change how much ambient light seeps in. Companies like Analog Devices, Intel, Philips, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Valencell have made great strides in filtering out all the noise to deliver more accurate results. That, in turn, is giving rise to new metrics that go well beyond simple step counts and heart rate. Like heart-rate variability, or HRV, for example. HRV tracks the time between individual heart beats. Though your heart may pump at a steady rate of 72 beats per minute, the time between each of those 72 beats are all a little different. The variations are typically larger when you’re calm and relaxed, and shorter when you’re active or tense. HRV is proving to be a critical indicator of stress, fitness and overall health. Which is why companies like Firstbeat, LifeQ and NeuroSky are offering heart-rate variability along with a wealth of other new measures, including stress levels, calorie intake, sleep quality and even blood pressure. Wearable Technology  (Photo: Getty Images) Getting people to care So how do they make wearables useful to normal people? Even with so many new metrics, this may be the most difficult hurdle to overcome. Like most tech industry players, wearables suppliers are so focused on delivering the next capabilities, improving the display and extending battery life that they sometimes lose sight of what will make people put on their devices – and keep them on. I certainly don’t qualify as one of the normal people they’re trying to reach. I’m one of those early adopter types. I’ve already logged more than 10 million steps tracked by nearly 20 different wearables. Being an early adopter means I’m willing to do what most normal people won’t: put up with the time and aggravation of force-fitting new technology into my life for limited and sometimes questionable gain. I do it to get an early glimpse into what’s possible. Normal people won’t tolerate that. They are interested in wearables that can nudge them onto a healthier path. But they must be quick and easy to set up, gain insight as they learn about you, and offer up recommendations for fine-tuning our activity at a time when we’re interested in hearing them.

Automotive Grade Linux UCB 3.0 Released, Brings New Window Manager Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 29 December 2016 at 01:50 PM EST. 2 Comments The Linux Foundation's "Automotive Grade Linux" infotainment platform is out with an update to its Unified Code Base (UCB) as the basis of various IVI systems from different automobile vendors. Automotive Grade Linux UCB 3.0 "Charming Chinook" is the new release as of yesterday. AGL attempts to provide "70-80% of the starting point for a production project. This enables automakers and suppliers to focus their resources on customizing the other 20-30% to meet their unique product needs." With AGL UCB 3.0 there is a new default home screen and window manager, a new SDK for application development, an improved application framework and application launcher, new reference applications, Smart Device Link for mobile phone integration, and expanded hardware support. Unfortunately, the technical details on AGL UCB 3.0 are light and no easy Git repository to get a nice technical glance of the changes. Automotive Grade Linux does appear to still be using Wayland judging from these closed work items but unfortunately haven't found an overview yet of the AGL 3.0 window manager changes. More details on Automotive Grade Linux 3.0 via this press release. Download links of Chinook 3.0 so far for the source package, QEMU, and Intel Minnowboard Max.

X Inside China’s ‘iPhone City’, the land of sweeteners and perks Facility can produce 500,000 iPhones per day and even allows for an Irish tax advantage Thu, Dec 29, 2016, 17:17 Drivers at a rest area between Zhengzhou and Shanghai in China.

The facility can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Photograph: The New York Times Previous Image Next Image Previous Images More Images         A vast, boxy customs centre acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China. Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes, counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by the New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. It all centres on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City”. The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion (€1.43 billion) to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. Build the nest “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. ADVERTISEMENT “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” US officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country. Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. China’s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to the country to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world’s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners such as Foxconn. While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to US technology companies, and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple’s consumer sales. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 per cent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 per cent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. Confidential records The confidential government records obtained by the New York Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their “support” for iPhone production, calling the benefits a “preferential policy.” The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, such as infrastructure, labour, taxes and exports. As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale – and the sway that they afford in China – is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer. The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the US technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here. In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the Chinese government’s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner. Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was “no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments”. A growing backlash against globalisation puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the US and China. US president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on US companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Trump, who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to “build their damn computers and things in this country”. ADVERTISEMENT Western influence China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of western influence, particularly US technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security. China, no longer content with just being the world’s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programmes that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny. Chinese regulators shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring, just six months after the services were introduced in China. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant for failing to pay taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country. Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met Trump in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. It followed a similar goodwill tour in China in August, when Cook sat down with the country’s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government’s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing’s Imperial City. The two countries are playing a high-stakes game. Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages – a complexity that is often lost in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports two million jobs in the US. As China and the US both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs. As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labour; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the US or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store. Export targets Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totalled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone. The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation. The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn’s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year. The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers. Apple was late to China. In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest US technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company’s co-founder, Steve Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated. ADVERTISEMENT Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them – in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity. “This is a machine that is made in America,” Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer. Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how. Under the direction of Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big US brands such as Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths: design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost. Brilliant engineers “They have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple’s growth,” said Joe O’Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia. When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. Foxconn’s founder, Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones. “The reason Foxconn’s so big is Terry Gou,” said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.” After the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China, unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations. “These have become like Olympic competitions,” said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China’s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant labourers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters. City officials lavished money and favourable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers. The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory. The right boxes “We know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,” said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego. The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licences were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. ADVERTISEMENT In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park. “I was impressed,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. “They were very focused.” When Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world’s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers. But Apple initially had to take the “Hong Kong U-turn” to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers. Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government’s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands. Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports, hence, the u-turn employed by many companies. In 2005, Apple’s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country’s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China. “This was really a legacy of China’s old export-oriented economy,” said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Wal-Mart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. “Back then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.” Apple and other multinationals wanted a better system. By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centres inside the country. In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city’s airport, to expedite Apple’s global shipments. Although it wasn’t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world’s largest iPhone manufacturing facility. A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country or out to the rest of the world. The Ireland connection As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple’s global tax strategy. In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically. The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an Irish affiliate, offering well-documented tax advantages, which have attracted the attention of the European Commission. In August, the Republic was told to claw back more than €13 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period, a ruling that the Government and Apple are appealing. ADVERTISEMENT The practice is nonetheless commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China. “US multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,” said Edward D Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the US congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “In doing so, they create stateless income – income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.” Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering an Irish subsidiary that previously had no tax jurisdiction. At Zhengzhou, a crushing workforce begins arriving for the early shift at 6.30am. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab. They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones – up to 350 a minute. Apple’s labour force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government. As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers. “Every city’s department of labour and ministry of human resources is involved,” said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting centre in Zhengzhou. The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Liu said. “If the demand is high, then they will pay more,” he said. “If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.” Cities such as Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don’t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China. Slowing economy As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology. To advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, China’s State Council, the country’s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters. The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue. But the broad trend lines are clear: Overseas companies will no longer get the welcome they once received. The Chinese government is tightening access to its huge market and pressuring Western technology companies to advance domestic goals ? in a coordinated action that one congressional study in the United States called a new form of “techno-nationalism.” “The government wants to know what you can give to China,” said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised US companies operating in China. “And they have the market and the muscle.

X Inside China’s ‘iPhone City’, the land of sweeteners and perks Facility can produce 500,000 iPhones per day and even allows for an Irish tax advantage Thu, Dec 29, 2016, 17:17 Drivers at a rest area between Zhengzhou and Shanghai in China.

The facility can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Photograph: The New York Times Previous Image Next Image Previous Images More Images         A vast, boxy customs centre acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China. Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes, counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by the New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. It all centres on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City”. The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion (€1.43 billion) to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. Build the nest “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. ADVERTISEMENT “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” US officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country. Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. China’s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to the country to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world’s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners such as Foxconn. While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to US technology companies, and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple’s consumer sales. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 per cent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 per cent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. Confidential records The confidential government records obtained by the New York Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their “support” for iPhone production, calling the benefits a “preferential policy.” The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, such as infrastructure, labour, taxes and exports. As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale – and the sway that they afford in China – is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer. The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the US technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here. In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the Chinese government’s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner. Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was “no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments”. A growing backlash against globalisation puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the US and China. US president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on US companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Trump, who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to “build their damn computers and things in this country”. ADVERTISEMENT Western influence China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of western influence, particularly US technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security. China, no longer content with just being the world’s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programmes that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny. Chinese regulators shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring, just six months after the services were introduced in China. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant for failing to pay taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country. Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met Trump in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. It followed a similar goodwill tour in China in August, when Cook sat down with the country’s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government’s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing’s Imperial City. The two countries are playing a high-stakes game. Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages – a complexity that is often lost in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports two million jobs in the US. As China and the US both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs. As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labour; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the US or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store. Export targets Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totalled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone. The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation. The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn’s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year. The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers. Apple was late to China. In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest US technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company’s co-founder, Steve Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated. ADVERTISEMENT Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them – in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity. “This is a machine that is made in America,” Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer. Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how. Under the direction of Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big US brands such as Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths: design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost. Brilliant engineers “They have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple’s growth,” said Joe O’Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia. When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. Foxconn’s founder, Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones. “The reason Foxconn’s so big is Terry Gou,” said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.” After the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China, unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations. “These have become like Olympic competitions,” said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China’s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant labourers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters. City officials lavished money and favourable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers. The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory. The right boxes “We know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,” said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego. The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licences were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. ADVERTISEMENT In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park. “I was impressed,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. “They were very focused.” When Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world’s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers. But Apple initially had to take the “Hong Kong U-turn” to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers. Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government’s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands. Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports, hence, the u-turn employed by many companies. In 2005, Apple’s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country’s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China. “This was really a legacy of China’s old export-oriented economy,” said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Wal-Mart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. “Back then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.” Apple and other multinationals wanted a better system. By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centres inside the country. In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city’s airport, to expedite Apple’s global shipments. Although it wasn’t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world’s largest iPhone manufacturing facility. A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country or out to the rest of the world. The Ireland connection As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple’s global tax strategy. In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically. The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an Irish affiliate, offering well-documented tax advantages, which have attracted the attention of the European Commission. In August, the Republic was told to claw back more than €13 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period, a ruling that the Government and Apple are appealing. ADVERTISEMENT The practice is nonetheless commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China. “US multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,” said Edward D Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the US congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “In doing so, they create stateless income – income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.” Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering an Irish subsidiary that previously had no tax jurisdiction. At Zhengzhou, a crushing workforce begins arriving for the early shift at 6.30am. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab. They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones – up to 350 a minute. Apple’s labour force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government. As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers. “Every city’s department of labour and ministry of human resources is involved,” said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting centre in Zhengzhou. The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Liu said. “If the demand is high, then they will pay more,” he said. “If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.” Cities such as Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don’t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China. Slowing economy As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption.

The music world took such a huge hit this year that it is, unusually, our first category. David Bowie, 69, is now a star man. Prince, 57, dances the dance electric. Leonard Cohen, 82, now has nothing on his tongue but hallelujah. Sir George Martin, 90, the fifth Beatle, joins John Lennon and George Harrison. George Michael, 53, now has that something more he was waiting for. Leon Russell, 74, will rock the biggest house of all. Great bands donated their best: Keith Emerson, 71, and Greg Lake, 69, left Carl Palmer to drum alone. Jefferson Airplane sent two, and on the same day: Signe Tole Anderson, 74, original singer pre-Grace Slick; and cofounder Paul Kantner, 74; the Eagles sent Glenn Frey, 67; Earth, Wind, and Fire sent Maurice White, 74; Parliament Funkadelic donated funk architect Bernie Worrell, 72; Heat Wave sent their genius keyboardist and composer Rod Temperton, 66; A Tribe Called Quest sent Malik "Phife Dawg" Taylor, 45. And the Hot Licks sent their namesake, Dan Hicks, 74, who now knows where the money is. The worlds of blues and country sent up many lights this year, including greats such as Glenn Yarborough, 86; Merle Haggard, 79; Sonny James, 87; Buckwheat Zydeco (a.k.a. Stanley Dural Jr.), 68; Guy Clark, 74; Ralph Stanley, 89; and Elvis' guitarist Scotty Moore, 84.

Mexican superstar Juan Gabriel was 66, and Bobby Vee, 73, has made up his mind: He's an angel. Phil Chess, 95, helped found one of the most important music companies in U.S. pop history. Kay Starr, 1940s and '50s chanteuse, was 94; And Frank Sinatra Jr., 72, went to sing duets with his dad. Like eighth notes rising up a stave, jazz artists took their place in the Best. Band. Ever. On clarinet, Pete Fountain, 86; on sax, Gato Barbieri, 83, tangoing in Paris; on sweet harmonica, Toots Thielemans, 94; on fabulous vibraphone, Bobby Hutcherson, 75; on piano, Mose Allison, 89 . . . and in the producer's booth, the great Rudy Van Gelder, 91. Newsmakers. Only a year like this could push this category down to the second spot. Fidel Castro, 90, lived to see Cuba and the United States draw (maybe?) closer. Nancy Reagan, 94, stood by her man, and both Daniel Berrigan, 94, and Phyllis Schlafly, 92, stood by their ideals. Elie Wiesel, 87, and Shimon Peres, 93, stood for peace as they hoped for it. Surgeon Henry Heimlich, 96, championed the maneuver named after him, which has saved many lives. John Glenn, 95, now will stay where he only visited before, as will fellow astronaut Edgar Mitchell, 85. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, 79, changed the teaching and practice of law in the United States. Janet Reno, 78, was a dedicated public servant, and so, by his own lights, was Tom Hayden, 76. Science/tech. Philadelphia-born Vera Rubin, 88, did historic research on the rotation curves of galaxies, and that led to the theory of dark matter.

How China Built 'iPhone City' With Billions in Perks for Apple's Partner The New York Times 4 days ago By DAVID BARBOZA < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 6NEXT SLIDE > The Zhengzhou government pledged to spend more than $10 billion on an airport just a few miles from the iPhone factory. © Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times ZHENGZHOU, China — A vast, boxy customs center acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China. Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes — counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 115.82 -0.91 -0.78% Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd HNHPF ▼ 5.05 -0.25 -4.72% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% New York Times Co NYT ▼ 13.30 -0.10 -0.75% The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter It all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City.” The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” American officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country. Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. In this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world. But the reasons behind their choices are not always transparent. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate — and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves. China’s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to China to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world’s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners like Foxconn. While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to American technology companies — and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple’s consumer sales. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation, or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. The confidential government records obtained by The Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their “support” for iPhone production, calling the benefits a “preferential policy.” The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, like infrastructure, labor, taxes and exports. As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale — and the sway that they afford in China — is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer. The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the American technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here. In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the government’s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner. Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was “no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments.” A growing backlash against globalization puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the United States and China. President-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on American companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to “build their damn computers and things in this country.” China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of Western influence, particularly American technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security. China, no longer content with just being the world’s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programs that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny. Regulators shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring, just six months after the services were introduced in China. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant for failure to fully pay its taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country. Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met with Mr. Trump in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. It followed a similar good-will tour in China in August, when Mr. Cook sat down with the country’s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government’s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing’s Imperial City. The two countries are playing a high-stakes game. Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages — a complexity that is often lost in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports two million jobs in the United States. As China and the United States both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs. As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store. Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totaled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone. The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation. The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn’s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year. The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers. Pursuing the iPhone Apple was late to China. In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest American technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company’s co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated. Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them — in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Mr. Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Mr. Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity. “This is a machine that is made in America,” Mr. Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer. Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Mr. Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Mr. Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how. Under the direction of Mr. Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big American brands like Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths — design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost. “They have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple’s growth,” said Joe O’Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia. When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. Foxconn’s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones. “The reason Foxconn’s so big is Terry Gou,” said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.” After the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China — unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations. “These have become like Olympic competitions,” said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China’s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant laborers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters. City officials lavished money and favorable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers. The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory. “We know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,” said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego. The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licenses were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park. “I was impressed,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. “They were very focused.” Made, and Sold, in China When Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world’s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers. But Apple initially had to take the “Hong Kong U-turn” to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers. Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government’s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands. Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports — hence, the U-turn employed by many companies. In 2005, Apple’s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country’s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China. “This was really a legacy of China’s old export-oriented economy,” said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Walmart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. “Back then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.” Apple and other multinationals wanted a better system. By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centers inside the country. In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city’s airport, to expedite Apple’s global shipments. Although it wasn’t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world’s largest iPhone manufacturing facility. A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country, or out to the rest of the world. As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple’s global tax strategy. In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically. The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale, according to a 2013 American congressional report on the company’s tax practices. It is a practice commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China. “U.S. multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “In doing so, they create stateless income — income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.” According to the congressional report, the process allowed Apple to move tens of billions of dollars offshore and substantially reduce its tax bill, which one senator called the “holy grail of tax avoidance.” The European Union in August ordered Ireland to claw back more than $14.5 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period. Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering a subsidiary in Ireland that previously had no tax jurisdiction. It is appealing the ruling in the European Union. In Zhengzhou, local officials have lauded the package of incentives provided to Foxconn, confident that the city’s iPhone production will continue to pay huge dividends. In August 2014, the city’s top leaders held a special meeting to discuss “deepening collaboration” with Foxconn, according to the government records obtained by The Times. They crowed that Zhengzhou was the “biggest production base for Apple iPhone worldwide.” There were 94 production lines producing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, and the government said about 230 million smartphones had already been exported from Zhengzhou, making it one of the nation’s crucial export centers. Production capacity had reached half a million iPhones a day. The city’s tax revenue was rapidly rising. Officials had a name for it all: “Zhengzhou Speed.” A State-Recruited Army A crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab. They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones — up to 350 a minute. Apple’s labor force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government. As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers. “Every city’s department of labor and ministry of human resources is involved,” said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting center in Zhengzhou. The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Mr. Liu said. “If the demand is high, then they will pay more,” he said. “If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.” Cities like Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don’t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China. As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology. To advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, China’s State Council, the country’s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any preferential treatment, including subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters. The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue. But the broad trend lines are clear: Overseas companies will no longer get the welcome they once received. The Chinese government is tightening access to its huge market and pressuring Western technology companies to advance domestic goals — in a coordinated action that one congressional study in the United States called a new form of “techno-nationalism.” “The government wants to know what you can give to China,” said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised American companies operating in China. “And they have the market and the muscle. They’re not playing around anymore.” Chinese regulators have been penalizing overseas companies, like the American mobile chip giant Qualcomm, which was forced to reduce prices for companies that sell smartphones within the country. It is a market increasingly dominated by Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi that undercut Apple and Samsung on price. China is also scrutinizing Western technology companies over national security issues. Beijing has increased oversight of the internet with new cybersecurity rules and forced state companies to reduce spending on overseas technology. It pressed Apple to hand over its source code. Apple said it refused. Apple has agreed to the government’s request to store more of its local data on Chinese servers. It must also undergo “security audits” on new models of the iPhone before gaining approval to sell the product. Beijing also expects American companies to help develop China’s own capabilities. Apple is teaming up with UnionPay, a state-backed financial services company. It has invested $1 billion in the Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, which has significant backing from state companies. Mr. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has also carefully cultivated Apple’s image as a big employer, a good corporate citizen and a major economic contributor. He comes to China regularly. He has donned factory uniforms and walked the assembly line in Zhengzhou. He has courted regulators, the heads of state telecom giants and the country’s top leaders, including Mr. Xi. In an interview with Chinese state television last year, Mr. Cook explained how Apple was planting trees in the country, calling the effort a “pillar of its environmental strategy.” He detailed plans to build a massive solar project to power Apple’s stores, headquarters and offices throughout the country. He also boasted about creating over three million jobs in China, half of them in manufacturing. At the Hall of Purple Light in the government’s walled leadership compound in Beijing, Mr. Cook promised in August to build the company’s first research and development center in the country and to support the government’s big focus on high-end manufacturing. Opposite him sat the vice premier, Zhang Gaoli. Beside him sat his partner. There was the chairman of Foxconn, Mr. Gou. Also present was the party leader of the province where Zhengzhou is located, Xie Fuzhan.

We'll find out soon. Sarah Tew/CNET For the past couple of years, the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas was a hotbed of new wearables. CES 2016 saw the Fitbit Blaze debut at the show, along with plenty of smart clothing concepts. CES 2015 had plenty of fitness trackers, too. CES 2017? Not so much.  In the mobile space -- including wearable tech -- CES has begun to take a backseat to the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona (only about eight weeks later) and company-specific events, such as Apple and Google's annual developer conferences. In the wearable market, we aren't expecting any major announcements. There are several reasons: A late flood of watches and fitness trackers that arrived in the summer and fall means that companies have just begun their product cycles. Meanwhile, smartwatch sales are tanking, and we are seeing more companies pull back on releasing new products. If there is anything noteworthy, it will likely focus on health and fitness, but it probably won't have the mass appeal of an Apple Watch or a Fitbit. But that doesn't mean there won't be plenty of companies trying to make a splash.  What's on deck from the major players Two of the biggest names in tech -- Apple and Google -- don't even attend the show, at least not officially. While we will likely see hundreds of Apple Watch apps and accessories, there will be no new products from the iPhone-maker, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Google has already indicated that its delayed Android Wear 2.0 software will finally hit in 2017. But we don't expect any high-profile new hardware -- including those two new flagship smartwatches -- to be unveiled in Las Vegas. Samsung has a big presence on the show floor, but we aren't expecting any new wearables. The company will likely focus on other product categories (TVs, appliances, smart home), while promoting existing products, such as the Gear Fit 2 and Gear S3. Fitbit had a big 2016. The company refreshed nearly its entire portfolio over the course of the year with the release of the Blaze, Alta, Charge and Charge 2 fitness trackers. We aren't expecting much from Fitbit, although there is a slight chance we could see an update to the company's GPS sportwatch, the Fitbit Surge, which was released over two years ago. Garmin is one of the few companies to actually see shipments and market share increase this year, mainly in part due to its focus on niche sports watches. As for new products at the show? There is a good chance we see something. Garmin has a history of announcing new watches at CES. We saw the Fenix 3 multisport watch in 2015, followed by the Fenix 3 HR in 2016. Perhaps 2017 will be the year of the Fenix 4 or another Fenix 3 variant?  There could be some cool concepts Smartwatches and fitness trackers are stuck in a rut. Innovation has slowed down, battery life hasn't improved, and too many of these devices are still dependent on a phone, but CES is always a chance to show off some interesting products. A handful of companies usually dazzle us with futuristic product concepts, many of which focus on health and fitness. In 2016, Samsung showed off smart clothing and Intel wowed me with its Radar Pace smart sunglasses, which were eventually released this past October. What could we see in 2017? I'm predicting three things: voice assistants in watches, more personalized coaching as well as feedback and longer-lasting battery tech. We've seen examples of these trends in products like the Alexa-compatible Martian mVoice watch and Matrix Powerwatch, which -- according to the company -- never has to be charged and runs off of your own body heat.  Expect vaporware -- but hope for a surprise CES has become a show about startups and crowdfunded ideas -- and prototypes. On all these fronts, expect a few odd ideas and a lot of vaporware. There will be hundreds of Chinese knockoffs that we will never hear from again. And remember that even more established companies can miss deadlines. Last CES, I was really excited about the Mio Slice fitness tracker, but it's December and I am still waiting for it to hit the market. That said, there's still plenty of room for a surprise or two. Just like my colleague Claire Reilly, I'd love to be totally wowed by a new wearable. Make it happen, CES.

The Top BSD News This Year: Ubuntu Atop BSD, FreeBSD 11.0, DragonFly's HAMMER2 Written by Michael Larabel in BSD on 29 December 2016 at 10:19 AM EST. 12 Comments Continuing our end-of-year recaps for the most popular stories on Phoronix, when we're not busy covering Linux, the BSD operating systems get their share of interest on Phoronix. Here is a look at the exciting BSD advancements made in 2016. 2016 saw the release of FreeBSD 11.0, UbuntuBSD making a few splashes, DragonFlyBSD advancing on several fronts, DRM/KMS Linux drivers seeing more ports to the BSDs, the original Lumina Desktop Environment seeing adoption, PC-BSD becoming TrueOS, and much more. Here's a look at our most viewed BSD stories on Phoronix for 2016: UbuntuBSD Brings Ubuntu Atop The FreeBSD Kernel The inaugural release of UbuntuBSD is now available, which the developers have codenamed "Escape From SystemD", and pairs the Ubuntu userspace with the FreeBSD kernel. FreeBSD Gets A Much Faster Sendfile Thanks To Netflix Thanks to work done by Netflix and NGINX, a new, drop-in-replacement sendfile syscall has been written for FreeBSD that is much faster. Trying Out The FreeBSD-Powered TrueOS With Its Custom Qt Desktop While I've been running PC-BSD on some systems for years I hadn't tried out any of its rolling-release FreeBSD 11.0-based spins under the new TrueOS brand nor had I tried out the project's Qt-based Lumina Desktop Environment since it reached 1.0. That changed today with trying out the latest weekly spin of TrueOS x64. Lumina Desktop 1.0 Released The PC-BSD/TrueOS developers have announced the release of the Lumina Desktop Environment 1.0. More Details On PC-BSD's Rebranding As TrueOS Most Phoronix readers know PC-BSD as the BSD operating system derived from FreeBSD that aims to be user-friendly on the desktop side and they've done a fairly good job at that over the years. However, the OS has been in the process of re-branding itself as TrueOS. FreeBSD 10.3 Officially Released With Much Better Linux Binary Compatibility FreeBSD 10.3 is now out in stable release form. FreeBSD-Powered Firewall Distro OPNsense 16.1 Released OPNsense, the open-source firewall project powered by FreeBSD that began as a fork of pfSense, is out with a new release. Lumina Desktop 0.9 Adds Window Compositing Support, New Text Editor The BSD-focused Lumina Desktop Environment has released version 0.9 of their open-source, Qt-powered desktop while version 1.0 is expected later this year in step with PC-BSD/FreeBSD 11.0. PC-BSD 10.3 Is Looking Great, Plus Trying The Linux Compatibility Layer Following this week's release of FreeBSD 10.3 has been the releases of the deskop-friendly PC-BSD 10.3 operating system along with PC-BSD's server-focused TrueOS 10.3 release. I've fired up PC-BSD 10.3 for some benchmarking and so far the experience has been going great. PC-BSD / FreeBSD 11.0-CURRENT Performance Last week I had plans to run some fresh FreeBSD vs. Linux gaming benchmarks using the FreeBSD's Linux software binary compatibility layer. Lumina Desktop 1.1 Released The BSD-focused, Qt-powered Lumina Desktop Environment is out with its version 1.1 update. DragonFlyBSD Decides To Drop PulseAudio DragonFlyBSD developers have decided to remove PulseAudio from their dports packaging system and patch their desktop software to not depend upon this open-source sound server. FreeBSD 11 Is Still Being Respun & Tested, Hope To Release Next Week Last week news came out that the FreeBSD 11.0 release wasn't going to happen as planned but it needed to be respun due to security issues. The release was supposed to happen on 3 October, but now we find out it needed to be re-spun again and is still going through testing. FreeBSD Now Has A Port For CentOS 7 Binary Support We've known for a while that FreeBSD has been working on a CentOS 7 compatibility layer while now that work has finally landed in FreeBSD ports. DragonFly's HAMMER2 File-System Sees Some Improvements The HAMMER2 file-system is going on four years in development by the DragonFlyBSD crew, namely by its founder Matthew Dillon. It's still maturing and taking longer than anticipated, but this is yet another open-source file-system. FreeBSD 11.0 Reaches Beta BSD fans looking to do some testing this weekend can try out the beta of the upcoming FreeBSD 11.0. PC-BSD's Lumina Desktop Now In Beta For v1.0 The Lumina Desktop Environment has made available their v1.0 beta release of the Qt-written desktop. DragonFlyBSD's Intel DRM/KMS Driver Now On Par With Linux 4.3 While the FreeBSD's Intel kernel DRM/KMS driver is still dating back to the Linux 3.x kernel days and the state of other BSD distributions vary when it comes to their DRM/KMS support, DragonFlyBSD continues moving forward with their DRM/KMS driver porting from the Linux kernel. Their i915 DRM driver now is based off the relatively recent Linux 4.3 kernel. FreeBSD 11.0 Alpha 4 Released The fourth alpha release of the upcoming FreeBSD 11.0 is now available for testing. FreeBSD Is Trying To Figure Out If Anyone Uses Its VGL Graphics Library FreeBSD VGL provides a library for accessing graphics modes and carrying out basic drawing operations atop its syscons console driver. Not only is basic graphics output on a virtual console supported by libvgl, but mouse input is too handled. However, not many people seem to be using this library. 12 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides iPhone 8 Nintendo Switch Samsung Galaxy S8 MacBook Pro CES 2017 iOS 10.2 News What to expect from Samsung in 2017 What to expect from Samsung in 2017 By Gabe Carey Mobile phones   From holographic TVs to cylindrical PCs, Samsung bears all Shares Ohhh boy, Samsung in 2016. You might expect this year in review to be a comedy roast. From exploding smartphones to Supreme Court cases, this was clearly not the South Korean tech company’s time to shine. Fortunately, there were enough silver linings to make up for it.  The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were Samsung’s best phones yet. In fact, we called the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge “the best smartphone in the world” at the time of its release. And, because of the way things panned out with the latest Galaxy Note 7, we’re inclined to say that may still be the case. However, Samsung saw success in other areas this year as well. The Samsung Notebook 9, for instance, made our best Ultrabooks list, ostensibly as a return to form for the company’s ostensibly stagnating laptop business. Meanwhile, the company also revealed one of the most unique desktop computers of the year, namely the ArtPC Pulse, which looks to finally take on Apple’s now-antiquated Mac Pro.  Samsung even occupied the top spot on our best 4K TVs list with its quality backlit KS9500 range. That goes without mentioning its advancements in budget-friendly virtual reality options with its third helping of Gear VR headsets. Looking forward into the future, 2017 could potentially be a year of redemption for Samsung. Although this year brought a handful of stellar product launches, in retrospect they were all overshadowed by one monumental error – perhaps unfairly so. 2017 in Samsung mobile devices Samsung’s mobile business was hit the hardest this year, and understandably so. The Note 7 blunder, specifically, cost the company nearly $10 billion, according to CNN. Financial discussions aside, there’s no denying that Samsung’s mobile strategy needs to be turned around in 2017. If rumors and reports are to be believed, the company is most certainly making changes for the better. Next year, you can expect not three but six different smartphones from the Korean hardware maker.  The Galaxy S8, S8 Edge, and Note 8 are all surefire hits – assuming they don’t literally catch on fire – while the company also has refreshes to its low-to-mid range Galaxy A-series smartphones in the works, namely the Galaxy A3, A5 and A7. All will have sufficient bumps in specs including the move to full HD 1080p screens and 3,000mAh batteries at the entry level. Nevertheless, it should go without saying that we can’t help but have our curiosity piqued more by Samsung’s flagship devices than its low-cost alternatives. If you were one of those who abandoned ship on Apple because of the loss of the 3.5mm headphone jack, it may be disheartened to hear that with the Galaxy S8, Samsung may also be moving to USB-C only arrangement.  Like the iPhone 7, the Samsung Galaxy S8 will reportedly lose its headphone jack in favor of newer, digital interfaces. That’s right, USB-C will join the ranks of Apple’s Lightning connector in serving as a means of replacement for the antiquated (and analog) 3.5mm headphone jack we’ve all come to know and love. Of course, if that were the Galaxy S8’s only change, we wouldn’t be inclined to upgrade. Luckily, it looks as though the Galaxy S8 will also tote a bezel-free design with both the home button and fingerprint scanner built into the screen. Reports also suggest a large 4K screen, 6GB of RAM and a dual-lens rear camera, reminiscent of the iPhone 7 Plus. In another attempt to steal some of Apple’s lightning, Samsung released a Jet Black-inspired Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge color variant named Pearl Black. Assuming Samsung wants to keep its forthcoming models in line with current-gen handsets, we wouldn’t discount the possibility of the Galaxy S8 twins adopting the glossy black fashion as well.  Keeping with the company’s history in revealing flagship smartphones the day before Mobile World Congress (MWC) kicks off, we can expect to see both the S8 and S8 Edge in the flesh as soon as February 26. Another, more far-fetched string of gossip has repeatedly proposed that Samsung has not one, but two foldable phones in production slated for early 2017. One of these devices will ship complete with two flat panels bolstered by a hinge while the other will be sport a single OLED display and ship shortly after the first.  Although it might appear unlikely at first glance, word of a Samsung Galaxy X can be found dating all the way back to 2011. Regardless of budget or personal necessity, Samsung is bound to have something for you in its – as always – vast array of mobile devices set to hit the road in 2017. 2017 in Samsung tablets and computers Now we’re not going to sit here and pretend Samsung’s computing business has been stellar these past few years, but we’re also not opposed to admitting that this year was pretty damn great for Samsung PCs. The cylindrical ArtPC Pulse tempted us with its potent specs and luscious Mac Pro sense of style. Meanwhile the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin put the MacBook Pro to shame with an aggressive price point and uniquely HDR display. Sure, the company had some compatibility issues with Windows 10 earlier in the year, but with PCs as proficient as the Samsung Notebook 9 at the helm, we couldn’t complain too much. While we haven’t heard much about Samsung’s 2017 PC lineup, the company will undoubtedly introduce new hardware come the new year.  Though it’s not a proper home computer per sé, the Galaxy Tab S2 is expected to drop in the first quarter of 2017. This will come not even a year after the release of Samsung’s most recent tablet, the Windows 10-equipped Galaxy TabPro S.  With the strong critical reception to its first shot at Windows on a tablet, we wouldn’t be too shocked to see Samsung take things a step further, opting for a desktop OS on its more affordable tablet PC. As of now, however, all we can say based on reports is that the Galaxy Tab S3 will come in two flavors, one outfitted with LTE functionality and the other without. Meanwhile, Android tablets fading into obscurity, it would make sense to maintain an exclusive 2-in-1 focus in regard to tablets. SamMobile confirmed back in August that a Galaxy TabPro S2 will arrive across four models in 2017. The outlet’s sources claim that the Galaxy Tab Pro S2 will take advantage of a 12-inch, 2,160 x 1,440 screen and an Intel Core M-series processor. Outside of that, there isn’t much concrete evidence pointing to much else as far as Samsung computers go. That said, we wouldn’t be awe-struck to see a Kaby Lake revamp of the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin after seeing how it fared with reviewers. 2017 in Samsung 4K TVs You might say this year was the year that 4K TVs finally managed to truly shake the scene. Whether it’s owed primarily to Black Friday sales or more widely available 4K high-dynamic range (HDR) content, there’s no denying that Ultra HD is the way to go heading into 2017.  With that in mind, Samsung’s KS9500 range leads the pack when it comes to delivering HDR imaging and high quality sound. Because of its overwhelmingly positive reviews, it makes sense that Samsung wants to continue from where it left off in 2017. In doing so, however, this means making some concessions while other companies move on to embrace new technologies.  While the likes of LG and Sony have been quick to employ OLED display panels, VP of Samsung Display, Park Dong-Gun, admitted earlier this year that the Korean tech company would be reluctant to follow suit. Instead, Samsung plans on iterating on its existing Quantum Dot technology, which has demonstrated better clarity and brightness over its OLED counterpart.  Moreover, an emphasis on Quantum Dot will allow for more competitive pricing, enabling Samsung to circumvent its OLED-hoisting opponents. Rather than taking a risk in a polluted OLED market, Samsung is choosing instead to remain at the top of a category it already reigns supreme in. Lastly, though we shouldn’t expect a consumer version to make its way to brick-and-mortar anytime soon, Samsung filed a patent back in January 2016 for a holographic TV that projects images literally off the screen. Being the ambitious pipe dream that it is, you shouldn’t expect to secure a holographic TV in 2017, but it wouldn’t take us aback to see a working prototype as imminently as CES.  2017 in VR and beyond We may have only just recently gotten our hands on the third round of Gear VR headsets, and while it’s the perfect gateway drug for Samsung users eager to jump into PC-powered VR, it’s also far from perfect.  Auspiciously, Samsung knows this. That’s why, perhaps with its next Gear VR rendition, the company plans on adding eye and mouth detection for an added layer of immersion (and virtual oddities). This is all just patent hearsay, so don’t sue us if it doesn’t come to fruition, but this does seem like a reasonable next step for Gear VR – aside from better apps and a higher resolution. All in all, Samsung has a busy year ahead of it, jam-packed with new devices and software across a wide range of categories. Truthfully, it’s rare for companies like this to deliver so many exceptional product offerings across a breadth of different hardware divisions. Here’s to hoping that in 2017, things really blow up for Samsung – just not in the way they literally did this year.   Now, let’s see what you can expect from Microsoft in 2017 Tags MacBook Pro ABOUT THE AUTHOR Gabe Carey Gabe has been writing about video games and technology since he was 16 years old.

Credit Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times How China Built ‘iPhone City’ With Billions in Perks for Apple’s Partner A hidden bounty of benefits for Foxconn’s plant in Zhengzhou, the world’s biggest iPhone factory, is central to the production of Apple’s most profitable product. 点击查看本文中文版 By DAVID BARBOZADEC. 29, 2016 ZHENGZHOU, China — A vast, boxy customs center acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China. Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes — counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story It all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” American officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country. Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. In this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world. But the reasons behind their choices are not always transparent. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate — and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves. China’s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to China to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world’s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners like Foxconn. Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to American technology companies — and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple’s consumer sales. Photo The Zhengzhou customs operation is inside a so-called bonded zone, where products can be imported and exported virtually. Credit Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation, or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. The confidential government records obtained by The Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their “support” for iPhone production, calling the benefits a “preferential policy.” The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, like infrastructure, labor, taxes and exports. As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale — and the sway that they afford in China — is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer. The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the American technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here. In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the government’s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner. Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was “no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments.” Continue reading the main story Photo Foxconn workers leaving at the end of the day shift through the gates of the Zhengzhou bonded zone. Credit Gilles Sabrie for The New York Times A growing backlash against globalization puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the United States and China. Advertisement Continue reading the main story President-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on American companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to “build their damn computers and things in this country.” China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of Western influence, particularly American technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security. China, no longer content with just being the world’s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programs that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny. Regulators shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring, just six months after the services were introduced in China. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant for failure to fully pay its taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country. Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met with Mr. Trump in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. It followed a similar good-will tour in China in August, when Mr. Cook sat down with the country’s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government’s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing’s Imperial City. The two countries are playing a high-stakes game. Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages — a complexity that is often lost in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports two million jobs in the United States. A Hidden Bounty About half of the world’s iPhones are made at the Foxconn facility in Zhengzhou, a city in one of China’s poorest regions. The local government has provided sweeteners and incentives to Foxconn, Apple’s manufacturing partner — a package of benefits that supports iPhone production there in a variety of areas.

DEC. 28, 2016 By The New York Times As China and the United States both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store. Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totaled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone. The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation. The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn’s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year. The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers. Pursuing the iPhone Apple was late to China. In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest American technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company’s co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated. 200 miles Zhengzhou Foxconn facility HENAN 500 MILES Beijing Yellow R. Yellow Sea Area of detail Yangtze R. CHINA TAIWAN South China Sea DEC. 29, 2016 By The New York Times Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them — in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Mr. Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Mr. Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity. “This is a machine that is made in America,” Mr. Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Mr. Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Mr. Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how. Under the direction of Mr. Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big American brands like Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths — design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost. “They have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple’s growth,” said Joe O’Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia. When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. Foxconn’s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones. Photo The Zhengzhou government pledged to spend more than $10 billion on an airport just a few miles from the iPhone factory. Credit Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times “The reason Foxconn’s so big is Terry Gou,” said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.” After the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China — unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations. “These have become like Olympic competitions,” said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China’s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant laborers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters. City officials lavished money and favorable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers. The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory. “We know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,” said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego.

Credit Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licenses were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park. “I was impressed,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. “They were very focused.” Made, and Sold, in China When Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world’s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers. But Apple initially had to take the “Hong Kong U-turn” to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government’s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands. Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports — hence, the U-turn employed by many companies. In 2005, Apple’s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country’s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China. How Does an iPhone Get From Factory Floor to Retail Store? “This was really a legacy of China’s old export-oriented economy,” said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Walmart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. “Back then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.” Apple and other multinationals wanted a better system. By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centers inside the country. In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city’s airport, to expedite Apple’s global shipments. Although it wasn’t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world’s largest iPhone manufacturing facility. A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country, or out to the rest of the world. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple’s global tax strategy. In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically. Continue reading the main story Photo Workers leaving the night shift at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou cross paths with those arriving for the early shift. The facility can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Credit Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale, according to a 2013 American congressional report on the company’s tax practices. It is a practice commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China. “U.S. multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “In doing so, they create stateless income — income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.” According to the congressional report, the process allowed Apple to move tens of billions of dollars offshore and substantially reduce its tax bill, which one senator called the “holy grail of tax avoidance.” The European Union in August ordered Ireland to claw back more than $14.5 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period. Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering a subsidiary in Ireland that previously had no tax jurisdiction. It is appealing the ruling in the European Union. In Zhengzhou, local officials have lauded the package of incentives provided to Foxconn, confident that the city’s iPhone production will continue to pay huge dividends. In August 2014, the city’s top leaders held a special meeting to discuss “deepening collaboration” with Foxconn, according to the government records obtained by The Times. They crowed that Zhengzhou was the “biggest production base for Apple iPhone worldwide.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story There were 94 production lines producing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, and the government said about 230 million smartphones had already been exported from Zhengzhou, making it one of the nation’s crucial export centers. Production capacity had reached half a million iPhones a day. The city’s tax revenue was rapidly rising. Photo A model of the Zhengzhou airport, which is not far from the main iPhone manufacturing site. Credit Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times Officials had a name for it all: “Zhengzhou Speed.” A State-Recruited Army A crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab. They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones — up to 350 a minute. Apple’s labor force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government. As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers. “Every city’s department of labor and ministry of human resources is involved,” said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting center in Zhengzhou. The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Mr. Liu said. “If the demand is high, then they will pay more,” he said. “If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.” Cities like Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don’t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China.

Privacy Policy As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology. Advertisement Continue reading the main story To advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, China’s State Council, the country’s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any preferential treatment, including subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters. The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue. But the broad trend lines are clear: Overseas companies will no longer get the welcome they once received. The Chinese government is tightening access to its huge market and pressuring Western technology companies to advance domestic goals — in a coordinated action that one congressional study in the United States called a new form of “techno-nationalism.” “The government wants to know what you can give to China,” said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised American companies operating in China. “And they have the market and the muscle. They’re not playing around anymore.” Chinese regulators have been penalizing overseas companies, like the American mobile chip giant Qualcomm, which was forced to reduce prices for companies that sell smartphones within the country. It is a market increasingly dominated by Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi that undercut Apple and Samsung on price. China is also scrutinizing Western technology companies over national security issues. Beijing has increased oversight of the internet with new cybersecurity rules and forced state companies to reduce spending on overseas technology. It pressed Apple to hand over its source code. Apple said it refused. Apple has agreed to the government’s request to store more of its local data on Chinese servers. It must also undergo “security audits” on new models of the iPhone before gaining approval to sell the product. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beijing also expects American companies to help develop China’s own capabilities. Apple is teaming up with UnionPay, a state-backed financial services company. It has invested $1 billion in the Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, which has significant backing from state companies. Mr. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has also carefully cultivated Apple’s image as a big employer, a good corporate citizen and a major economic contributor. He comes to China regularly. He has donned factory uniforms and walked the assembly line in Zhengzhou. He has courted regulators, the heads of state telecom giants and the country’s top leaders, including Mr. Xi. In an interview with Chinese state television last year, Mr. Cook explained how Apple was planting trees in the country, calling the effort a “pillar of its environmental strategy.” He detailed plans to build a massive solar project to power Apple’s stores, headquarters and offices throughout the country. He also boasted about creating over three million jobs in China, half of them in manufacturing. At the Hall of Purple Light in the government’s walled leadership compound in Beijing, Mr. Cook promised in August to build the company’s first research and development center in the country and to support the government’s big focus on high-end manufacturing. Opposite him sat the vice premier, Zhang Gaoli. Beside him sat his partner. There was the chairman of Foxconn, Mr. Gou.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Android bugs hard to shift from tellies Posted on December 29, 2016 by Nick Farrell - News, Security For a while now security experts have feared that android viruses will find their way into smart tellies and now this is starting to happen quirks in the telly industry appear to be preventing the viruses being fixed. Software engineer Darren Cauthon found that one of his family members had an LG smart TV infected with ransomware on Christmas day. However, when he rang LG for help, the outfit told him he would have to take the telly into the shop to be fixed. Based on a screenshot Cauthon posted online, the smart TV was infected with the Cyber. Police ransomware, also known as FLocker, Frantic Locker, or Dogspectus. The infected TV is one of the last generations of LG smart TVs that ran Google TV, a smart TV platform developed by Google together with Intel, Sony, and Logitech. Google TV launched in 2010, but Google discontinued the project in June 2014. LG really can’t be bothered with Google TV, and the company’s TVs now run WebOS. When Cauthon tried to reset the TV to factory settings, the reset procedure available online didn’t work. When the software engineer contacted LG, the company told him to visit one of their service centres, where one of its employees could reset his TV.

Korea fines Qualcomm $854 mln 28 Dec 2016 South Korea's antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm $854 million for unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales. Bobbi Rebell reports. Video Transcript South Korea's antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm the largest ever fine levied in the country - $854 million - for abusing its dominant market position and forcing handset makers to pay for unnecessary patents. The Korea Fair Trade Commission also said Qualcomm restricted competition by refusing or limiting licensing to rivals, like Intel and Samsung. The regulator ordered Qualcom to negotiate patent licensing with other chipmakers, and renegotiate chip supply agreements with handset makers. Qualcomm said it will appeal the decision. The fine is the latest in a series of antitrust rulings and investigations faced by Qualcomm from regulators across the globe. On the list - China, European Union, Taiwan, and the United States.

Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016 — consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the back-to-back daughter-mother Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds — the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona — androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist — was as shape-shifting as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his — I hesitate to say merry — way, ever the wise, gravel-voiced troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, “Until then, here’s another song.” Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was as if 2016 hadn’t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another pop-star death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people can’t bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane; Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Glenn Frey of the Eagles; and Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man’s mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the locked-up outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis’s swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose recording-studio genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking self-regard and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golf’s first media star. The gentleman’s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of middle-class postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome — but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88; and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductor’s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake — his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant — can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated women’s basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat Alzheimer’s disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N.B.A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86; his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a 14-year Hall of Fame career, was 74. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the whites-only major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball’s first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country.

Nancy Reagan’s death evoked the 1980s White House, where old-Hollywood glamour and well-heeled West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn’s had us thinking again about a long-ago burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War’s roiling home front. Phyllis Schlafly’s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing’s ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex., to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Elián González, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel Castro’s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a cigar-smoking strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are truth-seekers, even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and, pre-eminently, Edward Albee — all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun make-believe for our viewing pleasure — none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the nothing-dainty-about-her Princess Leia of the “Star Wars” tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother’s grief. Devotees of the “Harry Potter” movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snape’s younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor’s celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a therapy-obsessed culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the “Godfather” movies and “Barney Miller,” actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his convention-defying meditations on life and art; Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives; Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics’ eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (“Adventures of Superman”), Alan Young (“Mister Ed”), Robert Vaughn (“The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”), William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on “The Patty Duke Show”), Dan Haggerty (“The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams”), Florence Henderson (“The Brady Bunch”) and Alan Thicke (“Growing Pains”). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with “Happy Days,” “Mork & Mindy,” “Laverne & Shirley” and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker’s jacket with a camera slung around his neck — what a picture! — had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music’s other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin; the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri; the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor); and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a culture-changing executive, Grant Tinker, who in the ’80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a conscience-stricken gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. Advertisement Continue reading the main story By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone’s guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.

One early critique of the 1,023 words that created the presidency in Article II was that none of them prohibited those who held the office from running for an unlimited number of four-year terms. “Wherein does this president, invested with his powers and prerogatives,” one opponent to ratification of the document wrote in 1787, “essentially differ from the king of Great Britain?” ADVERTISEMENT Federalist supporters of continued eligibility argued otherwise. The ability to repeatedly seek office as head of the Executive branch would translate to reoccurring service for well-regarded presidents and retirement — and silence — for the unpopular ones.   What the Framers feared most in a term-limited executive was adored former presidents serving as the ever-present peanut gallery on the current occupant. “Would it promote the peace of the community, or the stability of the government,” Alexander Hamilton wrote in 1788, “to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy, wandering among the people like discontented ghosts?” Today, our fellow citizens bear witness to a unique circumstance in having the three most recent occupants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue all having served two terms and each of them elected to the office before the age of 55. This not only leaves Bill ClintonBill ClintonTrump marks deadly year in Chicago, hints at federal help Most Americans doubt Trump can handle presidential duties Politicians post New Years wishes MORE, George W. Bush and Barack ObamaBarack ObamaMost Americans doubt Trump can handle presidential duties Politicians post New Years wishes Plane carrying expelled Russian diplomats leaves U.S. MORE as historically young presidents but, perhaps more important to our contemporary situation, historically young former presidents. Ex-presidents are a unique breed. When they are not establishing libraries, serving humanitarian causes or flying to the rescue in Saturday Night Live cartoons, they tend to enjoy the perks of post-presidential life by removing themselves from the immediacy of overt political participation while Oval Office occupants can count on the chorus of nearly 319 million other citizens serving as critics for their every move. Traditionally the former presidents, despite their leverage and status, don't join the choir. The day after the still-contentious Bush v. Gore decision was announced to a divided nation by a divided Supreme Court in 2000, President Bill Clinton released a statement saying, in part, that “all of us have a responsibility to support President-Elect Bush and to unite our country in the search for common ground.” In March 2009,  former President Bush said that Obama, sworn in just two months prior, “deserves my silence.” As Bush’s tenure was repeatedly trampled by his successor, the Texan held his tongue. In fact, over the past eight years we have heard few conspicuous political rumblings from either No. 42 and No. 43 — until recently; one spent some time during the most recent campaign stumping for his brother while the other campaigned vigorously for his wife. Although Barack Obama will be vacating the White House grounds at noon on Jan. 20, 2017, don’t count on the future ex-president to fade away into the immediate sunset like his predecessors. “I’m still fired up and I’m still ready to go,” Obama said in a recent call with Democrats. Many interpreted this as his unorthodox pledge, despite being a defender of Trump’s president-elect status, to become the Democratic counterpunch to The Donald once the New York billionaire gets behind the desk himself. There are four factors that make it a safe bet to take Barack Obama at his word that he will be a “discontented ghost” in his post-presidential life: 1. His Age President Obama will be 55 years and 169 days old when he leaves office at noon on Jan. 20. This makes him the third-youngest ex-Commander-in-Chief who served two full terms in United States history. Ulysses Grant and Bill Clinton each vacated the White House at 54 years old. His youth makes for the possibility of a long and potentially active Oval Office afterlife. 2. His Popularity Even after a year in which Americans witnessed a sitting commander-in-chief campaigning with unprecedented zeal and vitriol to name his own successor, President Obama’s weekly average popularity according to Gallup is an enviable 55 percent. The Democratic drubbing in November — as in 2010 and 2014 — tells us that this popularity doesn’t translate to help for his party at the polls, but it does serve as a reminder that as ex-president he will enjoy personal appeal that is most likely to increase as he gets more selective in the issues he will address in the years to come. 3. His Partisanship President Obama has been a uniquely partisan president. He will no doubt be a uniquely partisan ex-president. Alternately addressing or failing to address issues that confronted his administration, he was never reluctant to champion those causes that would advance Democratic party interests. The 44th president was never far from his community-organizer roots and we can expect that he will take the partisanship that was part of his DNA prior to the presidency and apply it to his post-Oval life with as much energy on a larger platform. 4. His Legacy “All the progress we've made is at stake in this election,” President Obama said often in his speeches supporting his would-be Democratic successor. “My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is.” Campaigning for Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonBruce Springsteen questions whether Trump is fit to serve Seven rising Democratic stars Democrats take sides in race for DNC chair MORE as a referendum on his presidency and her failure to win the election has added a sense of urgency to his post-presidential endeavors. With his signature law and many of his executive orders facing significant questions about their future sustainability, Obama will be forced to remain a presence to help self-write the immediate legacy of his tenure. Whether he ultimately serves one term or two, Americans already know the length of Donald TrumpDonald TrumpHouse GOP votes to rein in independent ethics watchdog Alums of historically black college upset band marching in Trump's inaugural parade Trump on North Korea missile threat: ‘It won’t happen’ MORE’s  former-presidency will be shorter than those of Clinton, Bush and Obama. Not only will he be the oldest president to take a first-term oath, he will be sworn in an average of 20 years older than his three immediate predecessors. As much as he will no doubt come to detest Obama lingering on the national scene past his presidency, it’s a safe bet that if Trump leaves office with the amount of vigor with which he came in, his former-presidency will show him also being a “discontented ghost” for his own successor as well.

Patent suggests the firm could be working on eye tracking technology Microsoft has filed a patent for eye-tracking in a head-mounted display The technology uses infrared beams to track your eyes This reduces the need for clunky cameras that obstruct your view It is unclear if or when Microsoft will begin to use the technology  By Shivali Best For Mailonline Published: 06:58 EST, 30 December 2016 | Updated: 07:10 EST, 30 December 2016 e-mail 7 shares 1 View comments The ability to browse a website without needing to as much as move your hand could soon be a possibility with Microsoft's next HoloLens device. Microsoft has filed a patent for new eye-tracking technology for head-mounted displays (HMDs). The technology uses infrared beams to track the eyes, reducing the need for clunky cameras that obstruct your view as seen in current devices on the market. Scroll down for video  Microsoft has filed a patent for new eye-tracking technology for head-mounted displays (HMDs). The technology uses infrared beams to track the eyes, reducing the need for clunky cameras that obstruct your view as seen in current devices on the market HOW WILL IT WORK?  The glasses will use 'wave guides' to track infrared-lit eyes.  The patent states: 'A waveguide, which can be used in a head mounted display (HMD), but is not limited for use therewith, is transparent and includes an input-coupler and an output-coupler. 'The input-coupler comprises a grating area, formed by plurality of curved grating lines, that diffract light beams incident on the input-coupler into the waveguide and towards a common region at which is located the output-coupler. 'The curved grating lines of the input-coupler have a radially varying pitch.' The patent goes on to describe how the infrared beams work with the curved grating lines of the input coupler to produce an eye-tracking effect. The patent was uncovered by MSPoweruser, and includes a complex diagram showing how the new technology will work. 'Wave guides' will be used to track infrared-lit eyes, in an attempt to prevent your line of sight from being obstructed. Currently, most eye-tracking devices rely on a clunky camera attached to the frame of the display, meaning that at least part of your view is hindered. Alternatively, the only other eye-tracking technology available uses a reflector to bend the camera's line of sight towards your temple. But this is a problems for people who wear glasses, which can get in the way. If Microsoft's new patent is to be believed, it would remedy this problem, using a transparent wave guide to track the eyes using infrared. The patent states: 'A waveguide, which can be used in a head mounted display (HMD), but is not limited for use therewith, is transparent and includes an input-coupler and an output-coupler.

It is unclear if or when Microsoft will begin using the technology in its HoloLens devices.  HOLOLENS FEATURES  The HoloLens development edition includes the headset, a clicker for interacting with applications, a carrying case, nose pads and overheads straps. The headset is designed with multiple environment understanding sensors and powered by a custom-built Microsoft Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) and an Intel 32-bit chipset. The device weighs just a little over one pound and consists of 64GB of Flash memory and 2GB of RAM. The battery lasts for about two to three hours, with up to two weeks of standby time, says Microsoft. HoloLens has a 'see-through holographic lens' that uses an optical projection system to create multi-dimensional full-colour 'holograms'. According to Microsoft, 'the key to a great holographic experience is holograms that are light point rich, they have a high holographic density and are pinned, or anchored, to the world around you. In order to achieve this, the device has an optimal holographic density of 2.5k radiants.   Read more: About - MSPoweruser Share or comment on this article e-mail 7 shares Most watched News videos Mariah botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage Heart-warming moment woman plays piano and sings in cathedral Man goes crazy when he catches another guy in bed with his wife Woman takes seven minutes to parallel park car in double space Man finally talks to wife after over twenty years of silence Passenger insults flight attendant before being led away by police Disturbing moment pitbull kills small dog in front of its owner Mass brawl erupts between customers and restaurant staff Dog shows off its incredibly efficient banana-eating technique Bottles and furniture thrown during terrifying NYE fight Spooky!

Ga verder Meer informatie Software-update: OpenELEC 7.0 Door Bart van Klaveren, donderdag 29 december 2016 17:27, 27 reacties • Feedback Bron: OpenELEC, submitter: bjl De final release versie 7.0 van het Open Embedded Linux Entertainment Center is uitgekomen. Deze Linux-distributie is gebaseerd op Kodi en kan een computer tot een volwaardige htpc omtoveren. OpenELEC is eenvoudig te installeren, onderhouden en gebruiken, en is verder klein en razendsnel. Overigens rommelt het in OpenELEC-land en een groot aantal ontwikkelaars zijn uit het project weggelopen en hebben een fork onder de naam LibreELEC opgezet. In OpenELEC versie 7.0 is onder meer de overstap naar Kodi 16.1 gemaakt, is er een groot aantal onderdelen uit het os bijgewerkt en is er ondersteuning voor Bluetooth-audio. De belangrijkste veranderingen zijn hieronder voor je op een rijtje gezet Platform changes: New Platform WeTek Core supported with a own Build WeTek Core is the best Android TV box you can have to watch IPTV, Movies and TV Shows while you relax on your sofa. With an AMLogic S812-H, 2GHz Quad-core processor, 4K Support and 8-bit H265, this box will give you all entertainment you are looking for. Merged Nvidia_Legacy build to Generic build. Users who used the Nvidia_Legacy build now have to use our Generic build. Core OS updates and changes (old version in brackets): ALSA updated to 1.1 (1.0.29) Binutils updated to 2.26 (2.25) GCC updated to 5.3 (4.9) glibc updated to 2.23 (2.22) Python updated to 2.7.13 (2.7.3) LLVM updated to 3.8 (3.6) Linux kernel updated to 4.4 (4.1) Mesa updated to 11.2 (11.0) ffmpeg updated to 2.8 (2.6) libva updated to 1.7 (1.6) connman updated to 1.31 (1.23) libnfs updated to 1.11 (1.9) libressl updated to 2.2 (2.1) systemd updated to 229 (219) xorg-server updated to 1.18 (1.17) Driver and firmware updates and changes: updated WLAN drivers and firmware added new AMDGPU driver for new AMD Graphic cards updated Intel Graphic driver merged Nvidia with Nvidia legacy driver to support old and new Graphic cards with one build.

Wil kodi draaien Reageer +1 Spikie @Tennisbal • 29 december 2016 17:59 Ik zou voor LibreElec gaan. Ik ben zelf overgestapt van OpenElec naar LibreElec en niet meer omgekeken. Prettiger, stabieler en updates volgen sneller. Reageer +1 devil-strike @Spikie • 29 december 2016 18:57 Klopt en je kan zo upgraden van openelec naar libreelec, gewoon de libreelec file in update folder gooien en rebooten. Reageer +1 ThaStealth @Tennisbal • 29 december 2016 21:25 Zoals iedereen voor mij al zei, LibreElec installeren. Heb onder een x64 mediacenter waar voorheen Windows + Kodi opstond, nu ben ik daar ook omgeschakeld naar LibreElec en loopt hij een stuk beter! Draai nu de alpha 10, en viel me op dat hij nu auto update naar nieuwe alpha versies. Openelec deed dit nooit, is dit nieuw? Reageer +1 mhnl1979 @ThaStealth • 29 december 2016 21:32 Volgens mij doet hij dat pas na een canary periode van 24 uur. Maar dat is ook uit te zetten in de libreelec settings. Reageer +1 gjmi @Tennisbal • 29 december 2016 20:42 LibreElec is verder gegaan waar OpenElec stil bleef staan. Teveel gerommel aan de top zorgde voor vertragingen en slechte support. LibreElec is aan te bevelen. Daar zijn ze goed bezig. Ik ben als één van de eersten overgestapt en kijk niet meer terug. Reageer +1 glenn456 30 december 2016 00:04 OSMC is ook een aanrader. Vaak goede en snelle updates. Zelf van libereELEC naar osmc overgestapt. Reageer +1 rbr320 @glenn456 • 30 december 2016 01:20 OSMC is voor zover ik weet ook een op Kodi gebaseerd mediacenter. Op mijn Raspberry Pi ben ik erg blij met LibreELEC juist omdat dit "just enough OS for Kodi" is en dus niets extra probeert te doen, waardoor het ook geen extra power nodig heeft die in een RPi nu juist ontbreekt. Wat doet OSMC anders of misschien zelfs beter dan LibreELEC? Reageer +1 glenn456 @rbr320 • 30 december 2016 07:19 Osmc heeft als onderlaag debian. Ipv van helemaal gestript os en alleen het belangrijkste voor media. Waardoor je nog veel meer dingen kan met je pi. Zoals een openvpn server. net zoals raspbian. [Reactie gewijzigd door glenn456 op 30 december 2016 08:21] Reageer +1 rbr320 @glenn456 • 30 december 2016 13:47 Duidelijk. Inderdaad handig als de Pi het enige apparaat is in je netwerk dat altijd aan staat, maar ik heb persoonlijk voor dat doeleinde al een Linux servertje staan. Ik draai LibreELEC nog op een Pi 1 model B dus het lijkt me dat die echt niet de power heeft om er ook nog andere dingen naast te doen. Op een Pi 3 zal het allemaal wel gaan. Reageer +1 glenn456 @rbr320 • 30 december 2016 23:12 Op het oude model is het zeker een verschil ja. Zelf beschik ik over een pi 2. En daarop is het heel goed te doen Reageer +1 Maarten810 29 december 2016 21:29 Zijn er meer mensen waarbij checking size failed wordt weergegeven bij het herstarten? Zowel bij de automatische gedownloade update file als bij het update bestand vanaf de openelec website. Reageer +1 Klojum OpenELEC Design en multimedia @Maarten810 • 29 december 2016 22:22 LibreELEC is als systeem groter in omvang dan OpenELEC. Vandaar dat ook de systeempartitiegrootte van LibreELEC onlangs is vergroot. Wil van je OpenELEC naar LibreELEC, dien je een goede backup te maken van je OE setup, LibreELEC schoon/nieuw installeren, en dan indien nodig, je backup terug te zetten. Hierbij is er overigens geen 100% successgarantie. Soms willen addons en/of skins niet volledig compatible zijn. [Reactie gewijzigd door Klojum op 29 december 2016 22:27] Reageer +1 Maarten810 @Klojum • 30 december 2016 12:23 De foutmelding kwam naar voren bij het upgraden van Openelec 6.0.3 naar 7.0.0. Inmiddels heb ik de upgrade alsnog uit kunnen voeren door met Gparted de systeem partitie te vergroten. Alles draait weer als een zonnetje Reageer +1 devil-strike 29 december 2016 17:35 Ja libreelec is heel wat beter(vele zijn al overgestapt) en maakt gebruik van kodi 17 en de test builds van kodi 18. Reageer 0 jpfx @devil-strike • 29 december 2016 18:19 Je bedoelt Kodi 16.1 en de testbuilds van Kodi 17 neem ik aan. Reageer +1 Wesley-groet @jpfx • 29 december 2016 18:22 Kodi 17 is al bij release candidate Reageer +1 Klojum OpenELEC Design en multimedia @jpfx • 29 december 2016 18:43 De bleeding-edge versies van LibreELEC zijn al met Kodi 18 begonnen. Kodi 18 - LibreELEC Testbuilds for RaspberryPi (Kodi 18.0) EDIT: dat OpenELEC-kroontje hoef ik echt niet te hebben. Ik ben al een jaar weg bij die bende. [Reactie gewijzigd door Klojum op 29 december 2016 18:44] Reageer +1 devil-strike @jpfx • 29 december 2016 18:56 Oh lol ja zit al maandje of wat op libreelec kodi 18(want anders geen Apollo lake support) vandaar dat ik al dacht dat 17 al officeel uitwas, mijn fout sorry. Reageer 0 roches @devil-strike • 29 december 2016 19:58 Is LibreELEC ook verkrijgbaar voor de OrangePi (H3-chip)? Reageer 0 devil-strike @roches • 29 december 2016 20:00 Zou ik eerlijk gezegt niet weten daar zou je even op moeten google en of even kijken op kodi forum onder live/Linux topic. Reageer +1 derx666 29 december 2016 17:53 Die release notes lijken meer op een advertentie voor de WeTek Core dan op release notes van MediaCentre software. Ben ook blij dat ik tegenwoordig LibreElec draai. Reageer +1 Bart_Smith 30 december 2016 08:46 Ik heb beide, OpenELEC en LibreELEC geprobeerd en beide hebben als groot nadeel dat, ondanks de naam met open en vrij, je belangrijke files zoals /etc/samba/smb.conf niet kan editten naar eigen smaak. Van de twee is zeker LibreELEC beter, al is het alleen maar voor het gemak hoe de installer werkt. Maar het liefst zie ik weer de combi netinstall Ubuntu met een kodi install script, maar ik heb geen goed script meer kunnen vinden helaas. Zelf draai ik Kodi/SPMC op een Nvidia Shield TV, heerlijk die eenvoud en 4K/Atmos werkt prima. Reageer +1 wvkreg 30 december 2016 09:24 Openelec 7 is een pijnloze upgrade. Alles werkt nog prima nadien. Ik zie geen reden om op Libre over te stappen momenteel. Ik heb 1 RPI2 en 2 RPI3 en allemaal probleemloos met alle addons naar 7.0. Reageer +1 TiTbB 30 december 2016 13:07 Werkt als een trein, net als de bèta die al geruime tijd uit was trouwens Reageer 0 Raven__NL 29 december 2016 17:29 Ben een beetje verbaast dat het nu wel weer mogelijk is om een final op tijd af te hebben. Zijn toch andere tijden geweest. Ik hou het lekker bij Librelec Reageer 0 rbr320 @Raven__NL • 29 december 2016 18:19 Het duurde bij mij even (protip: goed lezen) voordat ik door had dat dit bericht om OpenELEC ging, Ik draai zelf inderdaad ook LibreELEC en mijn eerste reactie was "we zitten toch al op versie 7.0.2?

Qualcomm Fined W1 Trillion for Price Gouging By Choi Jong-seok, Kang Dong-cheol Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory December 29, 2016 13:08 Korea's antitrust watchdog has fined Qualcomm a record W1.03 trillion for gouging royalties from Korean smartphone manufacturers (US$1=W1,211). The Fair Trade Commission on Tuesday said Qualcomm abused a monopoly on certain technologies to force unfair contracts on Korean manufacturers. "Qualcomm made W38 trillion in revenues here since December 2009, so we decided to impose a 2.7 percent fine," said FTC Secretary-General Shin Young-seon. The highest fine so far was W668.9 billion imposed on six refineries for fixing LPG prices in 2010. The FTC said Qualcomm forced Samsung and LG to pay three to five percent of their smartphone prices in royalties for patented technologies and permitting only limited use of its technologies to rivals like Samsung and Intel, thereby hindering competition. It told Qualcomm to renegotiate contracts with the smartphone and chip manufacturers. The move is expected to have an impact on U.S., Taiwanese and EU regulators, who are pursuing similar probes. Chinese fair trade officials already fined Qualcomm W1 trillion last year. The FTC also told Qualcomm to revise contracts with foreign companies supplying parts to Korea, including Apple and Huawei. Qualcomm refused to accept the decision and pledged to sue. Qualcomm executive Donald Rosenberg said the firm's "repeated requests during the FTC's investigation for basic due process rights such as access to the case file and the right to cross-examine witnesses were denied."
