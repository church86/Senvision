Investors including chip company Intel Corp (INTC.O) piled into Cloudera several years ago when a flood of money into private technology companies pushed valuations skyward. Cloudera said it priced its shares at $15, above its indicated range of $12 to $14, but still a far cry from the $30.92 a share that Intel paid in 2014. Cloudera will begin trading tomorrow on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CLDR.” The source asked not to be named because the negotiations are confidential. Cloudera and Intel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Palo Alto, Califoria-based Cloudera, like rival HortonWorks Inc (HDP.O), focuses on helping corporate customers manage data through “Hadoop,” an open-source software system that can sort and handle the increasingly massive amounts of data generated through the Internet and mobile devices. Intel, which took a 18 percent stake in Cloudera in its initial $740 million investment and subsequently bought more shares, will hold a 19.4 percent stake in Cloudera after its IPO. Cloudera’s data business is meant to help Intel diversify away from its core business of making chips for data centers. Since Intel’s investment, Cloudera has had to invest heavily in marketing to help grow its revenue and has had to discount its products due to increased competition. In its fiscal year that ended January 31, Cloudera had $261 million in revenue and spent $203 million on sales and marketing. It posted a loss of $187 million for the year. Cloudera is not the first company in recent years to have gone public at a lower valuation than its private market level — known in investment parlance as a down-round IPO. Mobile payments company Square Inc (SQ.N) had a down round IPO in 2015 with a market capitalization of $2.9 billion, a steep discount from its private valuation of $6 billion. Its market capitalization now sits at $6.7 billion. Still, a down round IPO can be a disappointment for employees with expectations of big payouts. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Allen & Company LLC are helping to lead the IPO. Take your pick! Buyouts delivers exclusive news and analysis about private equity deals, fundraising, top-quartile managers and more.

[img]http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/weirdalfoil_2322.jpg[/img] You do understand that if Intel and Nvidia formed a monopoly by working with eachother, that might make a little sense, aside from the fact that Nvidia competes with Intel on many, many computing fronts. However, microsoft? Microsoft would love it more then anything if hardware costs much less. There would be no reason for microsoft to work with Intel and Nvidia to make their products more expensive, as all that does is make it less likely someone might buy a system for Windows.

Also AMD have lots of closed off stuff they don't let others use, sure they have more open stuff but business is a business. All this post goes to show is Intel is not panicking, it is not worrying and it is doing just fine as it was a couple of months ago, they have gone up in revenue. what this does show however is how little of a change AMD ryzen has made on the mainstream front, which i'm sure for AMD is very worrying as of right now Going by the Steam stats ( i know not the best data in the world) it shows that less users have AMD cpus than Intels over the past two years, and users are using Nvidia cards more than AMD cards CPU by users: AMD 23.9% March 2015 - 20.32% March 2017 Intel 76.1% March 2015 - 79.68% March 2017 GPU by users AMD 26.6% March 2015 - 22.14% March 2017 Nivida 54.1% March 2015 - 61.21% March 2017 Intel 18.8% March 2015 - 16.27% March 2017 Noisiv Ancient Guru Posts: 5546 Joined: 2010-11-16 #5425612 Posted on: 04/28/2017 12:54 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Silva You know, fanboys will always buy i7 7700k because it's faster in today's games, even if a R7 1700 is close and has allot more horsepower under the hood and costs the same.

Yeah well... you are calling them Intel fanboys for buying CPU that's hassle free, and does not require any special attention or future expectation, and which is also the fastest in pretty much the only area where they really need it to be fast aka GAMING! OTOH maybe they don't fret much whether LAME or VirtualDub or kernel compilation ends up 10 seconds of 10 minutes earlier, because they don't use that sh1t at all?

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > iPhone 7 Plus Qualcomm LTE Modem Outperforms Intel LTE Modem by Significant Margin iPhone 7 Plus Qualcomm LTE Modem Outperforms Intel LTE Modem by Significant Margin Thursday, 20 October 2016 With the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple elected to use LTE modems from two different sources, Qualcomm and Intel. The A1778 and A1784 iPhone models use a GSM-only Intel XMM7360 modem while the A1660 and 1661 iPhone models use a GSM/CDMA-compatible Qualcomm MDM9645M modem. Apple's decision has already caused some disappointment among customers because the GSM-only Intel modem is not compatible with as many carrier networks as the GSM/CDMA Qualcomm modem, and now independent testing conducted by Cellular Insights suggests there are some significant performance differences between the two modems, with the Qualcomm modem outperforming the Intel modem. Using an R&S TS7124 RF Shielded Box, two R&S CMW500, one R&S CMWC controller, and four Vivaldi antennas, Cellular Insights created a setup to simulate LTE performance at different distances from a cellular tower using two iPhone 7 Plus devices, one with an Intel modem and one with a Qualcomm modem. The goal of the test was to measure the highest achievable LTE throughput starting at a Reference Signal Received Quality of -85dBm (a strong signal) and gradually reducing the power level to simulate moving away from a cellular tower where signal is weaker. Three LTE bands were tested: Band 12, Band 4 (the most common band in North America), and Band 7. In all three tests, both the iPhone 7 Plus models offered similar performance in ideal conditions, but as power levels decreased, Cellular Insights saw "unexplainable sharp dips in performance" in the Intel modem, finding a gap "north of 30%" in favor of the Qualcomm iPhone 7 Plus. In the charts, the Qualcomm modem maintains noticeably higher throughput speeds than the Intel modem as signal strength decreases. In real world conditions, this would suggest the Qualcomm modem does better in areas where the cellular connection is weak, with faster throughput speeds. Cellular Insights describes the Band 12 test below: Both iPhone 7 Plus variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. [...] At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm Cellular Insights also created a chart that compares the edge of cell performance of several different smartphones. The increasing numbers on the X-axis below represent increasingly poor signal strength, while on the Y-axis, a higher throughput number indicates better performance. The iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem demonstrates the poorest performance of all phones tested. According to Cellular Insights, in every single test, the iPhone 7 Plus with a Qualcomm modem "had a significant performance edge" over the iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem.

(AMD) Traders are reacting to GOOGL and INTC earnings results differently, while the charts are already hinting at how AMD will trade on Monday Apr 28, 2017, 2:00 pm EDT  |  By Johnson Research Group Get GOOGL alerts: Submit     View All   The market got a deluge of earnings reports from technology giants last night. Companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) all provided their quarterly results. In general, the numbers were great, but the market’s reaction to the numbers haven’t been completely consistent. Today’s three big stock charts takes a look at the reaction to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) results while looking forward to Monday’s earnings release from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Intel Corporation (INTC) Intel gave some good numbers to Wall Street yesterday as the company beat on the top and bottom line. The color on the quarter after the release gave investors a reason to sell as PC demand and a few other metrics weren’t up to par. INTC stock is finding itself trading at a strong foundation of technical support that is likely to cause the chart watchers to step in and start buying. Outside of the simple round numbered support provided by $36, there are three major trendlines trading within a few cents of $36. This fortifies this price for Intel as short-term support. The critical 50- and 200-day moving averages are currently sitting at $35.90. The double-barreled support of these two indicators should be considerable as INTC stock works out the post-earnings selling. In addition, the 100-day moving average is just above $36, trading at 36.22. A move back above this trendline will confirm a hold of the 50- and 200-day and strengthen the intermediate-term outlook for the stock, drawing in more technical buyers. Shares of Intel have continued to lag the market; however, the 3% dividend is starting to make it more attractive as the interest rate environment has become hazy. For now, the chart is still friendly for bullish traders. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) In a perfect segue, Advanced Micro Devices announces their earnings on Monday after the market’s close. AMD is trading 1.5% lower in sympathy to Intel’s earnings results, but the stock may actually have more to lose given the chart. Unlike Intel, Advanced Micro Devices shares just got rejected by their 50-day moving average, which is rolling over. This transition alone puts AMD at risk as a the declining 50-day usually results in an increased probability that the stock will continue its decline. Support for AMD shares resides at an even $12 from the initial look at the chart. This is obviously from the round numbered nature of that price, but also a look back shows definite support and resistance from the technical activity over the last year. If $12 were to give way next week, which we are expecting to be the case, then technical traders will begin to eye $10 as the next level of solid support worthy of buying Advanced Micro Devices on a dip.  This price will have the stock deep in oversold territory as well as pressing against the stock’s 200-day moving average. The move to this price would represent an incredible 35% decline from its highs for the year, another number that would get the technical traders excited as AMD stock would represent a heavy discount against other peer companies.

The company’s first-quarter results came in close to expectations, but relatively slow growth in its vital data center business shocked investors and sent the stock down as much as 4 percent in after-hours trading Thursday. Notable numbers from first-quarter results issued Thursday: • Sales of $14.8 billion, in line with forecasts and up 8 percent from a year ago. • Profits of $3.0 billion, or 61 cents a share. That’s up from 27 cents a share last year. • Second-quarter forecast: $14.4 billion in revenue, up 6.4 percent from 2016. Earnings projected at 53 cents a share, up from 27 cents last year. • Full-year sales forecast raised by $500 million, to $60 billion, which would be a 1 percent increase from 2016. Intel expects 2017 earnings per share of $2.56. Intel is managing a difficult transition — demand for PCs and laptops is in decline, and the chipmaker still relies on that segment for more than half of its sales. In Thursday’s quarterly results, Intel reiterated that it views the PC market even more dismally than third-party analysts. Growth in Intel’s data center business has offset that decline thus far, with the chipmaker supplying nearly all the high-powered microprocessors behind the explosion in cloud computing. Intel’s data center business expanded by just 6 percent last quarter, though, held back by a decline in sales to large companies that run their own computer systems. That’s below Intel’s target of near 10 percent for the year, though the company said it still believes it will meet that goal. Late Thursday afternoon, Intel shares were down $3.63 at $36.07 in after-hours trading. When it announced first-quarter results a year ago, Intel began the biggest restructuring in its history. It ultimately eliminated 15,000 jobs through layoffs and buyouts. The company now employs 107,000 worldwide, down from 112,000 this time last year. Intel is Oregon’s largest private employer, with 19,300 workers in Washington County. That’s down just 200 from the company’s peak last year, indicating that Intel has hired for new jobs even as it eliminated positions through the restructuring. But within Intel, business groups including its sales and finance divisions continue to feel extreme pressure to reduce employment and cut costs. On Thursday, Intel said it expects to get overall corporate spending down to 30 percent of revenue by 2020. Spending was 36 percent of revenue in the first quarter, so the cuts Intel outlined Thursday suggest the company will continue making severe changes to its operations. “Hitting this goal requires spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities,” Krzanich said. He didn’t specify just how Intel will ratchet down spending, but pledged that Intel will continue to invest in markets where the company sees profitable opportunities.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to outside ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "These events add real value to me as an employee, and as a citizen of the net." --April 2017 "I now have a much better understanding of the controversy surrounding the Snowden leaks and have an idea of what I can do as a private citizen to combat the government's use of mass surveillance." --April 2017 "The topic was compelling and the level of expertise of the speaker made the information received very credible and thus easy to find relevant to my work." --April 2017 "Today's speaker challenged my expectations of the internet and of corporate behavior and stimulated good office discussion." --March 2017 "I dislike most presentations. This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, May 10, 2017: When Surveillance Goes Private: A 2027 Retrospective from Adrian Hon Location: Mozilla London + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: It’s 2027. In the UK, 8 out of 10 homes host a range of microphones, cameras and motion detectors. They help users secure their homes, find lost items, assist with cleaning, keep an eye out for accidents and falls, and a hundred other everyday tasks. They're integrated so seamlessly into daily life that they're considered indispensable – and they're cheap. Of course, consumption habits ranging from entertainment, clothing and food are not only known, but anticipated by intelligent systems. These habits are also owned, captured, analyzed and used by the corporations that run them. Interestingly, just a few decades ago in the 1990s, the UK’s introduction of Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) met with significant public outcry over concerns of privacy abuses. Yet now, less than half a century later, we’ve not only abandoned such talks: we’ve opted in to 24/7 surveillance of our homes. In our May 10 “future retrospective,” we’ll look at how we - in 2027 - became so collectively compliant to others owning data about our personal habits and lives. What factors led to us to give so much of our lives to corporations, with so little transparency or accountability? Why were we more open to private surveillance than public surveillance? And when we return to 2017, what can we learn from this evolution to map a different future? Host: Sarah Allen Speaker: Adrian Hon Adrian Hon is CEO and founder at Six to Start, co-creators of the most successful smartphone fitness game in the world, Zombies, Run!. The game has won awards for its stories and storylike games, and the team’s work has been displayed at the MOMA and Design Museum in London. He’s the author of A History of the Future in 100 Objects, and he used to write about technology for The Telegraph. Previously, Adrian was Executive Producer and Director of Play at Mind Candy from 2004 to 2007, where he designed and produced the Perplex City alternate reality game (ARG). Adrian’s interest in ARGs began with the genre itself in 2001, when as a moderator for the Cloudmakers community for ‘The Beast’ (an ARG for Steven Spielberg’s A.I.), he wrote a detailed walkthrough for the game, called ‘The Guide.' During that time, Adrian studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge, specialising in experimental psychology and neuroscience. In 2003, he began a neuroscience DPhil at Oxford, but left after a year to join Mind Candy. Adrian has also spoken at the main TED conference in Monterey in 2001 (about the human colonisation of Mars), as well as various SXSW, GDC, Economist, and other such tech and gaming conferences. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, July 20, 2017: Are you an introvert? Working Across Personality Types with Jennifer Selby-Long Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Engineers are introverted. Agile = meetings all the time. Which is great… for the extraverts. Over the past year a few hundred staff at Mozilla have used the Insights Discovery tool to better learn about their individual personality temperaments, and to be more effective on their teams. But can these tests really help us? What’s the real science behind them? Can they be abused? Or are there ways they can help us work together better? On July 20, Jennifer Selby Long, an expert in the ethical use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®), will lead us in a very interactive session on this material. She’ll help us explore these frameworks and the science behind them, with a focus specifically on their Introversion / Extraversion dimensions and workplace collaboration. Importantly, we’ll make it personal, rolling up our sleeves with some exercises to help us explore how our (and our team’s) MBTI preferences can help us work together better, regardless of job description, culture, or demographics. Hosts: Matt Frassica & Tyler Haugen Speaker: Jennifer Selby-Long Jennifer Selby Long is an executive coach, management consultant, and MBTI® expert who helps technology leaders navigate the challenges of seismic change to achieve their highest potential. She also advises on the impact of personality and gender on financial behavior. Jennifer is the past president of the Association for Psychological Type. She has been quoted by business and technology writers in the Fast Company, Information World, Dice.com, Univision, and the Bulletin of Psychological Type. She is an award-winning business writer and the author of Traveling Light, a blog helping leaders skyrocket their impact and lighten the load in their lives. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Previous Speakers Wednesday, April 26, 2017: American Spies: Jennifer Granick on U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: American Spies: U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Intelligence agencies in the U.S. (aka the American Spies) are exceedingly aggressive, pushing and sometimes bursting through the technological, legal and political boundaries of lawful surveillance. Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Host: Chris More Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

Shares traded as much as 29% above the IPO price, at $19.31 per share, in early morning trading. Underwriters for the IPO were Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Allen, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank Securities, Stifel, JMP Securities and Raymond James. The underwriters have 30-day option to purchase an additional 2.25 million shares. The company raised $225 million, and there are now over 130 million shares of Cloudera outstanding. Even at the top of its trading price this morning, however, Cloudera was trading at a discount of more than 30% to the per-share price that Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) paid for a stake in the company back in 2014. Intel held nearly 25 million shares prior to the IPO, for which the company paid some $766 million. At the IPO price, Intel’s stake is valued at around $375 million; at $20 a share, Intel’s stake is worth about $500 million. From a one-time valuation of around $4.1 billion to around $2.3 billion, Cloudera may not seem like a good bet. After all, Intel is taking a big haircut on its earlier investment. But the chipmaking giant indicated that it may acquire 10% of the shares in today’s IPO. Intel’s reasoning is driven by its desire to get Cloudera’s IPO out the door at a reasonable price in order to begin selling a long-term story that competes with IBM and its Watson platform. Intel is working with Cloudera to optimize silicon for big data analytics. No matter how fast a program runs on commodity processors, customized silicon will be lots faster. With big-data platforms like Cloudera, that could be the difference that wins in what has become a crowded market for analytics programs. On the financial side, the above-range IPO sets the table for a secondary offering within 12 months, especially if Cloudera can continue to build (or at least not slice) the share price. That could help Intel recover some of the haircut it took, a neat trick when you think about it. Cloudera’s stock traded at $18.10, up about 21%, as Friday’s noon hour ticked to an end. Over 10 million shares had changed hands since the stock went out this morning.

Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released. Stocks Soar, Then Hold Gains The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests. Amazon Is E-Commerce, Cloud King The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years. Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth. Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks. Alphabet Hits New High On Earnings The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's "other" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday. McDonald's, Domino's Earnings Deliver; Starbucks Iced McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level. Microsoft Earnings Solid; Sales, Guidance Shy Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion. Intel Tumbles Amid Mixed Chip Week Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results. Defense Stocks Are In Buy DMZ Zone Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees "significant demand signals" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas. Boeing Sales Miss, Cash Flow Triples Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose. Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range. Hard Drives Split Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings. Seagate revenue missed estimates, with the stock falling 17% in reaction. Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday. Casino Stocks Are Winners Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation. Exxon, Chevron Earnings Top Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains. T-Mobile Keeps Grabbing Customers T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low. Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains. Autos' Earnings Better Than Expected Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices. Caterpillar Earnings Crush Views Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone. Drug, Biotech Earnings Bonanza Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed. Insurers Navigate Earnings, TrumpCare Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that "20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid." Homebuilder Stocks Now Lagging PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.   Share this: Related news Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Fed To Grab Spotlight: Investing Action Plan 4/28/2017 Some of the most closely watched and high-profile tech companies — Apple, Tesla and Facebook — report quarterly results as... 4/28/2017 Some of the most closely watched and high-profile tech companies...

On Thursday evening, Cloudera priced its shares at $15, raising around $225 million and giving it a preliminary valuation of about $1.9 billion -- well below the $4.1 billion valuation Cloudera held three years ago following a major investment from Intel. In 2014, Intel jettisoned plans for its own Hadoop distribution, moving its funds over to Cloudera instead. At an estimated $740 million commitment, Intel said at the time that the Cloudera stake was its largest-ever datacenter technology investment. Intel doubled down on its investment during Cloudera's IPO, scooping up more shares in order to maintain its 19.4-percent ownership of the company.

A single autonomous car could generate as much as 100GB of data every second, said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson, in a note published Wednesday. If extrapolated out to the entire U.S. fleet of vehicles -- 260 million in number -- autonomous cars and trucks could potentially produce about 5,800 exabytes, Johnson stated. In other words, on a daily basis, there would be enough raw data to fill 1.4 million Amazon AWS "Snowmobile" mobile data center tractor-trailer trucks with 100 petabytes of storage each, for a convey reaching 11,000 miles long. "Even with data compression of 10,000x, that would still be a one-mile long convey," Johnson stated. Uber An Uber autonomous test vehicle on the streets of Pittsburgh. Big data will be "at the core of change and disruption" in the auto business, and managing massive amounts of data will require new solutions in storage and analysis, the report said. Security will also be a key area of concern for autonomous car makers. A modern car has 50 to 150 electronic control units (ECUs) - or tiny computers -- with as much as 100 million lines of code. And for every 1,000 lines there are as many as 15 bugs that are potential doors for would-be hackers, analysts say. In today's vehicles, ECUs are linked by an internal controller area network, infotainment systems and an increasing array of cameras and radars for advanced driver assistance systems that are already creating vast amounts of data that is typically used by automakers, but then discarded. "Going forward, any or all of this data can be uploaded to the cloud -- either in real time via 4G and beyond, someday through home WiFi uploads, or sporadically through service center uploads (as with the original Tesla Roadster," the report stated. Cars will produce data related to in-vehicle, environmental, and driver/passenger information. In-vehicle data will consist of historical data, such as vehicle fluid levels, speed and acceleration, GPS positioning and, in the event of an accident, a snapshot of data prior to the crash as well as alerts for first responders. Otto Otto's self-driving semi-trailer truck hauling Budweiser down I-25 in Colorado. Driver/passenger data will include information about the use of infotainment systems, HVAC and seat preferences, and even driving styles (i.e., whether the car is used in a "sporty" fashion versus economic driving). "All of this could be recorded, uploaded and used to tailor in-car experiences," the report stated. Environmental data will include information from LiDAR scanners, cameras and other sensors. "The car can become a roving data gathering vacuum," Johnson said in the report. "Think of millions of Google StreetView vehicles capable of refreshing live views of every street everywhere several times a day. Not only can this data be added as layers on top of traditional HD-maps in near-real time, it can also be potentially mined for a variety of insights." For example, video data could be used to determine how full a store parking lot is at any given time of day and what prices are advertised in a store window, according to Johnson. Intel "Moreover, installed cameras can displace the aftermarket dash-cam video market and record pre-crash images," Johnson wrote. Companies most likely to capitalize on vehicle big data are automakers that are building from scratch, such as Tesla, which offers a "clean sheet in-car architecture with a solid base of data," and third-party parts suppliers, such as Delphi, which is expected to provide analytics engines for legacy and newly manufactured cars and trucks, Barclays said. Mobileye, a maker of vehicle vision chip technology (called EyeQ), also has a strong lead in the mapping and camera sensing market, the report claimed. Mobileye, Delphi Mobileye and Delphi plan to start production in 2019 on their "Central Sensing Localization and Planning" platform for self-driving cars in urban and highway driving conditions. Intel recently acquired Mobileye for $15.3 billion to help advance an alliance between the two companies and BMW, which plans to ship self-driving cars by 2021. Last year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich emphasized how critical the automotive market has become to the company, and said the industry must be prepared for the deluge of data that will require an "unprecedented" level of "computing, intelligence and connectivity." Krzanich said there's a need for the auto industry to be prepared for that data deluge that could amount to 4TB of data being generated from a single car each day. Intel's investment arm, Intel Capital, also plans to spend $250 million of additional new capital over the next two years for the development of autonomous driving technology. Intel has partnered with self-driving technology makers, such as vehicle camera company Mobileye, and carmakers such as BMW, to produce fully-autonomous vehicles by 2021. Intel The BMW i3 autonomous car co-developed by BMW, Intel and Mobileye. While the oft-cited use case for automotive big data is in support of location-based marketing, Barclays believes the mountain of data will be mined for vehicle-related services, such as usage-based insurance plans and predicting required maintenance. The highest-value use case, however, would be to support level 4 and 5 fully autonomous driving through digital maps and sensor data videos, which would provide training data for autonomous algorithms. "Indeed, within mapping, Auto Big Data could support crowd-sourced live video covering every mile of road in the world," Johnson wrote. "While currently it is not feasible to stream constant video to the cloud, in the future it would be feasible as bandwidth and storage costs drop exponentially." The Society of Automotive Engineers International, a U.S.-based industry standards organization, has established six autonomous driving categories where Level 0 represents no automation and Level 5 is a fully autonomous vehicle that controls all aspects of driving previously performed by humans. Society of Automotive Engineers International The exabytes of data expected to come will reside mainly in the cloud, where data analytics and cloud storage platforms will be required to create and store useable information. Those who capitalize on the Auto big data will be able to compress the data and extract key data "events," Johnson stated. "Even in a world beyond 5G, the amount of raw data is impractical to process, so... the node and edge analytics engines in the car could become more important than the motors in vehicles," Johnson wrote. By 2020, 75% of the world's cars will be connected to the internet via embedded Wi-Fi, and the growth of internet-connected vehicles will bring in around $2.94 billion in revenue, according to a report by Topology, a division of TrendForce market research. In addition, autonomous or fully self-driving vehicles will enter mass production by 2020 because more major auto makers in recent years have committed to those vehicles' R&D, according to Topology. Automakers are already investing heavily in artificial intelligence technology to control self-driving cars. For example, Ford plans to spend $1 billion over the next five years on A.I. in support of the development of autonomous vehicle technology. "A common saying in Silicon Valley... is that 'data is the new oil' -- and enthusiasm for businesses that generate and analyze data is common across the technology space," Johnson wrote.

Delivered on Its Promises in This Q1 Report The chip giant met or beat its own guidance targets at every turn, and followed up with a couple of modest boosts to management's full-year profit targets. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Apr 28, 2017 at 1:46PM Semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported first-quarter results after the closing bell on Thursday. Unadjusted results were at or above management's guidance targets, and management's full-year profit targets were given a modest boost. Here's what investors need to know about Intel's latest earnings report. Intel: The raw numbers Metric Q1 2017 Q1 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $14.8 billion $13.7 billion 8% Operating margin 24.3% 18.7% 30% Net income (unadjusted) $2.96 billion $2.05 billion 44% Diluted EPS (unadjusted) $0.61 $0.42 45% Data source: Intel earnings reports. As a reminder, Intel's first-quarter guidance called for $14.8 billion of top-line revenue, a 24% unadjusted operating margin, and GAAP earnings near $0.56 per share. All of these projections were either met or exceeded in the final tally. Looking ahead, full-year revenue guidance held steady at $60 billion. The operating income target was lifted from $15.7 billion to $16.1 billion, boosting the targeted operating margin from 26.1% to 26.8%. At $2.56 per share, the new earnings target is a small improvement over the earlier $2.53 goal. The Robert Noyce building, home to the Intel Museum, on Intel's HQ campus in Santa Clara, Calif. Image source: Intel. Going deeper Intel's client computing segment reported 6% year-over-year revenue growth, balancing a 1% increase in notebook unit volumes against 7% lower desktop volumes. Average selling prices increased for both of these classic platforms. Data center revenue also increased by 6%, thanks to stable sales volumes and rising average prices. Intel released its first Optane memory products in the first quarter, building on a longtime partnership with memory specialist Micron Technology to produce a speed-booster module for systems based on 7th-generation Intel Core processors. Intel describes Optane as "the holy grail of memory, because it's cheaper than DRAM, way faster than NAND, and it's non-volatile." System builders have already started to embrace this young technology, driving Intel's memory segment to a 55% year-over-year sales boost in the first quarter. That $866 million revenue bite placed the non-volatile memory group third among Intel's six reportable segments, behind only the gargantuan data center and client computing divisions. Looking ahead, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich found reason for optimism in this quarter's demand for high-speed processors. "The [average selling price] strength we saw across nearly every segment of the business demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data," Krzanich said in a prepared statement.

The company claims that the drives will not increase prices of motherboards significantly, but will bring tangible performance benefits when it comes to boot times and application launches versus systems employing HDDs. MSI will add Intel’s Optane Memory 16 GB drives to its Z270 Tomahawk Opt Boost, B250M Bazooka Opt Boost, as well as B250M Pro Opt boost motherboards, which means the company will be hitting gaming, mainstream, and commercial PCs. The consumer Intel Optane Memory caching drives were not designed to replace conventional SSDs, but were developed to enable hybrid storage solutions featuring fast solid-state memory as well as a slower storage device with SATA interface (i.e., an HDD, but SSHDs and even SATA SSDs are formally supported as well). The Intel Optane Memory 16 and 32 GB drives cache frequently used data (i.e., frequently used LBA sectors where Windows boot files and frequently launched applications reside) with the help of Intel’s software and PCH and therefore speed up PCs with mechanical hard drives. Performance-wise, Intel’s Optane Memory 16 GB drive offers up to 900 MB/s sequential read and up to 145 MB/s sequential write speed, but keeping in mind that the drive is used for caching, random read speeds and overall read latency are what matter most. Intel Optane Memory Specifications Capacity 16 GB 32 GB Form Factor M.2 2280 B+M key Interface PCIe 3.0 x2 Protocol NVMe 1.1 Controller Intel Memory 128 Gb 20nm Intel 3D XPoint Sequential Read 900 MB/s 1350 MB/s Sequential Write 145 MB/s 290 MB/s Random Read 190k IOPS 240k IOPS Random Write 35k IOPS 65k IOPS Read Latency 7µs 9 µs Write Latency 18µs 30 µs Active Power 3.5 W 3.5 W Idle Power 1 W 1 W Endurance 182.5 TB 182.5 TB Warranty 5 years MSRP $44 $77 While MSI bundles the Optane Memory 16 GB drives with select 200-series motherboards, it should be noted that the drives are only supported by Intel’s Core i-series Kaby Lake processors (so, no Celeron or Pentium) and Microsoft Windows 10 64-bit OS. In addition, the Optane Memory drive must be supported by the UEFI firmware of the motherboard. Based on our own test results, Intel’s Optane Memory 32 GB caching drive can bring performance an HDD-based system up to the level of mainstream SSDs in SYSmark, but like most hybrid storage sub-systems, this happens only with frequently used files or programs. The good news is that Intel’s Optane 16 GB SSD (retail $47) comes for free(ish) with select MSI’s motherboards, essentially bringing an inexpensive performance improvement to equally inexpensive systems with HDDs.

POST A COMMENT 7 Comments View All Comments rocky12345 - Friday, April 28, 2017 - link I was all excited about these drives until I found out that Intel is not sharing the tech and AMD won't be getting to use it in their Ryzen platform at all. I plan on getting Ryzen 2 in a year and thought hey one of these little 32GB cache drives would be a nice speed booster. BUt the guy form AMD on another site confirmed that Intel owns the hardware rights and is not sharing it. He went on as far to say if you got a SSD drive why would you need it anyway. He is right and wrong in the review I read it showed the 32Gb version making a Spindle HDD work at SSD speed like speed in reads and a bit faster in writes but it also showed that if you have a sata SSD it even uplifts the performance for them a bit as well because of the 600MB's speed limit on the Sata bus. Oh well I guess a new NVMe drive is in the works for my next build...lol Reply fanofanand - Friday, April 28, 2017 - link Instead of listening to your buddy or some random person in a forum, try reading Anandtech's review of the product. Optane caches are pretty much worthless unless all you do is e-mail and surf the webz. Reply haukionkannel - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link According to Anandtech rewiev optane cache is quite usefull... I have a guite a lot games in normal HD and only one or two in ssd, so this would speed up my game leads considerably. Reply Samus - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link It is completely useless and not cost effective simply because 1) it doesn't consistently bring the speed of an HDD to SSD levels 2) Optane + HDD is more expensive than a system with a decent sized SSD 3) it adds power consumptions and footprint so it is a far fetched mobile solution, where it could have potentially been successful since these systems typically only fit one drive 4) it works with one platform, one series of CPU from one generation, and one operating system 5) the systems that benefit most are office and home PC's where large storage capacity is not needed. Just get a 275GB $90 SSD instead of a 2TB $90 HDD with capacity most of the target applications don't need. Reply tuxRoller - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link Why can't this be dropped into pcie on an amd board? It's talking nvme. The drive gets mapped by the os as a block device which could be used for swap, disk cache (and pick your replacement strategy), whatever. Reply fanofanand - Friday, April 28, 2017 - link Nice try Intel, but this is nowhere near enough to distract from Ryzen and what that means for the consumer. I would rather have smooth multi-tasking than a bump from 150 to 180 fps in some fps. Reply chipped - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link Waste of money when the Logical Volume Manager or/and Filesystem are not able to control the cache directly. It will be frustrating because of the random performance changes as data gets moved in and out of cache. Haven't used a photoshop for a week but installed some games and copied some data in? Chances are photoshop isn't in the cache anymore and will open slowly. Just buy a SSD.

While it’s limited to Kaby Lake processors and 200-series motherboards, this launch of a fundamentally new type of memory should offer significant performance improvements in at least some workloads. Early reviews, however, don’t entirely bear that out. Intel isn’t offering Optane as a full SSD option yet, but you can order 16GB or 32GB drives for $44 or $77 (MSRP). Intel supports these drives as cache options via Intel SRT (Smart Response Technology). This isn’t a new feature from Intel; SRT has been supported on small SSD cache drives for at least five years, and Intel’s Optane drives appear to offer commensurate benefits to an SSD cache drive when used in an equivalent configuration. Anandtech, Ars Technica, Hot Hardware, and Tech Report have all taken Optane out for a spin, with varying results. Most of the early reviews on Optane are, at best, cautiously optimistic. Anandtech’s sample failed too quickly for them to be comfortable giving a final verdict, though they do note impressive performance improvements for small transfer sizes and low queue depths. In multiple cases, workloads on a conventional HDD + Optane were accelerated to SSD-equivalent levels. Windows boot times also shrank dramatically, at least once cache training had been performed (Hot Hardware has benchmarks that address this acceleration, specifically, one of which is shown below). Data and graph by Hot Hardware This mirrors what we’ve seen from other types of caching in the past. Re-running a workload multiple times trains the cache solution to expect that workload in the future. Limited appeal One issue no one’s happy with is Intel’s decision to limit Optane to Kaby Lake CPUs in 200-series chipsets. SSD caches (and Optane caches) would be most effective if deployed as acceleration in lower-cost systems or older hardware. Intel’s decision to sandbox their platform to only the latest motherboards and CPUs means the computers that could benefit the most from Optane acceleration aren’t eligible to use it. It’s also telling the platforms Intel shipped for Optane testing literally preclude comparing it with its most logical competitor. As we’ve previously stated, Optane should be compared against SSD drive caching, but the B250 motherboards that Intel provided literally only support Optane caching. If you try to configure the software to cache via SSD instead, it refuses to do so. For that, you need a Z270 motherboard, and that’s one reason we don’t have Optane figures ourselves today. The appropriate configuration to test against is the configuration that should serve as Intel’s primary competitor. Optane is quite quick, in the right circumstances. Image and data by Tech Report But any comparison of SSD-versus-Optane pricing drives home that this isn’t 2012. Back then, it made sense to buy into SSD cache drives, particularly if you wanted to add SSD-like performance to an existing rig without giving up the much larger capacities of a hard drive. Today, SSD prices have fallen so much that you can buy a 256GB SSD for the same cost as a 32GB Optane cache (~$77). While we aren’t claiming that the performance benefits of an SSD cache are equivalent or exactly matched to those of an Optane cache, look through the slideshow from our 2012 review against any of the reviews above, and you’ll see many of the same performance improvements — with the aforementioned exception of Optane’s low queue depth performance, which really is exceptional compared with SSDs. SSD cache drives have found limited adoption in low-end desktops and laptops, but the higher power consumption of Optane when in standby (it consumes roughly 1W compared to ~.1W for SSDs) may make it a non-starter in the mobile market. SSD prices may rise this year, so Optane caches may become more compelling, but it’s unclear there’s a great consumer performance argument here just yet. Idle power consumption. Image and data by Anandtech In and of itself, this isn’t really a problem. It’s easy to forget now, but when the first consumer SSDs began to hit the market, they didn’t exactly cover themselves in glory, either. The earliest SSDs were ludicrously expensive, tiny, and couldn’t even match spinning magnetic media on certain workloads due to poor random read/write performance. Optane clearly has data center capabilities and superior consumer performance may arrive with future generations. But as of today, we agree with Ars Technica’s Peter Bright, who writes: Rather than showcasing the new capabilities that 3D XPoint brings to the table, it simply highlights how wretched Intel’s product segmentation is. It’s at best an incremental improvement over SRT, and for the money, most people are probably going to be better off with a plain flash SSD than a hybrid disk anyway. 3D XPoint may yet turn out to be something good, perhaps even something world-changing. But this ain’t it. Not everyone calls Optane out quite that harshly — Hot Hardware allows that the caching solution “may make sense” in certain configurations, but virtually all of the review coverage agrees that limited storage options and Intel’s segmentation decisions sharply limit Optane’s addressable market. Intel’s decision to ship a test platform that prohibited the most logical comparison point to make against its own hardware also doesn’t say much for the company’s confidence in its own performance.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Preps Next-Gen Data Center Chips for "Mid-Summer" Launch Intel's banking on new chips to fuel continued growth in what is arguably its most important business segment. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 28, 2017 at 12:00PM In its most recent quarter, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported that its Data Center Group (DCG) -- the core business unit that the company is betting on for long-term growth -- delivered just 6% year-over-year revenue growth. The company had previously told investors to expect "high-single digit" revenue growth in DCG for the full year, so naturally coming in below that for the quarter (6% would qualify as "mid-single digit") isn't exactly going to inspire confidence among investors. Image source: Intel. Nevertheless, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that the company is "absolutely committing" to hitting its high-single digit revenue growth target for DCG this year (although Intel clearly overestimated DCG's growth prospects last year, significantly missing its initial growth target). Now, it's worth mentioning that Intel's relatively weak DCG growth in its most recent quarter was, per Krzanich, since the first quarter of this year was a 13-week quarter whereas the year-ago quarter had 14-weeks. "That's a couple of percent that you're competing against in a year over year basis," Krzanich said. That said, critical to Intel achieving its desired growth will be the ramp-up of its upcoming Skylake Xeon processors, which promise to deliver substantial enhancements relative to its current Broadwell-architecture products. New products can often help stimulate demand as well as potentially serve to bolster average selling prices -- both clearly key factors of revenue growth. Let's take a closer look at what Intel had to say about these chips. Skylake server coming in "mid-summer" On the company's earnings call, Krzanich said that the company is "on track for mid-summer launch of [Intel's] next generation Skylake microprocessor," claiming that the chips offer "significant performance gains across a wide range of workloads." Krzanich continued, explaining that these new Skylake-based server chips will include a technology called AVX-512 that promises to "deliver a 2X improvement in floating-point operations per clock over the current generation." Image source: Intel. The executive then went on to say that this performance uplift "will have an especially high impact on [high performance computing] and artificial intelligence workloads." In terms of fiscal impact, Krzanich said that investors should expect the volume ramp to happen in the second half of 2017 (which clearly makes sense if the product achieves "general availability" in the middle of summer, corresponding roughly to July). Let's talk margins On the call, analyst Stacy Rasgon noted that the company's operating margin percentage in DCG was just 35%. He then asked management to give its view on the DCG margin trajectory over the course of 2017 "as the Skylake parts ramp." Rasgon also asked management if it believes that DCG will "be within the Data Center margin targets that [management] provided at the analyst day." Intel CFO Robert Swan went on to say that the company's revenue growth expectation for the year continues to be "high single digit" and that it expects to be "at the lower end of that range of the 40% to 45%" (he's referring to the company's stated target DCG operating margin percentage range). Swan also indicated that he expects DCG average selling prices to "improve as we go throughout the year," which suggests that the Skylake Server processor ramp should help drive improved average selling prices. The executive also said that he expects product manufacturing costs to improve as well, presumably as the company's 14-nanometer manufacturing yields continue to improve.

(Courtesy of Cloudera) By Marisa Kendall | mkendall@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: April 28, 2017 at 8:06 am | UPDATED: April 28, 2017 at 6:42 pm Shares of Palo Alto-based Cloudera spiked more than 20 percent in the company’s public market debut Friday, marking the latest in a string of local enterprise software IPOs to see healthy day-one pops. Related Articles Palo Alto startup Cloudera files for $200 million IPO Silicon Valley startups follow Snap to the public market Snap IPO: Shares soar in first day of trading The man behind 2016’s biggest U.S. tech IPO shares how the deal went down Cloudera closed at $18.10 Friday, above the $15 IPO price set the evening before. But some of the excitement that performance should have caused was tempered because Cloudera ended the day worth about $2.3 billion — a far cry from the $4.1 billion valuation it last received as a private company. For investors hoping to see the IPO market rebound after a sluggish 2016, Cloudera’s down round has a silver lining. It’s encouraging that Cloudera accepted the discount and priced an IPO anyway, said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director of research at private securities investment platform SharesPost. “It’s a healthy sign that another ‘unicorn’ is going public,” he said. Cloudera, which provides an open source data analysis platform to other companies, raised $225 million with its initial public offering Thursday, making the deal the largest enterprise tech IPO of the year, Kulkarni said. The company follows San Francisco-based cloud startups Okta and Mulesoft into the public market, both of which saw healthy first-day pops when they started trading earlier this year. The uptick in activity, which kicked off with Snap’s $3.4 billion IPO last month, comes on the heels of a year that saw deal volume slow to a trickle. But the market appears to be turning around. So far 45 IPOs have priced this year — nearly three times as many as at this point last year, according to Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. Cloudera shares opened at $17.87 Friday morning, spiking to a high of $19.31 before coming back down. The company offered 15 million shares, pricing them above the $12-$14 range it had targeted earlier this month. Cloudera is trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CLDR. Intel paid $31 per share for Cloudera stock in 2014 — a deal that valued the company at $4.1 billion during a time when cash was pouring into startups and valuations were skyrocketing. Now some companies, including Cloudera, have to take a haircut to bring those valuations back down to a more realistic level, Kulkarni said. Roughly one in six VC-backed tech IPOs — including Square and Box in 2015 — value the company below what it was worth in its last round of private financing, Kulkarni said. “A down round isn’t the end of the world,” he said. The real test, Kulkarni added, is how Cloudera performs in the next three to five years. Intel also views Cloudera as a strategic partner, which means the larger company may have attributed added worth to its 2014 investment, driving Cloudera’s valuation higher than what it might otherwise have been. Given that relationship, Cloudera co-founder and chief strategy officer Mike Olson said that 2014 number shouldn’t be used as a benchmark. Olson said Cloudera’s investors are “quite happy” with Friday’s valuation. So is the company, he said. “We’re all really pleased with how the stock performed and how the market valued the business,” he said. “It was a great day.” Intel poured $766.5 million into the company as of Jan. 31, and after the IPO was expected to control more than 19 percent of Cloudera’s stock. Like many tech startups going public, Cloudera is not profitable. The company brought in $261 million in revenue in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, up 57 percent from $166 million the year before, according to documents the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for its IPO. The company’s net losses were $187.3 million last fiscal year, and $203.1 million the year before. Cloudera shared the spotlight Friday with Arizona-based online used car seller Carvana, which also raised $225 million in its IPO Thursday, and had the honor of ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday morning. But Cloudera had the last laugh. Carvana was trading 26 percent below its IPO price when the market closed Friday afternoon.

Microsoft has a lot to answer for in the world of cheap laptops. I’m not convinced Windows 10, as it stands, is fit for the realities of budget netbooks. The likes of Google’s basic but ever-improving Chrome OS and the wonderful (and free) world of Linux are looking ever more attractive and, so far, Microsoft hasn’t come up with an answer. Both these operating systems are just about fit for a dual-core, bottom-of-the-range Intel Celeron, but I don’t think the same can be said of Windows. Windows 10 Cloud, which has been making its way through the rumour mill for several months, seems like Microsoft’s best chance of not losing out completely in an area in which it really needs to be present. The most recent news points to specs advice on so-called 'Cloudbooks', asking for quick boot times, Intel Celeron processors, and 4GB of memory. Related: Best laptops for students But it’s about more than just hardware. The success of these machines depends what form the operating system takes, and recently, there have been two vital decisions from Microsoft that could determine whether Windows is what budget laptop buyers are looking for. First, Microsoft has done a huge amount of work in improving the much-maligned 'Modern' apps of Windows 8, and having launched the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) for developers, there's progress being made in lightweight apps that can be kept in check in terms of security and permissions. Second, Microsoft has committed itself to being compatible with ARM-based processors as well as x86-based chips, which are currently the norm. This opens the door to laptops powered by cheaper, more power-efficient chips that run on hardware designed by ARM. Intel, by far the biggest player in the world of computer chips, has said it will also start working on chips that are based on ARM designs. Microsoft is even creating an x86 emulator that can run applications on ARM processors. Related: Best browser These two crucial developments open the door to my ideal vision of Windows 10 Cloud: essentially a lightweight OS with UWP apps and nothing else. Incorporate the Edge web browser, Office365 applications (for a subscription), and get enough big players such as Spotify, Netflix, and Amazon on board and you have a very attractive Chromebook alternative. With only UWP apps allowed, and their permissions and performance strictly limited, Microsoft should be able to dial down all those background processes that bog down ultra-cheap laptops running full-fat Windows 10. Oh, and it needs to be much cheaper to licence. A chunk of the cost of any new Windows laptop is the price of Windows itself. Ditch a bit of that with the knowledge that you’ll see more units, and I think it’s a genuinely great idea. Related: Acer Chromebook 14 review This all sounds simple, and you won’t be surprised to hear this isn’t an original idea. In fact, Microsoft has already done this in some form twice in recent years – first in 2012 with the ARM-compatible Windows RT. Horrible name, bad execution. The market wasn’t ready for it and only a handful of devices ever launched. Second with Windows 10 Continuum – Microsoft literally built Windows 10 into its Lumia handsets, as did HP, but it was slow and, more importantly, nobody seemed to care. It’s all gone very quiet since. This is Microsoft’s best chance to catch up with Google Chromebooks, and I hope it delivers at its event scheduled for May 2. Can Microsoft catch up to Google's Chomebooks?

Intel (NASDAQ: INTC 36.15 -3.42%)’s quarterly results for the first quarter of 2017 are out and saw the company beat analyst expectations as far as EPS go, but missed the mark on revenue. Analysts consensus for the (non-GAAP) EPS was 65 cents and the company posted an EPS of 61 cents on a GAAP basis and 66 cents on a non-GAAP basis respectively. Revenue for the quarter was $14.80 Billion, which was just shy of the $14.81 Billion expectation of the consensus. Before we break down the performance of the company, lets go over the financial summary: Delivered year-over-year revenue growth, up 8 percent on a GAAP basis and 7 percent on a non-GAAP basis, and record first-quarter revenue Growth businesses collectively grew double digits year-over-year; the memory business had record quarterly revenue and shipped first Intel® Optane™ products Operating income was up 40 percent year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 20 percent on a non-GAAP basis and EPS was up 45 percent year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 22 percent on a non-GAAP basis, driven by higher platform average selling prices and lower platform unit cost Full-year outlook for revenue was raised $500 million and EPS was raised by 5 cents to $2.85 Our Take On Intel (NASDAQ: INTC 36.15 -3.42%) – Is no one going to talk about the Ryzen elephant in the room? Disclaimer: I own no stock in Intel and/or competing companies and have no plans to do so for the foreseeable future. The analysis and forecasts given here are provided “as is”. The star of Intel’s earnings is its accelerating, Non-Volatile Memory Group which saw an impressive growth of 55% year over year. On a quarterly basis, Intel saw the majority of its segments go down as seasonality and cyclicality kicked in with the backdrop of a red-shifting PC market. With the acquisitions the company has made last year, it is clear that the company wants to diversify away from the PC market and head on to hitherto unexplored avenues – like the blossoming autonomous vehicle industry. “The first quarter was another record quarter, coming off a record 2016. We continued to grow our company, shipped our disruptive new Optane memory technology, and positioned Intel to lead in new areas like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO. “The ASP strength we saw across nearly every segment of the business demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data.” It has been a more or less reasonable quarter for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC 36.15 -3.42%) all things considered, and the company expects things to stay on track well into this year. Here is a summary breakdown of all the major trends for Intel this past few months: The company also entered its first revenue quarter for Optane memory. Intel has previously revealed (in their quarterly earnings webcast) that they were shipping 3D NAND from our Fab 68 and had qualified the first 3D XPoint base Optane SSDs, which were expected to ship for revenue in the first quarter. The DX P4800X is the realization of this statement and means that indeed, Intel has entered the first revenue quarter for this platform. Intel has also previously stated that they expect less than 10% of their Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group to be driven by 3D XPoint products. In the same earnings call they had also mentioned that their 3D XPoint memory DIMM will be shipped as sample to data center customers at the same time, so we assume that that is something that has already happened as well. As far as disruption goes, yes it is a disruptive technology but the very high cost associated with it means it wont be adopted in volume any time soon. Intel also made the decision to diversify away from its core business to a very significant extent with the acquisition of Mobileye for $15.3 Billion. Mobileye currently accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year.On paper, the deal looks good, the market for autonomous vehicles is clearly a race Intel wants to get into and analysts have commented that this might be a fair price for something that is “key technology” to break into this sector. So the question then becomes, is Mobileye worth $15.3 Billion? Advertisement The answer to that question is multi faceted and I would suggest reading our detailed analysis of the Mobileye acquisition. One thing is very clear however: Mobileye in its current state and function does not appear to be wholly capable of matching Nvidia (the major Self Driving technology competitor) in either capability or performance and will quickly be far outstripped by the fast paced chip-maker if it does not change its current fixed function philosophy. That said, Mobileye would have been a very good buy just for the IP it offers at a significantly lower premium. At the current pricing, it is priced more like the on-paper specs of the company (70% market share) without accounting for the severe risks it faces going forwards from new but powerful entrants like Nvidia Corporation. To justify its purchase, Intel must seek to broaden the vision of Mobileye and offer a truly integrative approach that matches the one provided by Nvidia. Here is the catch though: There is one major variable that has now changed, which no one seems to be talking about. Most of the analysts are focused on Intel’s acquisitions and the shrinking PC market, but all of that is secondary compared to the Ryzen threat that Intel faces right now. Intel has enjoyed a completely free run of the x86 market for quite a few years now. And this year, AMD is back in the game, with its Ryzen processors, chasing that delicious price point advantage that it has always exploited – and it looks like its succeeding. Anecdotal evidence based on our in-house polls in which thousands of readers took part showed that more than 60% of consumers aiming to upgrade their systems this year were going for a Ryzen processor. This is in sharp contrast to just a few year ago, where the vast majority of users would have no option but to opt for an Intel processor. And the most alarming part of this is that Intel does not appear to be responding in any rational fashion. There were no major price cuts, to make their lineup more competitive against Ryzen, and it seems to still be going for its standard policy to ignore AMD. Something, which will no longer work. So while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC 36.15 -3.42%)’s fundamentals remain as strong as ever (it still easily maintains its process leads of a couple of years over other foundries) it is turning an absolute blind eye to the first real competition in many years – something that could cost it a significant portion of its PC segment revenue if it is not careful.

Intel (NASDAQ: INTC 36.15 -3.42%) Q2 2017 Guidance The divestiture of Intel Security Group includes a gain of roughly $375 million and tax related impact on a GAAP basis. The tax basis in the net assets transferred in the McAfee Security transaction was lower than our GAAP basis, resulting in a larger tax liability than our GAAP gain. We excluded these impact on a non-GAAP basis. Revenue is expected to be $14.4B, plus or minus $500 million in the second quarter. Excluding Intel Security Group, this is up 11% on a year-on-year basis. GAAP gross margin in the second quarter is expected to be 62%, plus or minus a couple of points, flat to the first quarter. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.53 plus or minus 5 cents. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.68 plus or minus 5 cents. This is up 15% on a year-on-year basis Non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter is expected to be 63%, plus or minus a couple of points, flat to the first quarter. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin are primarily driven by lower platform* unit cost and offset by higher factory start-up costs. Spending for R&D and MG&A in the second quarter is expected to be approximately $5.2B.     Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Related The Official WCCF Hardware Polls 2017 Apr 23, 2017 11 Intel Kaby Lake-G Processors To Pack Fast Discrete GPU and HBM2 Memory – Will Utilize Multi-Die Package Design Apr 3, 2017 44 Analysis: Intel Agrees To Buy Mobileye, Is The Company Worth $15.3 Billion?

The Sooner Intel, created by Bob Przybylo in 2011, is an inside look into Oklahoma football and basketball recruiting and is solely for Sooners Illustrated subscribers. It is a sneak peek into what’s happening with OU recruiting and is not to be distributed anywhere else. Can’t be down in the dumps. Can’t be woe is me. All you can do is pick up the pieces and move on when you don’t catch recruiting breaks. The Sooners are attempting to do just that. It looked like April would be a great month for OU, but it went the opposite direction. Three targets who visited for the spring game ended up committing elsewhere and the quarterback commit has flipped his allegiances in the Red River Rivalry. http://www.scout.com/player/209431-patrick-fields?s=73 Everybody has sources. Team sources. High school sources. But sometimes nobody knows the pulse of what’s going on than the kids themselves. They know what’s up. When asking about that for OU’s 2018 class, it’s all about Tulsa (Okla.) Union’s Patrick Fields. A high three-star commit, Fields is the social media face of #SavageTeam2K18 and was able to give some insight as to what has gone down. http://www.scout.com/player/200616-bryce-bray?s=73 Bixby OL Bryce Bray (committed to Oklahoma State) Recruiting writers were surprised by this one, but Fields wasn’t. Fields said he talked to Bray at a track meet during the spring and could get a feel that Bray wasn’t about the Sooners. He was going to be a Cowboy. Bray grew up an OU fan, but it was OSU who offered first. The Cowboys also have signee Brendon Evers, a former teammate of Bray’s at Bixby. http://www.scout.com/player/203260-josh-proctor?s=73 Owasso S Josh Proctor (committed to Ohio State) This one hurt. Two weeks later, and you can still feel the sting in Fields’ voice when bringing up this recruitment. Proctor was at OU’s spring game, and Fields said Proctor was all-OU and was talking about committing and just waiting for the right time. It came as a huge shock to Fields the following Saturday when Proctor committed to the Buckeyes. Fields said there is still time to put in that work and try to convince him otherwise. http://www.scout.com/player/212850-ron-tatum?s=73 OKC Putnam City DE Ron Tatum (committed to Texas) Right there with Proctor. Fields said Tatum had been as adamant about committing to OU than anybody when at the spring game. Fields said he could start to see the tide turning Monday and then heading into Tuesday when Tatum stopped responding in the group messages. Fields never heard from Tatum on Wednesday but assumed Tatum was headed to the Longhorns. Like Proctor, Fields said it’s up to OU and guys like himself to show Tatum why Norman is the right spot. http://www.scout.com/player/203152-cameron-rising?s=73 Newbury Park (Calif.) High QB Cameron Rising (flipped to Texas) Fields said the in-state guys were always a little skeptical about Rising just because he was from California and didn’t have the local ties. Fields said Rising acted like he was all-in with OU when at the spring game. But Fields could tell something was up when Rising stopped answering in the group messages as well. The interesting part about the Rising/Casey Thompson dilemma seems to be a lot of people coming out of the woodwork saying this was just a miscalculation by offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley. Rising jumped first so he got the nod back in August, but multiple in-state recruits and coaching sources believe 100 percent if Riley would have waited it out, Thompson would be committed to OU and the Sooners would be in the process of sweeping the in-state offers. The prevailing thought in speaking with multiple in-state recruits and coaches is that Thompson commands the respect of the state and everybody would have come along with him. Now besides the whole hindsight is 20/20 argument, the one thing nobody could predict is if/when Thompson would have committed to OU. Waiting can be a very dangerous game in recruiting, especially at quarterback. It’s an interesting thing to consider. Riley gave them the choice, let them know the score, and Rising jumped. Can second-guess it until you’re blue in the face, but it was a fair proposition. Thompson had every right to wait. Riley had every right to not wait. But now? Well, it’s Riley having to pick up the pieces. Thompson, Rising and Tatum are all currently riding with the Longhorns. Fields is a good person to talk with concerning this because Texas was a legit choice and the Longhorns were in his final three. Fields isn’t all aboard the train with Tom Herman yet and said his image of Texas wasn’t as positive as the ones being portrayed now by recruits. “When I visited, it felt like the Texas priorities were the Texas guys,” Fields said. “When Ron visited, he was by himself. I think it gave him a greater image of Texas.” You can spend all day trying to decipher what has led to Texas’ momentum within the state. Complacency by OU? Herman’s infectious energy? Any combination of those or other things could point toward it. But it’s a put a dent on the in-state crop. Fields said once upon a time there was a group message of Fields, Proctor, Tatum, Jordan Kelley and Jalen Redmond. The trend was all of them were going to be Sooners. Heck, they were all together at OU’s spring game three weeks ago, giving off that vibe. Now? Proctor’s a Buckeye. Tatum’s a Longhorn. Redmond is undecided. Fields and Kelley are the in-state Sooners to go with Moore Southmoore five-star offensive tackle Brey Walker.  “Me and Jordan, personally, we take a lot of pride in going to OU,” Fields said. “This is our home state, and want to bring a national championship to OU. We’ve been through it all. The good times, the bad times, we’re living our dreams out together.” http://www.scout.com/player/207850-jalen-redmond?s=73 Redmond is someone OU is still hoping for. A Scout 300 prospect in his own right, Redmond has been busy visiting TCU, Nebraska and Kansas State in the last month. He said he plans on narrowing things down soon. Redmond was at Tatum’s announcement, decked out in OU gear. Really, whenever you see Redmond, you see OU, according to Fields. “I know his mom loves OU,” Fields said. “We just have to keep trying.” Fields has embraced being the face of #ST2K18, and obviously the coaches have as well. Fields said assistant coach like Calvin Thibodeaux and Lincoln Riley have been among the OU staff members to ask Fields to reach out to certain recruits. http://www.scout.com/player/198166-t-j-pledger?s=73 Fields won’t have to do it alone for much longer, it seems. Fields said Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy running back T.J. Pledger is starting to get a lot more involved, especially after last week. “He’s pretty cool,” Fields said. “He’s saying there’s nothing to worry about. To not even trip and just sit back and relax. “He’s an IMG kid so he has the respect there and has been talking to kids there. But he’s from Cali so he has a lot of respect with kids out there, too.” That first sign came earlier this week with Pledger tweeting Thompson about staying home and staying true to your city. It’s an overstatement to say this class is at a crossroads. It’s clearly not going to be as smooth as #SoonerSquad17, but the wakeup call has been heeded. #SavageTeam2K18 won’t fall apart, said Fields, but it is going to get stronger.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Patrick Fields rolls on as OU's face of 2018 Sooners take spotlight at NFL Draft Juco guard Ty Lazenby officially a Sooner Przybylo podcast: NFL Draft to be kind to OU Best Available Players Headed into 2nd Round Share & Embed Joe Mixon selected by Bengals Full Story Sooners Illustrated Top Stories Joe Mixon selected by BengalsFormer OU running back Joe Mixon comes off the NFL Draft board, selected by the Cincinnati Bengals. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 5:25 PM Breaking News Miguel Edwards commits to SoonersOU is back on the commitment board with high 3-star cornerback Miguel Edwards. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 1:32 PM Patrick Fields rolls on as OU's face of 2018Rough patch in recruiting not slowing down Patrick Fields as OU's face of the 2018 class. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedThursday at 9:45 AM Juco guard Ty Lazenby officially a SoonerFrom relative unknown to a Sooner, the journey continues for juco guard Ty Lazenby. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedThursday at 8:14 AM Sooners take spotlight at NFL DraftOU is ready to hear its name called multiple times this weekend with the NFL Draft. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedThursday at 7:53 AM OU's spring breakout starsSooners Illustrated takes a look at the five breakout stars from OU's spring. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedTuesday at 7:10 AM Breaking News Nation's 60th-Ranked CB Finds Home in Big 12Miguel Edwards, the nation's 60th-ranked cornerback, just committed to the Oklahoma Sooners while visiting campus. by Corey Bender Scout FootballYesterday at 1:31 PM CB Boykin Has One Must-See School CLIFTON, Va. -- Noah Boykin, the No. 5 cornerback in the East, is looking heavily at schools from the ACC, Big Ten and Big 12. by Brian Dohn Scout FootballYesterday at 4:30 AM Przybylo podcast: NFL Draft to be kind to OUThe BoneMan Show returns saying OU routinely flexes its recruiting muscles at the NFL Draft and will again this year. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedThursday at 4:33 PM Video: D.J.

Intel’s reported quarterly earnings appear lower than expected estimates, due to a reduction in the growth of its data centre business. The chipmaker and technology company reported its revenue for its data centre in Q1, which rose up by six percent to $4.2 billion. This shows a decrease from the nine percent in 2016 and the eight percent increase that was reported in Q4. The decrease can be seen from the change in businesses going to Intel for chips compared to last year. For example Microsoft, who for years were loyal customers of Intel, recently announced its switch to ARM chips. Microsoft’s move alone could prove to be a huge impact on Intel’s revenue, as its dominance of the chip market in cloud data centres comes to slowdown based on Microsoft’s cloud data centre footprint. According to CNBC, at an investor meeting in February, Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich said that it was expected that there will be lower profit margins for the data centre business. Read more: Microsoft commits to using ARM server chips in challenge to Intel’s data centre dominance In the earnings conference call, Krzanich said that the first quarter “tends to be the lowest quarter in general… for overall revenue and output and growth in the data centre business.” Intel has previously announced its plan to buy autonomous vehicle technology from Mobileye NV, with expectations that the acquisition will boost the company’s profit. This acquisition is expected to boost Intel in the market as it develops systems for autonomous cars, and paired with its focus on cloud computing it is also likely to help Intel reduce its dependence on the PC market, as this currently being where the company receives most its revenue from. Its revenue for the Internet of Things group of $721 million, showing an increase of 11 percent from the last quarter. Bob Swan, CFO, Intel said: “In the first quarter, we achieved growth across the business and increased capital returns with a five percent dividend raise while investing for future growth. “We’re off to a good start and raised our outlook for the year as we also look to further improve Intel’s operating efficiency.” Tags Chips Homepage News List Intel Market Revenue Previous ArticleICO Fines to explode under GDPR Next ArticleGoogle and Facebook confirmed as victims of $100m phishing scam Most read Hackers turn political saboteurs as cracks in the cloud signal a new frontier for cyber crime Ellie Burns 26th April 2017 IBM brings cognitive assistant to factory for cutting down inspection time Byomakesh Biswal 25th April 2017 Oracle, the newest tech startup?

We’re now on day 3 of our 20 day celebration of AnandTech’s 20th anniversary. After yesterday’s HTC U Ultra giveaway, today we’re back to PC parts, courtesy of Intel. For today’s giveaway the 800lb gorilla has contributed a true silicon sampler, sending us CPUs, SSDs, and even some Optane Memory cache drives to give away to you. 2x Intel Core i7-7700K 2x Intel SSD 600p 512GB 2x Intel Optane Memory 32GB The AnandTech 20th Anniversary - Intel Giveaway Intel Core i7-7700K First up, Intel’s Core i7-7700K needs no introduction. Intel’s flagship consumer CPU is still the chip to beat for all but the most heavily threaded workloads, thanks to the high IPC of Intel’s architecture combined with the equally high clockspeeds afforded by Kaby Lake. The i7-7700K will turbo boost to 4.5GHz, and as this is an unlocked processor, you can should must always overclock it even further. Core i7-7700K Specifications   Cores/ Threads Base/ Turbo IGP L3 TDP i7-7700K 4/8 4.2/4.5 HD 630 8 MB 91 W As a reminder, retail box i7-7700Ks do not include a cooler, so along with a compatible motherboard you'll need a 3rd party cooler as well to complete the ensemble. Intel SSD 600p 512GB Second on our list of prizes is a pair of Intel 512GB 600p SSDs. The 600p is from Intel’s mainstream SSD family, combining an Intel-customized Silicon Motion SM2260 controller with Intel/Micron’s own 3D TLC NAND. These are single-sided M.2 2280 drives, so they’ll fit in virtually all M.2-equipped motherboards and laptops. And as one of what’s still a relatively small number of NVMe-capable PCIe 3.0 x4 drives on the market, the 512GB 600p can easily sustain reads over several-hundred megabytes-per-second. Intel SSD 600p 512GB Specifications Form Factor single-sided M.2 2280 Controller Intel-customized Silicon Motion SM2260 Interface PCIe 3.0 x4 NAND Intel 384Gb 32-layer 3D TLC SLC Cache Size 17.5 GB Sequential Read 1775 MB/s Sequential Write (SLC Cache) 560 MB/s 4KB Random Read (QD32) 128.5k IOPS 4KB Random Write (QD32) 128k IOPS Endurance 288 TBW Warranty 5 years As Billy Tallis noted in our review of the drive, the 600p “offer[s] peak performance that is as high as promised” but do bear in mind that these are drives meant for consumer systems. So best not to try running your database server off of one. Intel Optane Memory 32GB Finally, we have a pair of Intel’s recently-released Optane Memory cache drives. Built using Intel’s newly-developed next-generation 3D XPoint memory technology, Intel has opted to start the consumer rollout of the technology by building cache drives, which maps well to the higher endurance and higher serial performance of 3D XPoint. Intel Optane Memory Specifications Capacity 32 GB Form Factor M.2 2280 B+M key Interface PCIe 3.0 x2 Protocol NVMe 1.1 Controller Intel Memory 128Gb 20nm Intel 3D XPoint Sequential Read 1350 MB/s Sequential Write 290 MB/s Random Read 240k IOPS Random Write 65k IOPS Read Latency 9 µs Write Latency 30 µs Active Power 3.5 W Idle Power 1 W Endurance 182.5 TB Warranty 5 years It’s important to note that to take full advantage of these drives, you will need a Kaby Lake Core-series processor and a supported chipset, as that’s the only platform to support Intel’s full Optane cache mode. Otherwise the drives can be used in some other systems, but they’d only show up as a small 32GB NVMe drive. According to our resident SSD-sommelier, Billy Tallis, these drives tend to be best paired with something like a Core i3 processor in a lower-end system, to transparently speed up performance on a HDD boot volume. Finally, as with our other giveaways, today’s giveaway is only open for 48 hours, so be sure to enter soon. However please note that for legal reasons, we’re only able to open these giveaways to residents of the United States. Good luck to everyone! And be sure to check in Monday for our next giveaway.

Data Center Group revenue driven by the growth in cloud computing services was also up 6% year-on-year to $4.2bn, but down almost 12% on the previous quarter. Intel is slowly building its internet of things (IoT) group, which reported revenue of $721m, an increase of 11% compared with the first quarter of 2016, but down 0.68% on the previous quarter. IoT is part of Intel’s strategy to reduce its dependence on the PC market, which has seen a worldwide downturn with the proliferation of mobile devices. Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue of $866m was up 55% year-on-year and up 6% on the previous quarter, while Programmable Solutions Group revenue was up 18% year-on-year to $425m and up 1.2% on the previous quarter.

Despite growth in Intel’s key datacentre and IoT businesses, investors remain concerned by falls in its core PC chip business amid market declines. Intel adds to previous strategic investments in drone technology to bolster its competitive position in the drone chip market. Computer chip maker Intel posts stronger-than-expected third-quarter financial results, indicating a recovery from the effects of the economic downturn. Intel Security Group reported revenue of $534m, down 1% compared with the same period a year ago and down almost 3% on the previous quarter. The group was spun out as an independent security firm under the McAfee banner in April, but Intel retains a 49% stake in the new business. Looking towards the next quarter, Intel is forecasting revenues of $14.4bn, plus or minus $500m. “In the first quarter, we achieved growth across the business and increased capital returns with a 5% dividend raise while investing for future growth,” said Intel CFO Bob Swan. “We are off to a good start and have raised our outlook for the year as we also look to further improve Intel’s operating efficiency.” CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Is it right for Microsoft to abandon its longstanding commitment to support Windows versions for 10 years after their release, regardless of the hardware they run on? By Nick Heath | April 28, 2017, 3:36 AM PST Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Microsoft insists that withdrawing support from machines running Windows 7 on newer hardware will lead to a better Windows in the long run. Image: TechRepublic Is Microsoft artificially blocking newer PCs running Windows 7 and 8.1 from receiving updates? The consensus is 'yes', but opinions on Microsoft's reasons for doing so range from 'protecting users' to 'forcing upgrades to Windows 10'. The block has even prompted some users to call for a class-action lawsuit against Microsoft, for cutting off updates to Windows 8.1 "eight months before the end of mainstream support". In March, Microsoft began blocking updates on Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs running on newer Intel and AMD processors, but debate over why Microsoft was doing so was reignited by an unofficial patch last week. The workaround allows users of Windows 7 and 8.1 on newer machines to continue receiving updates, by evading a Windows check to detect which generation of CPU the PC is using. For some, the fact the block could be circumvented reinforces the argument that Microsoft has decided to cut off updates, rather than being forced to do so for technical reasons. "Are Microsoft artificially blocking updates for new PCs? I would say most definitely," said Roy Castleman, owner of London-based Prosyn, which provides IT support for organizations of all sizes. Suspicions of Microsoft's motives for blocking the update have been compounded by the firm's recommendation that those affected should upgrade to Windows 10. "I believe that Microsoft is struggling to convince people that the constant upgrade and change of OSes is a requirement. Let's face it, while the multiple features that Windows 10 provides are useful in the home environment, most companies do not need any of these new features," said Castleman. Microsoft maintains that businesses are switching to Windows 10 at a faster rate than Windows 7, driven by security enhancements such as Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection's ability to detect and respond to network attacks. This claim gained some support from analyst house Gartner, which found that 85 percent of the 1,000 businesses it surveyed are planning to upgrade this year, with security enhancements the biggest motivating factor. However, the move to block updates is contentious, because a number of businesses rely on software that is not supported by newer operating systems, or are already set up to support Windows 7, making the upgrade to Windows 10 a difficult proposition.

Read more "The forced changes to a new OS are costly. They take time to train staff and they decrease productivity for a period," said Castleman. For businesses that can't upgrade, Microsoft has released a list of new Intel Skylake PCs that companies can buy, which will continue to get updates for Windows 7 and 8.1. Initially, Microsoft said Windows 7 and 8.1 systems running on Skylake processors also wouldn't receive updates, but later backtracked, citing the need to give business more time to upgrade. SEE: Windows 10: The smart person's guide The block now only affects PCs running on Intel Kaby Lake, AMD Ryzen Bristol Ridge, Qualcomm 8996 or newer processors. Gartner research VP Steve Kleynhans points out that Microsoft never said the latest Windows updates wouldn't work on Windows 7/8.1 systems running on newer processors, so a third party re-enabling updates on these systems is not surprising. "Of course the block is artificial, but it is pre-emptive. The issue is that Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are unsupported with the new processors, not that they don't work," he said. "As Microsoft creates new fixes for Windows 7 and 8.1 it won't be testing them on those processors. Just because it works right now doesn't mean it will keep working with future fixes. "Could Microsoft keep it working? Yes, but Windows 7 is already out of mainstream support, and Windows 8.1 has really small market penetration in enterprises. "Microsoft doesn't want to divert the resources it would take to properly test out all the variations that would exist away from more important areas." The rationale for no longer testing old OSes on newer hardware is that it is becoming increasingly complicated to do so, according to Microsoft. "Windows 7 was designed nearly 10 years ago before any x86/x64 SOCs existed," Terry Myerson, EVP of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, said in a blogpost last year. "For Windows 7 to run on any modern silicon, device drivers and firmware need to emulate Windows 7's expectations for interrupt processing, bus support, and power states, which is challenging for Wi-Fi, graphics, security, and more." Gartner's Kleynhans has sympathy with the argument that the complexity of continuing to support these processors in older systems is becoming untenable. "New processors today contain much more of the total logic that makes up a PC. They are much more integrated. "There are a ton of drivers associated with the processor, in particular around UEFI and boot-loading processes, and the whole thing is kind of a jenga tower just waiting to collapse." The issue that vexes some Windows users is whether Microsoft has the right to abandon its longstanding commitment to support Windows for 10 years after release, regardless of the hardware it runs on. Questioning how support can be removed before the end of either mainstream or extended support for Windows 8.1, GitHub user Levicki said: "I have read the Software License Agreement and nowhere does it say that they have the right to revoke support earlier like this. "All this is setting a very bad precedent in software and hardware industry, and I really hope some lawyer will pick this up and start a class action. All three vendors deserve to be crucified for this." Microsoft insists that the move to withdraw support, first flagged up in January 2016, will lead to a better Windows in the long run. "As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support," said a Microsoft spokesperson. "This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon."

This figure represents year on year revenue growth of 8 per cent. The extra revenue helped Intel boost its operating income by 40 per cent (20 percent on a non-GAAP basis). Overall, the chipmaker enjoyed revenue growth across all key business areas except for Security. Intel's Client Computing Group, responsible for its PC chips, did very well, raking in $8.0 billion, up 6 per cent. However the star of the show this quarter was Intel's Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group which generated revenue of $866 million, up 55 percent. "The first quarter was another record quarter, coming off a record 2016. We continued to grow our company, shipped our disruptive new Optane memory technology, and positioned Intel to lead in new areas like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving," said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO. "The ASP strength we saw across nearly every segment of the business demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data." Let's look more closely at the PC components we follow most closely here on HEXUS. The ASPs (average selling prices) were very important to Intel's Client Computing Group revenue growth this quarter. Intel actually saw a 4 per cent decline in platform volumes (CPUs and motherboard chipsets) but average selling prices were 7 per cent up this year. The positive ASP performance was skewed towards laptops. It's easy to see that at $8.0 billion, the Client Computing Group still brings in the lion's share of revenue for Intel. The second highest earner for Intel is its Data Centre Group. It brought in $4.2 billion in Q1 2017, up 6 per cent year on year. We can also see from the figures that Intel has experienced double digit revenue growth in its Internet of Things Group, Programmable Solutions Group, and Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group businesses. Remember that latter business group enjoyed revenue browth of 55 per cent - that's all down to the recent launch and shipment of Optane memory products.

Continue Reading Below Alphabet on Thursday said net profit in the latest period grew 29%, with no indications yet of an impact from a backlash that began late in the quarter from advertisers worried about their brands appearing near objectionable content online. Amazon, meanwhile, said first-quarter profit jumped 41%, marking its eighth straight quarter in the black, even as it continues to pour investment into expansion in new areas. Amazon's longest earnings streak since 2012 affirmed confidence among investors -- who had already driven its shares up 53% in the past year -- that Amazon has turned into a profit machine as well as a growth machine. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said success in its core operations is helping it expand in other areas. "The strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams," she said. Strong results from Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. provided further evidence that technology's juggernauts have nurtured businesses they helped found, such as cloud computing, e-commerce and online advertising, into full industries. Still, the industry is entering a time period of heavier investments as autonomous vehicles, drones and robots take off, which analysts warn could consume more capital resources. And the increasingly prominent position the tech giants occupy in society as well as in business exposes them to new kinds of risks, such as the broadcasting of violent episodes on Facebook Inc.'s live video tool. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT A fuller picture of the tech industry's health will come next week when Apple Inc. and Facebook report quarterly results. Amazon and Alphabet's stocks hit new highs in after-hours trading. The boost to Alphabet's market cap was about $25 billion -- equivalent to the value of Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, the mobile messaging service that went public last month. "They're becoming bigger and bigger and their growth rates are unchanged, " said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, noting that Alphabet has increased revenue in its core segment by at least 20% every quarter for seven straight years and Amazon has done the same for over four years. Google credited its growth to the strength of its advertising business on mobile phones and on its YouTube video site. It seemed to avert a crisis when advertisers discovered in recent weeks that their brands appeared alongside offensive content on YouTube. Major companies including Coca-Cola Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. pulled their ad spending from Google except for targeted search ads. That boycott didn't dent Google's growth: Advertising revenue jumped 19% in the first quarter to $21.4 billion. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, said the company had done "thousands and thousands of calls" with advertisers to address the issue, pointing to new "safeguards" to address their concerns. The impact of the protest could be felt more in the second quarter, if it picks up steam. In recent years, Google's growth engine has shifted from its traditional search advertising on desktop computers to mobile advertising, YouTube and automated ad-buying systems. The number of paid clicks on Google's ads soared 44% in the first quarter compared with the year-ago period, benefiting from rising mobile-first internet usage. Google has come to dominate the online advertising market along with Facebook. The digital giants accounted for an estimated 77% of the U.S. online advertising market in 2016, up from 72% the year before, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, analyzing data published by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. Google and Facebook captured 99% of the online ad industry's revenue growth in 2016, estimated Mr. Wieser. On balance the rest of the industry was flat. The question plaguing Amazon was whether the online retail giant could sustain its growth despite substantial spending on everything from international expansion to video content. Amazon has long plowed most of its revenue back into product development and operations, including massive warehouses to speed products to customers. In recent periods Amazon has shown some spending discipline while it expands its operations overseas, bolsters its shipping infrastructure and broadens its library of movies and shows. Analysts expect the phase to last at least through mid-2018, in part due to Amazon's promise to hire 130,000 U.S. workers during that time frame. A big piece of that spending is coming in international markets like Mexico and India, where the company is building out its Prime offerings and competing against heavily entrenched incumbents. The international business has been stuck in the red in recent quarters. That remained the case in the first quarter, as the division reported an operating loss of $481 million. Sales increased 15.6% to $11.06 billion. Amazon's financial chief, Brian Olsavsky, said the company is boosting investments in a number of areas, including in video content, its Echo personal-assistant speakers and its Prime subscription program. Amazon is also investing heavily in warehouses due to strong growth for its business fulfilling orders for sellers on its site. "We're continuing to look for things that customers love, that can grow to be large, that we think will provide strong financial returns in the long run, and that also can last for decades," Mr. Olsavsky said. One of those areas is transportation. The retail giant has also started laying the groundwork for its own shipping business to add capacity for itself, with the grander ambition of one day hauling and delivering packages for itself, other retailers and consumers, according to people familiar with the matter. In the first quarter, Amazon said it is building its first air hub in Kentucky. It is also planning to add airfreight capacity for Chinese customers. The company is leasing up to 40 planes, with 18 planes currently in service, and has more than 4,000 dedicated truck trailer hitches as it aims to move more of its goods itself. And it has rolled out delivery in as little as an hour to more than 45 cities across eight countries. Shipping costs rose 34% in the first quarter to $4.38 billion, a lower rate compared with a year ago. "The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up and we think the cost is very good," Mr. Olsavsky said. Analysts flagged one concern for Amazon in the quarter: Growth in the company's all-important Amazon Web Services division continued to shrink. The decade-old cloud-services operation, which rents computing power to a variety of startups, government agencies and other corporations, has become a major factor in Amazon's recent streak of profitability. The division is facing tougher competition from Microsoft and Google, prompting concerns about whether the growth can continue on pace -- especially amid price wars. Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business again posted torrid growth on Thursday as corporate customers adopt the service to handle larger pieces of their computing operations. Office 365, the online version of Microsoft's widely used productivity software, reported huge gains as well, as businesses increasingly subscribe to email, word-processing and spreadsheet applications that run in Microsoft's data centers. Intel posted an increase in first-quarter profit, helped by an uptick in PC demand. CEO Brian Krzanich said selling price strength across nearly every segment of the business in the quarter "demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data." --Jay Greene and Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.

Intel delivered record revenue for the quarter, of $14.8 billion, up from $13.7 billion a year ago. Intel is a company that loves their margins, and they were once again over 60% for the quarter, coming in at 61.8%, which is 2.5 percentage points higher year-over-year. Operating income was up 40% to $3.6 billion, and net income was up 45% to $3.0 billion, which resulted in earnings-per-share of $0.61 for the quarter, also up 45% from a year ago. This is even though Q1 2016 was 14 weeks, versus 13 weeks in 2017. Intel Q1 2017 Financial Results (GAAP)   Q1'2017 Q4'2016 Q1'2016 Revenue $14.8B $16.4B $13.7B Operating Income $3.6B $4.5B $2.6B Net Income $3.0B $3.6B $2.0B Gross Margin 61.8% 60.9% 59.3% Client Computing Group Revenue $7.976B -12.6% +5.7% Data Center Group Revenue $4.232B -9.34% +5.8% Internet of Things Revenue $721M -0.7% +10.8% Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group $866M +6.1% +55.5% Intel Security Group $534M -2.9% -0.6% Programmable Solutions Group $425M +1.2% +18.4% All Other Revenue $42M -35.4% -16% Intel’s Client Computing Group continued to have gains, with revenue for the quarter up 6% to $7.976 billion. Significantly for Intel, operating income for this segment jumped from $1.885 billion a year ago, to $3.031 billion this year. While we’ve seen the company forced to slow down its movement to smaller processes, the current 14nm node has been well refined and the Kaby Lake processors have been solid performers. The next generation 10nm node is looking very promising though, with Intel claiming 25% better performance and 45% lower power consumption versus Kaby Lake thanks to the density improvements. The Data Center Group also had gains, with revenues up 6% year-over-year to $4.232 billion, although the growth has slowed somewhat. Operating income for the group was $1.487 billion for the quarter, down from $1.764 billion a year ago. This will be an interesting space to watch with increased competition in both the x86 and ARM space, but Intel will be releasing new Xeon chips as well with a change in branding. The Internet of Things Group continued to show gains as well, with revenue up 11% year-over-year to $721 million, and up 35% since Q1 2015, so in two years they have seen some substantial growth in this segment. Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group had the largest jump in revenue, with revenue up 55% to $866 million. However, this group also saw an operating loss increase to $129 million, compared to a $95 million loss a year ago. This should be an exciting segment to watch though with Intel bringing their Optane products to market, with both the DC P4800X SSD and Optane caching memory. If you haven’t checked out those reviews yet, they are well worth the read, and 3D XPoint definitely brings some advantages even on a Gen 1 product. Intel’s Security Group is showing its final mention in their earnings, since Intel’s divestiture of the group closed on April 3, 2017, and subsequently it will fall in to the “All Other” category starting next quarter. Revenue for this group was pretty flat, at $534 million, compared to $537 million a year ago. Operating income was up to $95 million though, from $85 million last year. The Programable Solutions Group, which is Intel’s FPGA segment, had a revenue increase of 18% to 425 million, and an operating income of $92 million, compared to an operating loss of $200 million a year ago. Finally, the All Other category had revenues of $42 million and an operating loss of $1.082 billion. Looking towards next quarter, Intel is forecasting revenues of $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and a gross margin around 62%, give or take a couple of points.

Reply Alistair - Thursday, April 27, 2017 - link Yeah and AMD was so close this time, just 10 percent more single core performance and they'd have it in the bag. Reply Qasar - Friday, April 28, 2017 - link and that 10%.. could be gained.. if zen.. could clock higher... doesnt zen max out @ 4 ghz.. maybe 4.2 ghz at best ?? intel over all, i think has a minimun 200mhz over zen... correct? Reply axpneo - Friday, April 28, 2017 - link Intel's instruction per clock cycle count is also better, so not only do they have more clocks per second, they also do more per clock. Reply edlee - Thursday, April 27, 2017 - link Im not a fan boy, but it cracks me up that people think ryzen will affext intel at all. You cannot even find a ryzen from an oem pc maker like dell or hp. Only enthusiasts are buying it up, which make up a tiny sliver of the market Reply xype - Friday, April 28, 2017 - link Eh, people don't understands the difference between Intel and AMD in terms of size and markets. Ryzen might as well have a huge impact on AMD soon, but that doesn't mean it will have any on Intel. Reply ET - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link Not to mention that most of the market is laptops and AMD has only released desktop chips so far. Reply zepi - Friday, April 28, 2017 - link Ryzen was launched on 2nd of March. It wouldn't have much time to impact intels sales yet. Reply Meteor2 - Friday, April 28, 2017 - link Obvious Zen isn't going to affect Intel overnight. But I think 2017 will be Intel's best year, as it gets the most out of 14 nm, for a long time in the future. Their microarchitecture lead is disappearing to IBM, AMD and ARM, their FPGA (and Phi) stuff doesn't really compete with Nvidia, and GlobalFoundary's decision to skip 10 nm to work on cracking a real 7 nm means their process lead may have gone by 2020.

The Linux Foundation Given the increasing malware attacks against Linux-based IoT devices, there is growing interest in integrity protection schemes, as well as system update mechanisms that support over-the-air (OTA) field upgrades. At the recent Embedded Linux Conference, Patrick Ohly, a software engineer at Intel GmbH, Germany, who works on the Yocto Project and the IoT Reference OS Kit for Intel(r) architecture, surveyed both topics and explained how they interrelate. With attacks on the rise, embedded developers need a combination of proactive hardening with integrity protection schemes and regular system updates, among other security precautions. “Integrity protection ensures that your device only runs software that has been verified to be unmodified,” said Ohly. “But you can’t count on catching everything in advance, and there will be new vulnerabilities and attack methods, so that’s why you need system updates.” The bulk of Ohly’s talk explored the pros and cons of update and protection schemes available for Yocto/OpenEmbedded. Ohly is the maintainer of meta-integrity and meta-swupd -- two layers that make the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) integrity protection scheme and the Clear Linux OS swupd update mechanism available on Yocto/OE. The experience has led him to see the benefits of swupd, as well as the problems with IMA. Ohly explained the differences between block-based (swupdate, Mender.io) and file-based (swupd, OSTree) system update mechanisms. He then compared three integrity protection schemes: IMA with Extended Verification Module (EVM), or IMA/EVM, as well as whole-disk encryption with per-machine secret key, and dm-verity. One’s choice of system update mechanism can affect the choice of integrity protection scheme. IMA/EVM works only with the file-based swupd and OSTree while dm-verity works only with the block-based Mender.io and swupdate. Whole disk encryption, meanwhile, works with all four. Although this talk is specific to Yocto, all but these components can work with other embedded Linux environments, with the possible exception of the more Yocto-specific swupdate. Toward the end of the talk, Ohly detailed a recent project in which he took dm-verity and integrated it with whole-disk encryption into the IoT Refkit. “We are trying to use this to extend Yocto to additional use cases,” he said. Here, we only briefly reference the project, which involves integrating LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) and finessing QEMU to properly emulate TPM. If you’re interested, the discussion begins about 33 minutes into the 51-minute talk. System update pros and cons Before comparing the system update schemes available to Yocto/OE developers, Ohly noted that “they all have pros and cons, and in some cases, need further work.” The first decision is whether to with a block-based or file-based mechanism. Block-based schemes like swupdate and Mender.io have fixed partition sizes. This means “you can’t have an update stream that is supplied to different devices with different hard disks because they have to be partitioned the same way,” said Ohly. File-based mechanisms like swupd and OSTree “make it easier to support a variety of devices,” he added. In addition, updating selected files instead of entire partitions is a lot faster. “Swupd in particular works really hard to do the minimal amount of work for updates,” said Ohly. The two file-based mechanisms have further differences. “OSTree creates an alternative tree using hard-linking, and then during reboot it switches over to a new root,” said Ohly. “It’s a bit more atomic than swupd, but it still needs a writable root file system.” Another point of comparison lies in partition layout. A single partition approach is the default mode for OSTree and swupd, and is supported by swupdate. Mender.io, by contrast, requires an A/B setup in which you have both a live partition and a standby partition. The A/B approach lets you override the standby partition, and after rebooting, switch to the other partition. “Having a second partition is nice if you get file system corruption,” said Ohly. A/B partitioning is optional on swupdate, and is possible on OSTree and swupd, although it would require a lot more work, he added. Other issues concern the integration with boot process. “If you have an A/B setup, how do you choose which partition to boot into?” said Ohly. “Can a hacker force us to boot into something we don’t want?” To address this, the mechanisms that currently support A/B setup rely on the U-Boot bootloader and set U-Boot variables, which must be stored by the hardware such that an attacker cannot tamper with them. One’s choice of update mechanism can affect integration with an OTA update server. “If you have many devices you might want to update a subset, which depends on detecting which devices are currently checking for an update,” said Ohly. Swupd and OSTree require that clients pull updates anonymously, so they would need additional telemetry to check update status. By comparison, Mender.io offers a dedicated update server. “This allows you to do real device management, so you know if a device has updated,” said Ohly. Swupdate, meanwhile, supports hawkBit, which does something similar. Integrity protection pros and cons Ohly went on to compare three integrity protection schemes: IMA/EVM, whole disk encryption, and dm-verity. In a previous project with the Yocto-based Ostro Project, Ohly used IVA/EVM, which like dm-verity is now baked into the Linux kernel. He had a lot of trouble making IVA/EVM more secure, however. “I concluded that IVA/EVM is not yet ready for production,” said Ohly. When allowing to write files, there’s an increased risk that files become unreadable after a sudden power loss. IMA relies on hashing the modified file content after writing and verifies the checksum when opening a file again. This rehashing only happens on ‘close()’, which isn't called by long-running processes that keep an sqlite database open. Even when rehashing happens, the checksum and the actual data are not necessarily written to disk together.” Another problem with IMA/EVM is its lack of directory protection. “There are known attacks because IMA/EVM doesn’t protect the integrity of a directory,” said Ohly. “That allows an attacker to remove a configuration file and replace it with a link to something unprotected. There have been patches to address this, but they have not yet been merged.” By comparison, the whole disk encryption with per-machine secret key technique “is a lot more mature” than IMA/EVM, said Ohly. With whole disk, when a device is turned off, a malicious hacker sees only “garbage” in the partition, he added. “If the intruder lacks access to the secret key and tries to modify the partition, once the device boots up again, some blocks will be completely modified, so there’s no way to do dedicated file editing.” Whole disk encryption works great on laptops, but in the embedded realm, the scheme poses the tricky challenge of how to securely store the encryption key. “On a laptop, the user types in something, or plugs in a USB stick, but that doesn’t work in embedded,” said Ohly. Ohly’s code for the IoT Ref Kit adds an extra layer of security for whole disk encryption by using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to store the secret key. “It’s not a perfect solution since someone still has the device with the key in their hands, but it’s a bit more secure than just dumping the key on the hard disk,” said Ohly. “When you combine that with the secure boot, you make it very hard for an attacker to get the key.” Finally, Ohly examined dm-verity, which was originally designed for Chrome OS, and is supported by Android. Unlike the other schemes, dm-verity won’t let you write to and modify files. The mechanism verifies the integrity of each block in a read-only partition so that any modifications immediately lead to a read error. “The advantage of dm-verity over whole disk encryption is that you get a really specific read error saying this block is unreadable,” said Ohly. One side benefit is its ability to detect if a USB stick is corrupted. “It’s a common problem,” said Ohly. “You flash something and it doesn’t work, and it turns out to be a bit flip on the USB stick.” Finally, if you’re wondering why Ohly is wearing a Santa Claus hat, be advised that it’s rather “a genuine dwarf hat from the coal mines of the Black Forest.” The hat reminds Ohly that much of his work is based on existing open source code. “I feel like I’m a dwarf standing on the shoulders of giants,” he said.

Tech Search Search NSASpy Agency Abandons Controversial Surveillance Technique TechHuawei P10 Owners Accuse Company of “Cutting Corners” on Its Flagship Phone TwitterTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey Recently Bought $9.5 million in Company Stock outbrainTaboola and Outbrain Said to be Discussing a Merger PointCloud Cloudera Prices Latest Tech IPO Reuters Apr 27, 2017 Software company Cloudera raised $225 million in an initial public offering on Thursday, a source familiar with the situation said, giving the company a market valuation of about $1.9 billion, a steep fall from the $4.1 billion it was once valued at in the private market. Investors including chip company Intel piled into Cloudera several years ago when a flood of money into private technology companies pushed valuations skyward. Cloudera said it priced its shares at $15, above its indicated range of $12 to $14, but still a far cry from the $30.92 a share that Intel paid in 2014. Cloudera will begin trading tomorrow on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CLDR." The source asked not to be named because the negotiations are confidential. Cloudera and Intel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Cloudera, like rival HortonWorks, focuses on helping corporate customers manage data through "Hadoop," an open-source software system that can sort and handle the increasingly massive amounts of data generated through the Internet and mobile devices. Intel, which took a 18% stake in Cloudera in its initial $740 million investment and subsequently bought more shares, will hold a 19.4% stake in Cloudera after its IPO. Cloudera's data business is meant to help Intel diversify away from its core business of making chips for data centers. Since Intel's investment, Cloudera has had to invest heavily in marketing to help grow its revenue and has had to discount its products due to increased competition. In its fiscal year that ended January 31, Cloudera had $261 million in revenue and spent $203 million on sales and marketing. It posted a loss of $187 million for the year. Cloudera is not the first company in recent years to have gone public at a lower valuation than its private market level -- known in investment parlance as a down-round IPO. Mobile payments company Square Inc had a down round IPO in 2015 with a market capitalization of $2.9 billion, a steep discount from its private valuation of $6 billion. Its market capitalization now sits at $6.7 billion. Still, a down round IPO can be a disappointment for employees with expectations of big payouts. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, and Allen & Company are helping to lead the IPO. Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc.

Prices of Intel's chips in both desktops and laptops went up in the first quarter. That helped drive up the quarterly revenue for Client Computing Group -- which deals in PC chips -- to $8 billion, which was up 6 percent compared to the same quarter last year. But Intel's PC chips now face serious competition from AMD's new Ryzen chip, which was released last month. Ryzen chips offer competitive performance, and are priced significantly lower. AMD's fastest Ryzen 7 1800X chip -- targeted at gamers -- has eight cores and is priced at $499. A comparable chip like Intel's Core i7-6900K is priced at $1,089. Intel's fastest gaming chip is the Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition chip, which is priced at $1,723. During an earnings call on Thursday, Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich sidestepped a question on whether Ryzen had any role in the projected chip price declines. He said the market dynamics were a reason.Â  For more than a decade, AMD's cheaper processors were considered inferior to Intel's chips on performance. PC makers dropped AMD from their product lineup, but are now partnering with the chip maker on Ryzen, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "AMD is offering a competitive part, and their price is significantly lower than Intel's," McGregor said. That is attractive to PC makers, who want to increase their margins on PCs. "There's always the upper echelon that will pay anything for a PC," McGregor said. "This is more about bringing gaming systems to lower prices." It's still early to predict the full impact of Ryzen on the pricing of Intel's chips. But it's already showing up in a couple of places, like in retail stores, where prices of Intel's boxed processors were adjusted after Ryzen's arrival, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. For now, the price pressure is playing out on the premium chips. Later in the year, AMD will release chips for laptops and mainstream desktops. Low-end PCs are even more price sensitive. "Competition is always good, and Intel is certainly feeling the pressure from AMD," McCarron said. Intel could counter Ryzen by offering a newer and faster chips at the similar price compared to processors in its current lineup. Intel will release 8th Generation Core processors later this year, and those chips will be more than 10 percent faster than existing 7th Generation Core chips, also called Kaby Lake. Ryzen isn't the only reason behind Intel's projection of a decline in chip prices. The mix of Intel's chips from low-end to premium chips has slowed down. The price needs to be adjusted so more PC users move from low-end chips like Pentium to Core i5 and i7. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

From staff and wire reports Investors balk at GNC’s bid to extend loan Bloomberg News is reporting that investors are balking at GNC’s bid to extend the maturity on a $1.13 billion loan for another three years to 2022, saying the investors believe the Pittsburgh-based health and wellness retailer isn’t offering enough compensation in return, as well as better protections in the loan documents. The Bloomberg report was based on two unidentified people “with knowledge of the matter.” GNC shares closed Friday at $7.70, down 2 percent. CMU and Intel collaborate on $4 million video data project Intel will harness Carnegie Mellon University’s expertise in computer vision and storage systems through a three-year, $4.125 million project aimed at processing gargantuan volumes of video data. The research will allow cloud-based services to analyze video streams at scale, indexing and storing videos for future applications. Results of this work is expected to be made available to the public. Settlement would have companies pay millions for spill Residential customers and small businesses could receive thousands of dollars under a proposed settlement with the companies sued for a chemical spill and resulting water crisis in West Virginia’s capital area three years ago. If the federal court approves, the settlement filing shows West Virginia American Water would pay up to $126 million and Eastman Chemical $25 million. Thousands of gallons of a coal-cleaning agent leaked from now defunct Freedom Industries’ storage tank into the Elk River in January 2014, leaving about 300,000 people without water for up to nine days. The proposed settlement specifies that neither West Virginia American Water nor Eastman Chemical admit any liability for the spill. Apple ceases iPhone payments to Qualcomm, escalating feud Apple is refusing to pay any royalties owed to mobile chip maker Qualcomm for some of the features in the iPhone, escalating a patent feud that has turned the former partners into bitter adversaries. Apple’s decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties that Qualcomm contends it’s owed, said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. Qualcomm hasn’t threatened to go to that extreme yet, but its top lawyer made it clear that the San Diego company is girding for a fierce fight with its Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world’s most valuable company.

He grew up mostly in Delhi, India. Under his presidency, SanDisk focused on making more robust and reliable memory chips. Noah Berger AP Business April 27, 2017 6:36 AM New CEO ‘uniquely qualified’ to lead Micron, co-founded and led successful competitor By David Staats dstaats@idahostatesman.com and Kristin Rodine krodine@idahostatesman.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The cofounder and former leader of a competitor will join Micron Technology as its next president and CEO, the Boise company said Thursday. Micron’s board chose Sanjay Mehrotra, most recently the president and CEO of SanDisk, to succeed Mark Durcan, who announced plans to retire in February once a successor was in place. Mehrotra will take over May 8. “Sanjay has an outstanding track record of business success and exceptional knowledge of the memory and storage industry,” said Robert E. Switz, the chairman of Micron’s board. Shareholders greeted the news favorably, sending Micron’s stock up more than 3 percent to close at $26.63 in Thursday trading. We're excited to welcome Sanjay Mehrotra as the next CEO of Micron Technology! Read more here, https://t.co/Xw60A7PVEr. pic.twitter.com/Votd5ByZUi— MicronTech (@MicronTech) April 27, 2017 Micron is Idaho’s largest publicly traded company. It employs about 6,000 people in Boise, more than any other for-profit enterprise. Mehrotra, 58, was one of three immigrants who co-founded SanDisk in the Silicon Valley in 1988, a decade after Micron’s founding in Boise. SanDisk makes flash memory chips, which Micron also makes. Flash memory is used in solid-state drives that have replaced many hard drives, and in smartphones and tablets. It is slower but cheaper than dynamic random-access memory, which Micron manufactures but SanDisk does not. Flash retains data when the device’s power is shut off, while DRAM does not. SanDisk and the larger Micron rivaled one another for years in the global flash-memory market. In the early 2000s, SanDisk sued Micron alleging patent infringement. The companies settled. In 2005, on the day Micron and Intel announced a $5.2 billion in a joint venture to make memory products in Micron plants in Utah and Virginia, SanDisk’s stock price plunged 17 percent. After Micron announced in 2015 that it and Intel Corp. had developed a new, more powerful data-storage technology that the companies named 3D XPoint, SanDisk announced that it had teamed up with Hewlett-Packard Co. to develop new technology as well. But when SanDisk put itself up for sale, Micron took interest. Around the time of the SanDisk-HP announcement, Bloomberg News reported that Micron and Western Digital Corp., which makes hard drives, were in talks with SanDisk about possibly acquiring it. Western Digital eventually bought SanDisk for $19 billion, and Mehrotra stepped down. His arrival at Micron comes as the company enjoys strong revenues and profits. Micron’s most recent quarter was one of its best ever, with revenues up 58 percent from a year earlier. “Micron is proud to initiate this change in leadership from a position of strength,” the board’s announcement said. Born in India, Mehrotra earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley. He helped pioneer flash storage solutions, and he guided a 17-year joint venture with Toshiba in NAND flash memory technology. He holds more than 70 patents.   Under Mehrotra, the Micron board does not anticipate major changes in direction, but instead aims to “ensure we continue to invest in areas of the business that will accelerate Micron’s market and technology position and enable timely delivery of new and innovative products,” a company statement said. SanDisk is based in Milpitas, Calif., bordering San Jose in Silicon Valley. Micron has an office there. Mehrotra will work there and in the Boise headquarters. Durcan, who announced his retirement after 32 years with the company, will stay on as an adviser until August. He leaves a legacy as a strong CEO, especially for someone who never planned to have the job. In early 2012, Durcan announced he was leaving his post as Micron’s president and chief operating officer to spend time with his family. Then on Feb. 3, 2012, CEO and board chairman Steve Appleton was killed in a crash of an experimental aircraft near Boise Airport. “I don’t think there is any question he rescued Micron at a moment when no one knew what was going to happen next,” Boise State University President Bob Kustra said after Durcan’s retirement announcement. Durcan plans to stay in Boise. He has accepted a position on the St. Luke’s Health System board of directors. “We deeply appreciate the immense contributions that Mark has made to our company,” Micron said.

You should mention it's a 24-bay Uh, it's at 90k IOPS 4k random write. The m.2 NVMe 950 Pro does about half that on StorageReview, so I'm not sure what single SSD you're referring to. I mean sure, a few SSDs in a RAID 0 would probably outperform this thing but have no reliability. Adding on some redundancy for keeping data a bit safer and your overall IOPS will drop as you have to then run parity calculations on the data you're writing. Homebrew solutions can always be made cheaper and faster than business/enterprise grade stuff, but lack the one thing that a lot of businesses need: support. But I mean hey, no one is stopping anyone else from building their own solution cheaper and faster and selling it with support, which would happen if this was such a terrible offering.

The Nasdaq Composite pushed further above the 6,000 level at the open, setting a new intra-day high after a batch of big-tech earnings overnight. But the results were mixed, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) disappointing. Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▼ 36.15 -1.28 -3.42% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 68.46 +0.19 +0.28% Facebook Inc FB ▲ 150.25 +2.55 +1.73% Time Inc TIME ▼ 15.20 -3.10 -16.94% AdChoices Also, weighing on sentiment is lingering disappointment with President Trump’s tax proposal on Wednesday (light on details and set to add trillions to the national debt), a lack of progress on healthcare reform, and ongoing concerns about a potential government shutdown (despite a one-week stopgap bill moving through Congress). But above all, investors were unhappy with a very weak Q1 U.S. GDP growth report: Coming in at just 0.7% as consumer spending posted its weakest result since the end of 2009. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% as it bonked on overhead resistance from its early March highs, the S&P 500 lost 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite lost a fraction and the Russell 2000 finished 1.2% lower. Treasury bonds were unchanged, the dollar was little change, gold gained 0.2% and crude oil gained 0.7% but was unable to recover the 1.3% loss from Thursday. Related: 7 Tech Stocks That Will Bruise Your Portfolio The gains in T-bonds boosted the ProShares Ultra Treasury Bond (UBT) to a 0.9% gain so far this month for Edge subscribers. © Provided by InvestorPlace Breadth was negative, with 1.6 decliners for every advancer on the NYSE on heavy volume, at 122% of the 30-day average. Technology stocks led the way with a 0.3% gain thanks mainly to Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Facebook (FB). The vertical surge in GOOG looks a lot like the 1999/2000 dot-com craziness as investors piled in following the reporting of better-than-expected results on strong advertising revenue on Thursday night. © Provided by InvestorPlace On the downside, Time (TIME) fell 16.9% after announcing it had rejected a number of expressions of buyout interest — fueling fears of fiefdom on the part of management. Synchrony Financial (SYF) fell 15.9% after a big Q1 earnings miss on higher loan loss reserves. Intel (INTC) fell 3.5% despite reporting solid results amid a focus on weakness in its data center group. And Starbucks (SBUX) fell 2% after reporting weaker-than-expected comp-store sales growth and issued lowered earnings guidance. Returning to the economy, GDP growth slowed from the 2.1% pace set in 4Q16 to its slowest pace in three years. Personal consumption increased just 0.3% following a 3.5% expansion in Q4; which is exceedingly odd given off-the-charts survey-based measures of consumer confidence in recent months. Bright spots included non-residential fixed investments (businesses are ramping up spending). Inventories were a drag. Still, the weakness doesn’t appear set to slow the Federal Reserve rate hike pace. Inflation picked up, rising at a 2.4% annual rate for the biggest jump since 2011. The labor market remains strong. Confidence levels are high. And Wall Street anticipates a Q2 rebound in GDP growth. We’ll know more when the Federal Reserve holds its policy meeting next Wednesday and when the latest jobs numbers are released on Friday. We’ll also get updates on personal income and consumption, motor vehicle sales (a recent worry), and fresh data on labor costs and productivity. It’s a busy schedule, made worse by the ongoing need for Congress and the White House to pass a long-term budget deal.© Provided by InvestorPlace Expect market volatility to intensify. In anticipation, Edge Pro subscribers added a new put option position against Bank of America (BAC) as the bank looks ready to drop out of a large head-and-shoulders reversal pattern that traces a price target below its 200-day moving average.

The intel compute sticks with the m5 cpu is up to the job, but are out of my price range. Totally different price bracket than the Atom based units.   Anyone know of a similar type device, with more CPU and perhaps at a more reasonable price from our friends in China? All I need are Windows, at least a couple of RAMs, a CPU with sufficient stiffness and 2x USB 3.0 ports (1 for drobo, and another for 1GbE ethernet adaptor)         rb99 437 posts Ultimate Geek +1 received by user: 53 Subscriber   Reply # 1772419 29-Apr-2017 13:17     I realise this probably isn't going to help much, but have you considered -   a) getting something big(ger) and hiding it away   b) a NUC (too expensive ?)   c) pre-transcoding   d) replacing whatever you're sending the media too with something that'll direct play   e) second hand laptop rb99 michaelmurfy 5846 posts Uber Geek +1 received by user: 2452 Trusted Subscriber   Reply # 1772422 29-Apr-2017 13:22 I use an Odroid XU-4 (Here) along with the Cloudshell case (Here) and DietPi (Here). I used the eMMC module and got an old 1TiB drive from a laptop to use for media storage. Have got it set up with Plex + Samba and essentially drop files to it to be served by Plex.

If your smart TVs with Plex it's probably only needing to change container format or audio format, and not having to down sample the resolution.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login Home News Prey Spec me up: Prey PC system requirements confirmed By Alice O'Connor on April 27th, 2017 at 5:56 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit If you’ve been cooing and making kissy faces through the window at the upcoming new Prey [official site], Arkane’s sci-fi remix of Dishonored, you might have heard a demo is out today. It’s not for us. No, the demo with the first hour-or-so of the game is only for consoles. Given how many big games launch with performance problems, it’s a shame we won’t get to have a crack on our own PCs. Publishers Bethesda have at least confirmed system requirements, which give… a vague indication of how it might potentially run? Check your spec: Minimum CPU: Intel i5-2400, AMD FX-8320 GPU: GTX 660 2GB, AMD Radeon 7850 2GB Memory: 8 GB Recommended CPU: Intel i7-2600K, AMD FX-8350 GPU: GTX 970 4GB, AMD R9 290 4GB Memory: 16 GB That’s all good and well on paper but in reality, who knows? Now that Steam gives out refunds more freely, it will be possible to buy Prey, play it for up to two hours to get a sense of how it runs, then refund if it’s wonked, but that process sucks. It’s a chore to go through, and buying a good-lookin’ game only to discover it doesn’t run well is a big disappointment. Of course, it might run just dandy. It might be all sunshine and rainbows blasted into your eyes at 180fps. I do not know. But this sucks when a demo is on consoles. I have no insider knowledge but I would be surprised if this last week before the game’s launch next Friday, May 5th, isn’t being used to polish up the PC version. Given the response to Dishonored 2 — which is a neat-o game beneath its technical problems, to be clear — I can’t imagine Bethesda much fancy a repeat of that. As for what’s in the advanced graphics options menu (the most exciting part of any PC game for some, I know), Bethesda say to expect: Object Detail Shadow Quality Texture Quality Anisotropic Filtering Anti-Aliasing Horizontal Field of View Screen Space Directional Occlusion Screen Space Reflections You can always watch our Alec play that first hour (or with commentary), if you’d like.

Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:59 geisler says: Quite right. Dishonored 2 on the other hand used the Void Engine, based on a heavily modified idTech 5. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 21:03 haldolium says: luckily? CE can be even more of a disaster when it comes to optimization and performance issues as idTech. CE games frequently have a very poor performance/visual proportion and scale badly downwards. Especially these days with many proprietary engines delivering visuals equally great for what the CE once had ahead of them, I really do not welcome the choice. I highly hope PREY will have a professional touch from programmers with excellent CE knowledge. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 22:33 Earl-Grey says: Oh! Well that’s potentially good news though, isn’t it? Don’t know where I got the idea that Dishonored 2 and Prey shared the same engine! Maybe I just automatically assumed Arkane used the same engine for both games.

I watched some footage but am interested in playing the first hour or whatever myself. Looking forward to reviews of this one. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:18 brucethemoose says: I don’t like it when they only use high end, old hardware as the only baseline. To me, that says “Yeah, we had some equipment from 2011 lying around. We dusted it off, and the port starts up and runs on that! So it’s ready for PC!”. I know that’s not the reality, but reguardless, for a company that’s done VERY well (sales wise) on PC before, they don’t seem to have much enthusiasm for the platform. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:31 Veav says: They had my pre-order until they left PC off the demo list. I couldn’t handwave that. :/ Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:36 Scelous says: I took it more from a marketing standpoint as, “We don’t want to alienate our PC base, especially casuals or poor people, so let’s not even go near the newer high-end stuff.” That’s how I received it, anyways. Which I don’t think is bad. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 23:54 fish99 says: 970 isn’t exactly top end, and never was, and that’s recommended not minimum.

Dishonored 2 didn’t exactly run like butter when it came out, and frankly isn’t even with the updates. I will be holding fire on this one for a few weeks after release I think Log in to Reply 28/04/2017 at 08:08 Jaykera says: Exactly. I love Arkane and I’m a huge Dishonored fan but the demo not being released for PC looks a bit suspicious. I’ve completed Dishonored 2 multiple times on a high end PC and it’s still not buttery smooth. The fps are there but something feels wrong. (Maybe frame pacing that appears to be a thing these days) I seriously doubt DH2 will ever be as smooth as the first. They don’t seem to be in a hurry to improve it.

I just finished Blackguards and it came out in 2014, which is a bit into the future as far as my backlog-riddled gaming life goes. Unreleased games are pure science fiction.

It’s like your wrench is glued to your shoulder. Oh… and it had input latency problems. So imma keep my PC preorder. Dishonored 2 runs descent enough after a buttload of patches.

While the notebook makes some compromises , it offers an excellent package at an affordable price. Just like its other lines, Lenovo has brought the latest and greatest from Intel to the ThinkPad 13. The 7th generation Kaby Lake CPUs are available in several flavors, although choice is limited to the low-voltage U class reserved for ultrabooks. Our review model is a base-level model. It sports an Intel Core i3-7100U, Intel HD Graphics 620, 4 GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 128 GB M.2 SATA SSD. Aside from the internal components, nothing has changed from last year’s model. The excellent keyboard , ample port selection, and lightweight MIL-STD-810G rated chassis remain the same. As such, we will forego detailed looks at the case, maintenance, and input devices. Further detail on these parts of the notebook experience can be found in our 2016 ThinkPad 13 review. This review will be primarily concerned with the performance changes brought by Kaby Lake.

Action Alerts PLUS Action Alerts OPTIONS Daily Swing Trade Income Seeker Quant Ratings Real Money Real Money Pro Stocks Under $10 Top Stocks Trifecta Stocks Real Money Pro Portfolio Chairman's Club Compare All Top Takeaways From Amazon, Microsoft and Intel's Earnings Reports Eric Jhonsa Apr 28, 2017 3:55 PM EDT Thursday afternoon provided a slew of important tech company earnings; here's a look at the main earnings and guidance numbers provided by Amazon.com (AMZN) , Microsoft  (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) , along with some thoughts on the other numbers and earnings call commentary provided by the firms. Alphabet/Google's (GOOGL) results and commentary were covered on Thursday evening. Amazon.com Amazon reported Q1 revenue of $35.7 billion (up 23% annually) and EPS of $1.48, topping consensus analyst estimates of $35.2 billion and $1.08. It guided for Q1 sales of $35.25 billion to $37.75 billion, in-line with a $37 billion consensus. Operating income guidance of $425 million to $1.075 billion is below a $1.46 billion consensus, but with this outlook strictly due to Amazon's aggressive investment pace, markets aren't worried. After initially seeing larger post-earnings gains, shares are up 0.9% to $926. With Amazon up about 85% from its early-2016 lows, a lot has been priced in. Key Takeaways: Amazon is becoming more transparent. Two years after it started breaking out AWS revenue in earnings reports, the company is breaking out its direct retail product sales, third-party seller services revenue and retail subscription services revenue. It's also disclosing its shipping revenue and costs, and (after having sometimes shared them on earnings calls) its paid unit growth and the percentage of paid unit sales stemming from third parties. As annual report disclosures previously drove home, Amazon's gross profit mix continues shifting heavily towards services relative to direct e-commerce sales. While retail products revenue rose a moderate 15% annually to $22.8 billion, third-party seller services revenue (includes fulfillment services and commissions) grew 34% to $6.4 billion, with sellers accounting for 50% of paid units, and subscription services (dominated by Prime subscriptions) grew 49% to $1.9 billion. The latter two businesses are believed to feature much higher gross margins than the former. Together with Amazon Web Services' (AWS) growth, they helped Amazon's gross margin rise to 37.2% (better than expected) from 35.2% a year ago, in spite of the drag caused by heavy capital spending. AWS revenue growth slowed to 43% from Q4's 47% and Q3's 55%. Revenue of $3.66 billion was basically in-line with expectations. The business remains quite profitable, with operating income growing 47% to $890 million. But the law of large numbers, together with Microsoft and Google's aggressive efforts to gain ground, are slowing down AWS growth rates. For comparison, Microsoft reported Azure revenue rose 93%, a pace even with the December quarter. Google doesn't break out its cloud service revenue, but the business has been estimated to be growing at a triple-digit clip in recent quarters. AWS still towers over the cloud infrastructure (IaaS) market, is a major player in the cloud app platform (PaaS) market and is starting to make inroads in the cloud app (SaaS) market. And Amazon, Microsoft and Google all appear to be taking share from smaller IaaS/PaaS rivals. Amazon's U.S. e-commerce operations remain a juggernaut, steadily taking share with the help of Prime adoption and a burgeoning third-party seller marketplace. North American segment revenue rose 24% to $21 billion, better than Q4's 22% and well above the 15% growth comScore estimates for the total U.S. e-commerce market. Operating profit rose just 2% to $596 million due to major warehouse and logistics investments. International segment sales grew 21% in constant currency, but only 16% in dollars (to $11.1 billion), as a strong dollar once more took a toll. Growth slowed from Q4's 18% and Q3's 28%. Last year, about three-quarters of Amazon's international revenue (regardless of segment) came from the U.K., Germany and Japan. Spending growth has once more accelerated. Fulfillment spending rose 27% to $4.7 billion, tech/content spend rose 37% to $4.8 billion and purchases of property and equipment (led by warehouse spend, but also covering AWS spend) for the trailing 12 months (TTM) rose 51% to $7.4 billion. This led TTM free cash flow to drop to $3.3 billion from Q4's $3.9 billion. Amazon was keen to talk up its Indian investments, which had much to do with the $481 million operating loss reported by its International segment. The earnings release featured a Jeff Bezos quote trumpeting a 75% increase in Indian Prime selection over the last nine months, and a 26% increase in fulfillment capacity thus far in 2017. The remarks come as top local rival Flipkart raises $1.4 billion from eBay, Microsoft, Tencent and others. Ad sales continue to boom, as Amazon leverages both its shopping history data and its knowledge of what consumers are shopping for at a particular moment (also a Google strength) to send targeted ads on its site/apps and elsewhere. "Other" revenue, which covers things like ads and co-branded credit cards, grew 56% to $850 million. That's slower than Q4's 99% forex-adjusted clip, but Amazon attributes this to credit card deal timings. AWS and retail subscription revenue is understated when one takes into account Amazon's unearned revenue balance, which grew by $686 million sequentially to $5.45 billion. On the earnings call, IR chief Darin Manney indicated the main drivers behind unearned revenue growth are Prime subscriptions and purchases of reserved AWS capacity.

The Acer Switch 5 will be aimed at users who require both portability and performance, and is based on Intel’s Core i5/i7 CPU while being paired with up to 8 GB of DRAM as well as up to 512 GB of solid-state storage. To integrate a relatively powerful CPU while retaining moderate price, power consumption and long battery life, Acer had to give up a 4K display panel and a Thunderbolt 3 controller, which were key features of the Switch 5’s predecessor. In addition, Acer announced its new inexpensive Switch 3 convertible notebook that in many ways resembles its more advanced brother. Sales of PCs continued to decline in Q1 2017 and totaled 62.2 million units, according to Gartner. Market researchers believe that many consumers delay purchases of new PCs because their old machines are good enough and because they tend to spend more on smartphones. Meanwhile, there are multiple indications that computers in hybrid form-factors continue to gain popularity because many people want to have convenience of a tablet (e.g., compact sizes, touchscreen, etc.) and versatility of a laptop (physical keyboard, performance, features). After large PC makers introduced loads of various convertible PCs last year, competition in the segment intensified. Since 2-in-1s still represent a new category, PC vendors continue to learn what the end-user wants from such systems and continue to evolve their designs in response. To a large degree, this is exactly what Acer did with its entry-level Switch 3 and higher-end Switch 5: it upped the bar for its inexpensive machine and eliminated “overkill” features on the advanced model.

Previously the company used various Core M (Skylake-Y) CPUs for such computers, but since Core i5/i7 offer considerably higher performance due to higher frequencies, Acer decided to switch to them. The manufacturer uses its fanless "Liquid Loop" cooling solution (based on either heatpipe or vapor chamber tech) to cool down the CPU. Consequently the new PC is utterly quiet, just like its predecessors, the Acer Switch 12 S as well as the Switch Alpha. The new 2-in-1 can be equipped with up to 8GB of LPDDR3 memory, a 256 GB or a 512 GB PCIe 3.0 x2 SSD, a 802.11 ac Wi-Fi controller with 2x2 MU-MIMO technology, front- and back-facing cameras, a fingerprint reader, one USB 3.0 Type-A, and one USB 3.0 Type-C (5 Gbps) port, as well as a MicroSD card reader. However unlike its predecessor the Switch 12 S, the Acer Switch 5 comes with only one display option: a 12” IPS panel with a 2160×1440 resolution, covered with an unspecified protective glass. The multi-touch display supports the Acer Active Pen for note-taking and sketching, solidifying its tablet credentials. Previous-gen high-end convertibles from Acer offered an optional 4K display panel, but this time the manufacturer decided not to give such an option. Thunderbolt 3 has also been excised, presumably due to power consumption and/or cost concerns. The Acer Switch 5 is made of anodized aluminum, and because it also now uses a higher-performance CPU and a more powerful cooling system, the unit got a little thicker and heavier than the Aspire Switch 12 S. The tablet itself is about 9.6 mm (0.38 inches) thick and weighs around 920 grams (2.03 pounds). Meanwhile, the new keyboard seems to be more compact than the predecessor, which is why the whole system became thinner and lighter: with the keyboard connected, the 2-in-1 laptop is 15.24 mm thick (0.6 inches) and weighs around 1270 grams (2.8 pounds). The Acer Switch 5 will hit the market in North America and EMEA in June starting at $799 and €1099, respectively (exact specs vary by the region). The system will be available in China starting from July at a price from ¥7,499. Gallery: Acer Switch 5 Acer Switch 3: Entry-Level 2-in-1 with FHD Display The Acer Switch 3 is an entry-level 2-in-1, which is positioned above the inexpensive Switch V10 and the Switch One 10 launched a year ago. With the Switch 3, Acer is no longer pursuing the low end of the market, which is why the system inherits a lot from its more expensive brother, the Switch 5 (e.g., design, configuration of ports, etc.). The Switch 3 is based on Intel’s Kaby Lake Celeron and Pentium processors, with cooling provided by Acer’s fanless cooling solution. The device comes with up to 4 GB of LPDDR3, up to 128 GB of eMMC solid-state storage, front- and back-facing cameras, as well as dual-band MIMO 802.11ac Wi-Fi. The 2-in-1 also features a USB Type-C port, which is used for data transfer, video output and charging. The Switch 3 has a 12.2” IPS touchscreen with 1920×1200 resolution. As for dimensions and weight, the system is a bit thicker (9.95 mm), but a bit lighter (900 grams) than the Switch 5. Since the Switch 3 does not have to address the low end of the market, it is not going to come at a bargain price. The convertible will be available in Europe and the U.S. in June for €499 and $399, respectively. It will hit the Chinese market in July starting at ¥4,999. And keep in mind that exact specs will vary depending on the region.

Reply Kakti - Friday, April 28, 2017 - link Yeah I can't tell if there's a bunch of typo's, or I just don't know what the author considers the product's predecessor. The Alpha Switch 5 appears to me to be the successor to Switch Alpha from last year, which also used the U-series processors (article says predecessor used M/Y-series). If the Switch 5 is the update to the Switch Alpha, they appear very similar: - Same screen (2,460 x 1440), same Core-U processors, same 8gb LPDDR3 (kind of disappointing it's not DDR4, with its lower voltage), 802.11ac, backlit keyboard, same weight even. Primary upgrades are obviously Kaby Lake and what it brings (hardware h265 encode/decode, hdcp 2.2, supposedly better power management for mobile including more responsive turbo and the SSD uses PCIe instead of SATA. The one downside IMO is that the power now comes from the only USB Type-C port. On the Switch Alpha the power comes from a separate barrel connector, leaving you with an open Type A and Type C. The Switch 5 appears to use up the Type C to charge, which is disappointing when you only have two USB ports.

Tech Search Search NSASpy Agency Abandons Controversial Surveillance Technique TechHuawei P10 Owners Accuse Company of “Cutting Corners” on Its Flagship Phone TwitterTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey Recently Bought $9.5 million in Company Stock outbrainTaboola and Outbrain Said to be Discussing a Merger Tom Reilly, chief executive officer of Cloudera Inc., exits after a panel discussion at the 2015 Dell World Conference in Austin, Texas. Matthew Busch—Bloomberg via Getty Images Cloudera Cloudera’s IPO Gets a Warm Wall Street Welcome Jonathan Vanian Apr 28, 2017 After almost a decade as a high-profile startup, data crunching specialist Cloudera is now a public company. Cloudera’s first day trading kicked off with a bang Friday when it’s shares rose 20% to $18.10 at the market's close after the company priced its shares the day before. Cloudera ended up raising about $225 million from its IPO. Mike Olsen, Cloudera's co-founder and chief strategy officer told Fortune he was "very pleased with how the markets are valuing the business." Tom Reilly, Cloudera's CEO, said that Cloudera will not be “changing our business plans or operating plans” now that it's a public company. He said Cloudera now has "more capital strength with its IPO" that "allows us to play for the long haul." Cloudera, founded in 2008, gained prominence by helping companies use Hadoop, a once-trendy and free technology that lets companies store and process large amounts of data across thousands of servers. Since then, however, several more open source data tools have gained steam with businesses like Spark, which lets companies crunch data more quickly. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. With so many open source data tools available, as well as the rise of machine-learning technologies to sift and find patterns in data, Cloudera has had to expand into several new data technologies—not just Hadoop. Cloudera founder Mike Olsen said Cloudera “didn’t set out to create an open source company,” acknowledging the perception that creating a viable business based on free software is difficult. Instead, Olsen is betting that that Cloudera will grow by selling proprietary software for managing and securing data that is stored using various open-source data tools. But the company faces stiff competition from technology giants like IBM (ibm), Oracle (orcl), Amazon Web Services (amzn), and Microsoft (msft). In its IPO, Cloudera was valued at around $1.8 billion, far less than the $4.1 billion valuation it had in 2014 as part of a $900 million funding round with Intel. The decline raised the ears of some analysts, who feared that the company may have problems. Reilly responded by saying there's a “difference between financial and strategic investors,” essentially arguing that Intel wasn't out to make quick money. Cloudera’s other early investors are very happy with the company’s IPO, he claimed. Cloudera has a close relationship with Intel, which owns a nearly 20% stake in it. For example, Intel designed its data-center chips to be more compatible with Cloudera’s software and operate more quickly, Reilly said. Olsen said that the Cloudera has a “tremendous advantage” over competitors through its relationship with Intel because it knows how to build its software to get more out of Intel’s semiconductors. Analysts are concerned that Cloudera is spending too much money on sales and marketing relative to its sales. Cloudera spent $203 million on sales and marketing in its latest fiscal year, up 26% from the previous year. It’s total revenue for its latest fiscal year was $261 million, a 57% year-over-year increase, while it lost $187 million during the same time period. For more about technology and finance, watch: Reilly said Cloudera made a “strategic decision” to spend a lot of cash on sales and marketing in order to “expand internationally.” Essentially, it’s going to take a lot of money for Cloudera to compete against its much larger competitors like AWS, and it’s unlikely that Cloudera will cut back on it anytime soon.

Stocks posted sharp rallies Monday and Tuesday as corporate earnings season continued to reveal strong performances from some of the top companies in the world. "It seems like the earnings and the reduced anxiety over the policy agenda are driving the markets this week," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. About 190 S&P components reported this week. Here are some of most recent results: - General Motors (GM): earnings per share of $1.70 on sales of $41.2 billion, versus $1.46 per share and $40.75 billion expected by Thomson One analysts' consensus. - Amazon (AMZN): earnings per share of $1.48 on sales of $35.7 billion, versus a Thomson One consensus of $1.12 earnings per share on sales of $35.3 billion. - Alphabet (GOOGL): earnings per share of $7.73 on revenue of $24.75 billion, versus a Thomson One estimate of $7.39 earnings per share on sales of $24.22 billion. "I think this earnings cycle is doing a good job of justifying these valuations," said David Schiegoleit, managing director of investments at U.S Bank Private Client Reserve. Friday was also a big day for economic data. The U.S economy grew at a rate of 0.7 percent in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by Reuters expected growth of 1.2 percent. But the latest CNBC/Moody's Analytics survey tracked economic growth at 0.8 percent and the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow tracked GDP at a 0.2 percent growth rate. "While a bit disappointing, this number fits in with the seasonal pattern that we have seen over the past few years, where Q1 has tended to be weak," said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "But there was some hope that the recent jump in consumer and business confidence would translate into better growth." Treasury yields hovered around breakeven after the GDP data release. As of 3:09 p.m. ET, the benchmark 10-year yield traded at 2.28 percent, while the short-term two-year note yield hovered around 1.27 percent. "Economic data is being overshadowed by earnings and the fluidity of economic policy," said said State Street's Arone. "I think the market was already expecting the Q1 number to be pretty low so [investors] discounted that." Other economic data released Friday included the Chicago PMI, which unexpectedly rose, and the April read on consumer sentiment inched higher. Meanwhile, investors kept on mulling over the White House's outline for its vision of tax reform, The proposal slashes the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. The White House added there will be a "one-time tax" on the trillions of dollars held by corporations overseas. However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the rate for that tax has yet to be determined. "At the end of the day, when you think about where this thing can go, you need to figure out where you're getting the money to fund this," said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. "The government is going to run out of money if we give everyone a tax cut. That's a given." Geopolitical tensions remained in traders' minds as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged the United Nations to impose new sanctions against North Korea. "We must work together to adopt a new approach and impose increased diplomatic and economic pressures on the North Korean regime," Tillerson said. "There are a lot of competing forces in the market, ... and we're seeing a result where everything is balancing out," said U.S Bank's Schiegoleit.

The Data Center Group had sales of $4.2 billion in the three months ending April 1, Intel said in a statement Thursday. That’s below the company’s long-term goal of double-digit percentage growth and points to more weakness in corporate buying of equipment. Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, Intel is trying to spread its bets away from a personal computer market that’s been declining since it peaked in 2011. Sales of server chips, which have helped it make up for that fall off in its main market, aren’t expanding as quickly as Intel projected as corporate demand remains stagnant. “It’s all going to be about data center,” said said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “The cloud guys have been building. Intel’s problem is that enterprise has been weak.” Intel’s division that provides chips for the PC business again showed growth, expanding revenue by 6 percent to $8 billion. Its memory chips sales jumped 55 percent to $866 million. Intel Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said the company is sticking to its long-term target of “low-double digit” percentage growth for the data center unit. For this year the company is predicting expansion in the “high single-digits.” The company is seeing strong orders from cloud data center operators -- a group that includes Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s web services division -- and networking customers, while corporations and government buyers are delaying purchases. “That continues to be a challenge for us given that it’s the biggest portion of the business,” said Swan. Overall the company “feels good about where we are.” Intel said the earnings period in the first quarter of 2016 included one more week than this year. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Revenue will be $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million, in the current period, the Santa Clara, California-based company said. Analysts had projected $14.3 billion, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Intel also lifted its annual revenue prediction by $500 million and added 5 cents to its earnings-per-share forecast for 2017. It’s allocating an addition $10 billion to its stock repurchase plan. First-quarter net income was $3 billion, or 61 cents a share, compared with $2 billion, or 42 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales rose 8 percent to $14.8 billion. On average analysts had estimated a profit of 57 cents on $14.8 billion of revenue. Excluding certain items, profit was 66 cents a share. On that basis, analysts had projected 65 cents a share. PC shipments recorded their first quarterly growth in five years, researcher IDC said earlier this month. While that was a break in a multi-year slide for the whole industry, the gain of less than 1 percent from a year earlier underscored persistent weakness in demand, especially from consumers. Still, that’s better than Intel’s prediction of a decline in the mid-single-digit percent range in 2017. Intel shares fell in extended trading following the announcement. The stock has lagged its peers this year, gaining 3.2 percent, compared with a 13 percent advance by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. In March Intel said it would acquire Mobileye NV for about $15 billion, paying one of the highest takeover premiums this century to play catch-up in the market for technology that helps cars drive themselves. The offer, the largest ever for an Israeli company, was a 34 percent more than Mobileye’s closing price before it was announced. Intel estimates the market for vehicle systems, data and services will be worth as much as $70 billion by 2030. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Time to Profit Boot Up Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock for Free Income Buy the Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Dip With Gusto View All Posts Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) just reported earnings and Wall Street did not like what it saw. This dip, although it may seem like a debacle, does not change the long-term outlook of a company of this caliber. Source: Shutterstock I don’t need to defend the company’s fundamentals since INTC is a leader in an industry that is booming on the back of the digitization of everyday life. Technology is everywhere and we will need it even more later. There will be profits for Intel and there will be higher prices for Intel’s stock. Dips like today only serve as better entry opportunities. The problem is that in the moment, sharp stock retracements can be daunting. They often seem like bottomless pits scaring most investor from buying. Using options, I can structure trade setups that allow room for error, thereby eliminating the need to perfectly time your entry. Catching the proverbial falling knife suddenly becomes much easier and not as hazardous as buying INTC stock outright. Case in point, about a week ago I shared a trade that was designed to be boring, yet it paid me easy profits … and didn’t even need to sweat over the earnings event. Now, I can reset a similar trade with profits in hand knowing that I can be just a little bolder this time. I do have to recognize that technically INTC stock is still far from a sure bounce level, though, so it could be vulnerable to further downside. But that’s another reason to use options and not risk $36 here and without room for error. The Trade: Sell the INTC June 2018 $30 puts and collect $1.70 per contract. Here I have a 90% theoretical chance to have of success On another technical note, INTC stock is poised to break out into a very long-term bullish pattern that could result in a 20% rally. This dip could simply turn out to be a small step into a reload for the mega breakout. To capture that potential, I also want to invest some of my profits into a long-term call commitment. The Juice: Buy the INTC June 2018 $42 call for 50 cents per contract. This is a small price to pay for the potential that it could yield. For a more aggressive version I could instead buy the $40 call, but then I’d have to sell two puts to finance one call otherwise the spirit of this trade changes from one that generates income to one that bets on the super spike. Selling naked puts is dangerous, so I only do it if I am willing and able to own the shares at that price. Learn options as easy as 1-2-3 in a personal 1on1 webinar here.

Cloudera's offering of 15 million shares was priced at $15 per share, above its expected range of $12-$14, and raised $225 million. Shares opened at $17.80 on the New York Stock Exchange and hit a high of $18.64 in early trading. Cloudera helps businesses store, process and analyze data through Hadoop, an open-source software system that can sort and handle massive amounts of information. The company has more than 1,000 customers, including Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), Citigroup (C.N), MasterCard (MA.N) and Cisco Systems (CSCO.O). Its closest rival, Hortonworks Inc (HDP.O), whose offerings are also tied to Hadoop, went public in February last year. Hortonworks' shares had climbed about 11 percent since then. Palo Alto, California-based Cloudera's valuation is a steep fall from the $4.1 billion it was once valued at in the private market. Investors including chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) piled into Cloudera several years ago when a flood of money into private technology companies pushed valuations skyward. This year has been a hotbed for technology IPOs after a dull 2016, which marked the slowest year for such IPOs since 2008, when just 20 technology companies went public. The number of U.S. IPOs has more than tripled so far in 2017, compared to year-ago levels, with the technology sector leading the issuance market, according to Thomson Reuters data. Snap Inc (SNAP.N), the owner of the popular image-sharing app Snapchat, grabbed eyeballs when it went public last month in the biggest technology IPO in three years. Cloudera, founded in 2008, is backed by Fidelity Investments as well as high-profile investors including T. Rowe Price and Google Ventures, the venture capital investment arm of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O). Intel will hold a 19.4 percent stake in the company after its IPO. Cloudera's revenue for the year ended Jan. 31 was $261 million, increasing 57 percent from a year ago. It reported a net loss of $185.3 million and is yet to post a profit. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Allen & Co LLC were among the top underwriters to the IPO, which was widely anticipated by investors for over a year.

Time Inc and Meredith Corp end talks over merger deal Time Inc said it was "definitely" not up for sale on Friday, sending its shares and those of U.S. broadcasting and publishing group Meredith Corp , its most prominent suitor, sharply lower.

Prey Minimum & Recommended PC System Requirements Revealed Share Tweet by Mike Guarino | @mikeyg0403 | on April 28, 2017 Next month will finally see the release of Bethesda and Arkane Studios’ Prey, bringing the years-long wait to an end. However, if you’re a PC gamer then you’ll need to be sure that your rig will actually be able to handle the game, as is always the case with new AAA game releases. Thankfully, the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for the game have been revealed, giving you time to figure out if you should fork over the cash for the PC version. Minimum CPU: Intel i5-2400, AMD FX-8320 GPU: GTX 660 2GB, AMD Radeon 7850 2GB Memory: 8 GB Recommended CPU: Intel i7-2600K, AMD FX-8350 GPU: GTX 970 4GB, AMD R9 290 4GB Memory: 16 GB Accompanying these details are the advanced settings that players will have access to in the PC version of the game. These include the likes of object detail, shadow and texture quality, anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing, horizontal field of view, screen space directional occlusion and screen space reflections. It looks like PC gamers will have plenty of options to tinker around with, tweaking the game to their liking in the process. Console players most recently got a demo of the game, with it being available to download on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The demo gives players a taste of the game’s opening segment, as well as all of the different possibilities that players have at their disposal. Creative Director Raphael Colantonio said on the PlayStation Blog that they “want to encourage different playstyles. If you really are the weapons guy then it’s possible to play through just using weapons and gadgets. You can fabricate ammo for yourself and just be that player. However, we also want to encourage players to be a little more indirect and explore with powers and different ways to solve problems.” Prey will launch for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC on May 5th.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Foxconn to open a new Production Facility for Amazon Products and Beef up Echo Lines by Year End | Main | Qualcomm Lowers Q3 Fiscal 2017 Guidance due to Apple Holding back Royalty Payments » April 28, 2017 ARM Confirms that Microsoft-Qualcomm Notebooks and 2-in-1 Devices for Windows 10 will hit the Market in Q4   Last December Patently Apple posted a report on Microsoft and Qualcomm teaming up to create ARM based Windows 10 Notebooks and 2-in-1 devices for 2017. The collaboration is to spawn a new breed of tablets and notebooks that promise to diversify the software giant's technology base and give the chip maker access to new markets. The partnership will result in an update of Windows 10 that runs on a chip in Qualcomm's widely used Snapdragon line of processors, the first Windows 10-Snapdragon pairing. Microsoft already has Windows designed for ARM processors on Apple's iPad. The new devices will allow users to access the net wirelessly like tablet do today with the chip already built-into the architecture. Users only need set up an account online. Today we learn that the new devices are on track to hit the market during the holiday quarter in the fourth quarter.   A new supply chain report today states that "ARM has recently revealed that a Snapdragon 835-based Windows 10 notebook will be launched in the market by the end of 2017 and some market watchers believe ARM and Microsoft's partnership is expected to focus on conquering the weakness in software ecosystem and could bring pressure to Intel.   Some upstream suppliers believe the new ARM-based notebooks could start with Microsoft's new Surface line this fall and from Lenovo's new 2-in-1 device."   It was rumored in December that Huawei, the number one smartphone maker in China was on board with this project as well.   With AMD gradually picking up its pace and Microsoft's partnership with Qualcomm, Intel is expected to face fierce competition from both sides.   I think that Intel knows that Microsoft opening the door to AMD processors for notebooks could change the tide away from Intel processors over time. Intel announced the end of their 20 year run of the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) earlier this month which reveals that PC's are no longer Intel's future.   The race to 10nm processors begins this fall. Intel is supposed to be introducing their 10nm chips aimed first at notebooks. So it's going to be a very interesting war. Intel is likely to win the first round or two, but over time the writing might be on the wall.   If successful, the new Windows 10 devices with ARM processors could begin to erode Apple's lead in tablets over time. Microsoft may have finally found the right formula to make that happen.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Trade of the Day: Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock’s Earnings Dip Is an Opportunity The Nasdaq Blasts Through 6,000 to New Highs Recent Posts: Time to Ignore the Nasdaq Trade of the Day: Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock’s Earnings Dip Is an Opportunity Shop for Bargains in the Russell 2000 View All Posts On Thursday, stocks achieved small gains ahead of key earnings results from some of Wall Street’s most influential stocks. However, mid-cap stocks continued to be in focus. The Nasdaq’s stocks were in demand, and its move into uncharted territory continued with a gain of 0.4%. But the other major indices failed to follow: The Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged, and the S&P 500 rose 0.1%. Despite the focus on earnings and the positive impact of a 0.6% gain in the technology sector, the rest of the 500 results were flat to lower, thus the small overall gain. Crude oil fell 1.2% following an inventory report from the EIA which showed an unanticipated increase in gasoline inventories for the week ending April 21. And with the move lower in crude, prices fell below the technical support level of its 200-day moving average.  The energy sector of the 500 fell 1.1% in response to the decline in WTI to $49 per barrel. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 6 points, closing at 20,981, the S&P 500 was up one point at 2,389, the Nasdaq rose 24 points to close at 6,049, and the Russell 2000 closed at 1,417 for a loss of 2 points. The NYSE’s primary exchange traded 1 billion shares with total volume of over 4 billion shares, and the Nasdaq crossed 1.9 billion shares. On the Big Board, decliners and advancers closed even, and on the Nasdaq, decliners led by a small margin. Click to Enlarge On Wednesday, I focused on the Nasdaq’s near-term “W” formation and the implications of a breakout propelled by a break-away gap followed by a continuation gap. Today we consider the implications of the formation from an intermediate view: Five steps up, followed by a “W” and gaps could not only be a sign of high demand but also of an irrational chase. The “W” provides a target of 6,050, and yesterday’s high was fractionally above that. Conclusion: On Wednesday I said, “Even though the Nasdaq is the sole achiever of a new high, its reflective power, especially in the technology sector, is significant. Gaps, both Break-Away and Continuation, occurred on the DJIA and the S&P 500, and that means that the Russell 2000, which missed a new high by a fraction, will also jump to uncharted territory.” But so far the other indices are lagging. Banks and other financials, as well as technology stocks, are still prime candidates for cash that has been squirrelled away. Why? Because their earnings are strong and getting stronger. This market is still geared to geo-political events and the administration’s tax policies. Earnings among lagging stocks are strong, thus, I conclude that the time for ignoring the Nasdaq and focusing on value is now. The gamblers will continue to chase the high P/E stocks of the Nasdaq but are unprepared for the whiplash of a correction. The time to buy quality is now.

Trade of the Day: Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock’s Earnings Dip Is an Opportunity The Nasdaq Blasts Through 6,000 to New Highs Recent Posts: Time to Ignore the Nasdaq Trade of the Day: Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock’s Earnings Dip Is an Opportunity Shop for Bargains in the Russell 2000 View All Posts Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) — Yesterday, after the close, this large-cap value stock and member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average reported earnings of 61 cents. On an adjusted basis, it earned 66 cents. Revenue grew 7% to $14.8 billion, a small gain on earnings from FactSet’s survey of analysts that expected 65 cents on revenue of $14.81 billion. However, despite beating quarterly estimates coupled with a positive interview of its CFO on CNBC, the stock fell in after-hours trading. The company projects second-quarter revenue to increase and earnings to improve to about 68 cents, which is slightly above analysts’ expectations. For this year Intel projects revenues of $60 billion and an adjusted EPS of $2.85. Standard & Poor’s has an EPS estimate of $2.94 for 2018. Although headwinds exist from an overall decline in PC sales, Intel is forecast to experience growth from within the “Internet of Things” and an expanding data center growth from its cloud investments. The company’s plan to acquire Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY), a leader in the high-growth market for autonomous vehicles should offset any declines in PC chip sales. Curiously its Q1 revenue increase was helped by a slight increase in PC sales. Technically INTC is currently consolidating in a right triangle. Yesterday’s high at $37.50 almost touched the resistance line of the triangle, and aftermarket trading reversed prices back to support at the $36 area. Closing volume was above average, and the MACD indicator is in positive territory. Try to buy INTC at about $36 for a trade to $42 and a proposed return of over 16%.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Ups Financial Outlook on Higher Chip Selling Prices Better than expected average selling prices of Intel's personal computer chips led it to boost its full-year revenue outlook. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 28, 2017 at 8:00AM After the bell on April 27, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported its first quarter financial results and updated its full-year financial outlook. The company reported $14.8 billion in revenue, precisely hitting the guidance that it gave last quarter. Although merely hitting guidance for the quarter isn't exactly impressive, the company did hike its full-year revenue outlook a smidgen from $59.5 billion to $60 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range. In the grand scheme of things, $500 million isn't much -- it represents less than a 1% increase from the original guidance -- but good news is good news. Image source: Intel. Intel said that better-than-expected average selling price performance in its personal computer chip business helped to drive this slightly higher full-year outlook. No change in TAM, it's all on average selling prices Intel was clear that it isn't revising its expectations around the unit total addressable market (TAM) within the personal computer -- it's still banking on a "mid-single digit percentage decline" in the PC TAM. However, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that the company's average selling prices (ASPs) are "trending ahead of expectations and are contributing to [Intel's] slightly higher revenue expectations for the full year." Krzanich attributed the ASP growth to its "annual cadence of product innovation combined with a thoughtful segmentation strategy." Digging into the details The personal computer average selling price performance that Intel saw wasn't limited to just desktop or notebook computer chips -- it was evident in both. Intel reported that it saw a 1% boost in notebook platform unit shipments last quarter, with average selling prices surging 7%. The situation in desktop computer platforms -- which have generally suffered as users opt for more portable notebook computers -- was less exciting, but the average selling price trend was evident there, too. Intel said that desktop platform volumes plunged 7% year-over-year, but that this was partially offset by 2% growth in average selling prices. An eye toward the future On the call, analyst Vivek Arya asked management about the sustainability of the average selling price performance that Intel is enjoying in its personal computer business. Krzanich began with the following: Each quarter we come in here and we say we're a little concerned about the sustainability of those high ASPs, and we continue to have that, so we always forecast -- if you take a look at what we forecasted [sic] for the remainder of the year, we've forecasted [sic] a slight decline in ASPs as we move throughout the year. The executive then took the opportunity to point out that despite the apparent caution that the company is baking into its average selling price expectations for the remainder of the year, Intel is taking actions to try to keep average selling prices high. "We're continuing to pull in products, and the demand for those high-end, high-performance products, from 2-in-1s, gaming, high-end workstations continues to grow faster than we are even able to project," Krzanich said. Indeed, a recent report from DIGITIMES said that the company has pulled in its upcoming high-end desktop Skylake-X product family by about two months and is now expected to launch on May 30. That same report also said that the company's unlocked Coffee Lake-S chips for enthusiast gamers has been pulled in from a January 2018 release to an August 2017 release. It'll be interesting to see if the roll-out of these products, as well as the company's upcoming eighth-generation Core chips for notebooks, helps Intel outperform its current average selling price expectations as the year progresses.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login Home News Prey Spec me up: Prey PC system requirements confirmed By Alice O'Connor on April 27th, 2017 at 5:56 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit If you’ve been cooing and making kissy faces through the window at the upcoming new Prey [official site], Arkane’s sci-fi remix of Dishonored, you might have heard a demo is out today. It’s not for us. No, the demo with the first hour-or-so of the game is only for consoles. Given how many big games launch with performance problems, it’s a shame we won’t get to have a crack on our own PCs. Publishers Bethesda have at least confirmed system requirements, which give… a vague indication of how it might potentially run? Check your spec: Minimum CPU: Intel i5-2400, AMD FX-8320 GPU: GTX 660 2GB, AMD Radeon 7850 2GB Memory: 8 GB Recommended CPU: Intel i7-2600K, AMD FX-8350 GPU: GTX 970 4GB, AMD R9 290 4GB Memory: 16 GB That’s all good and well on paper but in reality, who knows? Now that Steam gives out refunds more freely, it will be possible to buy Prey, play it for up to two hours to get a sense of how it runs, then refund if it’s wonked, but that process sucks. It’s a chore to go through, and buying a good-lookin’ game only to discover it doesn’t run well is a big disappointment. Of course, it might run just dandy. It might be all sunshine and rainbows blasted into your eyes at 180fps. I do not know. But this sucks when a demo is on consoles. I have no insider knowledge but I would be surprised if this last week before the game’s launch next Friday, May 5th, isn’t being used to polish up the PC version. Given the response to Dishonored 2 — which is a neat-o game beneath its technical problems, to be clear — I can’t imagine Bethesda much fancy a repeat of that. As for what’s in the advanced graphics options menu (the most exciting part of any PC game for some, I know), Bethesda say to expect: Object Detail Shadow Quality Texture Quality Anisotropic Filtering Anti-Aliasing Horizontal Field of View Screen Space Directional Occlusion Screen Space Reflections You can always watch our Alec play that first hour (or with commentary), if you’d like.

If I remember correctly this uses the same engine as Dishonored 2, no? Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:25 G-Lord says: It’s not the same engine (luckily). Prey uses a modified CryEngine. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:59 geisler says: Quite right. Dishonored 2 on the other hand used the Void Engine, based on a heavily modified idTech 5. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 21:03 haldolium says: luckily? CE can be even more of a disaster when it comes to optimization and performance issues as idTech. CE games frequently have a very poor performance/visual proportion and scale badly downwards. Especially these days with many proprietary engines delivering visuals equally great for what the CE once had ahead of them, I really do not welcome the choice. I highly hope PREY will have a professional touch from programmers with excellent CE knowledge. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 22:33 Earl-Grey says: Oh! Well that’s potentially good news though, isn’t it? Don’t know where I got the idea that Dishonored 2 and Prey shared the same engine! Maybe I just automatically assumed Arkane used the same engine for both games. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:16 AutonomyLost says: I s’pose I’ll have to download the PS4 demo tonight and see what it’s all about. I watched some footage but am interested in playing the first hour or whatever myself. Looking forward to reviews of this one. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:18 brucethemoose says: I don’t like it when they only use high end, old hardware as the only baseline. To me, that says “Yeah, we had some equipment from 2011 lying around. We dusted it off, and the port starts up and runs on that! So it’s ready for PC!”. I know that’s not the reality, but reguardless, for a company that’s done VERY well (sales wise) on PC before, they don’t seem to have much enthusiasm for the platform. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:31 Veav says: They had my pre-order until they left PC off the demo list. I couldn’t handwave that. :/ Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:36 Scelous says: I took it more from a marketing standpoint as, “We don’t want to alienate our PC base, especially casuals or poor people, so let’s not even go near the newer high-end stuff.” That’s how I received it, anyways. Which I don’t think is bad. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 23:54 fish99 says: 970 isn’t exactly top end, and never was, and that’s recommended not minimum. Minimum is a 660 which was mid-range when it was new, which is a long time ago now. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 19:22 ColonelFlanders says: I’m sceptical about the PC release of this. Dishonored 2 didn’t exactly run like butter when it came out, and frankly isn’t even with the updates. I will be holding fire on this one for a few weeks after release I think Log in to Reply 28/04/2017 at 08:08 Jaykera says: Exactly. I love Arkane and I’m a huge Dishonored fan but the demo not being released for PC looks a bit suspicious. I’ve completed Dishonored 2 multiple times on a high end PC and it’s still not buttery smooth. The fps are there but something feels wrong. (Maybe frame pacing that appears to be a thing these days) I seriously doubt DH2 will ever be as smooth as the first. They don’t seem to be in a hurry to improve it. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 19:26 phuzz says: Nice to see my graphics card is still hitting “recommended” spec. Log in to Reply 28/04/2017 at 00:06 ColonelFlanders says: I think the GTX970 will be the card to have for at least another 18 months. When I finally have to retire mine I think I’ll go for a 2nd gen ryzen while I’m at it. Log in to Reply 29/04/2017 at 00:45 fish99 says: You’d be right if it weren’t for so many bad ports these days. Even gaming at 1080p, my 1070 eats through some games my old 970 struggled with. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 19:44 Unclepauly says: That sad part is the specs are 480P for the min and 720P for the recommended, ultra will require 12 core i7’s/36gb/dual 1080ti’s. Log in to Reply 28/04/2017 at 13:33 Darth Gangrel says: As usual, I meet or exceed the requirements on Recommended, except for my graphics card (GTX 680) which is just a notch above Minimum, but it’s not like I’m gonna play Prey this year or even the next. I just finished Blackguards and it came out in 2014, which is a bit into the future as far as my backlog-riddled gaming life goes. Unreleased games are pure science fiction. Log in to Reply 28/04/2017 at 14:12 Blacki138 says: Tested the PS4 Demo. The game is pretty good and looks okayish on console. But the FOV is a desaster. It’s like your wrench is glued to your shoulder. Oh… and it had input latency problems. So imma keep my PC preorder. Dishonored 2 runs descent enough after a buttload of patches.

What's more, while the Predator lineup continues to be aimed at hardcore gamers, Acer has thrown a little love to more casual gamers as well. For those who like to game, but maybe don't want to drop a small fortune on a laptop, Acer introduced the new Nitro 5. Available with Intel's latest 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, the Nitro 5 cuts costs while maintaining real gaming power with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 in either 2GB or 4GB varieties. If you want a little more power, you can shell out a little extra to upgrade that card to a GTX 1050 Ti. Either way, the Nitro 5 also comes equipped Dolby Audio, fast SSD storage options, and Acer's Cool Boost tech that allows for manual fan speed control. The Nitro 5 will make its way around the world in July. Taking a step up is the Predator Helios 300, which comes also comes with Intel's 7th-generation processors, as well as the NVIDIA GTX 1060. The real draw here is the inclusion of what Acer call its Aeroblade 3D fan. Essentially, Acer explains it has added axial fins to its standard metal Aeroblade fan to push air flow even further. In total, Acer is claiming up to a 35 percent increase in overall air flow. Last is the Predator Triton 700, the first in a new line of Triton laptops. The Triton 700 is both beastly and svelte, packing powerful internals into a body only 18mm thick. Inside, you'll be able to configure the Triton 700 with, again, Intel's 7th-generation processors, NVIDIA GTX 10-series GPUs, and up to 32GB of RAM. It looks like the Aeroblade 3D fan is present here as well. Acer has also managed to pack in a mechanical keyboard that, interestingly, appears at the edge of the laptop's body. In exchange, the trackpad is positioned near the screen. It's an odd move that will require some adjustment to be sure. The Triton 700 is expected this August, and it likely won't be cheap.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Flip-Chip Technologies Market to Grow at CAGR Of 11.94% According to Forecast from 2017 to 2022 Some of the key players in the global market include IBM Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Texas Instruments Inc., Amkor Technology PUNE, INDIA, April 27, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — Global Flip-Chip Technologies market is estimated at $25.89 billion in 2015 and is poised to reach $57.04 billion by 2022, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.94% during the forecast period. Flip chip is a key technology for advanced packaging of microelectronic circuits and other micro-devices. This technology is used to interconnect semiconductor IC with other ICs, peripheral circuits or substrate in efficient way by solving the heat transfer problem of semiconductor devices, improving performance at higher frequency and reducing the power consumption. Wide range of low-end and high-end electronic products, enhanced electrical performance and high interconnection density are the major factors favoring the market growth. Try sample report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/339153-flip-chip-technologies-global-market-outlook-2015-2022 Due to a global trend on banning the toxic material lead in electronic products, conventional flip chip assembly using lead-based solder bumps is facing a great challenge. Flip chip technology continues to advance and is playing a huge role in 2.5D interposers and 3DICs. The demand for copper pillars and microbumps are reshaping the Flip chip technology, which are swiftly becoming the innovative conventional bumping metallurgy solutions for die interconnections. Intel is the leading producer of flip chip. It is estimated that, by the year 2017 more than half of all bumped wafers for flip chips will be made with copper pillars. Some of the key players in the global market include IBM Corp., Samsung Electronics Co.

(NASDAQ: INTC) released its most recent earnings report after markets closed on Thursday. The chip manufacturing giant had $0.66 in earnings per share (EPS) and $14.8 billion in revenue, compared to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates which called for $0.65 in EPS and $14.81 billion in revenue. Last year’s first quarter had $0.54 in EPS and $13.8 billion in revenue. In terms of the outlook for the second quarter, Intel expects to see revenues around $14.4 billion, give or take $500 million, and EPS in the range of $0.63 to $0.73. The consensus estimates for the coming quarter are calling for $0.64 in EPS and $14.34 billion in revenue. The company reported its business segment revenues as: Client Computing Group revenue increased 6% to $8.0 billion. Data Center Group revenue was up 6% to $4.2 billion. Internet of Things Group revenue jumped 11% to $721 million. Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue increased 55% to $866 million. Intel Security Group revenue of $534 million, down 1%. Programmable Solutions Group revenue was up 18% to $425 million. During the first quarter, Intel also generated about $3.9 billion in cash from operations, paid dividends of $1.2 billion, and used $1.2 billion to repurchase 35 million shares of stock. The board of directors also has approved a $10 billion increase to Intel’s share buyback program, which brings the amount currently available for future buybacks to approximately $15 billion. Brian Krzanich, Intel’s CEO, commented: The first quarter was another record quarter, coming off a record 2016. We continued to grow our company, shipped our disruptive new Optane memory technology, and positioned Intel to lead in new areas like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. The ASP strength we saw across nearly every segment of the business demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data. Shares of Intel closed Thursday up 1.4% at $37.43. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $29.50 to $38.45 and a consensus analyst price target of $39.97. After earnings were released the stock was initially down 3.5% at $36.13 in the after-hours session.

These notebooks are available in 15.6-inch and 17.3-inch variants and were unveiled at the company’s next@acer event in New York. The laptops come with an overclockable Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or GTX 1050Ti graphics card (GP). You also get to choose between two CPUs, the Intel Core i7 7700HQ or the Intel Core i5 7300HQ. Up to 32 GB DDR4 RAM is supported and the laptops include a Sata SSD as well as a 1 TB HDD. Acer says that the devices include a USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.0 port, two USB 2.0 ports and an HDMI 2.0 port. An ethernet port and Wi-Fi 802.11ac is also supported. As mentioned earlier, you can opt for either a 15.6-inch or 17.3-inch display. Both support Full HD resolutions (1920×1080 pixel) and are IPS panels. Dolby has provided the audio solution. The laptop configurations will vary by region, so don’t expect India to get the same configuration as was launched in the US. Official US prices start at $1,299 (around Rs 84,000) for the 15.6-inch model and $1,399 (around Rs 90,000) for the 17.3-inch model. Products with similar specifications in India cost around Rs 1,30,000, so until India prices are confirmed, don’t get your hopes up. The devices will launch in July in the US.

Revenue from Intel’s higher-margin data center business rose 6 percent to $4.2 billion in the first quarter. That was less than the 9 percent jump a year-ago and the 8 percent increase in the fourth quarter. “I think the Street was looking for slightly better than that,” Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Analysts were expecting revenue to increase 10 percent to about $4.4 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. The slowdown in revenue growth comes after Intel warned in February that business’s margins could be hit by higher costs. However, Intel still expects the business to grow in the high single-digit percentage rate this year, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a call. Forecast Raised Intel marginally raised its full-year revenue forecast, which Krzanich said was due to average selling prices across its businesses trending ahead of expectations. The Santa Clara-based company expects 2017 revenue of about $60 billion. It had earlier forecast revenue would be flat compared with 2016 revenue of $59.4 billion. Intel increased its share buyback program by $10 billion to about $15 billion and also raised its 2017 adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents to $2.85 per share, plus or minus 5 percent. The company has previously said it expects its deal to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, announced last month, to boost adjusted profit. The acquisition thrusts Intel into the forefront of the market to develop driverless systems. The deal, along with a focus on cloud computing, will also help Intel reduce its dependence on the PC market. Intel gets most of its revenue from selling chips used in PCs. Its PC business returned to growth in 2016 as demand stabilized in the second half of the year. Demand also unexpectedly edged up in the first quarter, according to research firm IDC. That helped revenue from the client computing group, as Intel calls the business, increase 6 percent to $8 billion, matching estimates. Intel’s total revenue rose 8 percent to $14.80 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimate of $14.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income jumped 45 percent to $2.96 billion. Excluding items, Intel earned 66 cents per share, one cent above analysts’ estimate.

Razer had better watch its back: the current king of thin-but-powerful gaming laptops has a new challenger. Acer's Predator Triton 700 has all the top-spec hardware you'd expect, courtesy of Intel and Nvidia, but hasn't piled on the pounds to make room for it. At just 18.9mm with the lid closed, it's positively skinny. That's because it's packing some ultra-clever fans, which keep everything cool while taking up less space. Acer's pretty proud of 'em - that's why you can actually see them underneath the touchpad. Yep - this is the first laptop I've seen that's not just running Windows, but actually has a window as well. After putting one through its paces at Acer's global press launch, I came away impressed. Here's why. OK, so it's got the mandatory ridiculous name, just like any other gaming laptop, but Acer hasn't gone crazy on the styling. The Triton is almost subtle, which isn't something I would've thought I'd be saying about a 17in laptop with a see-through glass touchpad. It sits above the keyboard, which is a little crazy, but makes sense when you think where this laptop will spend most of its life: firmly on a desk, with a mouse attached so you can get your game on. Beneath the glass, one of the two AeroBlade 3D fans and its accompanying heat sink can be seen doing its thang. They're metal, rather than plastic, with an axial fin that makes them 35% more efficient than a standard laptop fan. At full pelt, that means there's enough cooling to keep a 7th gen Intel Core i7 CPU and a Nvidia GeForce 10-series GPU (no confirmation on which one just yet) running smoothly without melting into a puddle of silicon. It certainly worked a treat while blasting gringos in Ghost Recon: Wildlands, keeping frame rates smooth without any noticeable drops. The keyboard sits right at the front of the machine, and while it's great that you won't accidentally nudge the touchpad while you're gaming, it's a little bit too close - without a wrist rest this looks like a one-way trip to RSI. Population: you. On the plus side, those are honest-to-goodness mechanical keys, with fantastic feedback and that recognisable clicky sound that gamers just can't get enough of. They're absolutely awesome to type on, so hopefully Acer will be bringing it to more laptops in the future. This 15.6in laptop doesn't overdo it when it comes to screen resolution, with a Full HD panel that the dedicated graphics card will be able to handle. QHD and even 4K screens are great for getting work done or web browsing, but are useless if all that matters are high frame rates. That's why you get Nvidia G-Sync, which makes even the most demanding games look smooth when the GPU can't quite hit that stable 60fps target. It's a decent enough display, although Acer's choice of venue (a rooftop terrace on a bright, if slightly overcast day) meant it was tough to get an idea of how it'll perform indoors and in the dark. Which is how most gamers will probably be using it. There are certainly enough ports to hook it up to a bigger, higher resolution display if you need, with both HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort. You get wired Ethernet, two USB3 ports and a single USB2, so you can hook up plenty of peripherals as well. ACER PREDATOR TRITON 700 INITIAL VERDICT With matte black styling and such slim dimensions, you'd have to look closely to spot that the Triton 700 was a gaming laptop. Ok, so the blue keyboard LEDs might give the same away, but it's the most restrained Acer has been when it comes to high-performance notebooks. It is genuinely powerful, too, thanks to high-end components and the cooling system to keep them running at their highest possible speeds. Gaming won't be a problem, and that keyboard is among the best we've tried in a laptop. Razer still has the edge right now, but Acer has something special here. Unfortunately, you're going to have to pay serious cash to take one home. When it goes on sale later this year, expect prices to start from$US2999. That puts it firmly up against the Razer Blade, which has the added benefit of an external graphics card for gaming at home on the big screen. Will it take down the champ? We'll have to wait until closer to launch, when we get hold of one and give it a full review.

Google's parent company Alphabet's net income rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion in the first quarter, from $4.21 billion in the same period last year. Revenue increased 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion, from $20.26 billion. Google's net income jumped 21.8 percent to $7.6 billion, from $6.24 billion; while revenue rose 21.9 percent to $24.5 billion, from $20.1 billion, during the same period. Google's ad revenue increased 18.9 percent to $21.4 billion, from $18 billion. After strong financial results, Alphabet's stock price climbed 5.1 percent to $937 a share in after-hours trading. Microsoft also saw its net income rise $27.6 percent to $4.8 billion in the January-March period this year, from $3.76 billion a year ago. Its revenue climbed 11 percent to $22.09 billion, from $20.53 billion, during that period. The results, however, missed expectations and the firm's shares fell 2.4 percent to $66.60 after the final bell. Microchip giant Intel's net income rose 50 percent to $3 billion in the first three months of the year, from $2 billion a year ago. Revenue increased 8 percent to $14.8 billion, from $13.7 billion, during the period. Intel's results also missed expectations, and its shares declined 4.4 percent to $35.83 during after hours. E-commerce giant Amazon saw its net income rise 41.1 percent to 724 million in the first quarter, from 513 million last year. Revenue rose 22.7 percent to $35.7 billion, from $29.1 billion, year-over-year. Amazon's stock price climbed to $961.44 per share with a 4.7 percent gain after the stock market closed.

AF nowadays can affect a lot the performance, because many times by now in some games, Tesslation or Parallax Occlusion Mapping is tied to the anisotropic filtering. So the more the anisotropic, the more the tesslation or POM at certain distance. Rise of the Tomb Raider is one of the games where it's very noticable the performance penalty while using tesslation and messing around with AF. Plus, you also have the laptop gamers, with their low end cards (which I have one) where AF takes a huge impact on the performance due to the lack of bandwidth in this cards (DDR 3 + 64 bits). so this setting needs to exist. Apart from this situations, it's true what you say, the AF have like a small impact on the performance. Cheers.     ObscureangelPT View Public Profile Find all posts by ObscureangelPT   (#9) Genova84 Newbie   Videocard: Dual Zotac 980tis Processor: 5960X Mainboard: Rampage V Extreme Memory: 64GB DDR4 2133K Soundcard: PSU: 1100 watt Yesterday, 13:14 | posts: 20 | Location: 'Merica I wish more devs would show exactly what recommended can run.

PC has had 4K tech since the 980TI and if all games werent console ported trash designed on what a console can or its limitations why should people like me buy their crap then? You game on PC to get away from limitations. Yet you jump down the throat of someone who doesn't want a game based on money grabbing companies who can't be botherd to make Pc games that are optimised for a PC... We know they don't do this because it costs more! And they won't have that!

The "Mad Money" host said that with the federal government funded through the next week, investors can finally relax and gear up for yet another earnings-filled agenda. With that in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar this coming week: Monday: Advanced Micro Devices, Cardinal Health Advanced Micro Devices: After shares of competitor Intel slid on its earnings miss on Thursday, Cramer is unsure that even the best of earnings reports from this chipmaker will garner a positive market reaction. "As I have repeatedly said, there is nothing wrong with the company AMD," Cramer said. "What can I say? The market's fallen out of love with last year's darlings." Cardinal Health: Once the health care services company reports earnings, Cramer thinks investors will start to notice its monumental acquisition of part of Medtronic's business, which will make it a more streamlined hospital supplier. Tuesday: CVS Health, Mastercard, Apple CVS: The health care retailer's stock has been under pressure lately as even pharmacies are squeezed by the rise of Amazon, but Cramer says there could be a hidden upside to earnings. "All that said, it's hard to really dislike a well run company like this that sells at just 13 times earnings. I say wait and see. Maybe numbers come down, maybe that's your chance," the "Mad Money" host said. Mastercard: Other payment services names like Visa and PayPal have reported great numbers this quarter, so Cramer expects a good report from Mastercard as well. "Here's one where you might want to see if the stock gets hit after it reports so you can come in at a lower price," he said. "That's been the pattern with the stock of this amazing company. It might be a great way to get in on a trend that still has a lot of room to run: the paper to plastic secular growth story." Apple: Expectations are sky-high for the tech titan's after-the-bell earnings report, and Cramer thinks they are justified. "Apple's doing so many things right. It's making the best products, developing a deep ecosystem with a substantial service revenue stream," he said. Plus, Apple's upcoming iPhone release is rumored to have an array of new features that makes the smartphone more functional and easier to handle, which should boost sales and new customer numbers, Cramer said. The company also stands to massively benefit from repatriation if the administration is able to implement it. All said and done, Cramer says investors should own the stock, not trade it, and eager buyers should hope for a post-earnings dip so they can buy it at a discount. Wednesday: Sprint, Facebook, Kraft Heinz Sprint: Cramer likes the stock of this telecommunications player, which will report its quarterly earnings Wednesday morning, but the "Mad Money" host is concerned that it may just be pushing along instead of really growing. T-Mobile CEO John Legere told Cramer he may be open to buying Sprint, but antitrust issues may stand in the way of a merger or acquisition, Cramer warned. "Any merger would lessen the competition for something that's become a modern day necessity," he said. "You really have to own these for fundamentals, not potential deals, and if that's the case, T-Mobile remains best of breed." Facebook: The social media colossus reports earnings after the bell, and unless its numbers are substantially better, Cramer expects a slight sell-off. "I like how competitive Facebook is," the "Mad Money" host said. "If you don't own it now, I think you might as well wait to see if we get that kind of weird sell-off that we usually get even after it reports a great number." Kraft Heinz: Investors will be tuned into the consumer goods name when it reports because it always seems to be on the lookout for a takeover candidate despite botching its proposal to buy Unilever last quarter. Cramer prefers Unilever's stock, but said that if Kraft Heinz floats the idea of a deal, it could get a boost. "We know, though, it takes two to tango, and I'm hard pressed to see who would possibly want to sell in that consumer packaged goods industry as the remaining players seem to have no inclination to let go of the reins," Cramer said. Thursday: Dunkin' Donuts, Activision Blizzard Dunkin' Donuts: Cramer contended that this coffeemaker, which will report earnings Thursday, "has quietly become a better investment than Starbucks over the last year, going from $46 to $55, while Starbucks has only traveled up four points." The "Mad Money" host credited the company's execution for the rise, saying that it has outperformed Starbucks in terms of stemming the U.S. slowdown. Activision Blizzard: The gaming sector is one of Cramer's favorite secular growth stories in the stay-at-home economy, and Activision Blizzard's earnings reports have a tendency to spur selling. "I say the trend's your friend," Cramer said. "This franchise is worth buying if it gets hit." Friday: Non-farm payrolls The Labor Department will release its monthly non-farm payroll data. The hiring statistics could have a detrimental effect on bank stocks if they are low, but Cramer expects the opposite. "If April turns out to have been a robust hiring month, and I think it will be, that gives the Fed breathing room to raise interest rates twice, and therefore the bank stocks will soar," he said. So with Washington policymakers at bay for now and the market digesting this week's madness, Cramer said to focus on the stocks that get unjustly beaten down for chances to buy high quality names next week. "This week we have a couple of stocks that tend to act badly after they report. Those are your best bets for investments. Otherwise, get ready for still one more opportunity to buy some Apple stock as Wall Street's naysayers try to say its best days are behind it. But, of course, they say that to each other on their iPhones," the "Mad Money" host said.

AF nowadays can affect a lot the performance, because many times by now in some games, Tesslation or Parallax Occlusion Mapping is tied to the anisotropic filtering. So the more the anisotropic, the more the tesslation or POM at certain distance. Rise of the Tomb Raider is one of the games where it's very noticable the performance penalty while using tesslation and messing around with AF. Plus, you also have the laptop gamers, with their low end cards (which I have one) where AF takes a huge impact on the performance due to the lack of bandwidth in this cards (DDR 3 + 64 bits). so this setting needs to exist. Apart from this situations, it's true what you say, the AF have like a small impact on the performance. Cheers.

GFX wise the game looks like it was made 8 years ago. Super linear with very sub par gameplay. Doubt the PC version will improve much on this.

Some PC peeps are annoying. Game must run 144FPS on ULTRA and look better then Crysis on ultra @ 4k and play that way on my GTX 1070 or game is a crappy console port. Ill be the first to admit I love great graphics, but it is not what makes a game either. Prey 1 had really nice graphics, but the atmosphere and story are what made it a bad ass game.

If you need a bit more power, there’s the Acer Swift 3 series. These 14 inch and 15.6 inch notebooks feature full HD displays, Intel Kaby Lake processor options, and relatively compact designs. They’re also available with optional NVIDIA GeForce graphics… although one thing you don’t get with these models is fanless cooling. The Acer Swift 3 laptops should be available starting in June for $599 and up. The 14 inch model measures 0.7 inches thick and weighs 3.9 pounds, while the 15.6 inch version is 0.74 inches thick and weighs 4.9 pounds. Both feature brushed-aluminum bodies, 1920 s 1080 pixel IPS display, support for up to 8GB Of RAM and up to a Core i7-7500U processor Storage options range from 128GB to 512GB SSDs or 500GB to 2TB hard drives. Acer says the Swift 3 notebooks should be able to get up to 10 hours of battery life, and each model features 802.11ac WiFi, and USB 3.1 Type-C ports. Unfortunately, while the Swift 1 has a matte display, all of the Swift 3 models I saw had glossy screens… which made me question why Acer decided to show them off in an outdoor setting.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Acer Switch 3 Apollo Lake 2-in-1 coming soon for $399 and up 04/27/2017 at 3:26 PM by Brad Linder 2 Comments As expected, Acer has unveiled a new entry-level 2-in-1 Windows tablet that’s powered by an Intel Apollo Lake processor. It’s called the Acer Switch 3, and it’s a tablet with a 12.2 inch, 1920 x 1200 pixel display, a built-in kickstand, a keyboard cover, and a starting price of $399. The Switch 3 should be available for purchase starting in June. Acer Switch 3 specs include: Intel Celeron and Pentium Apollo Lake CPU options Up to 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB eMMC storage options MicroSDXC card slot USB 3.1 Type-C port and USB 3.1 Type-A port 802.11c WiFi Bluetooth 4.0 The tablet measures 11.6″ x 7.9″ x 0.4″ and weighs about 2 pounds and Acer says you should get up to 8 hours of battery life from this model. The tablet has front-facing speakers, but lacks some of the premium features found on the Switch 5, such as the fingerprint sensor, retractable kickstand, LiquidLoop fanless cooling system, and backlit keyboard. So those are some of the reasons this model has a starting price of $399 while the Switch 5 is priced at $799 and up.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Acer Aspire U27 is a fanless all-in-one desktop PC with LiquidLoop cooling 04/28/2017 at 3:00 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment When you think of fanless computers, you probably think notebooks, tablets, and maybe a desktop or two. But Acer is going a bit bigger with its latest fanless computer. The Acer Aspire U27 is an all-in-one desktop PC with a 27 inch full HD display and a case that’s just 0.5 inches thick, thanks to its fanless design. Acer keeps the system cool by using a version of the LiquidLoop cooling system that the company first designed for tablets with passive cooling. The computer supports up to 32GB of DDR4-2400 memory, up to an Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake processor, and optional Intel Optane memory. It also has a 2.5″ drive bay and an M.2 slot for a solid state drive, stereo speakers with a subwoofer, integrated 802.11ac WiFi, an IR camera for Windows Hello facial recognition, a 1MP webcam, and a touchscreen with support for 10-finger input. The Aspire U27 should be available in North America in July for $1099 and up, but it will launch in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) in May for €1,299.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 143.65 -0.14 -0.10% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 924.99 +6.61 +0.72% Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD ▼ 13.30 -0.32 -2.35% Intel Corp INTC ▼ 36.15 -1.28 -3.42% AdChoices "Apple's doing so many things right. It's making the best products, developing a deep ecosystem with a substantial service revenue stream," the "Mad Money" host said Plus, Apple's upcoming iPhone release is rumored to have an array of new features that makes the smartphone more functional and easier to handle, which should boost sales and new customer numbers, Cramer said. The company also stands to massively benefit from repatriation if the administration is able to implement it. All said and done, Cramer says investors should own the stock, not trade it, and eager buyers should hope for a post-earnings dip so they can buy it at a discount. As the busiest week of earnings season came to a close, Cramer breathed a sigh of relief despite Friday's mild pullback caused by a weaker-than-expected GDP number. Read more from CNBC's Jim Cramer The "Mad Money" host said that with the federal government funded through the next week, investors can finally relax and gear up for yet another earnings-filled agenda. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reports earnings, and after shares of competitor Intel (INTC) slid on its earnings miss on Thursday, Cramer is unsure that even the best of earnings reports from this chipmaker will garner a positive market reaction. Aside from Apple, Tuesday will bring an earnings report from health-care retailer CVS (CVS), where Cramer says there could be a hidden upside to earnings. "It's hard to really dislike a well run company like this that sells at just 13 times earnings. I say wait and see. Maybe numbers come down, maybe that's your chance," the "Mad Money" host said. On Wednesday, the market will get Facebook (FB)'s results. The social media colossus reports earnings after the bell, and unless its numbers are substantially better, Cramer expects a slight sell-off. "I like how competitive Facebook is," Cramer said. "If you don't own it now, I think you might as well wait to see if we get that kind of weird sell-off that we usually get even after it reports a great number." The gaming sector is one of Cramer's favorite secular growth stories in the stay-at-home economy, and Activision Blizzard's earnings reports have a tendency to spur selling, which may happen when it releases numbers on Thursday. "I say the trend's your friend," Cramer said. "This franchise is worth buying if it gets hit." The Labor Department will release its monthly non-farm payroll data on Friday. The statistics could have a detrimental effect on bank stocks if they are low, but Cramer expects the opposite. "If April turns out to have been a robust hiring month, and I think it will be, that gives the Fed breathing room to raise interest rates twice, and therefore the bank stocks will soar," he said. © Provided by CNBC When Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported earnings at the same exact time Thursday night, Cramer found it difficult to compare the two and pick a winner. "The problem is that in some ways, this is a real apples-to-oranges situation," the "Mad Money" host said. Amazon, for example, chooses to promote faith-based investing, assuring shareholders that their India business will flourish and that robots will save time at their fulfillment centers. Alphabet went about energizing investors in a different way. They talked about how their search engines help local businesses and about their cloud operations, which compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure. Cramer also spoke with Stephen Milligan, the CEO of Western Digital (WDC), a data storage player and one of the world's biggest hard disk drive manufacturers. Milligan said that the company's longtime partnership with troubled electronics giant Toshiba was worth preserving despite the Japanese giant's current difficulties. "The joint venture that we've had with Toshiba is 17 years running. I would contend that it's probably one of the most successful technology joint ventures in the history of our industry. And so our first goal is let's keep that joint venture healthy," Milligan told Cramer on Friday. While the CEO acknowledged that helping Toshiba could create a bit of an overhang in terms of how investors perceive Western Digital, his main focus remained on growing his own business. "Rest assured, we're going to do our very best to make sure that we protect our interests and advance not only our position, but the stakeholders that Toshiba has, and really come to a resolution that helps us to continue to be successful going forward," the CEO said. Upon the release of BioMarin's (BMRN) orphan drug Brineura, which made headlines for its $702,000-per-year price tag, chairman and CEO JJ Bienaimé said the system will have the final say on whether the sky-high price is fair. "Obviously, the system will have to determine that," he told Cramer on Friday. But I would say that CLN2, the disease that Brineura is being used for, is an absolutely devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which, unfortunately, the patients will lose their life, most of the time by [age] 12." And although Washington lawmakers have knocked pharmaceutical companies for high drug costs, Bienaimé said most policymakers understand the industry's inevitable trial-and-error aspects. "I think, hopefully, ... if there is any kind of regulations coming around health care, that they will make sure that those regulations protect innovation and protect innovative biotech companies," Bienaimé said. Finally, Cramer spoke with AGCO (AGCO) Chairman, President and CEO Martin Richenhagen to understand more about how President Donald Trump's protectionist slant might affect the agricultural landscape. AGCO manufactures agricultural equipment like tractors that require steel to produce. Richenhagen said that if the current administration were to follow through with placing high tariffs on non-U.S. steel, the effects would be felt industry-wide. "For us, of course, if steel's prices would go up because of this kind of protectionism, it wouldn't be so good because finally our customers would have to pay. So that's true for all of us, for the whole industry," the CEO told Cramer on Friday. Richenhagen added that while the move would benefit the steel industry, it was "not really a great strategy" to implement tariffs without explicitly informing consumers of their effects. "All kind of protectionism finally has to be paid for," he said. "And I think consumers should know that." In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Bank of the Internet USA (BOFI): "I don't know. Too much risk there, my friend. I'd rather own JPMorgan (JPM). I think that's a little more, let's just say, strong." Agilent Technologies (A): "Oh my, I like Agilent so much. I like the quarter. You can win two ways here: you can win on an acquisition or you can win on earnings. That's how good that quarter was. Terrific." Questions for Cramer?

The Nasdaq Composite pushed further above the 6,000 level at the open, setting a new intraday high after a batch of Big Tech earnings overnight. But the results were mixed, with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) disappointing. Source: Shutterstock Moreover, President Trump’s “big league” tax plan announcement on Wednesday was a dud, another healthcare reform push has apparently died in the Congress, and Friday’s first-quarter U.S. GDP growth report came in at just 0.7% on the weakest consumer spending performance since 2009. That’s a lot of headwinds for the market to digest, especially since the gapped move higher this week came on very narrow breadth. Sentiment is extended. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average is contending with stiff overhead resistance from its early March high.

Leading the tepidly bearish charge were Athenahealth, Inc (NASDAQ:ATHN), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), all of which were sent lower in response to lackluster earnings news. Synchrony Financial (SYF) Synchrony Financial, the former financing arm of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) that was spun off in 2015, was probably wishing its results were still buried with its former parent company’s numbers after they were posted early on Friday morning. SYF shares didn’t like what they heard, sending the stock to a loss of 15.9% for the day. The bearish response is understandable. For the quarter ending in March, Synchrony was expected to report earnings of 74 cents per share on revenue of $3.54 billion. Instead, the company reported a profit of 61 cents per share of SYF and a top line of $3.91 billion. Although the top line was better than expected, the earnings miss was not only wide, but the bottom line withered — a lot — compared to the year-ago profit figure. The bulk of the shortfall stemmed from a $403 million loan-loss provision Synchrony Financial was forced to factor in. SYF shareholders weren’t sympathetic though. Intel Corporation (INTC) Synchrony Financial wasn’t the only name to get beaten up … well, down on Friday following a mixed first-quarter earnings report. Technology giant Intel also hit a headwind following the release of its fiscal Q1 numbers, though not as harsh as the one SYF bumped into. Last quarter, Intel earned 66 cents per share versus expectations for a profit of only 65 cents. Revenue of $14.8 billion, however, came up just a little shy of estimates for a top line of $14.81 billion. The big letdown came from the company’s data center arm. Though its Data Center Group’s business was up 6% year-over-year, that was still short of the company’s target. It matters simply because that division is the centerpiece of the company’s growth plans. INTC ended the session down 3.4%. Athenahealth, Inc (ATHN) Last but not least, medical billing and management IT names athenahealth struggled with lower reimbursement rates as well as fewer reimbursable doctor visits last quarter, taking a bite out of the top and bottom line. For its first quarter of 2017, athenahealth earned an operating profit of 32 cents per share, missing estimates of 46 cents per share. Sales of $285.4 million missed the outlook for revenue of $296.6 million. The core of ATHN stock’s 19.3% setback today, however, was in response to the YOY decline in earnings for the first quarter, and an alarming contraction for its full-year outlook. The company now expects to only earn between $36 million and $46 million for 2017, down from previous guidance for a full-year profit of between $61 million and $81 million. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The Nasdaq Composite pushed further above the 6,000 level at the open, setting a new intra-day high after a batch of big-tech earnings overnight. But the results were mixed, with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) disappointing. Also, weighing on sentiment is lingering disappointment with President Trump’s tax proposal on Wednesday (light on details and set to add trillions to the national debt), a lack of progress on healthcare reform, and ongoing concerns about a potential government shutdown (despite a one-week stopgap bill moving through Congress). But above all, investors were unhappy with a very weak Q1 U.S. GDP growth report: Coming in at just 0.7% as consumer spending posted its weakest result since the end of 2009. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% as it bonked on overhead resistance from its early March highs, the S&P 500 lost 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite lost a fraction and the Russell 2000 finished 1.2% lower. Treasury bonds were unchanged, the dollar was little change, gold gained 0.2% and crude oil gained 0.7% but was unable to recover the 1.3% loss from Thursday. The gains in T-bonds boosted the ProShares Ultra Treasury Bond (NYSEARCA:UBT) to a 0.9% gain so far this month for Edge subscribers. Breadth was negative, with 1.6 decliners for every advancer on the NYSE on heavy volume, at 122% of the 30-day average. Technology stocks led the way with a 0.3% gain thanks mainly to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). The vertical surge in GOOG looks a lot like the 1999/2000 dot-com craziness as investors piled in following the reporting of better-than-expected results on strong advertising revenue on Thursday night. On the downside, Time Inc (NYSE:TIME) fell 16.9% after announcing it had rejected a number of expressions of buyout interest — fueling fears of fiefdom on the part of management. Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) fell 15.9% after a big Q1 earnings miss on higher loan loss reserves. Intel Corporation (NYSE:INTC) fell 3.5% despite reporting solid results amid a focus on weakness in its data center group. And Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) fell 2% after reporting weaker-than-expected comp-store sales growth and issued lowered earnings guidance. Returning to the economy, GDP growth slowed from the 2.1% pace set in 4Q16 to its slowest pace in three years. Personal consumption increased just 0.3% following a 3.5% expansion in Q4; which is exceedingly odd given off-the-charts survey-based measures of consumer confidence in recent months. Bright spots included non-residential fixed investments (businesses are ramping up spending). Inventories were a drag. Still, the weakness doesn’t appear set to slow the Federal Reserve rate hike pace. Inflation picked up, rising at a 2.4% annual rate for the biggest jump since 2011. The labor market remains strong. Confidence levels are high. And Wall Street anticipates a Q2 rebound in GDP growth. We’ll know more when the Federal Reserve holds its policy meeting next Wednesday and when the latest jobs numbers are released on Friday. We’ll also get updates on personal income and consumption, motor vehicle sales (a recent worry), and fresh data on labor costs and productivity. It’s a busy schedule, made worse by the ongoing need for Congress and the White House to pass a long-term budget deal. Expect market volatility to intensify. In anticipation, Edge Pro subscribers added a new put option position against Bank of America (BAC) as the bank looks ready to drop out of a large head-and-shoulders reversal pattern that traces a price target below its 200-day moving average.

"Apple's doing so many things right. It's making the best products, developing a deep ecosystem with a substantial service revenue stream," the "Mad Money" host said Plus, Apple's upcoming iPhone release is rumored to have an array of new features that makes the smartphone more functional and easier to handle, which should boost sales and new customer numbers, Cramer said. The company also stands to massively benefit from repatriation if the administration is able to implement it. All said and done, Cramer says investors should own the stock, not trade it, and eager buyers should hope for a post-earnings dip so they can buy it at a discount. Victor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images As the busiest week of earnings season came to a close, Cramer breathed a sigh of relief despite Friday's mild pullback caused by a weaker-than-expected GDP number. The "Mad Money" host said that with the federal government funded through the next week, investors can finally relax and gear up for yet another earnings-filled agenda. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices reports earnings, and after shares of competitor Intel slid on its earnings miss on Thursday, Cramer is unsure that even the best of earnings reports from this chipmaker will garner a positive market reaction. Aside from Apple, Tuesday will bring an earnings report from health-care retailer CVS, where Cramer says there could be a hidden upside to earnings. "It's hard to really dislike a well run company like this that sells at just 13 times earnings. I say wait and see. Maybe numbers come down, maybe that's your chance," the "Mad Money" host said. On Wednesday, the market will get Facebook's results. The social media colossus reports earnings after the bell, and unless its numbers are substantially better, Cramer expects a slight sell-off. "I like how competitive Facebook is," Cramer said. "If you don't own it now, I think you might as well wait to see if we get that kind of weird sell-off that we usually get even after it reports a great number." The gaming sector is one of Cramer's favorite secular growth stories in the stay-at-home economy, and Activision Blizzard's earnings reports have a tendency to spur selling, which may happen when it releases numbers on Thursday. "I say the trend's your friend," Cramer said. "This franchise is worth buying if it gets hit." The Labor Department will release its monthly non-farm payroll data on Friday. The statistics could have a detrimental effect on bank stocks if they are low, but Cramer expects the opposite. "If April turns out to have been a robust hiring month, and I think it will be, that gives the Fed breathing room to raise interest rates twice, and therefore the bank stocks will soar," he said. Gary Cameron | Reuters Jeff Bezos When Amazon and Alphabet reported earnings at the same exact time Thursday night, Cramer found it difficult to compare the two and pick a winner. "The problem is that in some ways, this is a real apples-to-oranges situation," the "Mad Money" host said. Amazon, for example, chooses to promote faith-based investing, assuring shareholders that their India business will flourish and that robots will save time at their fulfillment centers. Alphabet went about energizing investors in a different way. They talked about how their search engines help local businesses and about their cloud operations, which compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Cramer also spoke with Stephen Milligan, the CEO of Western Digital, a data storage player and one of the world's biggest hard disk drive manufacturers. Milligan said that the company's longtime partnership with troubled electronics giant Toshiba was worth preserving despite the Japanese giant's current difficulties. "The joint venture that we've had with Toshiba is 17 years running. I would contend that it's probably one of the most successful technology joint ventures in the history of our industry. And so our first goal is let's keep that joint venture healthy," Milligan told Cramer on Friday. While the CEO acknowledged that helping Toshiba could create a bit of an overhang in terms of how investors perceive Western Digital, his main focus remained on growing his own business. "Rest assured, we're going to do our very best to make sure that we protect our interests and advance not only our position, but the stakeholders that Toshiba has, and really come to a resolution that helps us to continue to be successful going forward," the CEO said. Mark Neuling | CNBC Jean-Jacques Bienaime, CEO, BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Upon the release of BioMarin's orphan drug Brineura, which made headlines for its $702,000-per-year price tag, chairman and CEO JJ Bienaimé said the system will have the final say on whether the sky-high price is fair. "Obviously, the system will have to determine that," he told Cramer on Friday. But I would say that CLN2, the disease that Brineura is being used for, is an absolutely devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which, unfortunately, the patients will lose their life, most of the time by [age] 12." And although Washington lawmakers have knocked pharmaceutical companies for high drug costs, Bienaimé said most policymakers understand the industry's inevitable trial-and-error aspects. "I think, hopefully, ... if there is any kind of regulations coming around health care, that they will make sure that those regulations protect innovation and protect innovative biotech companies," Bienaimé said. Finally, Cramer spoke with AGCO Chairman, President and CEO Martin Richenhagen to understand more about how President Donald Trump's protectionist slant might affect the agricultural landscape. AGCO manufactures agricultural equipment like tractors that require steel to produce. Richenhagen said that if the current administration were to follow through with placing high tariffs on non-U.S. steel, the effects would be felt industry-wide. "For us, of course, if steel's prices would go up because of this kind of protectionism, it wouldn't be so good because finally our customers would have to pay. So that's true for all of us, for the whole industry," the CEO told Cramer on Friday. Richenhagen added that while the move would benefit the steel industry, it was "not really a great strategy" to implement tariffs without explicitly informing consumers of their effects. "All kind of protectionism finally has to be paid for," he said. "And I think consumers should know that." In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Bank of the Internet USA: "I don't know. Too much risk there, my friend. I'd rather own JPMorgan. I think that's a little more, let's just say, strong." Agilent Technologies: "Oh my, I like Agilent so much. I like the quarter. You can win two ways here: you can win on an acquisition or you can win on earnings. That's how good that quarter was. Terrific." Questions for Cramer?

By Rene Ritchie Friday, Apr 28, 2017 at 3:31 pm EDT 4 Comments Should you buy the 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Pro? Here's how to choose! Apple currently offers the MacBook Pro in two sizes: 13-inch and 15-inch. They differ in ways beyond simply display size though, including the overall weight and footprint, and details of the ports and the potential of their processors. So, how do you decide between them? See our pick for the best Apple laptop. MacBook Pro lineup If you look at Apple's current MacBook Pro lineup, even excluding the 12-inch MacBook and legacy 13-inch MacBook Air, there's still a ton to choose from. Especially when you consider Apple still offers last year's MacBook Pro 13-inch and 15-inch alongside this year's models. For this, I'll be referring to the 2016 MacBook Pro, though many of the points will also pertain to 2015 pros as well. Weight and size With great size comes great weight. Or something like that. What I mean is, those extra 2-inches (diagonal) of display come with a bigger footprint, which means your MacBook Pro will take up more room on the table, from your desk to the coffee shop to the tray on the train or airplane. It'll also weigh more in your laptop bag. The 13-inch MacBook Pro weighs 3.02 pounds (1.37 kg). The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs 4.02 pounds (1.83 kg). That might not sound like a huge difference, but if you're walking around all day, it might just feel like one. If portability is most important to you, get the 13-inch MacBook Pro. If power beats portability, get the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Displays MacBook Pro was the first Mac to go "Retina", or what Apple calls a display dense enough that you can no longer see pixels at a normal working distance. They remain Retina to this day so, no matter which one you get, the quality will be the same. What about the quantity, though? The 13-inch MacBook Pro has a 2560x1600 16:10 display at 227 ppi. The 15-inch MacBook Pro has a 2880x1800 16:10 display at 220 ppi. More display means seeing either more of the web and more of apps you can cram onto it, including interface and toolbars. Or, if accessibility is an issue, seeing bigger of all the same. Here's how the pixel differences look side-by-side: If size doesn't matter to you, save some space and dollars and get the 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you want the largest possible display, you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro. External displays You can also drive external displays with the MacBook Pro. Due to a difference in the bandwidth supplied to the Thunderbolt 3 ports on both sides of the 2016 MacBook Pro, however, you can't drive as many on the 13-inch. Specifically, the 13-inch MacBook Pro can support up to two 4096x2304 (4K) or one 5120x2880 (5K) display. The 15-inch MacBook Pro, though, can drive up to four 4096x2304 (4K) or two 5120x2880 (5K) displays. If you don't need an external display, or one need a one or two, the 13-inch is fine. If you want to drive four 4K or two 5K external displays, you want a 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016. Processors The central processing unit (CPU) is what powers the MacBook Pro. MacBook Pro 2016 has Intel's Skylake processors for both the 13-inch and 15-inch models. The 13-inch model starts with a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 or 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor for the version without the Touch Bar, and 2.9GHz or 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, or 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor for the version with Touch Bar. The 15-inch has options for a 2.6GHz, 2.7GHz, or 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. If absolute power doesn't matter, don't give Intel any more money and stick with the 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you want maximum performance for things like video editing, you want a quad-core 15-inch MacBook Pro. Graphics The graphics processing unit (GPU) handles rendering and pushing the pixels. That includes everything from the macOS interface to photo and video editors to video games. The more powerful the GPU, the more pixels it can render and push, and the smoother and better the animations, apps, and the more realistic 3D you'll get. MacBook Pro 2016 has Intel Iris Graphics 540 for the 13-inch version without Touch Bar and Intel Iris Graphics 550 for the 13-inch version with Touch Bar. The 15-inch version has both Intel HD Graphics 530 for low power and discreet graphics for high performance. There are options for Radeon Pro 450 with 2GB of GDDR5 or 460 with 4GB of GDDR5 on the 13-inch model, or Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB of GDDR5 or Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB of GDDR5 on the 15-inch model. If you graphics needs are casual at best, the 13-inch MacBook Pro can save you some cach. If you want the biggest graphics boost you can get, you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Battery Life All versions of the MacBook Pro 2016 are rated for 10-hours of web browsing or iTunes movie playback and 30 days on standby. (iTunes movie playback is hardware accelerated, so YouTube in Chrome will consume way more power, for example.) Those are for base models, though. The higher the processor and graphics options you get, and the harder you push them, the less battery life you'll get. Battery life is pretty much the same on all models, just know that the more and hotter you push them, the more you'll have to charge them. Memory The amount of random access memory (RAM) in your Mac determines how many apps you can keep live at a time, how big your photo or video editing projects can be without having to swap data out back and forth on the drive, and otherwise keeps everything super fast. The 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 without Touch Bar starts with 8GB of 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory and can go to 16GB. The 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar starts at 8GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory and can go to 16GB. The 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 only comes with 16GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory. If you don't want 16 GB of RAM, you need to go 13-inch MacBook Pro. All MacBooks Pro currently max out at 16 GB, so if that's what you want, get any MacBook Pro you want. Storage Storage used to consist of big, noisy hard drive platters that spun around and didn't take well to bumps or power problems. Now they're solid state — Flash chips with no moving parts. They don't hold as much as old-style hard drives and are still more expensive, but they're ultra-fast and far more resilient. The 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 comes with 256GB PCIe Flash storage but can go up to 1 TB. The 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 starts with 256GB PCI Flash storage on the low-end model, 512GB PCIe Flash storage on the high-end model, and both can go to 2 TB. If you want the largest amount of storage possible — 2 TB — you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016. Ports Wired connections like USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 let you connect to high-performance accessories like external displays, drives, networks, and more. The 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 without the Touch Bar has 2x Thunderbolt 3 ports (USB-C), both the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 with the Touch Bar have 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports (USB-C), though the two right ports on the 13-inch aren't full speed. If you want the most, fastest ports possible, you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Who should get the 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016? If you value portability over power, don't need to drive double the displays, are fine with fewer processor cores and lower end memory and graphics options, and otherwise want a pro without paying top dollar for it, get a 13-inch MacBook Pro. See at Apple Who should get the 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016? If you want power, the biggest display possible, the ability to drive ridiculous amounts of external display, and options for the most memory, processor cores, and graphics chips availale, you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro.

I hope it goes to 32 gigs, but will be happy wit 16. And I hope the 13 inch has full speed ports on the right. But even if it doesn't, no problem. I'll be getting a Thunderbolt 3 dock. 0 8 hours ago Reply Planetary Paul As my 2010 15" MBP reached EOL, I got the latest fattest 2016 15" MBP. Fab machine that will serve me well for many years to come. 0 8 hours ago Reply Moodyz 13" MBP is underpowered and overpriced, while the 15" MBP is simply just way overpriced. Decided to wait till the new iMac is announced. Hopefully Apple don't jack up the price as heinously as they did with the MBPs, though I'm not hopeful. If pricing remains similar as the current 5K iMac levels, I'll sacrifice mobility for power. Currently using the previous gen 13" MBP, and while it's served me well over the last 3.5 years, I recently upgraded to a 50+ megapixel camera, and things aren't as zippy as they used to be with my old 30+ megapixel files in Adobe Lightroom. 0 5 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

The week when all of the makers, the tallest and the smallest, get together to talk about the looks they love, the technology they’re using, and the newest concepts and products they’re dreaming up. From streetwear to downtown Portland to sporting goods to candy, everything’s on the drawing board. We started out the festival last week with a live “Think Out Loud” show at the Redd, an old industrial building in Southeast Portland that’s serving as DWP’s headquarters. This week, we’re packaging some of those interviews together with new reported stories from the rest of the fest. University of Portland senior Kaylie Van Loo, at practice. April Baer/OPB JavHack: Reimagining Sports Ergonomics - 5:48 You might not think the javelin needs innovation. It worked for 400,000 years of human history, right? But track and field athletes are always pushing the limits. We spoke with record-breaking javelin thrower Tom Petronoff about the need for a new design vision and the time he almost speared Alberto Salazar. You can see videos of some high-class javelin chucking and a vintage clip of Tom Petranoff narrated by Caitlyn Jenner here.  Still from MacGregor Campbell's "They Mostly Come at Night" as a part of AEPDX's "Draems" animation challenge.  Courtesy MacGregor Campbell Cutting Edge Pixels With The Annual Animation Challenge - 10:04 Jamal Qutub has been in love with animation since he was a kid. For work, he creates animations for clients like Adidas and Intel, but in his spare time, Qutub runs AEPDX, a meetup group for local animators. For the past three years, Qutub has been putting together an animation challenge during Design Week. Local animators submit short films to be viewed and voted on by an audience of their peers and interested DWP spectators. Check out six of our favorite animations here. And if you’re excited about Portland’s booming animation scene, make sure to check out OPB’s deep dive on all things Oregon animation on “Oregon Art Beat.” It’s all about how the local industry grew from a couple of singing raisins sculpted in clay to things like 3-D printed Boxtrolls and samurais. An aerial image of where the green loop might eventually be in Portland. Untitled Studio Portland’s Highline? A Proposed Park That Wants To Change How You See The City - 18:04 Last year, Design Week featured a challenge to design a 6-mile linear park circling downtown Portland called the Green Loop. Now the winners, Untitled Studio, are taking the conceptual idea one step further with an interactive exhibit as part of this year’s festival. They stop in to tell us about their big dreams and why Portland needs the Green Loop. You can see Untitled’s plans and their life-size mock-up for the Green Loop at the Redd Building until Saturday, April 29 at 2 p.m.  Jami Curl's candy cookbook "Candy is Magic" is chock-full of inventive recipes and dazzling photos.  Photo copyright Maggie Kirkland QUIN Candy’s Magical Confections - 30:42 What could be better at the end of Design Week Portland than dessert? Jami Curl told a sweet story on Friday about how she built two successful companies, QUIN Candy and Saint Cupcake, that stand out in the forest of Portland food brands. We visited her at her QUIN Candy production room this week and heard all about her candy design. Curl will read from her new candy cookbook, “Candy is Magic,” at Powell’s City of Books on April 30, and she shared a recipe for shimmery Chocolate Magic Dust from it just for you. Constructed in 2008, Maya Lin's Bird Blind lies tucked away in the Sandy River Delta. It's one of five completed installations by the Confluence Project. April Baer/OPB Design In The Forest: Maya Lin’s Bird Blind - 37:33 So many design stories originate on desktops and drafting tables, but we found one that must be experienced with hiking boots on. While Design Week took out a busload of explorers, we headed out to explore the Sandy River Delta with biologist Bill Weiler, Confluence Project member Colin Fogarty and designer Dylan Woock.  In 2004, the Confluence Project kicked off with the goal of connecting people with places in the Columbia Basin. Confluence’s renowned artist and designer Maya Lin took on this challenge, and created an elliptical immersive sculpture out of wood and metal that blends effortlessly into the terrain.  You can get directions to the Bird Blind and see photos of it here.  dfrntpigeon designer Dani Courtesy of dfrntpigeon Portland At-Risk Youth Create Streetwear Label - 43:45 “Don’t just rise, take flight” is the tagline of streetwear label dfrntpigeon, which is a collaboration between the non-profit New Avenues for Youth and branding gurus AKQA. Run by marginalized and homeless youth, the agency designs and sells shirts and apparel that are expressive, political, sometimes humorous, and sometimes dark. They’ve just released their newest line of tees, the Identity Collection, with screen printed shirts like “Humanity,” which shows four forearms holding a cigarette, a grenade, an hourglass and a digital clock, surrounded by a ring of flowers. design art oregon portland More State of Wonder A Hike In The Sky: The Path To Maya Lin's Sandy River Bird Blind Oregon Book Award Winners Announced 2017 Oregon Book Awards: The Nonfiction Nominees Portland Writers Group The Guttery Challenges Notion Of Solitary Writing More OPB Red-Light Cameras Could Nab Speeders Under Proposed Oregon Law Public Employees Rally At Oregon Capitol Oregon's Congressional Delegation Pushes Bill To Prepare For Railroad Derailments, Spills Follow State of Wonder Thanks to our Sponsors: become a sponsor Related Content At-Risk Youth Learn Job And Design Skills At dfrntpigeon Apparel Company OPB | Broadcast: April 21, 2017 A Hike In The Sky: The Path To Maya Lin's Sandy River Bird Blind OPB | April 28, 2017 Hacking The Javelin At Design Week Portland OPB | April 25, 2017 Thanks to our Sponsors become a sponsor About FAQs Employment Volunteering Internships Producing for OPB Accessibility Hire OPB Pressroom OPB Public Files Contact Email OPB Newsroom Connect Facebook Twitter Reception Issues Mobile Podcasts Mobile Apps Newsletters RSS Feeds Support Contribute Sponsorship Leadership Giving Planned Giving Vehicle Donations Volunteering Shop Shop Legal Privacy Policy Terms of Use Editorial Policy Contest Rules FCC Public Files KOPB-TV KOAB-TV KOAC-TV KEPB-TV KTVR © 2017, Oregon Public Broadcasting

Even the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite couldn’t hold on to an early gain and trailed southward all day. Tech and energy were Friday’s best sectors while telecom and financials led the losers. WTI crude oil for June delivery settled at $49.33 a barrel, up 0.7% on the day but posted a monthly loss of 2.5%. June gold added 0.2% for the day to settle at $1,268.30, finishing the week down 1.6% and the month up about 1.3%. Equities were headed for a lower close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.22% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down 0.22%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded down 0.02%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Friday was Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) which traded down 3.78% at $36.01. The stock’s 52-week range is $29.50 to $38.45. Volume was about 90% above the daily average of around 23.6 million shares. The chipmaker announced first-quarter results last night that were good, but not good enough. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) traded down 1.45% at $45.99. The stock’s 52-week range is $45.94 to $56.95 and the low was posted this afternoon. Volume was about 25% above the daily average of around 15.6 million shares. The company had no specific news. American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) traded down 1.28% at $79.31. The stock’s 52-week range is $57.15 to $82.00. Volume was just above the daily average of around 4 million shares. The credit card issuer had no specific news. McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) traded down 0.76% at $139.80. The stock’s 52-week range is $110.33 to $142.79. Volume was about a 10% below the daily average of around 3.8 million. The company had no specific news Friday. Of the Dow stocks, 10 are on track to close higher Friday and 20 are set to close lower.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq reached a new record intraday high in early trading but pulled back into negative territory. The Nasdaq ended the day just below the unchanged line, edging down 1.33 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 6,047.61. The Dow dipped 40.82 points or 0.2 percent to 20,940.51, and the S&P 500 slipped 4.57 points or 0.2 percent to 2,384.20. Despite the lower close on the day, the major averages moved notably higher for the week. The Nasdaq surged up by 2.3 percent, while the Dow and the S&P 500 jumped by 1.9 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. The modest weakness on Wall Street came after President Donald Trump warned of a major conflict with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. "There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely," Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. Trump said he wants to resolve the standoff with North Korea peacefully but argued a diplomatic solution is "very difficult." On the U.S. economic front, the Commerce Department released a report showing that economic growth slowed by more than anticipated in the first three months of 2017. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased by 0.7 percent in the first quarter after jumping by 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 1.2 percent. The weaker than expected increase in GDP in the first quarter represents the worst performance since a 1.2 percent decline in the first quarter of 2014. Among individual stocks, shares of Intel (INTC) moved notably lower after the semiconductor giant reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates but on weaker than expected revenues. Wearable camera maker GoPro (GPRO) also came under pressure after reporting a narrower than expected first quarter loss but disappointing shipments. Meanwhile, shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) showed a strong upward move after the parent of Google reported better than expected first quarter earnings and revenues. Sector News Semiconductor stocks saw considerable weakness on the day after trending higher in recent sessions. After ending Thursday's trading at its best closing level in over sixteen years, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell by 1.7 percent. Cavium (CAVM), Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), and Microsemi (MSCC) turned in some of the semiconductor sector's worst performances. Significant weakness was also visible among housing stocks, as reflected by the 1.5 percent loss posted by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index. The drop by the index came after it ended Thursday's trading at its best closing level in eleven years. Banking, transportation, and commercial real estate stocks also saw notable weakness, while substantial strength was visible in the gold and electronic storage sectors. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.3 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index crept up by 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets moved to the downside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index slid by 0.5 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index both edged down by 0.1 percent. In the bond market, treasuries moved modestly higher over the course of the session after seeing early weakness. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, dipped 1.4 basis points to 2.292 percent. Looking Ahead The Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcement is likely to be in focus next week along with the Labor Department's monthly jobs report. While the Fed is likely to leave interest rates unchanged, traders will examine the accompanying statement for clues about future rate hikes. Along with the jobs report, traders are likely to keep an eye on reports on personal income and spending, manufacturing and service sector activity, and labor productivity and costs. Earnings news will also continue to attract attention next week, with a slew of companies due to report their quarterly results. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Next Story More Top Stories Reebok Trolls Nordstrom With $425 Sweat-Stained Shirt Former President George H.W.

Fittingly, Silverstone's next Vital-series chassis is a bit different from its predecessor. The Vital VT02 is once again designed for motherboards in the Mini-STX form factor, but this time, the unit has room for a pair of 2.5" drives. Two 2.5" devices may not seem like a lot of storage, but in a device that's under two liters in total volume it's pretty impressive. The Vital VT02 can also fit Intel's standard boxed cooler, so builders don't have to worry about shelling out for a low-profile heatsink. The case has USB Type-A and Type-C ports on the front, as well as your standard 3.5-mm headphone and mic jacks. The actual dimensions of the case are 6.5" by 2.87" by 6.16" (16.5 by 7.3 by 15.6cm)—even smaller than a Nintendo Wii U. You won't be fitting a graphics card or a power supply in the VT02, but that's sort of missing the point anyway. Silverstone also includes a VESA mount for attaching the VT02 to a wall or the back of a monitor. Silverstone will sell the chassis for just $31.50, or 28.90€, when it goes on sale.  Mini-STX is an Intel-driven standard, and as of yet, the only boards in that size are for LGA 1151 CPUs. AMD's upcoming Raven Ridge processors seem like an ideal fit for small form-factor applications like this, however, so hopefully some enterprising motherboard vendor steps up to the plate.

The U.S. economy grew at a rate of 0.7 percent, below a Reuters estimate of 1.2 percent. Earnings continue to come in strong, with Alphabet, Amazon and General Motors all topping expectations. Fred Imbert | @foimbert 10 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Earnings the big story as markets open    17 Hours Ago | 02:45 U.S. equities closed lower on Friday as investors digested economic data and key corporate earnings, but ended April with strong monthly gains. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped about 40 points, with Intel and Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent, with financials and telecommunications leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite hit a fresh record high before closing marginally lower. That said, the three major indexes posted a monthly advance of about 1 percent. The S&P and the Dow posted their fifth positive month in six, while the Nasdaq recorded its sixth straight monthly gain. A large portion of those gains came this week. Stocks posted sharp rallies on Monday and Tuesday as corporate earnings season continued to reveal strong performances from some of the top companies in the world. Major indexes this month Source: FactSet "It seems like the earnings and the reduced anxiety over the policy agenda are driving the markets this week," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. About 190 S&P components reported this week. Here are some of most recent results: General Motors: earnings per share of $1.70 on sales of $41.2 billion, versus $1.46 per share and $40.75 billion expected by Thomson One analysts' consensus. Amazon: earnings per share of $1.48 on sales of $35.7 billion, versus a Thomson One consensus of $1.12 earnings per share on sales of $35.3 billion. Alphabet: earnings per share of $7.73 on revenue of $24.75 billion, versus a Thomson One estimate of $7.39 earnings per share on sales of $24.22 billion. "I think this earnings cycle is doing a good job of justifying these valuations," said David Schiegoleit, managing director of investments at U.S Bank Private Client Reserve. Friday was also a big day for economic data. The U.S economy grew at a rate of 0.7 percent in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by Reuters expected growth of 1.2 percent. But the latest CNBC/Moody's Analytics survey tracked economic growth at 0.8 percent and the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow tracked GDP at a 0.2 percent growth rate. "While a bit disappointing, this number fits in with the seasonal pattern that we have seen over the past few years, where Q1 has tended to be weak," said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "But there was some hope that the recent jump in consumer and business confidence would translate into better growth." Treasury yields hovered around breakeven after the GDP data release. As of 3:09 p.m. ET, the benchmark 10-year yield traded at 2.27 percent, while the short-term two-year note yield hovered around 1.27 percent. Brendan McDermid | Reuters NYSE Traders on the floor. "Economic data is being overshadowed by earnings and the fluidity of economic policy," said said State Street's Arone. "I think the market was already expecting the Q1 number to be pretty low so [investors] discounted that." Other economic data released Friday included the Chicago PMI, which unexpectedly rose, and the April read on consumer sentiment inched higher. Meanwhile, investors kept on mulling over the White House's outline for its vision of tax reform, The proposal slashes the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. The White House added there will be a "one-time tax" on the trillions of dollars held by corporations overseas. However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the rate for that tax has yet to be determined. "At the end of the day, when you think about where this thing can go, you need to figure out where you're getting the money to fund this," said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. "The government is going to run out of money if we give everyone a tax cut. That's a given." Geopolitical tensions remained in traders' minds as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged the United Nations to impose new sanctions against North Korea. "We must work together to adopt a new approach and impose increased diplomatic and economic pressures on the North Korean regime," Tillerson said. "There are a lot of competing forces in the market, ... and we're seeing a result where everything is balancing out," said U.S Bank's Schiegoleit.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BIG DATA Cloudera ends first day of trading with $2.3 billion market cap, 44% lower than 2014 valuation Jordan Novet@jordannovet April 28, 2017 1:16 PM Above: Cloudera at the New York Stock Exchange. Image Credit: NYSE Twitter account Open source big data company Cloudera is now, finally, a public company. Today the company traded for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), after filing to go public last month. In 2014, when Intel made a major investment in Cloudera, the latter was reported to boast a $4.1 billion valuation. Other investors include Greylock Partners and Accel Partners. Today, after the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closed, the company’s stock price settled at $18.10 — up 1.7 percent from today’s $17.80 opening price — giving the company a $2.3 billion market cap. In other words, investors think the company is worth a bit more than half what other investors did three years back, when the company was bringing in considerably less revenue. The 9-year-old company originally focused on outdoing startups in the then-burgeoning big data category — particularly emphasizing the Hadoop collection of open-source software for storing and processing lots of different kinds of data — and has increasingly targeted database software and cloud service providers. Competitors include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Databricks, Hortonworks, IBM, MapR, Microsoft, Oracle, and among others.

Microsoft is developing a worrying habit of neglecting its hardware products. Peter Bright - Apr 28, 2017 7:17 pm UTC At first glance, it's easy to mistake the Surface Pro 4 for the Surface Pro 3. reader comments 166 Share this story Microsoft's third-quarter financial results were published yesterday, and they had many high points: cloud revenue is growing well (though we have some misgivings about how the numbers are reported), Windows outperformed the PC market, and Office 365 passed 100 million corporate seats. But there were a couple of significant black marks: Phone revenue has dropped to effectively zero, and Surface revenue was down sharply year on year, with a 26-percent drop in revenue. The phone revenue is no big surprise: Microsoft has all but abandoned the market, and the last phones to sport a Microsoft logo—the Lumia 950 and 950 XL—are no longer sold. The company has been winding down its phone operation, writing off the entire value of the phone business it bought from Nokia and laying off thousands of former Nokia employees in the process. But the story with Surface is more unsettling. In its analyst call, Microsoft ascribed the drop in Surface revenue to "product end-of-lifecycle dynamics," whatever that means. The company's 10Q filing used rather clearer language: Microsoft simply didn't sell as many Surface systems. The Surface range has two main products: the Surface Pro 4, a tablet-style two-in-one, and the Surface Book, a laptop with a detachable screen. These systems were launched in November 2015. The Surface Pro 4 available today, about 18 months later, is unchanged. Surface Book has been slightly updated—a variant with a better GPU was added in November 2016. But it, too, is little altered. These portable systems were joined late last year by the Surface Studio, a fascinating but flawed desktop system. With its high price—it starts at a dollar shy of three thousand bucks—and niche utility—it's compelling if you're in the market for a Wacom digitizer, but otherwise something of a curate's egg—Surface Studio is not designed to be a big seller with mainstream appeal. Microsoft didn't offer numbers, but we'd imagine that the majority of Surface sales are of the portables. The march of technology Eighteen months is a long time to wait for systems to be refreshed. The Pro 4 and Book were early adopters of Intel's Skylake processors, but Skylake is now a generation old. Kaby Lake, which started shipping last autumn, is not a huge advance over Skylake, but it's a more power-efficient design that offers meaningful improvements in battery life, improved encoding and decoding support for 4K video, and, for the low-power Y-series parts, meaningful improvements in performance. Surface Pro 4 uses a Y-series part in the cheapest model, and it would stand to make big gains from a Kaby Lake upgrade. Microsoft wouldn't even have to do much work to make such a switch; Kaby Lake is pretty much a drop-in replacement for Skylake. Enlarge / Microsoft's Surface Book. Nathan Fitch The last 18 months have also seen significant growth in the adoption of USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3, which offer standardized single-cable charging and docking. While Thunderbolt 3 is still young, hardware companies are experimenting with concepts such as Thunderbolt 3 monitors that charge laptops over the same cable used to carry the display signal, external GPUs, and docking stations that are no longer specific to particular hardware models (or even OEMs). Indeed, it feels like a natural fit for a revised version of the existing Surface Dock, or even, dare we dream, a standalone version of the mouth-wateringly beautiful touch screen of the Surface Studio. USB Type-C is rapidly gaining adoption; it has already become the norm for phone charging (for Android, at least) and increasingly is being favored for laptop charging. The slimline ports enable thinner PCs, and the ability to use a single port for power, USB connectivity, and video output is compelling. No Surface product supports either technology. The Surface portable line-up, the bread and butter of the Surface brand, is looking very neglected. Further ReadingSurface Book with Performance Base: A lot more graphics in a little more weight At their release, the Pro 4 and Book were both arguably class-leading machines: 18 months later, they look sad and stale. Last November, we felt that we couldn't recommend the Surface Book's version with the updated GPU to most buyers—we couldn't justify buying a Skylake system with Nvidia 900-series graphics when the state of the art was Kaby Lake and 1000-series GPUs. Six months later, the machine looks even less appealing. With this stagnation, falling sales are inevitable. Until Microsoft shows the brand some love, the decline will only continue. We're not expecting to see that love any time soon, either; the company's guidance for the current quarter is that Surface sales will continue to fall. Microsoft is holding an event next week, and we expect there to be some hardware element, but we've also heard from sources close to the matter that there won't be updates to the Surface Pro or Surface Book. Either do hardware properly, or stop pretending If Microsoft wants to make PC hardware, it needs to do so properly and commit to the same kinds of updates as other PC OEMs. Almost every other PC OEM has refreshed its systems for Kaby Lake. Almost every other PC OEM has adopted, at least for machines in the premium space that Surface occupies, USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3. Surface Pro—a machine which, in its early generations, arguably defined that particular style of two-in-one systems—is no longer unique. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, and others all have solid two-in-one offerings. These machines are modeled after the Surface Pro concept, but they now embody that concept better than Microsoft's own system. The Surface has been out-Surfaced. The failure to do anything with Surface for so long makes us wonder just what Microsoft is up to. If the company is serious about its hardware ambitions—and officially, at least, it still says that its intent is to produce market-leading systems under the Surface brand—then it has to take its hardware seriously. That means refreshing it to keep pace with the competition. Further ReadingImagining a new Mac Pro, the “iMac Pro,” and the future of Apple’s desktops One hardware company has a similarly lackadaisical approach to updating: Apple. In recent years, refreshes of Mac laptops and desktop systems across the lineup have slowed down. While the company has been quick to pick up Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C on at least some of its machines, the broader failure to keep pace with the state of the art is a continued source of frustration for Apple loyalists. But Apple's hardware sales remain robust, because Apple, in a very important way, is not like Microsoft or any other PC OEM: if you want to run macOS in a legal and supported way, you simply have no option but to buy Apple hardware. There's no corresponding necessity when it comes to buying Surface. Microsoft is but one Windows OEM of many, and if Microsoft's hardware isn't offering the right feature mix, a system from HP or Dell or Lenovo or Samsung or some other company probably will. It's fine for Microsoft to take inspiration from Apple's close cooperation between hardware and software development; it's not fine for Microsoft to mimic Apple's unpredictable and inconsistent system refresh policies. The PC market dynamics don't allow it. Enlarge / Instead of a full refresh, Microsoft released the Surface Book with Performance Base. The base is a little fatter, its battery is bigger, and its GPU is faster. Peter Bright When Microsoft first started making hardware, there was widespread uncertainty as to what the company was hoping to do. General consensus was that Redmond's aim was to serve as a kind of trailblazer, building the kinds of systems that the company wanted to see in the world while pushing the PC market in the direction it wanted. But this kind of hobby approach is a problem. Without assurances of a long-term commitment to hardware development, many would-be customers will avoid the systems. This is particularly acute in the corporate space: support lifecycles and extended system availability are essential when buying a fleet of systems. Microsoft recognized this concern and took action to address it. Surface systems were offered through the usual corporate channel partners like Ingram Micro and through cloud subscriptions, and the company promised that Surface Pro 3 peripherals would remain compatible with Surface Pro 4. The message was clear: Microsoft wasn't merely dabbling in hardware, it was investing in building a serious hardware brand. After some early missteps, the hardware was solid and well-received, revenue grew steadily, and Surface looked like it was becoming an integral part of Microsoft's ecosystem. That feels like it's now in jeopardy. Troubling precedent It doesn't help that Microsoft's hardware track record is more than a little shaky, and skepticism about its commitment and seriousness to hardware is well-earned. After a difficult start, Windows Phone was finally on an upward trajectory, especially in the EU where, in some countries, it had broken double-digit market share. But lackluster hardware—including a complete failure to offer a competitive new flagship phone in 2014—and lack of clear messaging saw a complete reversal of fortunes. The ultimate result was felt this quarter: Phone revenue is now essentially zero, even as work on the mobile version of Windows 10 continues. Enlarge / The last high-end phones Microsoft released were the Lumia 950 (pictured) and 950 XL, which came out in November 2015. Peter Bright Surface RT and Surface 2, Microsoft's ARM-based two-in-one machines, similarly raise questions about the company's commitment to hardware. Although Windows 10 itself has been built for ARM systems (and a version of Windows 10 for ARM is on the market in the Internet of Things guise), Microsoft opted not to offer a Windows 10 upgrade for Surface RT or Surface 2. This leaves the machines basically orphaned. Microsoft's inaction has taken a promising prestige PC brand and turned it into a borderline embarrassment. The question of whether Microsoft cares about hardware and is in it for the long haul is once again a live one. We've seen similar levels of neglect before. It was ruinous for the Nokia phone business and devastating for Windows Phone. Windows on the desktop is, of course, going to prove more robust—it doesn't live and die on the fortunes of Surface in the way that Windows Phone hinged on Nokia and Lumia. But everything invested in building the Surface brand is now in doubt. That's bad for anyone who likes the machines, including those corporate buyers who have made the leap to Microsoft hardware. It's even worse for the software company's future ambitions: later this year, we're going to see a new generation of ARM machines running Windows. But with the way the company has treated its other hardware endeavors, who would want to take the gamble? Microsoft has developed a habit of ignoring and abandoning its niche hardware platforms; what reason is there to believe that Windows 10 for ARM will be any different?

Similar devices could monitor a range of variables, from bacterial levels in a river to heavy metal concentration in the atmosphere. Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, said that about 40 proposals to make the sensors had come in, and two would be shortlisted within the next month. Intel, which will make the chips powering the devices, and the DST would split the ₹35 crore investment. “Pebbles are an analogy; they could be any shape,” Mr. Sharma said. “The main criteria is that they be cheap and hardy.” The sensors will need to work for at least a year, getting power from solar, wind, flowing water, wave motion and mechanical vibrations. “We expect them to be ready within the next three years.” Mr. Sharma says the devices would complement important missions by serving critical real-time data for pre- and post-treatment analysis. Similar devices have been used to monitor the health of oil wells. “Because the purpose is that they be cheap we hope the resulting technology would be able to manufacture them in the thousands.” The sensors will be available to researchers working on projects that require environmental monitoring, and Intel would be able to test the longevity and sturdiness of their newly-developed chips. Officials said they hope the sensors will birth new technologies and find applications beyond monitoring the environment.

Windows 10 Creators WSL vs. Clear Linux vs. Ubuntu 17.04 Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 28 April 2017. Page 1 of 3. 13 Comments Windows 10 Creators Update was released earlier this month by Microsoft as the latest installment to Windows 10. Since it's been a few months since last benchmarking the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" (WSL), a.k.a. "Bash for Windows", here are some fresh benchmarks of Ubuntu atop Windows 10 Creators Update vs. Intel's Clear Linux vs. Ubuntu 17.04. The Windows Subsystem for Linux remains a very easy way if you need to run some Bash scripts, use SSH, etc from this Ubuntu environment atop Windows 10. The tests for this article were done with Windows 10 Creators Update and all available system updates as of 22 April. All of the testing was done with a Core i7 7700K system (4.2GHz base frequency, 4.5GHz turbo), 16GB DDR4, Samsung 950 PRO NVMe 256GB SSD, MSI Z270-A PRO motherboard, and HD Graphics 630. All the system hardware components remained the same during the benchmarking process. All of these benchmarks were done in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

The German company chose HPE’s Apollo 6000 system to play a central role in transforming its ability to run virtual and modelled experiments to bolster its industrial chemical research programmes. The supercomputer will be built and installed at BASF’s headquarters in Ludwigshafen, on the Rhine south of Frankfurt. Dr. Martin Brudermueller, Vice Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and Chief Technology Officer at BASF, said: “The new supercomputer will promote the application and development of complex modelling and simulation approaches, opening up completely new avenues for our research at BASF. The supercomputer was designed and developed jointly by experts from HPE and BASF to precisely meet our needs.” The machines will run on Intel Xeon chips and Omni-Path Fabric managed by HPE software. It can fit up to 160 servers in a single rack, giving a smaller footprint than a standard blade set-up. HPE administration software will simplify administration and workload management, as well as control energy and cooling costs. The deal will create one of the world’s largest supercomputers for use in private sector chemical research using several hundred computing nodes. The hardware will give an effective power of one petaflop – one quadrillion floating point operations per second. The machine will allow staff at BASF’s 70 research centres around the world to answer complex questions and slash the time required to obtain results from several months to days across all research areas. Running virtual experiments with the supercomputer is a major part of BASF’s digitisation process. The supercomputer will allow the company to greatly reduce the time to market for new products. It will also cut costs by simulating processes on catalyst surfaces more precisely and accelerating the design of new polymers with pre-defined properties. Meg Whitman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hewlett Packard Enterprise said in a statement: “In today’s data-driven economy, high performance computing plays a pivotal role in driving advances in space exploration, biology and artificial intelligence. We expect this supercomputer to help BASF perform prodigious calculations at lightning fast speeds…” BASF employs 114,000 people around the world. They work in five major segments: Chemicals, Performance Products, Functional Materials & Solutions, Agricultural Solutions and Oil & Gas. The company turned over more than €58bn in 2016. The company famously invented Styropor (polystyrene) in 1951. It was founded in 1865 as a waste recycling firm and has focussed on reducing pollution and emissions since the 1960s – it is the world’s leading manufacturer of catalytic converters for cars and lorries. The deal strengthens HPE’s top spot in supercomputer sales. Independent analysts IDC estimated HPE sold more than $440m of supercomputer hardware in the first half of 2016, well ahead of Wuxi’s second place score of $300m. This position pre-dates HPE’s purchase of high performance computing specialist SGI in November 2016.

And following Baron’s example I also run the same load against MonetDB. Reading comments to Baron’s post I tied to load the same data to LucidDB, but I was not successful in this. I tried to analyze a bigger dataset and I took public available data http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time about USA domestic flights with information about flight length and delays. The data is available from 1988 to 2009 in chunks per month, so I downloaded 252 files (for 1988-2008 years) with size from 170MB to 300MB each. In total raw data is about 55GB. Average amount of rows in each chunk is 483762.46 (the query Q0 is: Shell 
 select avg(c1) from (select year,month,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEAR,month) t; 1 select avg(c1) from (select year,month,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEAR,month) t; for InfoBright and Shell 
with t as (select yeard,monthd,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEARD,monthd) select AVG(c1) FROM t 1 with t as (select yeard,monthd,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEARD,monthd) select AVG(c1) FROM t for MonetDB. For InfoBright it took 4.19 sec to execute and 29.9 sec for MonetDB, but it’s almost single case where MonetDB was significantly slower) Few words about environment: server Dell SC1425, with 4GB of RAM and Dual Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.40GHz. InfoBright (ICE) version: 5.1.14-log build number (revision)=IB_3.2_GA_5316(ice) MonetDB version: server v5.14.2, based on kernel v1.32.2 LucidDB was 0.9.1 The table I loaded data is: Shell

Load procedure: Infobright: the loader that comes with ICE version is very limited and I had to transform files to quote each field. After that load statement is: Shell

And total load time is 8836 sec (2.45h). The size of database after load is 1.6G which is impressive and give 1:34 compress ratio. MonetDB: It took some time to figure out how to load text data ( I really wish developers improve documentation), but finally I ended up with next load statement: Shell

It seems it does not use any compression, and it’s bigger than original data. LucidDB Here it took time to find how to execute command from command line using included Shell 
sqlline 1 sqlline utility, and I did not understand how to do that, so I generated big SQL file which contained load statements. Load of each chunk was significantly slower starting with about 60 sec/chunk for initial year and constantly growing to 200 sec / chunk for 2000 year. On 2004 year (after about 5h of loading) the load failed by some reason and I did not try to repeat, as I would not fit in timeframe I allocated for this benchmark. Maybe I will try sometime again. Query execution So I really have data for InfoBright and MonetDB, let see how fast they are in different queries. First favorite query for any database benchmarker is Shell 
SELECT count(*) FROM ontime; 1 SELECT count(*) FROM ontime; . Both InforBritgh and MonetDB executes it immediately with result 117023290 rows Now some random queries I tried again both databases: -Q1: Count flights per day from 2000 to 2008 years Shell

It is a bit more trickier, as for InfoBright and MonetDB you need different query: MonetDB: Shell

So result is: [ “EV”, 101796, 286234, 355 ] [ “US”, 135987, 485447, 280 ] [ “AA”, 176203, 633857, 277 ] [ “MQ”, 145630, 540494, 269 ] [ “AS”, 42830, 160185, 267 ] [ “B6”, 50740, 191450, 265 ] [ “UA”, 128174, 490002, 261 ] … with execution time: 0.5s for MonetDB and 2.92s for InfoBright.

My goal was to check how available OpenSource software is able to handle such kind of tasks. Despite InfoBright was slower for many queries, I think it is more production ready and stable. It has Enterprise edition and Support which you can buy. And execution time is really good, taking into account amount of rows engine had to crunch. For query Q8 (1year range) traditional transactional oriented stored engine took 30min to get result. I really like MonetDB. I do not know what is the magic behind the curtain, they also do not have indexes like InfoBright, but results are impressive. On drawbacks – the command line is weak ( I had to use bash and pass query as parameter, otherwise I was not able to edit query or check history), the documentation also needs improvements. The fact it does not use the compression also maybe showstopper, the space consumption is worrying. Addressing these issues I think MonetDB may have commercial success Worth to note that MonetDB supports all INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE statements (and space is price for that as I understand), while InfoBright ICE edition allows you only LOAD DATA. InfoBright Enterprise allows INSERT / UPDATE but that also is not for online transactions processing. Compression in InfoBright is impressive. Even smaller rate 1:10 means you can compress 1TB to 100GB, which is significant economy of space. I am open to run any other queries if you want to compare or get info about air performance.

This comes from the “fewer knobs to tune is better” approach that MonetDB takes. I’m still trying to understand here why “MonetDB does not like to scan many records”, as it seems to me at first sight that a full scan is made in most queries. Anyhow, if it does a plain full scan, it for sure loses from Infobright which really benefits from their excellent compressed storage in that case. Thanks.

Reply Alexander Rubin says: October 3, 2009 at 5:09 am Vadim, very interesting results. You can also try sphinxsearch (http://www.sphinxsearch.com/) for some of those queries (it can now group by and order by). I’ve done some tests on the smaller dataset, and it gives very good results: http://www.arubin.org/blog/2009/10/01/reporting-queries-with-sphinx/ Will be interesting to see how sphinx performs on 55G Reply Vadim says: October 3, 2009 at 8:04 am Tomaz, Sure MonetDB in this case. MongoDB is also getting popular and we discuss it periodically, but that’s different story Reply Vadim says: October 3, 2009 at 8:07 am Alexander, Sure I know that feature in Sphinx. I am going to have talk on OpenSQL Camp about this side of Sphinx, I may use this dataset. What would be interesting to see it on multi-cpu box and run Sphinx query in N parallel processes. Reply peter says: October 3, 2009 at 10:30 am Vadim, Couple of questions and notes 1) Did you run query once or several times (so if any self tuning needs to be done it is done) ? 2) I’m wondering if data set you have was giving undue advantage to MonetDB. I see you have touch may be 1/10 of columns which with 4GB of memory gets close to amount of memory you have. I trust Infobright and compression can cost you when data is in memory but if working set is significantly more than amount of memory things may change. 3) What is about Joins ? So far we have only looked at single table queries which do not stress the optimizer a lot. It would be very interesting to see some more complicated multiple table queries too. 4) What is about MyISAM ? It would be really nice to keep it as a baseline. Reply Vadim says: October 3, 2009 at 1:27 pm Peter, 1) I did run queries in loop until I got stable repeatable number. as 2-4) there indeed much more experiments can be done.

Reply James Birchall says: October 5, 2009 at 9:18 am Vadim, Infobright ICE does some serious optimisations on columns if they have less then 10,000 unique entries in the column and if you specify “COMMENT ‘lookup'” in the definition (they automatically generate and maintain an ENUM, I think). Think of them like indexes. If you change the definitions for the key columns in the queries, does that change your results at all? Reply Vadim says: October 5, 2009 at 9:27 am James, That’s good point, I will try to change column definition for fields affected in queries. Reply David says: October 5, 2009 at 7:41 pm Good post, but why not try to run TPC-H test ? Reply Vadim says: October 5, 2009 at 8:30 pm David, TPC-H is boring and everyone can run it 🙂 Also it uses some unreal data. Database vendors often publish TPC-H by themselves: see e.g. http://www.monetdb.nl/projects/monetdb/SQL/Benchmark/TPCH/index.html. And I know some companies optimizes performance of database especially for TPC-H load ( I do not point here to InfoBright nor MonetDB, I do not have that facts). So better to take some independent and something that is more interesting for me. Reply Vadim says: October 5, 2009 at 8:38 pm James, I did changes you mentioned, it really affected only Q8, but really affected significantly. The execution time for InfoBright now is: 1y: 1.74 s 2y: 3.68 s 3y: 5.44 s 4y: 7.22 s 10y: 17.42 s Reply erin says: October 7, 2009 at 10:41 am Thanks Vadim! I was hoping you’d do something like this! I really appreciate the use of real world data because in my experience random, dummy data without any similarity to real world data just doesn’t give realistic info when it comes to large datasets. I’m using ICE in production & the data compression is impressive (think green! as Brian Aker says). The query performance is impressive. But queries really have to be optimized and that is a challenge without explain. We’re not using joins (but unlike mysql you can have more columns) and we’re only using INTs, no varchars or date (tho my test with using date resulted in a very very slight increase in load time, not anything noticeable in query time). But if you mess up & run a query with curdate() in it, oh boy is that slow. Then do NOT kill it. That’s a bug (reported & they are working on it). Thanks for doing these benchmarks. erin Reply James Birchall says: October 8, 2009 at 3:00 pm Hey Vadim, One more variation for InfoBright… You might try using the FlightTime fields instead of the Year, Month, DayOfWeek stuff for your range queries. I found that the Knowledge Grid does some wonderful things with range queries over dates that it didn’t do for straight integers (even simple equality). James. Reply John Sichi says: October 11, 2009 at 1:34 pm Hi Vadim, We’ve written up a page with instructions on the LucidDB load (including experimental support for parallel load): http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbOtp Best results will probably be achieved with one year per INSERT statement (theoretically you could use a massive UNION ALL to do them all at once, but I haven’t tested that). We’re guessing that the performance degradation and eventual failures you hit may have been due to the blanks for number fields (which LucidDB is picky about); the cleansing CASE expressions are supplied to fix those. In case there are other problems, we’ve included a section on how to enable row rejection for debugging them. Please let me know if you need any help with getting it working or tuned; we’ll be interested to see your results. LucidDB is targeted at complex schemas and queries, but we’d like to know where we stand even on simple table+query environments. Reply Vadim says: October 11, 2009 at 10:20 pm John, Thank you, I will try it in next couple days. Do you have public examples with complex queries and schemas, beside TPC-H ? Thanks, Vadim Reply Carl Gelbart says: October 12, 2009 at 10:51 am Itâ€™s great to see these independent tests of Infobright Community Edition (ICE) and other open source products. The massive compression you saw is typical of what ICE and IEE (enterprise edition) users see. A couple of comments in regards to Infobright: While we have lots of ICE users with relatively small databases (which we would consider under 200GB), the real power of the product can be seen when the database is considerably larger(hundreds of gigabytes to tens of terabytes.) Thatâ€™s when the Knowledge Grid advantages really show, as itâ€™s ability to eliminate the need to access large amounts of data results in great query performance versus other products. Typically we also see that the kinds of queries people run donâ€™t have a where clause that encompasses half the rows in the databases. How about doing a test against a 500 GB database? Try it with putting in a typical report date range (a month?) and see what kind of results you get. As far as getting access to IEE as mentioned by someone above, a free trial is available via download on the Infobright.com website, or we could send it to you if you want. The compression and query speed will be comparable to ICE, but there are more options for loading data and faster load speed. Carl Gelbart Sr. S.E. Infobright Reply Vadim says: October 12, 2009 at 5:26 pm Carl, Thank you for following our blog. I do not have bigger dataset on the hands that I can publish on public. When I have something interesting I will ask access to IEE. Do you have data that you can share ? Reply John Sichi says: October 12, 2009 at 8:49 pm Vadim, The best examples of high schema and query complexity I know of are locked away inside of the now-defunct LucidEra. CRM analytic schemas there involved numerous fact tables (e.g. leads, opportunities, orders, forecasts, quotas), joining on many conforming dimensions (e.g. time, lead owners, salesreps, territories, campaigns, prospects, customers, opportunity type/status, pricing, partners, discounts, on and on…), and in fact many of the fact and dimension “tables” were actually views joining underlying base tables in order to make the warehouse schema accessible via Mondrian’s dimensional model. But if you want to see a reasonable amount of query complexity on a public dataset, use Mondrian’s FOODMART schema with LucidDB: http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbOlap And then execute MDX queries involving lots of filtered dimensions, and trace the underlying SQL (you’ll see a lot of star joins). The data volume is piddling though. For schema complexity, I’m not aware of any, but if you can find something that already has Mondrian set up with PostgreSQL or MySQL, we have an automated procedure for replicating that into LucidDB: http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbMondrianReplication Reply Greenplum Single-Node Edition — sometimes free is a real cool price | DBMS2 -- DataBase Management System Services says: October 19, 2009 at 6:25 am […] MySQL Performance blog on MonetDB and Infobright community edition […] Reply Matin Kersten says: October 31, 2009 at 7:17 am Dear Vadim, We appreciate your tryout of the system. We did not found the time yet to load the referenced data and re-run the experiments to shed some light on the questions raised. (Does RITA http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time has a (hidden) textual interface to quickly download the files? Can I download your cvs files?) – we are aware that the documentation can be improved, especially in areas where confusion may arise due to SQL 2003 compliance. – the parallel loading in 5.14 was turned off due to a design error that could materialize in COPY with initial offsets. The November release has it fixed. (on tpch-sf10 loading it is locally 3 x faster then the release you used) – MonetDB does not rely heavily on value compression (the X100 project, now part of VectorWise/Ingres does) MonetDB does, however, use the minimal data types required to store information. – MonetDB automatically builds a dictionary system for strings string heaps = 64KB are opportunistically (imperfect) duplicate eliminated – The growth in database size most likely comes from the logical references (8bytes) into the dictionary(short strings) – Q7 would be a target for us to run with the statement modifiers EXPLAIN (for plan) and TRACE (for detailed performance trace) We would appreciate those for inspection. – same for Q9. Note that MonetDB does not create any a priory (persistent) index, sorting or clustering to answer aggregate queries. Everything is done at runtime and upon need. Including sampling for grouping. I guess that Infobright benefits here from its partitioning information and compression over sorted tables (year). Q3 is an example that highlights the differences in the ‘rough’. regards, Martin Kersten The MonetDB Team Reply Matin Kersten says: October 31, 2009 at 7:19 am – MonetDB automatically builds a dictionary system for strings string heaps smaller then 64KB are fully duplicate eliminated string heaps larger then 64KB are opportunistically (imperfect) duplicate eliminated Reply Vadim says: October 31, 2009 at 11:41 am Matin, Thank you for follow up. you can download data by direct links like http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Download/On_Time_On_Time_Performance_1988_1.zip just change year and month in loop. I am going to try another benchmark, suggested by John Sichi http://www.cs.umb.edu/~poneil/StarSchemaB.PDF, but on 500GB+ data size. Should I wait on your November release, I guess parallel load will be useful. What is ETA for release ? Can I try X100 project or it is not available yet ? Thanks, Vadim Reply Martin Kersten says: October 31, 2009 at 5:44 pm Vadim, Thanks for the url. That looks a lot easier then a webform. I will install it as well. We have a monthly bug fix release cycle and a 3-4 month feature release cycle. The feature release date is the last days of November. That version is now internally used as a release candidate. (if you are in a hurry we can provide you with a copy) The SSB is a reduced version of TPC-H. We have looked at it shortly. X100 is a product under development (http://www.vectorwise.com/index_js.php?page=mission_overview). Presumably becoming available for a wider public Q1 2010. regards, Martin Reply Martin Kersten says: November 1, 2009 at 4:09 am Dear Vadim, The csv files have been obtained without problem.

This data warehouse is interesting, as it is one from the ‘wild’. The dimension and fact tables have been combined into a single table. Furthermore, the varchar(10) used often in the schema is an overshoot for the actual values stored. I have ran the load and queries on the MonetDB Nov 2009 RC. The results can be seen here http://www.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport The results align with those reported here. However, we may consider reviving an old manual technique applied in an older version of MonetDB, which would bring the storage down to ca 10 GB. regards, Martin Reply Martin Kersten says: November 1, 2009 at 1:06 pm Vadim et.al. (not sure if my earlier message got through, if so ignore this one) I have installed the database and ran the queries against the MonetDB Nov 2009 RC. The results are summarized in http://www.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport. regards, Martin Reply Vadim says: November 2, 2009 at 12:15 pm Martin, I see you have comment about load time and datasize. Is there something I should change to get better results ? Thanks. Vadim Reply Martin Kersten says: November 2, 2009 at 12:46 pm Vadim The load time is with the default loader settings in the Nov 2009 RC. Unlike the Aug 2009 release, it uses all possible threads to act in the loading. Further improvements, which is still possible, would call for more development in the loader algorithms itself. There is still quite some room to improve further, because we have not reached our CPU nor IO capacity limit. The current algorithm properly deals with variable sized input and requests for OFFSET into the input stream. (which may be coming from stdin) For utmost loading speed there is an attachment option, but that is a totally different story and only relevant for dealing with tables of >1TB. The database size was a little surprise. The OnTime table looks like a flattened star-schema. This means we have a lot of small dimension tables, as indicated in the count overview. It would not be a design aimed at scalability. Furthermore, any varchar() object in MonetDB leads to an overhead of 8 bytes, a logical reference from a column to a string area. This hurts if the actual collection of strings only consists of a handful values and we have 120M references. The way to deal with is well known, and the functionality is part of MonetDB4 as ENUM types. We might put a little compression optimizer in the pipeline, that recognizes and handles this case directly and transparently for the user. SQL users would obtain the same result, if they replaced the corresponding columns with a dictionary table and a TINYINT or SMALLINT and relied on the join to couple them. This, however, would not be our preferred way. regards, Martin Reply Vadim says: November 28, 2009 at 4:11 am There is comment from David Lutz, InfoBright: Hello! I have been testing with this data set, as well, thanks to your suggestion. There are many differences in our two environments and I don’t want to post the whole test as it would be almost as big as your original post. What I did want to offer is that I performed the test on 10 years of data using the current version of Infobright Enterprise Edition (3.2.2) which has a multi-threaded loader. I loaded different years and my total raw data was only ~27GB in size (~1.5GB compressed). My experience in loading was very consistent for each subsequent year at between 4m12s and 4m20s for each complete year (concatenated the months into a single file) or around 2,560 seconds. The total record count was 70,097,260 records. Another way of saying that would be 273,817 records/second versus your experience of 13,244 records/second (117,023,290 records in 8,836 seconds) with the single-threaded loader provided in Infobright Community Edition, a ~20X improvement (on my server) and using the DDL below. The DDL is the other thing. When appropriate I used the COMMENT ‘LOOKUP’ attribute offered by Infobright to transparently convert repetitive text strings to internal, integer lookup values. This improves load times, compression on those columns, and query performance when one of these columns is used for filtering, joining or aggretating on. This is apparent in the improvements in response time for several of the queries above. The DDL I used is included below: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ontime; CREATE TABLE ontime( Year SMALLINT NOT NULL, — 1 Year Quarter TINYINT NOT NULL, — 2 Quarter (1-4) Month TINYINT NOT NULL, — 3 Month DayofMonth TINYINT NOT NULL, — 4 Day of Month DayOfWeek TINYINT NOT NULL, — 5 Day of Week FlightDate DATE NOT NULL, — 6 Flight Date (YYYY-MM-DD) [not (yyyymmdd)] UniqueCarrier CHAR(2) NOT NULL COMMENT ‘LOOKUP’, — 7 Unique Carrier Code.

Is that version available to download ? Reply Vlad Rodionov says: February 2, 2010 at 5:47 pm First of all, I would like to thank Vadim and mysqlperformanceblog team for very interesting posts – I am a regular visitor of your web-site. In our company we are looking for D/W solution which will allow us to do a real-time (10-15 sec) queries on 1B+ row tables. InfoBright, MonetDB, InfiniDB are in my short lists. Having read your article first time I was impressed by performance numbers of columnar databases, but now … I think that there are a lot of room for query optimization inside both MonetDB and Infobright. For example, this query takes 7.9 sec for MonetDB and 12 sec for Infobright. -Q1: Count flights per day from 2000 to 2008 years SELECT DayOfWeek, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE YearD BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008 GROUP BY DayOfWeek ORDER BY c DESC This is a full column scan query. Group BY column has very low cardinality (7) => do grouping and aggregation in memory. DayOfWeek requires only 3 bits per row => for 117M row table, it will need ~30Mb to store the whole column. Loading column from disk (30MB), decompressing it and aggregating 117M numbers should not take more than 1 sec (actually, I think I can do it on my laptop in less than 0.5 sec). Vadim, can you forward my e-mail address and question to MonetDB and Infobright guys? This is query: SELECT T.C FROM T WHERE (up to 4 simple filter conditions ANDed) ORDER BY T.B DESC LIMIT N; The good selectivity is not guaranteed. It may require almost full table scan in a worst case. Can they do this type of query under 15 sec in a worst case on 1B table which is similar to the table from this post (120 columns – most of them with low cardinality – no strings only numbers) Reply Vlad Rodionov says: February 2, 2010 at 6:02 pm Forgot to mention YearD column in my example. Of course we need to scan through 2 columns, but both are with very low cardinality and must be very compressible ones. The second column will add possibly 60Mb more data to load from disk. Reply Vadim says: February 2, 2010 at 9:56 pm Vlad, I forwarded your question to my contacts in MonetDB and InfoBright. Reply Martin Kersten says: February 5, 2010 at 3:05 pm Dear Vlad, Sorry for the delay in answering your question regarding Q1 and compression. Bit-wise compression is a two-edge sword. You save on IO and pay with CPU cycles. The numbers reported for both MonetDB and Infobright on this blog already show that compression is just one ingredient in the equation. MonetDB used more diskspace and still performed very well. In http://homepages.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport you find more recent numbers. In particular, Q1 runs currently within 1 sec on the 118M tuples. It is certainly worth trying out the 1B version using the upcoming Feb2010 release. Reply Vlad Rodionov says: February 5, 2010 at 3:35 pm Thanks, Martin I will definitely give MonetDB a try. Reply itsme says: October 27, 2015 at 2:33 am hi Vadim, what’s king of software are you using to make picture graph ? thanks in advance 😉 Reply Eyal Rozenberg says: October 30, 2016 at 9:12 am For anyone who’s interested in this data and/or in these queries as a benchmark, I’ve created a github repository: https://github.com/eyalroz/usdt-ontime-tools for automating the download of the CSVs and the loading of the data – at least into MonetDB. The numbers have changed significantly since 2009 – but there are also schema changes because of what BTS provides; some make the schema ‘tighter’ – e.g. the fact that the decimal values are not really decimal, they always end with .00 and are really ints, so my loading script cleans them up; but on the other hand, you can’t rely on having exactly 6 chars in the tailnum, and sometimes it’s even missing entirely. I’ll be using this to try out some GPU decompression primitives. Reply Juan says: April 28, 2017 at 1:42 pm Hello. With MonetDB is possible to convert a table from wide format to long format and viceversa? https://mgimond.github.io/ES218/img/Tidyr_long2wide.png http://pavlov.tech/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/widetolong-462×270.png With some programs you can apply this transformation automatically to datasets with thousands of columns.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq has pulled back into negative territory after hitting a record intraday high. Currently, the major averages are lingering below the unchanged line. The Dow is down 36.47 points or 0.2 percent at 20,944.86, the Nasdaq is down 5.32 points or 0.1 percent at 6,043.61 and the S&P 500 is down 4.69 points or 0.2 percent at 2,384.08. The modest weakness on Wall Street comes after President Donald Trump warned of a major conflict with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. "There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely," Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. Trump said he wants to resolve the standoff with North Korea peacefully but argued a diplomatic solution is "very difficult." On the U.S. economic front, the Commerce Department released a report showing that economic growth slowed by more than anticipated in the first three months of 2017. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased by 0.7 percent in the first quarter after jumping by 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 1.2 percent. The weaker than expected increase in GDP in the first quarter represents the worst performance since a 1.2 percent decline in the first quarter of 2014. Among individual stocks, shares of Intel (INTC) are moving notably lower after the semiconductor giant reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates but on weaker than expected revenues. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has also come under pressure after cutting its fiscal third quarter guidance due to Apple (AAPL) withholding future royalty payments amid a dispute between the companies. Meanwhile, shares of Amazon (AMZN) seeing notable strength after the online retail giant reported first quarter results that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is also moving higher in morning trading after reporting better than expected first quarter earnings and revenues. Sector News Semiconductor stocks are seeing notable weakness in mid-day trading, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index sliding by 1.6 percent. The index is pulling back after ending the previous session at a sixteen-year closing high. Considerable weakness has also emerged among housing stocks, as reflected by the 1.5 percent drop by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index. The drop by the index comes after it ended Thursday's trading at its best closing level in eleven years. On the other hand, gold stocks continue to turn in a strong performance on the day, resulting in a 2.1 percent gain by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index. The index is rebounding after ending the previous session at its lowest closing level in over a month. The rebound by gold stocks comes amid an increase by the price of the precious metal, with gold for June delivery climbing $2.90 to $1,268.80 an ounce. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.3 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index crept up by 0.1 percent. The major European markets also ended the day mixed. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index dropped by 0.3 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index both inched up by 0.1 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have climbed back near the unchanged line after seeing early weakness. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by less than a basis point at 2.302 percent.

Providers of Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) aim to implement asset efficiency solutions. Designing the asset efficiency solution, developing the application, adapting advanced engineering knowledge for the use cases, and supplying the information platform is the composite task of the analytics engine. IBM is a premier supplier of an analytics engine with its Watson product. There is enormous variety in the Internet of things markets. Bosch supplies industrial IoT sensor technology, acquiring data from the edge, providing device management. Scalability is achieved by the Bosch IoT Suite and ProSyst IoT middleware. The Vorto code generator enables M2M modelling. PTC supplies the Thingworx Application Enablement Platform (AEP), used for creating dashboards, widgets and other user interface elements. Intel provides the Moon Island Gateway used for data aggregation at the edge, as well as horizontal infrastructure in collaboration with HP. Browse Detail Report With TOC @ http://www.hexareports.com/report/internet-of-things-iot-market Hitachi analytics is used to diagnose manufacturing process. Hitachi uses its analytics platform to integrate production and sensor data outputs to help visualize, analyze and diagnose a manufacture polymer mixing problems. A polymer mixing process was said to be producing inconsistent output quality, with yields dipping to 50%. Hitachi addressed the scrapping of poor batches and huge costs by addressing ever-changing product specifications and variations in a range of production parameters. Using IoT and the analytics platform, production engineers were able to stabilize the process even as new product formulations were introduced. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next Industrial Revolution. It will impact the way all businesses, governments, and consumers interact with the physical world. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps speed has been used in data centers for years. The jump to 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps has come rapidly as a result of the need to increase the quantity of data managed inside the data center with more analytics and more applications. Many of the Cloud 2.0 mega data centers have moved to 100 Gbps, presaging the move to 400 Gbps. One reason for the increase in speed is the growth of data consumption, attributed to smartphones, social media, video streaming, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Big pipes are used to cope with the huge quantities of data that are being transferred. Request A Sample copy of This Report @ http://www.hexareports.com/report/internet-of-things-iot-market/request-sample Users, partners, suppliers and other mega-datacenters communicate using digital systems that are automated and self-healing. The effect on the business is compelling, managers have much more responsibility to create maps of strategy and work with IT to see that developers tune the software to fit the current competitive environment. The explosion of data comes from smart phone apps and IoT digital onslaught of streaming data that needs to be processed in real time to look for anomalies, look for change, set alerts, and provide automated response to shifts. According to Susan Eustis, lead author of the study, “Transparency is one of the benefits of IoT that sensors bring to digital controls. The benefits of digital manufacturing, farming, and automotive vehicles are higher productivity and more efficient use of resource. Transparency in is being asked for by consumers. Consumers want to know where their food came from, how much water and chemicals were used in food preparation, and when and how the food was harvested and transported. They want to know about consistent refrigeration during transport.” Use of IoT sensors and cameras represents a key milestone in provision of value to every industry. Customized cameras are used to take photos and videos with stunning representations. Digital controls will further automate flying and driving, making ease of use, flight stability, and automated cars a reality. New materials and new designs are bringing that transformation forward. By furthering innovation, IoT continued growth is assured. Sensors and software analytics platforms are implemented with connectivity capability for streaming data from endpoints and using analytics to process the data in a manner that generates alerts when appropriate. The complete report provides a comprehensive analysis of Internet of Things (IoT) in different categories, illustrating the diversity of uses for digital tracking devices in industry, healthcare and consumer markets. Analytics makes the images more cogent to everyone, farmers, doctors, machine operators, the uses of IoT are quite diverse. Letting people anticipate problems that only become visible to humans days or weeks after the sensors and images detect issues is a fundamental aspect of IoT, along with generating apocopate levels of alerts. Not too many and not too few.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq has pulled back into negative territory after hitting a record intraday high. Currently, the major averages are lingering below the unchanged line. The Dow is down 36.47 points or 0.2 percent at 20,944.86, the Nasdaq is down 5.32 points or 0.1 percent at 6,043.61 and the S&P 500 is down 4.69 points or 0.2 percent at 2,384.08. The modest weakness on Wall Street comes after President Donald Trump warned of a major conflict with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. "There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely," Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. Trump said he wants to resolve the standoff with North Korea peacefully but argued a diplomatic solution is "very difficult." On the U.S. economic front, the Commerce Department released a report showing that economic growth slowed by more than anticipated in the first three months of 2017. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased by 0.7 percent in the first quarter after jumping by 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 1.2 percent. The weaker than expected increase in GDP in the first quarter represents the worst performance since a 1.2 percent decline in the first quarter of 2014. Among individual stocks, shares of Intel (INTC) are moving notably lower after the semiconductor giant reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates but on weaker than expected revenues. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has also come under pressure after cutting its fiscal third quarter guidance due to Apple (AAPL) withholding future royalty payments amid a dispute between the companies. Meanwhile, shares of Amazon (AMZN) seeing notable strength after the online retail giant reported first quarter results that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is also moving higher in morning trading after reporting better than expected first quarter earnings and revenues. Sector News Semiconductor stocks are seeing notable weakness in mid-day trading, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index sliding by 1.6 percent. The index is pulling back after ending the previous session at a sixteen-year closing high. Considerable weakness has also emerged among housing stocks, as reflected by the 1.5 percent drop by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index. The drop by the index comes after it ended Thursday's trading at its best closing level in eleven years. On the other hand, gold stocks continue to turn in a strong performance on the day, resulting in a 2.1 percent gain by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index. The index is rebounding after ending the previous session at its lowest closing level in over a month. The rebound by gold stocks comes amid an increase by the price of the precious metal, with gold for June delivery climbing $2.90 to $1,268.80 an ounce. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.3 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index crept up by 0.1 percent. The major European markets also ended the day mixed. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index dropped by 0.3 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index both inched up by 0.1 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have climbed back near the unchanged line after seeing early weakness. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by less than a basis point at 2.302 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories Major Averages Close Lower On The Day But Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary Reebok Trolls Nordstrom With $425 Sweat-Stained Shirt Former President George H.W.

Create an Account By Starla Pointer • Staff Writer • April 27, 2017 Tweet YC School Board: Mitchell challenges Egland YAMHILL-CARLTON — Incumbent Jami Egland, a state employee with a business in Carlton, is facing a challenge from Terah Long Mitchell, who works for Intel, for the Position 1 seat on the Yamhill-Carlton School Board. Voters will decide in a mail-ballot election concluding Tuesday, May 16. Ballots must be returned to the Yamhill County Clerk’s Office by mail or in person by 8 p.m. election night. The Egland-Mitchell race is one of two contested in Y-C this spring. In addition, Holly Nettles, operations manager with the Yamhill Community Care Organization, is facing a challenge from Ken Watson, a retired teacher now serving as fire department chaplain, in Position 5. Software engineering manager William “Jack” Bibb Jr. is running unopposed in the Position 4 seat. Rick Yeo, who currently holds the position, is not seeking re-election. Egland grew up in Renton, Washington, home of Microsoft. She moved to Carlton 17 years ago. In addition to her state post, she is partnering with her sister, Joni Anderson, in The Violet Rose gift shop in Carlton. “I just really appreciate small towns,” she said. “It’s like going on vacation when I go home — nice and quiet.” At the same time, she said, she’s pleased the area has been revitalized, and the wine industry attracts people to the city. Egland said longtime board member Carol West encouraged her to apply for a board post. She knew West through her volunteer work with Carlton Together Cares. “I wanted to get more involved,” she said. “It was one way for me to give back and get to know more about Carlton and Yamhill.” She decided to run for another term this year, in part, to ensure there will be consistency on the board. As the only board member from Carlton, she wants her city to be represented. During her service on the board thus far, Superintendent Steve Chiovarro retired and board members conducted a search that ended with hiring of current Superintendent Charan Cline. Egland termed the search “a really great process that brought in community members as well as staff and board members.” She’s been pleased with the results, as well. She said Cline had “done some great things,” noting, “We communicate pretty well.” One of the greatest accomplishments in the last few years, Egland said, was passing a $14.2 million bond measure to repair buildings and construct a new high school gym and career tech center. “It’s very exciting,” she said. “I would love to see that through. Hopefully, the community will be pleased.” She’s also enthused that Y-C has improved its academic performance across the board, and that Yamhill-Carlton Intermediate School ranks in the top 10 percent of like schools in Oregon. “That’s our goal for all the schools,” she said. The board has seen improved attendance and a new career program at Yamhill-Carlton High School, as well as partnerships with local wineries, farmers and businesses such as Meggit. High school Principal Greg Neuman and the superintendent have brought in grants to support career education, as well. “That’s fabulous for the kids,” she said. The district is working to keep class sizes small, which Egland said is “really, really important for learning, especially at the lowest grades.” And efforts are underway “to teach the whole student, social, emotional and academic, not just three R’s,” she said. She’s a strong believer in public education, as it gives all children a chance to achieve their potential. Y-C must try to maintain its gains even as every district in the state worries about school funding. “Funding is always a concern,” Egland said, especially during a Legislative year, when the amount devoted to K-12 education is usually undecided until late spring. “It’s a big problem in Oregon,” she said. “I don’t know what the answer is, but we’ve got to find the funds to educate our kids.” As they search for solutions and try to make improvements, she said, it’s important for board members to be open to new ideas and listen to the community. “Board members need to not have an agenda,” she said. “It’s important to listen, learn, observe, and do what’s right for the kids.” That’s true of the current board, she said. While the members don’t always disagree, they are respectful of each other. They share a common purpose. “We all try to listen and do the right thing for kids,” Egland said. Mitchell grew up in Carlton and Gaston. She attended Y-C High for a time before graduating from Gaston High. She and her husband moved to Yamhill 13 years ago to raise their children. “I like knowing everybody,” she said. “The kids have more opportunities to play sports, do things, and they know everyone, too.” She decided to run for school board this year to do something for her community. “I really feel like we’re ready for a change,” she said. “I hear from lots of parents and community member who have experience with the school, and they’re wondering what’s happening,” Mitchell said. “It’s time for a fresh set of eyes, experiences, enthusiasm.” The flap over the “Eleanor & Park” novel contributed to decision to run, as did the bond measure approved by voters last year. She didn’t like how either was handled. “I told myself, ‘You need to be the change you want to see. It’s not enough to be upset. Get involved,’” said Mitchell, who has a daughter in fifth-grade and a son in third. Thinking of her children, she decided to speak out against requiring the novel. She asked the board to do a better job letting parents know about materials used in the classroom and given them a better chance to opt out. She also is unhappy about the bond measure. For one thing, the district scaled back the scope after several failures. For another, she feels previous bond measures promised one thing and delivered another. That situation seems to be happening again, Mitchell said. “Proper due diligence was not completed before it went out to voters,” she said. “If this project is not executed in a way that makes voters feel happy, we’ll never pass another bond,” she warned. As a board member, she said, she would do her best to turn things around and ensure the district gets the most of its bond money. “Let’s put it on all on the table, look at it from every angle, understand how to accomplish everything we need to accomplish,” she said. “If we can’t, then go back to the community for input and ask, ‘What are your priorities?’” One key to improving matters is to increase communication, she said. She wants to hear a more detailed monthly report about the projects, with challenges as well as successes spelled out. “I manage projects all the time,” she said. “As a board member, I’m not just going to accept ‘on time, on budget.’ I want to see the details. I want to see oversight committee’s questions and concerns addressed.” Mitchell’s project management experience comes from her work at Intel. She joined the company in 1990, shortly after graduating, and worked her way up. She’s held a variety of positions over the years. Her job is a direct result of a five-week secretarial internship she completed as a junior in high school. The experience made her passionate about starting a career, and teachers arranged a second internship for her, leading her to Intel, where she is currently an operations manager. College isn’t the best, or the right, path for everyone, she said. “We absolutely have to invest in programs to help young people find decent jobs when they leave high school,” she said, pointing to internships like she had and programs such as the viticulture classes at Y-C. “I was a product of that. Invest a little in me and I was able to go far,” she said. The skills students learn in career-oriented classes also will serve them well if they continue to higher education, she said. “Even if you use the skills just as part of your home ownership,” she added. Learning such skills “helps them be productive members of society.”   Related Articles AN F.A.Q.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq has pulled back near the unchanged line after initially jumping to a new record intraday high. Currently, the major averages are turning in a mixed performance. While the Nasdaq is up 3.27 points or 0.1 percent at 6,052.21, the Dow is down 17.17 points or 0.1 percent at 20,964.16 and the S&P 500 is down 1.76 points or 0.1 percent at 2,387.01. The choppy trading on Wall Street comes after President Donald Trump warned of a major conflict with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. "There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely," Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. Trump said he wants to resolve the standoff with North Korea peacefully but argued a diplomatic solution is "very difficult." On the U.S. economic front, the Commerce Department released a report showing that economic growth slowed by more than anticipated in the first three months of 2017. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased by 0.7 percent in the first quarter after jumping by 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 1.2 percent. The weaker than expected increase in GDP in the first quarter represents the worst performance since a 1.2 percent decline in the first quarter of 2014. Among individual stocks, shares of Intel (INTC) are moving notably lower after the semiconductor giant reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates but on weaker than expected revenues. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has also come under pressure after cutting its fiscal third quarter guidance due to Apple (AAPL) withholding future royalty payments amid a dispute between the companies. Meanwhile, shares of Amazon (AMZN) seeing notable strength after the online retail giant reported first quarter results that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is also moving higher in morning trading after reporting better than expected first quarter earnings and revenues. While many of the major sectors are showing only modest moves on the day, considerable strength is visible among gold stocks. The NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index is jumping by 2.2 percent after ending the previous session at its lowest closing level in over a month. The rebound by gold stocks comes amid an increase by the price of the precious metal, with gold for June delivery rising $2.20 to $1,268.10 an ounce. Steel, oil service, and brokerage stocks have also moved to the upside on the day, while weakness is visible among semiconductor, commercial real estate, and telecom stocks. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.3 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index crept up by 0.1 percent. The major European markets have also turned mixed on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is just above the unchanged line, the German DAX Index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index are down by 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries have climbed back near the unchanged line after seeing early weakness. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by less than a basis point at 2.302 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Next Story More Commentary -Global Major Averages Close Lower On The Day But Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mixed Ahead Of Long Holiday Weekend Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Futures Pointing To Roughly Flat Open On Wall Street - U.S. Commentary Street Might Open Moderately Higher Sensex Drops 111 Points Ahead Of Long Weekend; Nifty Ends At 9304 European Shares Mixed Amid Earnings Deluge Asian Shares Mixed On North Korea Jitters European Shares Seen Lower After Trump Comments Sensex Dips Below 30000; Nifty Down 37 Points Sensex, Nifty To See Lackluster Start As Biocon Disappoints Asian Markets Mixed Amid Cautious Trades Flat Lead Tipped For Thai Stock Market Indonesia Market May Test Support At 5,700 Points Hong Kong Bourse Due For Profit Taking <<Previous        53 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed The World's Richest Bachelors And Bachelorettes Uber's Self-Driving Head Out Amid Waymo Lawsuit Southwest Ending Practice Of Overbooking Electrolux Stock Up On Higher Q1 Results GM Q1 Results Climb, Top Estimates; Backs FY17 Adj.

Though shipping without integrated graphics, which is often used to highlight the benefits of speedier RAM, AMD has said that using high-quality RAM has clear benefits from scaling memory frequencies on its Ryzen chips. Intel, too, has been increasing the official memory speed of Core processors steadily, and DDR4-3,000 usage is commonplace on enthusiast systems. Crucial used to be hugely conservative with respect to memory frequencies, often trailing the likes of Corsair and Kingston by months and months. Such thinking is changing slowly with the Ballistix line, which is now available at speeds of up to 3,466MHz. Looking to strike a middle ground between speed and price, the company sent us in a quad-channel kit of DDR4-2,666 memory for technical evaluation. Said memory is from the Ballistix Sport LT range, and a 16GB (4x4GB) kit operating at DDR4-2,666 speeds and 16-18-18-38-2T latencies is available for £150. That's the going rate for memory of this ilk. It's also the highest frequency from a quad-pack kit with this capacity. Those wanting higher need to opt for 8GB modules instead. As an example, 16GB (2x8GB) of 3,200MHz memory costs £168 while the aforementioned 3,400MHz kit is £178, at the time of writing. Back on point, the Sport LT is an attractive kit dressed in red heatspreaders set against a black PCB. Crucial has yet to indulge the RGB crowd with multi-coloured memory, meaning this set is standard in every respect. The modules stand 42mm tall and fit in easily underneath large coolers. You have a choice of colours Should the red not take your fancy, the same kit is available clad in white or grey heatspreaders, though we rather do like the colour of our review set. The midrange speeds translate to a standard operating voltage of 1.2V and, as expected, the modules have XMP 2.0 compatibility for easy configuration. Our set worked first time in an Asus Z270F Gaming motherboard. Ideal for a number of platforms, including the quad-channel X99, let's now see if it is better to have two or four modules from a performance perspective as we line up the Crucial against various sticks in our test platform.

The stock started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the ticker "CLDR." Shares rose to $18 a share as the stock opened around 10.:45 a.m. ET, and closed at $18.10 a share. The company priced its IPO at $15 a share, above the expected range of $12 to $14 a share. But it's significantly less than the $30.92 a share that Intel paid for the stock in 2014, according to regulatory documents. Chief executive Tom Reilly told CNBC that because Intel is working with Cloudera to design data analytics software and hardware that works together, the deal with Intel was structured differently in the private market. Matthew Busch | Bloomberg | Getty Images Tom Reilly, chief executive officer of Cloudera Inc. "Intel is an amazing partner of ours .... Intel and us have a long journey ahead. They are supportive of this IPO. They are investors with us, [but] they are different than a financial investor," Reilly told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" on Friday. "All our financial investors are very happy with their returns.... we're very excited about our valuation." The 15 million share IPO will raise $225 million, more than the $200 million the company had initially filed to raise. Founded by alumni from Oracle, Yahoo, Facebook and Google, Cloudera specializes in data science technology, using one of software developers' most beloved technology frameworks, called Hadoop. "Everything is connected — pretty much everything and everyone," Reilly said. "Think of smart cars, smart homes, smart watches .... that creates a vast amount of data. Ninety percent of the world's data in 2020 doesn't exist today. And our platform is designed to capture that." While its revenue grew to $261.0 million in the year ending Jan. 31, up from $166.0 million a year ago, Cloudera is losing money. It posted a loss of $187.32 million last year, narrower than the $203.14 million from a year ago. Having incurred net losses since its founding in 2008, Cloudera said in regulatory filings it does not intend to pay any cash dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future. "With the proceeds from the IPO, this gives us even greater flexibility to look long-term — look at this big market — and make sure that we remain the market leader by making the right investments, having the right partnerships," Reilly said. The company faces what it calls "intense competition," both from enterprise technology companies like IBM and Oracle, and from cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft that are bolstering their business intelligence offerings. Cloudera rival Hortonworks, which priced its IPO at $16 a share in 2014, has since cratered and traded at less than $11 a share on Friday. But Reilly said that the growth in cloud is a tailwind for Cloudera, thanks to its partnerships with major providers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. "Some of our biggest investments are developing new capabilities in the cloud. And some of our fastest-growing part of the business is adoption of our technology in the cloud," Reilly said. Cloudera, a CNBC Disruptor 50 company, said the company intends to continue to expand internationally after the IPO, and will use the proceeds for activities like sales and marketing, research and product development. The start-up was backed by venture capitalists like Greylock and Accel, and the IPO was underwritten by banks including Morgan Stanley, JPMogan, and Allen& Company.

Acer may not be the first name that comes to mind when thinking of performance gaming systems, but it's been growing its Predator gaming brand recently. At its next@Acer event yesterday, the company showed off a couple new families of high-end gaming laptops. We're starting with the spiciest of the bunch, the Predator Triton 700 series. Acer says these laptops sport Intel seventh-generation Core processors and Nvidia GeForce GTX 10-series graphics cards—though it doesn't specifically state which varieties are available. The press release mentions VR capability, suggesting the minimum spec might be a Core i5 coupled with a GeForce GTX 1060. The display is a 15.6" 1920x1080 IPS number with support for G-Sync. The machine's memory and storage are decidedly high-spec, with support for up to 32 GB of DDR4 memory and two NVMe PCIe SSDs in RAID 0. For peripheral connnectivity, users can count on Thunderbolt 3 ports, along with DisplayPort and HDMI 2.0 outputs. A Killer DoubleShot Pro adapter handles both wired and wireless networking duties. The laptops in the Triton 700 series have mechanical keyboards with RGB LED lighting mounted on the near side of the laptop's top. A glass touchpad between the screen and the keyboard shows off the machine's cooling system. Judging by the promo video, that's only pointing device in the system, so ergonomics freaks might feel their carpal tunnel syndrome flaring up from just looking at it. The machine's 5.7 lb. (2.6 kg) weight and 0.74" (1.9 cm) thickness shouldn't bother users too much when moving the machine around. The company's Helios 300 family has more mainstream specs and designs. Models with 15.6" and 17.3" IPS 1920x1080 screens will be available with Intel Kaby Lake Core i5-7300HQ and Core i7-7700HQ CPUs along with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 and GTX 1060 graphics cards. The keyboards are standard membrane units with red backlighting. The standard opaque touchpad sits in front of the keyboard, where sensible laptop makers have been putting it since the mid-1990s. Helios 300 systems ship with up to 16 GB of DDR4 memory installed, upgradeable to 32 GB. Storage comes courtesy of a combo setup with a SATA SSD and a 1 TB hard drive. Peripheral connectivity options include a USB 3.0 Type-A port, one USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 2.0 connectors, and an HDMI 2.0 output. Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11ac Wi-Fi let the laptops talk to other computers.  Acer says the Predator Triton 700s will be available in August starting at around $3000. The Helios 300 laptops will start appearing on North American shelves in July. The 15.6" models are slated to start at $1300, while the 17.3" will go for at least $1400.

That’s partly because it was one of the first software companies I ever covered in depth as a junior tech reporter two decades ago. Mostly, it’s because I’m as curious as the next person as to whether the 42-year-old company can steal the spotlight from 20-something Amazon when it comes to replacing corporate data centers (at least most of them) with cloud computing services. Microsoft’s latest financial results—delivered last night alongside acts from tech powerhouses Amazon, Intel, and Google parent Alphabet—talk up all the right things. It recorded a very respectable 11% revenue growth for the unit that represents its cloud offerings—the Azure business alone grew a scene-grabbing 93%. And just this week, the company scored another huge Fortune 500 account: shipping company Maersk. I’m sure that follows CEO Satya Nadella’s turnaround script just fine. But the acknowledged market leader, Amazon Web Services, managed to upstage those results. It pulled off an overall revenue expansion of almost 43% during the same period.

Heather Clancy @greentechlady heather@heatherclancy.com BITS AND BYTES A cheat sheet for last night's earnings bonanza. Intel's data center business didn't grow as fast as expected. Alphabet recorded a surge in mobile and video advertising, despite boycotts from some huge advertisers over its YouTube content policing policies. Amazon's Prime subscription business grew almost 50% amid a monster quarter. And GoPro is managing to get more efficient, without compromising the release schedule for its next digital camera. (Reuters, Fortune, Reuters, Reuters, Fortune) The dispute between Apple and Qualcomm has escalated. Apple has stopped paying Qualcomm-related royalties to its iPhone contract manufacturers, according to a statement made by the chipmaker Friday morning. That forced Qualcomm to slash its revenue projections for the second quarter by about $500 million to between $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion. Qualcomm's licensing agreements are with Apple's manufacturers directly, who in turn charge Apple. (Fortune) Uber moves controversial self-driving car exec into another role. Anthony Levandowski—the former Google engineer in the middle of a bitter intellectual property fight with Alphabet's Waymo division—is no longer in charge of autonomous vehicle research at the ride-sharing company. Waymo has accused Levandowski of taking information about its LiDAR sensing technology when he left to start Otto, the self-driving truck company Uber bought last year. (Fortune, New York Times) It looks like Apple has a case of Venmo envy. The technology giant is working on an alternative to PayPal's peer-to-peer mobile payments platform, reports Recode. Given how well the app did in PayPal's latest quarter—transaction volumes doubled to $6.8 billion—the revelation isn't so surprising and this rumor has surfaced before. (Fortune, Recode) The smartphone market grew last quarter, no thanks to Apple and Samsung. Unit shipments for the category grew 4.3%, reports International Data Corp. Chinese handset makers like Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo—which target lower price points—were responsible for most of the growth. (Fortune) Chinese ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing closes record $5.5 billion round. The new funding reportedly raises the valuation for Uber's rival to more than $50 billion. Didi Chuxing hasn't disclosed who participated, but the buzz is that both SoftBank and Silver Lake Kraftwerk were involved. (Bloomberg, TechCrunch) It looks like analytics software firm Domo isn't going public soon. Instead, the Utah-based startup has raised at least half of a new $200 million funding round that will help it grow as a private company for a bit longer, according to paperwork it filed this week and flagged Thursday by Bloomberg. BlackRock led that infusion, which values the company around $2.3 billion. (Bloomberg) Cloudera will undershoot its last valuation when it starts trading today. The data management software firm priced its initial public offering at $15 per share, raising about $225 million and giving it a market capitalization of about $1.9 billion. That's higher than expected but still much lower than the $4.1 billion it was once worth as a private company. (Reuters) THE DOWNLOAD Aurora is the secretive new startup from the best minds in self-driving cars. Before Google launched its moonshot factory, Uber disrupted the taxi industry, and Tesla delivered its first electric vehicle—Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell, and Chris Urmson were working on self-driving cars. Their positions at Google, Tesla, and Uber, perhaps the most watched autonomous vehicle programs in the world, are an indication of their esteem. Now, they're striking out on their own—and likely competing with at least one of their former employers—with a self-driving car company called Aurora Innovation. Fortune's Kirsten Korosec has more details about the venture's, which settled a lawsuit with Tesla just last week.  How McAfee's CEO is securing the future. Chris Young has a long to-do list. As CEO of McAfee, which popularized antivirus software in the 1980s and 1990s, he has to prove to investors that his company can operate on its own following a $4.2 billion spinout from Intel in April. He needs to show peers that McAfee can succeed in a new era. And he must teach customers that the company can once more be on the cutting edge. Fortune's Michal LevRam spoke with Young ahead of his company’s spinoff about how he plans to execute.

The Nasdaq, almost 42 per cent of which is tech stocks, rose 0.2 per cent at 9:40 a.m (9:40 p.m Singapore time) in New York while the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average were little changed. All three benchmarks have advanced at least 1.7 per cent this week, hitting or approaching record highs, as the first round of the French election eased risk that the European Union might unravel and the Trump administration released its guidelines for tax cuts. Amazon rose 3.1 per cent to US$945.50, while Alphabet gained 4.2 per cent to US$928.50 after their quarterly results beat estimates. The two stocks also boosted the S&P 500 index. Data showed gross domestic product increased at a 0.7 per cent annual rate, below the 1.2 per cent rise estimated by economists, as consumer spending barely increased and businesses invested less on inventories. The economy grew at a pace of 2.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. The major indexes are on track to end the month in positive territory, with the Nasdaq on track to post gains for the sixth straight month as the corporate earnings season continues to impress. Overall profits of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 12.4 per cent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While strong earnings have kept the market at or near record levels, persistent geopolitical tensions in North Korea and Syria have weighed on investors' minds.

April 28, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ -- The global quantum cryptography market analyst says one trend in market is advent of integrated security solutions.

According to the quantum cryptography market report, one driver in market is adoption of the crypto cloud computing system. Crypto cloud computing is built on the quantum direct key system. Each entity encrypts data using their individual private key while using crypto cloud computing systems. These crypto cloud computing systems are being rapidly adopted for authentication processes, video management systems, and for storing information gathered from biometrics. Many enterprises including banks and healthcare organizations are storing their confidential data on the cloud, which makes it important to secure the cloud from unauthorized access. The adoption of crypto cloud computing systems is escalating faster in small and medium sized business (SMBs) when compared to large enterprises as cloud-based services work on a pay-per-use model. These systems also offer flexibility and scalability to accommodate the varying needs of the enterprises. The following companies as the key players in the global quantum cryptography market: HP Development Company, ID Quantique, IBM, and Nokia. Other prominent vendors in the market are: Airbus, Alibaba Group, BT, Google, Infineon Technologies, Intel, KPN, Lockheed Martin, MagiQ Technologies, McAfee, Microsoft, Mitsubishi Electric, NEC Corporation, NTT Communications, QuintessenceLabs, Raytheon, SK Telecom, and Toshiba.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a roughly flat open for the markets, with the Dow futures up by just 20 points. Geopolitical concerns may weigh on the markets after Trump warned of a major conflict with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. "There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely," Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. Trump said he wants to resolve the standoff with North Korea peacefully but argued a diplomatic solution is "very difficult." On the U.S. economic front, the Commerce Department released a report showing that economic growth slowed by more than anticipated in the first three months of 2017. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased by 0.7 percent in the first quarter after jumping by 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 1.2 percent. The weaker than expected increase in GDP in the first quarter represents the worst performance since a 1.2 percent decline in the first quarter of 2014. Shortly after the start of trading, MNI Indicators is scheduled to release its report on Chicago-area business activity in the month of April. The Chicago business barometer is expected to drop to 56.5 in April after inching up to 57.7 in March, although a reading above 50 would indicate continued growth. The University of Michigan is also due to release a revised report on consumer sentiment in the month of April. The consumer sentiment index is expected to be unrevised at the preliminary reading of 98.0. Among individual stocks, shares of Intel (INTC) are moving notably lower in pre-market trading after the semiconductor giant reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates but on weaker than expected revenues. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) may also come under pressure after cutting its fiscal third quarter guidance due to Apple (AAPL) withholding future royalty payments amid a dispute between the companies. Meanwhile, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are likely to see early strength after the online retail giant reported first quarter results that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is also moving higher in pre-market trading after reporting better than expected first quarter earnings and revenues. Stocks turned in a relatively lackluster performance during trading on Thursday but managed to end the day mostly higher. With the upward move on the day, the tech-heavy Nasdaq reached a new record closing high. The major averages finished the session in positive territory. The Dow inched up 6.24 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 20,981.33, the Nasdaq rose 23.71 points or 0.4 percent to 6,048.94 and the S&P 500 edged up 1.32 points or 0.1 percent to 2,388.77. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.3 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index crept up by 0.1 percent. The major European markets have also turned mixed on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.1 percent, the German DAX Index is just below the unchanged line and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is down by 0.4 percent. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are climbing $0.70 to $49.67 a barrel after sliding $0.65 to $48.97 a barrel on Thursday. After rising $1.70 to $1,265.90 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are inching up $0.60 to $1,266.50 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 111.69 yen compared to the 111.26 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0915 compared to yesterday's $1.0873. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories Major Averages Close Lower On The Day But Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary Reebok Trolls Nordstrom With $425 Sweat-Stained Shirt Former President George H.W.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas Updated April 28, 2017 14:26 BST Close Prey (2017) Gameplay Trailer 2 Bethesda Bethesda Softworks has released the first hour of Arkane Studio's upcoming Prey reboot as a free demo for PS4 and Xbox One. The publisher has also revealed the official minimum and recommended system requirements for the PC version of the upcoming sci-fi thriller ahead of its release next week. The console-exclusive demo features the optional male or female version of protagonist Morgan Yu during his or her first day on the job on board the Talos 1 space station. "Morgan Yu is about to have a very bad day," Bethesda said in a release. "Aliens have escaped containment, dead bodies now litter the hallways of the Talos 1 space station, survivors are huddled together for safety, and the Typhon aliens are threatening to destroy everything you hold dear. "As Morgan, you'll have to fight the invasion in order to save humanity. But it all begins with what should have been a typical first day on the job for Morgan." For the PC version the minimum specs are listed as an Intel i5-2500 or an AMD FX-8320 with 8GB of RAM and at least a GTX 660 or Radeon 7850 graphics card. For the best experience, Bethesda recommends having at least an Intel i7-2600K or an AMD FX-8350 processor with 16GB of RAM and an Nvidia GTX 970 or an AMD R9 290 card. The company has also revealed the various advanced settings that PC players will be able to tweak, ranging from object detail and horizontal field of view to shadow and texture quality. Meanwhile, PS4 owners will need 42GB of free storage space to cover the initial install and a day one patch, while Xbox One players will need 38GB of available space.

While many laptops meant for gaming tend to be bulky, the Predator Triton 700 is thin, measuring only 18.9 mm. It is only slightly thicker than the Razer Blade (18 mm) with which Acer seems to be looking to compete. According to Associate Marketing Manager Steven Funcke, in benchmark testing, the Triton 700 beat the Razer Blade with a 3DMark score of 17,000 to 11,139. In fact, for notebooks under 20 mm, no other laptop could come close, with second place only scoring 12,423. The Predator even outperformed thicker systems with the Schenker XMG P507 PRO (29 mm) coming closest with a score of 16,383. The design team was able to achieve this high, yet “conservative” benchmark by cramming Nvidia’s latest GTX 10-series graphics cards into the chassis, backed by up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM and driven by a seventh generation Intel Kaby Lake Processor. It also has dual PCIe solid state drives. The company did not reveal precisely what configuration the Nvidia graphics would entail, but for comparison, the Predator 21X uses dual GTX 1080 SLI cards. Acer CEO Jason Chen also seemed excited to point out that the Triton uses overclocked components. Of course, the biggest problem with all this power is heat. Funcke explained that Acer has also improved its AeroBlade fan technology. The Triton's dual AeroBlade 3D fans now push 35 percent more air through the system. This improvement is a 10 percent increase over the AeroBlades in the 21X. The Predator Triton 700 has a 1080p display and an LED-illuminated mechanical keyboard. However, one of the more interesting aspects of the Triton’s design is the layout of the keyboard and trackpad. Acer has switched the positions of the components so that the trackpad is above the keyboard. This redesign seems risky in that many people rest their hand while using the trackpad and in this case, the keyboard is in the way. However, since the notebook is intended for gaming, most users will probably be using a gaming mouse like the Razer Lancehead instead of the trackpad, so it will likely not pose a problem. The trackpad is also integrated into a Corning Gorilla Glass panel that shows off the internals nicely. It is an artistic touch used in the Predator 21X and made unique with the addition of the touchpad. Acer was not forthcoming with pricing. However, we should expect a price point between $3,000-4,000 based on competitive pricing models. The Predator Triton 700 should ship sometime this summer near the "back-to-school cycle."

Some upstream suppliers believe the new ARM-based notebook could be Microsoft’s new Surface or Lenovo’s new 2-in-1 device. ARM also partnered with Microsoft, looking to penetrate into the notebook market, in 2012; however, the cooperation ended up in failure due to Windows RT’s lack of software support. With AMD gradually picking up its pace and Microsoft’s partnership with Qualcomm, Intel is expected to face fierce competition from both sides.

Portwell XM-1 modularized IoT gateway featuring highly composable structure Portwell DS-1/DS-1B wireless sensor node series featuring wide variety of options for sensors and wireless connectivity FREMONT, CALIF. —April 18, 2017—American Portwell Technology, Inc. (www.portwell.com), a wholly owned subsidiary of Portwell, Inc., a world-leading technology innovator in the Industrial PC (IPC) and embedded computing markets and an Associate member of the Intel® Internet of Things (IoT) Solutions Alliance, empowering the Internet of Things (IoT) with intelligent gateways and edge devices, announces the Portwell XM-1, the first IoT gateway to feature international patents of highly composable structure. XM-1 satisfies customers’ requests for an IoT gateway solution that can meet the requirements emerging from an extensive range of IoT applications. System Characteristics of XM-1 Modularized IoT Gateway - Modularization mechanism with patents - All the communication modules can be hot-plugged on-site without removing the system chassis - Supports four different communication technologies: ZigBee, LoRa, Wi-Fi, 2G/3G/LTE (optional) - Two board choices: ARM processor-based (more power saving) and X86 processor-based (high computing power) - Integration of conventional communications: RS232/422/485 (optional) - 4-port Ethernet Switch (optional) For applications into “diverse” communication interfaces Due to local/specific infrastructural challenges -- such as transmission distance, geological obstacles, limitation of regulation and/or power consumption -- a system integrator involved in a wide variety of IoT projects might need to deploy a gateway solution, ideally, designed with various communication interfaces to ensure that data can be collected effectively under the same IoT structure. With the modularized design of XM-1, the same system integrator can select and “insert” the communication module/s based on “actual” application needs and requirements instead of preparing several different hardware gateways. For example, intelligent agriculture can utilize LoRa long range, low power wireless technology for collecting data, plus LTE (Long-Term Evolution) high-speed wireless communication to connect to the cloud. In other cases, the system integrator might be required to choose to adopt Wi-Fi instead of LTE, and accordingly the LTE module could be exchanged with a Wi-Fi module swiftly and easily. Portwell’s agile XM-1 modularized IoT gateway not only helps save costs, but also provides remarkable flexibility for unlimited IoT deployments within an evolving IoT world. Enhanced efficiency for facility maintenance and upgrade When a communication or connectivity system encounters technical issues, or requires an upgrade, engineers no longer need to open the system/gateway chassis. With its hot-plugging capability, XM-1 facilitates easier maintenance and upgrade. This modular design can dramatically decease the training time for technicians and help the enterprises lower costs and enhance efficiency Portwell also announces a series of wireless sensor nodes, DS-1 and DS-1B, supporting Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and a wide variety of options for sensors and wireless connectivity. System Characteristics of DS-1/DS-1B Wireless Sensor Nodes - Supports ZigBee, LoRa and Wi-Fi for connecting the IoT gateway - Supports sensors with different voltages at the same time - Transfers sensors data with digital, analog, I²C and more - Integrates lithium battery and solar charging, making DS-1B free from space and/or environment limitations - Supports popular Arduino development environment - Sleep mode and extreme power saving feature Connecting numerous sensors under limited space condition The DS-1 series integrates numerous sensors with the electronic and mechanical characteristics, dramatically decreasing circuit and mechanical complexity. The DS-1 series is a highly flexible sensor node solution that makes construction easier, faster and simpler. Can be applied in almost any IoT application imaginable 1. Smart Home Adopting the Wi-Fi communication module and integrating sensors of smoke, CO (carbon monoxide), gas, temperature, humidity and PIR (passive infrared) motion, the DS-1 sensor node series enables an intelligent system to rapidly understand the home environment and provide a more comfortable and safer living experience. 2. Intelligent Agriculture With LoRa long range, low power wireless technology and sensors of soil humidity, CO2 (carbon dioxide) and UV, the DS-1 sensor node series enables an intelligent system to collect useful and valuable data to empower smart farming, such as analyzing the best cultivation plan for the highest yields. 3.

The HiKey 960 comes packing some of the latest smartphone hardware, with Google, ARM, Archermind, LeMaker, and Huawei all teaming up to produce the computer. Its release means developers can take advantage of high-speeds when developing Android software, though the board can also be used as the basis of an Android PC. Related: Best Raspberry Pi projects Up until this point, developers have had to make use of x86 chips to develop software for Android, but Intel has been scaling back Android support on those processors for some time. Linaro, an Android software package developing group that aims to "lead collaboration in the ARM ecosystem by bringing together industry and the open source community", backed the HiKey 960 project. The board itself is about as powerful as today's top-end smartphones and packs Huawei's latest octa-core Kirin 960 processor – the same chip used in the the Huawei Mate 9. There's also 32 GB of storage and 3 GB of RAM, two USB 3.0 ports, backed up by one USB Type-C port, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 support, along with an HDMI port. The HiKey 960 will support resolutions up to 1920 x 1080, and there's the usual array of pins to allow devs to attach other add-ons. Huawei has also made sure the Mali-G71 GPU is capable of outputting 4K, and the board comes with the open-source version of Android. Google has jumped on-board, officially supporting the 960 and the less capable HiKey 620, with the former set to ship in the US, EU, and Japan in early May. The 960 wil go on sale for $240, which works out to around £185 – though we're still confirming UK pricing so stay tuned.

Included are two new AiO PCs — one of which includes Acer's fanless cooling system — and four new notebooks. On the desktop side of things, Acer took the wraps off of the Aspire U27 and Aspire Z24. Both machines pack Intel's 7th-generation Core processors with up to 32GB of RAM. With a 27-inch 1080p display, the U27 includes Acer's LiquidLoop fanless cooling system for quiet operation. Windows Hello is also supported via the built-in webcam. The 24-inch Z24, on the other hand, differentiates itself with NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics. Both machines include v-shaped metal stands that look fairly stylish. The new Aspire notebook lineup, on the other hand, is led chiefly by the Aspire 7. It includes NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics, up to 32GB of RAM, up to an Intel Core i7 processor and an HDR webcam. The Aspire 7 is available in either 15-inch or 17-inch varieties with a textured aluminum cover. Sitting just below the Aspire 7 is the Aspire 5, which likewise offers up to Intel Core i7 processors. The focus of the Aspire 5 is turned towards a "media heavy lifestyle." Up to 20GB of RAM are available with the Aspire 5, along with NVIDIA GeForce graphics (the exact chip isn't specified). Acer says the Aspire 5's 15.6-inch IPS display provides accurate colors at wide viewing angles, while its TrueHarmony tech should deliver "lifelike audio" with two digital microphones. Rounding out the bottom of the range are the Aspire 3 and Aspire 1. The Aspire 3 is available in 14-inch or 15.6-inch varieties, while the Aspire 1 only comes with a 14-inch option. Both include fairly entry-level internals with options for Intel Celeron or Pentium processors — though the Aspire 3 also includes options for Intel's Core processors. As for availability, the Aspire U27 and Z24 are due in North American in May and June for $1,099 and $899, respectively. The Aspire notebooks will be available from June at prices ranging from $219 to $799.

Gen. Michael Flynn received from foreign groups and whether he failed to obtain proper approval to do so, lawmakers and defense officials said Thursday. The Pentagon has in the past advised retiring officers that because they can be recalled to military service, they are subject to the Constitution’s rarely enforced emoluments clause, which prohibits top officials from receiving payments or favors from foreign governments. On Thursday, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, released an Oct. 8, 2014, letter in which a Defense Department lawyer warned Flynn upon his retirement from military service that he was forbidden from receiving payments from foreign sources without receiving permission from the U.S. government first. Flynn received $45,000 to appear in 2015 with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a gala dinner for RT, a Kremlin-controlled media organization. He also worked as a foreign agent representing Turkish interests for a Netherlands-based company, Inovo BV, which paid his company $530,000 in the fall. Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after revelations that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The pugnacious retired officer, who at last year’s Republican National Convention led “lock her up” chants decrying Hillary Clinton, filed paperwork as a foreign agent for Turkish interests about three weeks later, on March 7. Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, has argued that the retired general met requirements for his trip to Russia by briefing the Defense Intelligence Agency, from which he retired in 2014, before and after that trip. The DIA confirmed that he did so in a letter it sent to to the House committee this month, but added that it had no record of Flynn seeking permission or approval to accept money for going. Kelner released a statement on Twitter noting that the letter sent by the DIA to the House committee this month shows Flynn communicated with the agency about his trip to Moscow both before and afterward. It also mentions that Flynn submitted a thumb drive with information about a presentation he made in Russia through his speakers bureau. “General Flynn provided two briefings to the Department — one before and one after the event,” Kelner said. “The Department was fully aware of the trip. We urge DIA and the Committee to release the full, unredacted letter, along with the documents that Flynn provided to DIA during the briefings and details concerning the in-person briefings provided by General Flynn to DIA.” Flynn did not seek permission from the U.S. government to work as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interests, defense officials said last month, raising the possibility that the Pentagon could dock his retirement pay. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said then that the Defense Department was reviewing the issue. The Army had no record of Flynn seeking permission for that arrangement, military officials said. The issue involving Turkey emerged after Flynn retroactively registered in March with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for work that his company, Flynn Intel Group, carried out on behalf of Inovo, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin is not a part of the Turkish government but has links to it. Flynn’s company received three payments between September and November from Inovo before Trump was elected president and the arrangement was discontinued, according to Flynn’s filings. Flynn is the majority owner and chief executive of the Flynn Intel Group. Asked about the inspector general’s investigation Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that he thought it was “appropriate.” “If they think that there’s wrongdoing, then the department’s inspector general should look into that,” he said. But the White House deflected criticism that it failed to properly vet Flynn to be Trump’s top security adviser. Spicer said any improper actions by Flynn also flew under the radar of the Obama administration: The Defense Department issued Flynn a new security clearance in 2016, and Flynn took his trip to Russia in 2015. “All of the clearance was made during the Obama administration, and apparently with knowledge of the trip that he took,” the press secretary said. Flynn’s security clearance at the time, though, would have been granted by career civil servants, not political appointees in the Obama administration. And Spicer indicated that beyond checking that Flynn had a security clearance, the Trump administration did not do much vetting of him — something that new administrations typically do. When asked by reporters if the president had any regrets about bringing Flynn on in the first place, Spicer said: “I think the president made the right decision at the right time, and it’s been pretty clear.” Bruce Anderson, a spokesman for the Defense Department’s inspector general, said the investigation into Flynn began April 4. The watchdog’s office did not discuss the investigation publicly until after the House Oversight Committee released documents about it, and the inspector general typically does not disclose what it is reviewing while an investigation is underway. “These documents raise grave questions about why Gen. Flynn concealed the payments he received from foreign sources after he was warned explicitly by the Pentagon,” Cummings said. “Our next step is to get the documents we are seeking from the White House so we can complete our investigation.” The latest revelations from the Pentagon came as congressional Democrats put more pressure on Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, to make good on vows to investigate the Flynn matter. Chaffetz announced Wednesday that he plans to take a medical leave of up to four weeks to repair screws implanted in his foot years ago after an accident. It is likely that House GOP leaders will appoint an interim chairman in his absence. Two Republican members who emerged Thursday from the room with the documents about Flynn brushed off questions from reporters. But a group of Democrats on the committee addressed the media. “The information that we received this morning was quite troubling. Actually, it left us with more questions, I would say, than answers,” Rep. Val Demings, D-Florida, said.   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Rockefeller’s will leaves art, millions of dollars, a Maine island Man dead in Old Town meth lab explosion Army veteran from Maine accused of brutally killing service dog This ‘ice carousel’ covered in snowmobiles may be the most quintessentially Maine thing ever recorded 2015 shooting rampage suspect appears in court through FaceTime, but refuses to talk LePage’s continued monument opposition jeopardizes Katahdin region’s progress Saturday, April 29, 2017: Maine needs immigrants, support solar bill, school nurses critical Minimum wage warriors see certainty in ambiguity Trump’s presidency is teaching elites like me a lesson Sen.

E-Mail Out-of-Office Replies Show More One of the original poster children of the big data software craze, Cloudera, is due for its long-awaited IPO this week. Sometime Thursday afternoon, its shares will price somewhere between $12 and $14 and will open for trading on the New York Stock Exchange the following morning, raising about $200 million in the process. Make no mistake, this IPO qualifies as what’s known in venture capital circles as a down round. Essentially the new investors are buying shares in a company that is worth less than it was during its prior funding rounds. When Cloudera last raised money in 2014 it took a jaw-dropping $740 million from the chipmaker Intel, which paid a little less than $31 a share for a stake in the company amounting to about 19 percent. That investment implied that Cloudera was then worth about $4.1 billion. Depending on its final price, when trading on Cloudera shares opens on Friday, Cloudera will be worth less than half that: About $1.8 billion. What happened to that valuation? A lot of things, but as the IPO process progressed, it became clear that there was no way that Cloudera could justify a valuation north of $4 billion, especially when compared to a publicly held competitor it has tried mightily to ignore: Hortonworks. Cloudera and Hortonworks compete in selling and servicing open-source software for analyzing data called Hadoop, and a set of related technologies. Hadoop was a central factor in the “big data” hype cycle that rocked the enterprise software world earlier this decade. That hype cycle has cooled, and shifted toward newer, shinier buzzwords including artificial intelligence and machine learning. And yet the more you look at Cloudera’s S1 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Cloudera minimizes mentions of Hadoop, which is still very much its primary line of business, mentioning it 14 times in a 150-page document. The new emphasis is on “machine learning” a phrase it repeats 70 times.  But Hadoop is still without question, Cloudera's main business, just as it is the main business at Hortonworks. At Cloudera, Hadoop gets packaged with proprietary software in an approach it calls Hybrid Open Source Software or HOSS. The HOSS approach, it argues, is aimed at large corporate customers who want an "enterprise-grade" product. Hortonworks has for its part sought to stay true to its roots in Hadoop while evolving into adjacent businesses in order to address wider markets. It has built enterprise-grade products for security, governance, and operations. One example is a dedicated streaming analytics platform called Hortonworks DataFlow intended for use with Internet of Things applications. Cloudera customers are told to use Spark Streaming which isn't comparable.   As you work further through the document you first see Cloudera start to squirm awkwardly on the subject of Hortonworks in the only place the latter company warrants a mention. In the section where Cloudera names its competitors, and break them into four tiers. Hortonworks and another Hadoop company MapR appear only in the fourth, as if to say “Oh, them… Are they still around?” Yes it is, very much so. Hortonworks has ties to all three of those first-tier competitors: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is a strategic investor in Hortonworks, and the other three, IBM and Oracle and Teradata are partners who resell Hortonworks. Where Cloudera sees competitors, Hortonworks sees allies.  And the further you compare it Hortonworks, the more it makes sense to compare them, because it turns out that Hortonworks stands up pretty well. Consider annual revenue: Cloudera, founded in 2008, posted revenue of $261 million in its most recently completed fiscal year. By itself that figure would be fine for a software company first coming public. And yet when compared to Hortonworks, founded in 2011, it’s easy to ask yourself “Is that all?" Despite a three-year operational head start over Hortonworks, Cloudera’s annual revenue was only $77 million ahead of Hortonworks. (Hortonworks has been public for nearly three years and posted revenue of $184.5 million in its fiscal 2016.) Put another way: Cloudera had a three year head start, and yet the smaller Hortonworks has already grown to 70 percent of its size. By one key financial metric — billings, or the combined value of invoices sent to customers in a period — Hortonworks is growing faster than Cloudera. At Hortonworks billings grew year-on-year by 63 percent to $270 million while at Cloudera they grew 54 percent to $320 million. Yet again, Cloudera seeks to change the subject. Billings, Cloudera argues in the filing “are not an accurate indicator of future revenue.” None of this is to suggest that Cloudera won’t have a successful IPO this week and make its venture capital investors -- mainly Greylock and Accel who combine for nearly 29 percent of Cloudera’s equity -- very happy. Tech IPOs have remained popular. And most of the tech companies who completed their IPOs in 2016 got off to good starts but some have seen their share prices dip below the offering price since then. We’ll soon see if this one was worth the wait. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

In an interview ahead of his 100th day in office, Trump said a major conflict with North Korea was possible over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, but he would prefer a diplomatic outcome to the dispute. A slew of U.S. earnings released after the closing bell on Thursday have been less inspiring. While Google parent Alphabet and Amazon reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, Intel and Microsoft reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Starbucks' same-store sales also failed to meet Wall Street expectations. China's Shanghai Composite index rose 2.47 points or 0.08 percent to 3,154.66, but ended the week down about 0.6 percent on concerns over tightening regulation and cooling economic growth. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 88 points or 0.36 percent at 24,610 in late trade. Japanese shares lost ground as investors digested a barrage of economic data. The Nikkei average dropped 55.13 points or 0.29 percent to 19,196.74, but ended the week with a 3 percent gain. The broader Topix index closed 0.32 percent lower at 1,531.80. Nintendo shares rallied 2.1 percent after the company said strong sales of its new Switch console will help it to double annual profits. Sony Corp edged down marginally and Honda Motor shed 0.4 percent before releasing their earnings results after the market close. On the economic front, Japan's industrial output fell 2.1 percent in March from the previous month after a 3.2 percent gain in February, government data showed. The jobless rate held steady at 2.8 percent in the month, household spending fell more than expected and consumer price inflation remained stagnant at 0.2 percent, while retail sales rose more than expected, separate reports showed. Australian shares ended flat but posted their third straight month of gains. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed up 2.60 points or 0.04 percent at 5,924.10, while the broader All Ordinaries index inched up 3.20 points or 0.05 percent at 5,947.60. Mining giant BHP Billiton shed 0.6 percent, while Rio Tinto rose 1.1 percent and smaller rival Fortescue Metals Group climbed 1.9 percent. Energy majors Oil Search and Origin Energy fell over 1 percent, but Santos rose 1.2 percent. Banks ended narrowly mixed. Gold miners Newcrest and Northern Star tumbled around 4 percent each as gold remained on track to post its biggest weekly fall in seven. Tatts Group declined 3.8 percent after the company rejected a sweetened all-cash A$6 billion bid from private equity group Pacific Consortium. South Korea's Kospi average slid 4.02 points or 0.18 percent to 2,205.44 and the local currency hit a one-week low as industrial output data for March missed estimates and Trump called the five-year-old trade pact with South Korea "unacceptable". South Korea said it would adopt a "wait and see" stance, after Trump told Reuters he would either renegotiate or terminate a "horrible" trade deal with the country. New Zealand's NZX-50 index rose 24.14 points or 0.33 percent to 7,378.75 after data showed building consents in the country grew strongly on an annual basis in March. Another report showed that the country's merchandise trade surplus widened in the month from a year earlier. The Taiwan Weighted closed 0.1 percent higher after preliminary figures showed Taiwan's economic growth moderated at a slower-than-expected pace in the three months ended March. Singapore's Straits Times index was moving up 0.2 percent, extending gains for a sixth straight session, even as data showed the country's employment rate hit its highest level since 2009 in the first quarter of the year. India's Sensex was declining 0.3 percent amid profit taking after recent sharp gains. Indonesia's Jakarta Composite index was down 0.3 percent while Malaysian shares were marginally higher. Overnight, U.S. stocks eked out modest gains as investors digested a flood of earnings reports and sluggish economic reports on jobless claims, durable goods orders and pending home sales. The Dow inched up marginally and the S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 percent to reach a fresh record closing high. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Previous Story Next Story More Commentary -Global Major Averages Close Lower On The Day But Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mixed Ahead Of Long Holiday Weekend Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Major Averages Showing Modest Moves In Morning Trading - U.S. Commentary Futures Pointing To Roughly Flat Open On Wall Street - U.S. Commentary Street Might Open Moderately Higher Sensex Drops 111 Points Ahead Of Long Weekend; Nifty Ends At 9304 European Shares Mixed Amid Earnings Deluge European Shares Seen Lower After Trump Comments Sensex Dips Below 30000; Nifty Down 37 Points Sensex, Nifty To See Lackluster Start As Biocon Disappoints Asian Markets Mixed Amid Cautious Trades Flat Lead Tipped For Thai Stock Market Indonesia Market May Test Support At 5,700 Points Hong Kong Bourse Due For Profit Taking <<Previous        53 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed The World's Richest Bachelors And Bachelorettes Uber's Self-Driving Head Out Amid Waymo Lawsuit Southwest Ending Practice Of Overbooking Electrolux Stock Up On Higher Q1 Results GM Q1 Results Climb, Top Estimates; Backs FY17 Adj.

At the time, the computer maker did not elaborate much on the details of the machine especially its price. A few weeks later, it was reported that the blazing fast machine would cost anyone somewhere around $9,000. While the price maybe a deterrent, Acer then moved on and developed a cheaper version of the laptop, the Acer Predator Triton 700. On the face of it, the new Acer Predator Triton 700 has taken much of the performance gains seen on the original Acer Predator. However, Acer deemed it an better to not give the Triton a massive screen. Instead, the company settled for a 15.6-inch matte IPS with full HD resolution. To keep the cost down, the Acer Predator Triton only equips a single NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 series graphics card instead of two. However, it does sport the latest generation Intel Kaby Lake chip. Acer Predator Triton 700 (via pcadvisor.com) In terms of storage and memory, this is where Acer did not skimp at all. Instead of the usual spinning platter or SSD-type drive, the new gaming laptop has two NVMe storage drives. Meanwhile, it can carry as much as 32GB of DDR4 RAM running at 2,400MHz. On the aesthetics, the blue-lit low-profile mechanical keyboard is more of a welcomed change. While the high-profile version of the same keyboard is the predominant choice with most gamers, the slimmed down version makes for less bulk and a lighter build. One quirky feature of the Acer Predator Triton 700 is the top-mounted Gorilla Glass-covered trackpad. Because it’s been moved to the top of the keyboard, access to it can be quite weird during normal uses. However, on gaming mode, it does not cause distractions as users will have full unencumbered access to the keyboard. Overall, the Acer Predator Triton 700 is one mean machine. Granted, it does not compare to the Predator 21X’x giant display as well as dual graphics card. But for $3,000, gamers will grab this one rather than the $9,000 counterpart.

The big story coming out of Europe on Thursday is that of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Governing Council meeting. Thursday’s meeting was held to discuss the future of the bank’s current stimulus programme, commonly referred to as Quantitative Easing, which is set to come to an end later on this year. With inflation close the ECB’s threshold and the European economy going from strength to strength, Mario Draghi, the ECB’s president, is facing increasing pressure to increase interest rates and wind down the stimulus programme, but the outcome of Thursday’s meeting resulted in leaving interests rates unchanged and the continuation of the stimulus programme. American markets During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump threatened that he will pull the United States out of NAFTA, but went back on his word on Wednesday The S&P 500, tracking the largest 500 companies in America, posted a gain 0f 0.06% as earnings season is currently underway with Alphabet, Intel and Microsoft all releasing their earnings. During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump threatened that he will pull the United States out of NAFTA, which is a free trade zone between the three North American countries of Canada, US and Mexico, should he win the presidency. On Wednesday, he went back on his earlier comments as he stated that the US will remain within NAFTA. Following his remarks, the Mexican peso, the Mexican national currency, and the Canadian dollar both rose against the American dollar. Airbus profits nosedive Airbus has had its earnings fall by more than 50% in the last three months Airbus, the French aeroplane maker, has had its earnings fall by more than 50% in the last three months. This was mainly due to the delay in the delivery of its newest civil models. The company faces three problems to deal with this year; glitches affecting engines on its A320 model, together with production delays on its twin aisle A350 model and cost overruns on the A400M military transport model have bogged down the company. Airbus shares have fallen by more than half a percent during Thursday’s session following the announcement by the company, although on a yearly basis shares are up by more than 25%. Deutsche Bank trails peers Deutsche Bank posted first quarter results that have seen it fall behind its competitors Deutsche Bank, Europe’s largest investment bank, posted first quarter results that have seen it fall behind its competitors. The bank’s largest source of income is derived from the trading of bonds and currencies and although this division’s revenue of the German bank have risen by 11%, it failed to reach the pace set by its American rivals. Another source of revenue for the bank, which is currently undergoing a restructuring plan by its CEO John Cryan following several penalties by authorities and litigation, is that of stock dealing. This unit has seen a 10% decline in its revenue. As part of its restructuring plan, the bank sought to tap the markets for €8 billion this month in order to inject fresh new capital and revive the business. The bank saw its shares taking a hit on Thursday as shares fell by almost 3%. Disclaimer: This article was issued by Simon Gauci Borda, Trader at Calamatta Cuschieri.

This keeps the index in a 7225-7260 range since the breakdown on Wednesday, with a trend of falling highs to overcome. Bulls need to see a break back above 7260 if they want to see 7300. Bears want another test of 7225 to open the door for a drop towards 7160. Watch levels: Bullish 7260, Bearish 7235. A positive opening call comes as sentiment gets a boost from banking sector results and an oil price rebound on hopes of an extension to OPEC production cuts. This offsets a negative session in Asia where investors took profits and balked at Trump saying he wants to renegotiate a South Korean trade deal and that there was the possibility of a major conflict with North Korea. Australia’s ASX outperforms, just positive as IT names offset weakness in materials which is thankfully limited by the oil price bounce. Japan’s Nikkei dented by the Yen off its lows, some disappointing macro data and weakness among financials. This morning, continuing the consensus-beating good news from banks this week note Barclays Q1 pre-tax profits more than doubled although impairment charges also rose and legacy legal issues remain. RBS has posted its first profit since September and reiterated FY guidance, while Swiss giant UBS’s shares are called 3% thanks to Q1 benefiting from strong wealth management performance. The UK government has also cuts its bailout stake in Lloyds to below 1%. US equities closed mostly flat, although the Nasdaq outperformed (another record high) on well-placed expectations of solid results from Alphabet Amazon and Microsoft, even if Intel disappointed. Investors were also relieved to hear Trump decided not to terminate NAFTA, some good news after his tax news underwhelmed, and that progress is being made with the Healthcare bill, which could unlock the door to funding the tax cuts and infrastructure spending markets are so desperate for. Crude Oil prices have bounced back from yesterday’s sharp sell-off (Brent >$52; WTI >$49), one that was driven by continued fears about rising US output following this week’s inventory data compounded by Libya bringing its largest oil field (Sharara) back on-line, merely adding to headwinds OPEC already faces with its production cut efforts.  2-week downtrends yet to be overcome however. Gold remains rangebound $1265-70 after a 2-week sell-off, albeit holding a 1-month uptrend. The precious metal is supported by a pickup in demand from China and India, however, geopolitics and US monetary policy outlook may take over in terms of short-term drivers. In focus is UK GDP (9.30am) with consensus expecting a sequential slowdown in growth to 0.4% in Q1 from 0.7% in Q4, the slowest since Q1 last year. On an annual basis, however, growth should jump to 2.2%, the fastest since Q2 2015, surely cheering the Brexiteers. Eurozone Consumer Price Inflation (CPI; 10am) will likely echo Germany’s improvement towards February highs, however, more attention will surely be paid to a forecast Core print of 1.0% - highest since March 2016 - after what ECB President Draghi said yesterday in terms of what he wants to see before normalising Eurozone monetary policy further. US GDP (1.30pm) likely slowed markedly in Q1, back to levels close to that of the same quarter last year, the same thing visible in Personal Consumption, although inflation metrics will please the hawks, with Core PCE improving to the magic 2.0% level and Employment Costs edging higher. Chicago PMI (2.45pm) may give up a little ground in April while Uni of Michigan Consumer Confidence holds firm and we expect results from Chevron, Colgate-Palmolive, Exxon Mobil, General Motors and Goodyear.

Hot Topics: Fatal Colo. 66 crash Fatal Main Street crash Firestone house explosion AAA Electric fire Sanctuary city News tips Anadarko shuts 3,000 wells in Colorado after deadly Firestone house explosion Oil and gas company operated well 200 feet from home that exploded By Amelia Arvesen Staff Writer Posted:   04/26/2017 03:55:27 PM MDT Updated:   04/26/2017 08:26:29 PM MDT A well head is seen Wednesday in a fenced-off area near the house that exploded and burned in the 6300 block of Twilight Avenue in Firestone last week, killing two people inside and injuring two others. (Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer) Erin and Mark Martinez (Courtesy Photo) Related Firestone house explosion Apr 28: Results of Firestone oil and gas well probe could fuel policy debate Apr 27: As Firestone investigation continues, state won't shut down other operators' older wells Apr 20: Coroner officially IDs brothers-in-law killed in Firestone fire Investigators confirmed Wednesday that they're looking at a 24-year-old well operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation as part of their probe into the house explosion that killed two men in Firestone last week. That revelation followed an announcement by Anadarko that it has shut down more than 3,000 similar vertical wells across northeast Colorado, including the well that sits about 170 feet from the home at 6312 Twilight Ave. that exploded April 17. Investigators have not announced the origin or cause of the explosion. Frederick-Firestone Fire Chief Theodore Poszywak said in a news release that officials have determined there is no threat to other homes in that Firestone neighborhood, and have communicated that with residents.

"...Our priorities are to ensure the safety of the neighborhood, and to complete a systematic, thorough and timely investigation to determine a conclusive cause." Anadarko — the largest Weld County oil and gas producer in 2014, according to state data obtained by Natural Gas Intel — did not directly link its well to the explosion, and said in a news release that "there is still much that is not yet known regarding the potential contributing factors." Advertisement The bodies of brothers-in-law Mark Martinez and Joey Irwin, both 42, were discovered in the basement one day after the explosion. Martinez's wife, Erin, was seriously injured and continues to heal in the hospital. A child, believed to be her 11-year-old son, was also injured. Family and friends said Irwin had been called to help the Martinez family with the hot-water heater in their two-story home that they had lived in since 2015. Both Martinez and Irwin were experienced handymen, working as a public works foreman and as a plumber, respectively. Construction crews building new apartments have continued working behind the neighborhood since the explosion. A chain-link fence that once surrounded the leveled home and its mildly-burned western neighbor now extends around a field east of the home, where the Anadarko well is located, south-central from the field behind its own tan fence. In its statement, Anadarko characterized the well as "an older vertical well that was drilled by a previous operator in 1993." The company said it has shut down all of its vertical wells "of the same vintage" across northeastern Colorado, and will keep them off until the company's field personnel conduct inspections and testing of wellheads and associated underground lines.

Horizontal wells start with a vertical well, but then diverge horizontally through layers of rock to tap into more than one point. "As such, the company has been working cooperatively with fire officials and state regulatory agencies in their investigations since the time of the accident," Anadarko said in its news release. The company — with other operations in Wyoming, Texas, Utah, the Gulf of Mexico, South America, Africa and New Zealand, according to its website — operates more than 3,000 producing vertical wells of the same approximate age as the one located near the site of the Firestone house explosion. The company said the wells account for a total production of about 13,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. According to the release, inspections will focus on areas where housing and commercial developments are in close proximity to existing infrastructure. The company also said wells will not be reactivated for two to four weeks. "Our teams will remain actively engaged with residents in the Firestone community," said Brad Holly, an Anadarko official. "Colorado residents must feel safe in their own homes, and I want to be clear that we are committed to understanding all that we can about this tragedy as we work with each investigating agency until causes can be determined." The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission also released a statement to say that crews are taking environmental samples and inspecting oil and gas wells in the area of the explosion, which includes Anadarko's oil and gas operation southeast of the house. The commission said it has been assisting the Frederick-Firestone Fire Protection District and the Firestone Police Department with the ongoing investigation. As of Wednesday, Anadarko shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, were down 12 cents at the end of the day and closed at $59.96.

In an interview ahead of his 100th day in office, Trump said a major conflict with North Korea was possible over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, but he would prefer a diplomatic outcome to the dispute. Meanwhile, South Korea said it would adopt a "wait and see" stance, after Trump told Reuters he would either renegotiate or terminate a "horrible" trade deal with the country. U.S. earnings released after the closing bell on Thursday have been less inspiring. While Google parent Alphabet and Amazon reported better -than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, Intel and Microsoft reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Starbucks' same-store sales also failed to meet Wall Street expectations. Energy giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil will unveil their financial results before the opening bell later today. In economic releases, U.K. consumer confidence ebbed in April, the latest survey from GfK revealed with an index score of -7, in line with expectations and down from -6 in March. First-quarter GDP data out of the U.K. and France as well as euro-zone inflation figures for April are slated for release later in the day. Across the Atlantic, investors look forward to data on first quarter GDP, consumer sentiment and Chicago-area business activity. Asian shares are mostly lower this morning and the euro was little changed while oil prices rose in Asian deals after ending lower on Thursday as two key Libyan oilfields restarted production. The yen inched up against the dollar as a raft of data indicated that the modest recovery in the world's third-largest economy is continuing for a fifth quarter. Overnight, U.S. stocks eked out modest gains as investors digested a flood of earnings reports and sluggish economic reports on jobless claims, durable goods orders and pending home sales. The Dow inched up marginally and the S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 percent to reach a fresh record closing high. European markets snapped a six-session winning streak on Thursday as Trump's tax plan offered few details and ECB President Mario Draghi offered a mixed picture on inflation and policy outlook. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index eased 0.2 percent. The German DAX slid 0.2 percent, France's CAC 40 index shed 0.3 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 declined 0.7 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Market Analysis Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Previous Story Next Story European Market news European Markets Finish Mixed Ahead Of Long Holiday Weekend European Shares Mixed Amid Earnings Deluge European Markets Snap Winning Streak After ECB Holds Firm European Shares Retreat Ahead Of ECB Meeting FTSE 100 Slides On Trump Tax-plan Disappointment CAC 40 Falls Ahead Of ECB Meeting DAX Drifts Lower Ahead Of ECB Rate Decision European Shares Seen Lower On Trump Tax-plan Disappointment European Markets Finish Little Changed Ahead Of ECB Meeting European Shares Little Changed As Focus Turns To ECB European Shares Seen Up On Trump's Tax Plan Optimism European Markets Inch Higher After Yesterday's Strong Rally European Shares Mostly Higher On Earnings FTSE 100 Steadies After Big Rally CAC 40 Edges Higher In Choppy Trade <<Previous        23 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Major Averages Close Lower On The Day But Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary The World's Richest Bachelors And Bachelorettes Congress Avoids Government Shutdown With Stopgap Spending Bill Uber's Self-Driving Head Out Amid Waymo Lawsuit Southwest Ending Practice Of Overbooking Beyonce Announces Scholarships To Mark 'Lemonade' Anniversary U.S. Consumer Sentiment Nearly Unchanged In April Chicago Business Barometer Unexpectedly Indicates Faster Growth In April Google's VR Hamilton Experience For Students Eurozone Inflation Climbs To ECB Target Trump Warns Of Major Conflict With North Korea Rights Groups Allege Trump Threatened Human Rights In First 100 Days Wall Street Set To Open Strong Stocks May Open Roughly Flat As Traders Digest Earnings News - U.S. Commentary European Shares Seen Up On Trump's Tax Plan Optimism Stocks Close Mostly Higher On Upbeat Earnings News - U.S. Commentary European Shares Seen Lower After Trump Comments Asian Shares Mixed Despite French Election Relief Wall Street Aims Mixed Opening Stocks Manage To Close Mostly Higher, Nasdaq Sets Record High - U.S. Commentary Win Streak May Continue For Singapore Stock Market Australian Market Rises Ahead Of CPI Data Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Stocks Show Strong Move To The Upside - U.S. Commentary Sensex Soars 287 Points After Late Rally; Nifty Ends Above 9300 Wall Street Set To Open Strong Asian Shares Extend Gains On Improved Risk Appetite Asian Markets Higher After Global Rally Indonesia Bourse Expected To Open In The Green Rebound Tipped For Thai Stock Market Singapore Market May Challenge 3,150-Point Mark Markets Cheer French Election Results, Dow Up Nearly 200 -- U.S. Commentary European Markets Soar On French Election Results Markets To Cheer French Vote, Home Capital In Crosshairs -- Canadian Commentary CAC 40 Up 214 Points Led By Banks DAX Rallies Led By Banks Copyright © 2017 RTTNews.

Acer’s recently announced Triton 700 gaming laptop looks like an attempt to take on Razer in this domain. The Triton 700, unveiled at Acer’s next@acer event in New York, is a 15.6-inch device that weighs just 2.6 kg and measures 18.9 mm from the side. This relatively slim chassis will house a 7th generation Intel processor, an Nvidia GeForce 10-series graphics card, up to 32 GB of DDR4 RAM and two NVMe PCIe SSDs in RAID 0. That last just means that your storage will be blisteringly fast. The display offered is a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) display with support for Nvidia G-Sync to limit screen tearing in gaming. Connectivity options include Killer DoubleShot Pro networking, Thunderbolt 3 support, two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, one HDMI 2.0 port, one DisplayPort and one Ethernet port. Oh, and Acer’s apparently managed to squeeze an RGB-backlit “mechanical” keyboard into that chassis. These don’t seem to be the traditional, Cherry MX type mechanical keys however, and seem more akin to the butterfly switches on Apple’s MacBooks. That’s not all that’s interesting about the keyboard, however. It’s been moved down, where the trackpad would be, and the trackpad has been made larger, transparent, and placed near the display hinge. The trackpad is made of Gorilla Glass, so at least it shouldn’t break easily. The placement of the trackpad is unusual, but this is a gaming laptop, after all, and you’ll probably be using it with a mouse anyway. Acer hasn’t clarified the exact specifications of the device, so we can’t comment on its capabilities. Acer did add that its using an “AeroBlade 3D” fan with metal blades to help cool this device. Interestingly Acer claims that the Triton 700 is designed to be VR-ready, so we can assume that the GPU will be a powerful one. The device’ pricing is expected to start at $2,999, which is almost Rs 2,00,000 in the US. India pricing and availability details are yet to be revealed, but the prices will definitely be way higher.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Microsoft needs to stop blocking updates on Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs By Martin Brinkmann on April 28, 2017 in Windows - Last Update:April 28, 2017 39 Microsoft's decision to block security and non-security updates on customer PCs running Windows 7 or 8.1 (or the server variants) with "next-generation silicon" is as customer unfriendly as it gets. What makes this all the more problematic is the fact that Microsoft's detection routines, those that identify the processor of a PC to determine whether updates will be blocked or allowed, is flawed. We already talked about some "old generation" processors being caught in the crossfire before. Windows users reported that PCs with AMD Carrizo processors were blocked from installing updates even though that should not have happened according to Microsoft. It was clear then that Microsoft screwed up the identification of processors. Now, a story on Infoworld highlights that AMD Carrizo systems are not the only ones caught in the crossfire. Woody reports cases of Dutch computer users whose machines were updated-blocked by Microsoft. The processors of these machines? A nearly decade old Intel Pentium Dual Core E5400 2.70GHz CPU, and a Celeron J1900 from 2013. There is even a report from another user who got updated-blocked by Microsoft after replacing a graphics card with an AMD Radeon RX480. If true, it would suggest that the detection cannot even get that right, or includes graphics cards as well in determining which customers to serve with updates, and which to block even though Microsoft did not mention that at all. Microsoft lists only the following three processor generations when it comes to update-blocking: Intel seventh (7th)-generation processors AMD Bristol Ridge Qualcomm 8996 Customer unfriendly move As time goes by, more and more Windows users will upgrade the processors in their machines. While the number of users who will upgrade the processor of a PC is relatively small when compared to users who purchase new PCs instead, it is still a sizeable number that will run into the update-blocking issue. Microsoft's decision to block its customers from receiving updates on supported machines is as customer unfriendly as it gets especially since the block includes security updates and patches as well. The situation is even more dire for users whose PCs are falsely flagged as next generation processors when they are clearly not. Without security patches, PCs remain vulnerable to vulnerabilities that could have been patched. Who is responsible then for any damage done when attackers manage to exploit these already patched vulnerabilities on PCs that are update-blocked by Microsoft? Customers are not informed by Microsoft, through Windows Update for instance, that installation of a particular patch will break updating on the PC deliberately. Microsoft should at least inform users about that prior to enabling the blocking on the PC. Workarounds Windows users who experience the issue -- that their PC won't receive any more patches despite its operating system being supported by Microsoft for years to come -- have two options right now to deal with the issue. First, there is a bypass for Windows Updates being blocked which requires you to patch a system file. The method seems to work right now, but may require further patching when Microsoft alters files responsible for identifying processors, or adds more protection mechanisms to the whole process. Second, Ask Woody lounge member Mr Brian highlights a manual option on how to install patches on blocked systems. This involves some uninstalling and installing of updates, and may take a bit of time and research on your part to get right. Tip: read this to find out how to list all installed updates on Windows. There is also the option to switch to another operating system, for instance a Linux flavor. Closing Words I think that Microsoft went too far with this, and should reconsider the whole approach. Considering that Windows 7 and 8.1 operating systems are still supported by Microsoft, the company should honor this by providing patches to all customers on those systems for as long as the operating systems are supported. Yes, this may require more testing and maybe some tweaks for some of the patches, but it is the right thing to do. Now You: Should Microsoft reconsider, or can you understand the company's decision? Summary Article Name Microsoft needs to stop blocking updates on Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs Description Microsoft's decision to block security and non-security updates on customer PCs running Windows 7 or 8.1 (or the server variants) with "next-generation silicon" is as customer unfriendly as it gets.

Not a surprising move from Microsoft. Reply DaveyK April 28, 2017 at 10:18 am # Problem is that in the past, Microsoft used the "Carrot" approach to enticing OS upgrades - lots of hyping of the new OS and how wonderful it was, what new stuff it supported and all that, plus a few "exclusive" games and whatnot. This time around, MS is using the stick approach - repeatedly hitting Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users to try and get them to upgrade. Whether it's malware updates, or just blocking them altogether. Whether you buy into it or not, it is causing an increasing amount of bad blood among Microsoft's customers, and is making some of them (such as myself) dig in their heels even more. I will not be forced to "upgrade" to Windows 10 just because Microsoft wants to treat its customer base like dirt. Reply AnorKnee Merce April 28, 2017 at 6:21 pm # Enterprises, not consumers, are where M$ make most of their money$ from sales of Windows licenses. This azz-hat move by M$ is to mainly push corporate Win 7/8.1 Enterprise Volume License(VL) buyers onto Win 10 = gotta pay money$ to M$ to buy new Win 10 Ent VL and Software Assurance/Insurance(SA). Some large corporations pay M$ US$millions for such. Since 2009, many corporations have bought Win 7/8.1 Ent VL and expected to use them on their computers for about 10 years until EOL in 2020/2023 = very cost-effective but less profits for M$. Today, some of them may need to buy new OEM computers as replacements or for business expansion. To do so, they have to first buy new OEM Win 10 Pro computers and then downgrade them to Win 7/8.1 Pro before converting them to Win 7/8.1 Ent VL. ....... By blocking Intel Kabylake and AMD Ryzen processors from receiving updates for Win 7/8.1, M$ are trying to push the affected corporations onto Win 10. Fyi, corporations who paid less upfront money to M$ to lease/rent/subscribe Win 7/8.1 Ent VL, eg start-ups, usually for a minimum 3 year term-lease, were required to also buy Software Assurance. Those who bought Win 7/8.1 Ent VL were not required to buy SA. But in 2014, even the buyers were required by M$ to buy the 3-year-term SA, at least once. ....... SA gives "free" OS upgrade within 3 years. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ We know that each Win 10 Version has an EOL of about 2 years, except for the very expensive Win 10 Ent E5 VL LTSB(= more than double the cost of Win 10 Ent E3 VL) which is 10 years. ....... Corporations who buy new Win 10 Ent E3 VL will only be able to use them for only 2 years, instead of the previous 10 years for Win 7/8.1 Ent VL. After the 2 years is up, they will have to pay M$ again to buy new Win 10 Ent E3 VL. ....... Corporations who lease/rent/subscribe Win 10 Ent E3 or E5 VL will be able to use them perpetually since SA is required = "free" upgrades, like for Office 365 subscriptions. ....... So, in due time, many corporations will be "forced" to lease/rent/subscribe, instead of buy, Win 10 Ent VL. Fyi, only bought-up Win 10 Ent E5 VL can be converted to LTSB, eg for OS stability. Subscription-based Win 10 Ent E5(= costs minimum US$168 per year per user/employee) cannot be converted to LTSB since they can get perpetual upgrades. Reply jern April 28, 2017 at 6:45 pm # I agree with David. MS is making money in the cloud and its product revenue is slowly declining. It doesn't care about Windows customers any more. There are only two alternatives - either MS is trying to force users of older software/hardware to upgrade or they no longer give a shit about doing it right - and, maybe, a bit of both. Reply zund April 28, 2017 at 9:35 am # "I think that Microsoft went to far with this..." I think that Microsoft went to far with nearly everything they've done within the last five years. Reply ellisgl April 28, 2017 at 9:40 am # No shit right. They've added some nice things, but have been taking things away since the 9x builds. Also moving things & renaming things really messes with the experience. They are getting to the point where they are matching MacOS, making it harder than hell to do things/fixes things. Reply Tom Hawack April 28, 2017 at 11:46 am # It's called the carrot and stick approach. More of a stick when the company's carrot isn't even attractive. Whoever thinks Win10 is attractive is either blind or masochist. Of course Microsoft did some good things, nothing is binary (all good - all bad). Civilizations as businesses have disappeared even though they included the best at one time. The problem is they didn't sustain that best when making decisions incompatible with that best, when deeply modifying their policies. And this is what is happening to many companies, be it Microsoft and Mozilla. It's not that other majors are more ethical but only that their long-term life expectancy is greater because their approach is smarter. The devil made its way up to now not because it was good but because it was and remains smart. But life is longer than the longest long-terms. Anything which clashes with ethics is bound to disappear and the term depends on smartness. Corky April 28, 2017 at 9:45 am # Maybe they think if they keep telling people that they take the security of their customer very seriously and that trust is very important to them that customers won't notice how Microsoft's actions betray their words. Reply Yuliya April 28, 2017 at 10:16 am # Even when it desperately tries to be evil, Micro$oft comes out as incompetent nowadays. Lovely. Reply Henk van Setten April 28, 2017 at 11:14 am # Right. Please allow me to remind you that according to Netmarketshare, the current (March 2017) "Desktop Operating System Market Share" (measured through all browsers) is 57.65% for Win 7 and 8x combined (49.42% for Win 7 only), and just a measly 25.36% for Win 10. The excessive attention here at Ghacks for every little new Win 10 update or feature does in fact fit in Microsoft's own publicity offensive: in that it helps suggesting that Win 10 is the only OS that matters today. But in reality, Win 10 market share growth is stalling for quite some time now. The large majority of Windows users are not using Win 10, but Win 7. And they will most probably keep doing so for the near future. In accordance with the actual users' situation, blogs like Ghacks should pay far more attention to informative posts that are useful for the majority (that is, relevant to Windows 7 users) and use far less space to flout every Microsoft publicity fart about their pitiful Windows 10. Reply Corky April 28, 2017 at 2:07 pm # I can't disagree with your sentiment towards Windows 10 however the reason so many sites, not just Ghacks, cover Windows 10 is because it's the latest version of Windows and just like most new things they get talked about more because they're, well, new. Most information about older versions of Windows has already been discovered, discussed, and written about. Reply Gary D April 28, 2017 at 4:33 pm # Unlike some other sites, a lot of Martin's blogs about Win 10 warn users to beware of installing flawed updates because of the borking ( is that a word ? ) effect they have on PCs / Laptops. His in depth explanations of the contents of these updates are well worth publishing and reading. Also, he spends a lot of time researching workarounds in order to avoid the pit falls of giving MS free rein with installations.

This is nothing more than a unilateral breach of contract.

Reply Klaas Vaak April 28, 2017 at 5:56 pm # No, you did not. I bought a Win 8.1 PC 2½ years ago & have been very happy with it. But M$ broke my Windows Update tool in the Control Panel 2x 6 months ago, and even DISM could not fixed it. I stayed without updates until today I read on this site about WSUS. I ran it, and wow, it works like a dream !!!! What's more, the latest version of WSUS let you choose if you only want to download & install security-only updates. I will never touch the CP tool again. Reply ddk April 28, 2017 at 11:02 pm # Wow, no wonder then my Win 8 update panel continuously scrolls forever. I'm guessing you might have a 3rd party program through the CP. I don't know but updates aren't downloading on 8 anymore, all I'm getting is eternal "checking for updates" msgs plus my cpu is at 25% with win update services running. Computer here is 6 years old with an intel sandybridge 2120 3.30 ghz, don't think that's on the blacklist. Will try WSUS. LD April 28, 2017 at 2:40 pm # So Microsoft has a list of processors that are designated W10 only and there are mistakes in that list. I find it strange that software engineers who handle highly technical software maintenance can not properly create a mere list. This is not a complex task. As the list was incorporated in the April monthly rollups and security-only update bundles for W7/8, hopefully the mistakes will be addressed in the May updates - both bundles and not just the non-security side. Assuming the users could back out the April updates, they should receive the May updates. Let's see if MS engineers can handle this with some degree of expertise. Their reputations are at stake. Reply Corky April 28, 2017 at 6:23 pm # The problem is how are people who've mistakenly been blocked going to download the fix now they've had Windows update disabled, that's a rhetorical question BTW as i know there's ways around it. :-) Reply pHROZEN gHOST April 28, 2017 at 2:46 pm # I have Windows 10 on my PC by my own choice. But I sympathize with Win 7/8 users. MS's approach is not unique by any means. I liken this to the partnership between gasoline suppliers and automobile manufacturers working to cause people to buy newer vehicles by providing a fuel which is not friendly to the older automobiles. The addition of ethanol to gasoline many years ago was a significant cost savings for gasoline suppliers and it wreaked havoc on some older automobiles. I'm sure they will deny, deny, deny. But, this is not the end of that type of game. MS is purposely putting owners of newer hardware and legally licensed Win 7/8 in danger by not allowing them to have the updates they deserve. They are doing this because Windows 10 has not been as widely accepted as they predicted. Of course they will deny, deny, deny. Reply kalmly April 28, 2017 at 3:00 pm # "Should Microsoft reconsider, or can you understand the company's decision?" Microsoft should reconsider many of the decisions and designs of the last few years. But yes. I understand very well. Microsoft will have you move to Windows 10. They will not accept no for an answer. Laggers will be punished. They wouldn't be having such a hard time getting people there if they gave us something we want, but they don't. Dear Microsoft: I don't want Windows as a service. I don't want ugly. I don't want something I can't customize to my own taste. I don't want you puttering around in my system and changing things. I don't want you uninstalling applications. I don't want you watching everything I do. I don't want a store. I don't want ads. Go back to XP and start over from there, because after Win 7, you went berserk. I will gladly give you $200 for a customizable, customer-centric OS. Hey! Are you listening? Are you? Anyone out there? No. Of course not. Reply Clairvaux April 28, 2017 at 3:08 pm # Clearly, quality control has gone out of the window at Microsoft. And I'm not even trying to be funny. Being callous towards faithful customers + botching the job in a way that would have been unimaginable a few years ago = market failure of epic proportions coming up, even if possibly in slow motion. Reply P April 28, 2017 at 3:56 pm # I think m$ should go back to the old and FRIENDLY policy of enticing customers into their OS with features, options and services rather than the new HOSTILE approach of dictating to people how, when and in what way they are allowed to use their OS, like linux.

Reply Helena April 28, 2017 at 4:58 pm # Corporations want to dictate and not to cooperate. The problem with companies like MS is that they know people have to use their products and that there may be very little alternatives for the disgruntled consumer. The only solution is changing the system which may be impossible for the majority of users for various reasons. Seems Microsoftonians, as unpleasant as it may be, will be able to play their games for quite a while. But...., as much as I realize, nothing lasts for ever. Still a grim outlook for other surprises to come from this perfidious institution. Reply kevin April 28, 2017 at 5:20 pm # This story makes me so happy that I use an OS whose developers don't fight me and/or try to force an unwanted agenda upon me. (hello GWX!) I feel sorry for the innocent users who are being denied critical security updates because of Microsoft's pigheadedness, but I must simultaneously laugh at Microsoft's incompetence for blocking people who weren't supposed to be blocked! (Besides, no one should be blocked) And maybe, if one of these consumers who are being denied updates suffers a breach, they can sue Microsoft. That would be awesome! Reply Jack April 28, 2017 at 5:51 pm # Thank you Martin for bringing this to everyones attention. But personally I think it is being forced onto us for all areas of technology. Look at mobiles, I understand that as far as Android is concerned, only the latest two OS are still supported, yet shops like Amazon still sell unsupported OS phones, I heard recently that a feature on IOS is not supported on anything older than iPhone 5. Going back to the Windows OS, so many times when I have learned of changes I don't agree with, my immediate reaction is to go to Linux. There was the issue of automatic downloads, even forced on those with a capped internet service, Windows didn't seem to care about this, the public outcry got it changed, but now they have changed their minds again, and redstone 3 later in the year is going to be forced on everyone. I am still thinking about jumping onto Linux, as I only use my PC for internet stuff like RSS feeds from the excellent gHacks. Don't get me wrong I am all for having the latest updates, but when the consumer is not given any consideration I think it is totally wrong. I understand the S9 is already been rumoured about when the S8 is just coming out. The businesses need to consider their consumers; if someone has used their hardware for x years, they should get discounts from the hardware makers to encourage them to go for the latest hardware. NB: Idea 2 the global players get together and say you have the business market you have the mobile you have the personal PC market. What do we think ?

Reply Tim April 29, 2017 at 4:40 am # At the risk of fully exposing my Luddite status, I find I am quite happy with my Windows XP system running on my antique Intel E8400 dual core. I have avoided the update hassle since Ms decided to bury this operating system and I have never received any unwanted code from MS. Unlike later versions of Windows, I can block internet access of svchost.exe at the firewall level which does cut back on the ability of the system to phone home without my knowledge. My unsupported and dangerous system has had no viral infections nor any ransomware or trojans since the end of updates. Internet explorer is still at the original version 6 and has no ability to escape the local subnet. I have a faster quad core machine as well, ready to go as a fully operational backup system, but I find the E8400 is adequate for everything except par file checks on some of the larger usenet binaries,. I read what MS is doing to the current user base with a mixture of bemusement and horror and I am really grateful that I never bothered to obtain a newer system. When this setup becomes completely obsolete, I will consider the upgrade to Windows 11 or 12 because i think 10 will turn out to be a colossal flop and MS will go into full panic mode once the desktop monopoly starts to slip badly. And of course I could be all wrong on my predictions, but that won't worry me too much. Reply AnorKnee Merce April 29, 2017 at 6:46 am # @ Tim M$'s Windows has a market-monopoly of about 80%-90% since the 2000s. Most corporations/businesses have already been locked into the Windows ecosystem and their purchase or lease of Windows Enterprise Volume Licenses are the Big money-earners for M$, not consumers. IOW, M$ will not be going into panic mode because the desktop monopoly won't start to slip badly. ....... Come 2020/2023, most corporations/businesses will have little choice but to upgrade/transition to Win 10 Ent from Win 7/8.1 Ent. So, very likely, there will be no Win 11 or 12. If you wanna avoid Win 10, the likely options left for you will be ....... #1. Buy a Win 8.1 license for use until EOL/2023 or after. #2. Buy a new MacOS computer. #3. Install Linux. . P S - Google and Facebook have to hire many Linux experts to run their huge Linux-based Data-servers/centers and websites. IOW, for a corporation/business to leave the Windows ecosystem, they have to hire at least a few Linux experts. Most SMB cannot afford to do that. ....... Linux is like a DIY desktop OS.

Yes, it is. But the fact that these two gigantic technology roadmaps are converging and colliding isn’t just a coincidence. 5G is helping automotive industry in dealing with the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) conundrum that has long been shadowing the connected car promise: Who will pay for the roadside infrastructure? Automotive industry or governments? Now connected cars can utilize the 5G signals to scope out road and weather conditions and draw up more accurate maps. And for the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication part, 5G frees up the automotive industry from the obligation of developing a specialized infrastructure based on the dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology. [Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications — serving as the foundation of the connected car movement — is also becoming a key enabling technology for the autonomous vehicles. Image courtesy of Qualcomm] The next frontier after getting cars fully connected is automated driving, a.k.a. autonomous cars. According to Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, an autonomous car can generate as much as four terabytes of data in a day, so a robust and pervasive communications infrastructure is imperative in moving more data at higher speeds and lower latency with utmost reliability. The 5G network will help vehicles keep tabs on cars, cyclists, and pedestrians in the vicinity while serving as glue between the key building blocks of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and self-driving cars. In other words, it will facilitate split-second connectivity for cameras, radars, and other in-vehicle sensors providing the 360-degree view. Then, there are machine learning tasks for image and speech recognition that require faster and ultra-reliable data links along with greater compute power and data synthesization capabilities. The autonomous car brings forth massive data challenges, so 5G is most likely going to become part of the automated driving ecosystem by facilitating large chunks of data via roadside communication infrastructure. There isn’t much automotive connectivity in play right now, and many industry observers attribute this to the lack of automotive friendly features in the 4G LTE networks. The 5G systems claim to offer five times lower latencies than predecessor 4G networks while enabling the more intelligent use of the radio spectrum through software-defined networks (SDN), network slicing, and virtualization techniques. The creation of the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) is clearly a harbinger of the convergence between mobility and connected automated driving. The multi-industry body is carrying out cross-sector collaboration to facilitate road safety and intelligent transportation for autonomous cars.

By Chad Day and Stephen Braun / Associated Press WASHINGTON — Investigations intensified into President Donald Trump’s ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn, on Thursday as the Pentagon watchdog joined lawmakers in probing payments he accepted from foreign sources including a Russian state-sponsored TV network. At the same time, documents released by the top Democrat on a House oversight committee showed Mr. Flynn was warned by authorities after he retired from the military in 2014 not to take foreign government-sourced money without “advance approval” from the Pentagon. Mr. Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general and Defense Intelligence Agency chief, later accepted tens of thousands of dollars for his work on behalf of foreign interests, including RT, the state-supported Russian television network, and a Turkish-owned company linked to Turkey’s government. The Pentagon’s acting inspector general’s office confirmed Thursday he has launched an inquiry into whether those payments qualify as coming from foreign governments and whether Mr. Flynn properly informed military authorities about them. The White House defended its hiring of Mr. Flynn and attempted to shift blame for any problems with his vetting onto the Obama administration, which handled the reissuance of his security clearance in January 2016. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who released the documents, said during a news conference that Mr. Flynn had been clearly informed he needed to get permission to receive foreign payments and there’s no evidence he did so. “The Pentagon’s warning to Gen. Flynn was bold, italicized and could not have been clearer,” Mr. Cummings said. In a key 2014 document, Mr. Flynn was told by a Defense Intelligence Agency official that the U.S. Constitution’s emoluments provision prohibits any monetary payments or gifts “from a foreign government unless congressional consent is first obtained.” The Oct. 8, 2014, letter — which was sent to Mr. Flynn at his request — explained that such “advance approval” would need to come “from the relevant service secretary.” Earlier this week, Mr. Cummings and Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House committee, said that they had found no evidence Mr. Flynn asked the Army for permission to receive foreign payments or informed the military he had accepted them. Army spokeswoman Cynthia O. Smith said the Army had no records that Mr. Flynn requested that permission. One episode in question involves a trip he took to Moscow in 2015 for RT’s anniversary celebration. He was paid at least $33,750 to attend the gala at which he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Gen. Flynn’s attorney says he discussed his trip to Moscow with DIA, but we have no evidence, not a shred, that he disclosed his payments,” Mr. Cummings said Thursday. In a statement, Mr. Flynn’s attorney Robert Kelner said the Defense Department “was fully aware of the trip,” citing his previous statements that his client briefed DIA officials before and after the RT trip. Mr. Kelner also pointed to a letter, released in redacted form by Mr. Cummings, that notes that Mr. Flynn provided a thumb drive to the agency containing documents detailing the RT event, including that Leading Authorities, a speakers bureau that handled Mr. Flynn’s paid speeches, was handling the event for him. Mr. Kelner’s statement did not address other payments Mr. Flynn received from foreign sources. Mr. Flynn has previously disclosed he got between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his personal stake in $530,000 that his company, Flynn Intel Group, received for consulting work last year for a Turkish businessman. Last month Mr. Flynn’s firm filed as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for its consulting work and acknowledged the work may have benefited the government of Turkey. Mr. Flynn’s client, Inovo BV, is owned by a businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey’s finance ministry. In comments to the AP, Utah Republican Mr. Chaffetz, chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said that Mr. Flynn “had an obligation to seek approval to take money from a foreign government. We found no evidence that he did that.” Mr. Chaffetz’s office released a letter he sent on Thursday to the Army, asking the service’s acting secretary to make a final determination as to whether Mr. Flynn violated federal law by accepting the payments, and if so, to start the process of recovering that money. Mr. Chaffetz also asked the Army to say why it hasn’t yet made a determination as to the legality of Mr. Flynn’s payments from RT given that they have been widely reported for at least two years. He also wants the Army to disclose any other investigations it’s launched since 2010 into similar legal violations. The committee’s inquiry is one of several congressional investigations into Mr. Flynn’s contacts with foreign officials. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Flynn in February for failing to inform senior administration officials about his contacts with Russian officials — contacts that are being examined as part of the wider inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Thursday, 18 House Democrats on the oversight committee signed a letter calling on Mr. Chaffetz to do more to pressure the White House to release documents regarding Mr. Flynn. “There is obviously a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow,” the Democrats wrote in the letter. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer rebuffed criticism from Mr. Cummings that the White House was covering up. Asked about Trump administration vetting, Mr. Spicer appeared to shift blame onto the Obama administration, which had fired Mr. Flynn as head of the DIA. “Why would you re-run a background check on someone who is the head of the Department of Defense Intelligence Agency that had and did maintain a high-level security clearance?” Mr. Spicer asked. He noted that Mr. Flynn’s security clearance was renewed during the Obama administration “with all of the information that’s being discussed that occurred in 2015.” The White House recently told the committee that documents the lawmakers sought would not be turned over because they contained classified information or were not relevant to the committee’s investigation. Senate confirms Acosta The Senate on Thursday confirmed Alex Acosta as Labor secretary, filling out Mr. Trump’s Cabinet. The 60-38 vote confirms Mr. Acosta — the only Latino to join Mr. Trump’s Cabinet — to the post. Once sworn as the nation’s 27th Labor secretary, the son of Cuban immigrants will lead a sprawling agency that enforces more than 180 federal laws covering about 10 million employers and 125 million workers. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., spoke for many Republicans with a statement issued just after the vote saying he hopes Mr. Acosta’s focus will be “promoting labor policies that are free of unnecessarily burdensome federal regulations.” Mr. Scott said he wants Acosta to permanently revoke rules governing financial advisers and adding Americans eligible for overtime pay. Democrats said any Labor secretary should advocate for the American workers to whom Mr. Trump promised so much during his upstart presidential campaign. They said Mr. Acosta has given no such commitment. Labor secretary is the last Cabinet post for Mr. Trump to fill. Mr. Trump’s choice for U.S. trade representative, a job considered Cabinet-level, is awaiting a Senate vote. Tax overhaul push A senior administration official speaking anonymously said Thursday the White House plans to push its tax overhaul without any support from congressional Democrats. Meanwhile, asked on “Good Morning America” on Thursday whether everyone in the middle class would see their taxes reduced, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin admitted that it’s possible they won’t. New office at VA Mr. Trump on Thursday created an office at the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve accountability and protect whistle-blowers, calling it a “bold step forward.” March for climate Thousands of environmentalists will once again rally in the nation’s capital this weekend, this time for the People’s Climate March. Coal pollution case The Trump administration has successfully delayed a legal fight over enforcing Obama-era restrictions on pollution from coal-fired power plants.
