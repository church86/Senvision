These new cores, codenamed Kittson, will be the last Itanium processors Intel manufacturers. Kittson is the first update to Poulson, which debuted a new Itanium architecture back in 2012, but it includes no additional features or capabilities — just higher clock speeds in some cases. We’ve aligned the chart from Intel’s CPU database (available at ark.intel.com) to show the upgrades to the higher-end eight-core CPUs, and this is it for the CPU The Register once nicknamed “Itanic.” The highest-end eight-core Itanium CPU gets a 133MHz speed bump, while the lower-end eight-core doesn’t even get that — the 9740 is literally the same chip as the 9540, with the exact same clock speed. The quad-core models (not shown above) all pick up an additional 133MHz of clock speed, but nothing else. It’s a bit of a sad end to what was once billed as Intel’s most exciting, forward-looking design. Back in the late 1990s, Itanium was pitched as a joint project between HP and Intel, one that would produce a true successor to the various RISC architectures that were still in-market at that time. Intel and HP both spent huge amounts of money and burned an enormous amount of development time trying to bring a new type of microprocessor to market, only to see Itanium crash and burn while x86 boomed. So what went wrong with Itanium? A brief history Itanium uses a computing model called EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing), which grew out of VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word). One of its primary goals was to move the work of deciding what workloads to execute from the CPU back to the compiler. To understand why this was considered desirable, it helps to understand a bit of CPU history. In the 1970s and early 1980s, most CPUs were CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) designs. These designs ran at relatively low clock speed, but could perform highly complex operations in a single clock cycle. At the time, this made sense, since the cost of memory actually dominated the total cost of a computer and was extremely slow. The less memory your code required and the fewer memory accesses it depended on, the faster it could execute. Beginning in the 1980s, a new type of architecture, RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) began to become popular. RISC architecture reduced CPU design complexity, instituted simpler instruction sets and CPU designs, but clocked those designs at higher frequencies. Both MIPS and SPARC have their origins in early RISC research, for example, and all modern higher-end x86 chips decode x86 operations into RISC-style micro-ops for execution. Debates over whether RISC or CISC were ‘better’ somewhat misses the point; CISC made very good sense at one point in history, and RISC-like designs made good sense at another. This graph of expected Itanium sales shows part of why the chip was such a disaster — it was hyped as an overwhelming Next Big Thing and completely failed to take a leadership position. Image by Wikipedia EPIC isn’t directly related to RISC, but the engineers at HP and Intel were hoping EPIC would be a huge leap above the x86 designs of the early and mid-1990s in the same way that RISC designs had proven themselves superior to the CISC architectures of the 1970s. The goal for EPIC was to push instruction scheduling, branch prediction, and parallelism extraction on to the compiler. In theory, this would free up die space for additional execution units, which could then be used to execute parallel workloads even more quickly. Instead of using hardware blocks on the CPU to organize workloads for out-of-order optimal execution, the compiler would handle that task. All the CPU has to do is execute the code it gets handed in the order and manner it was told to execute it. The only problem was, it didn’t work well in practice. Memory accesses from cache and DRAM are non-deterministic, which meant the compiler can’t predict how long they will take — and if the compiler can’t predict how long they’ll take, it’s going to have a hard time scheduling workloads to fill the gap. Itanium was designed to present a huge array of execution resources that the compiler would intelligently fill, but if the compiler can’t keep them filled, it’s just wasted die space. Itanium was designed to extract and exploit instruction-level parallelism, but compilers of the time struggled to find enough ILP in most workloads to justify the expense and difficulty of running code on the platform. And EPIC was so radically different from any other architecture, there was no way to cleanly port an application. These days, we talk a lot about differences between x86 and ARM processors, but x86 and ARM are practically blood relatives to one another compared with EPIC and x86. Of course, technical reasons aren’t the only reason why Itanium failed. The chips were expensive, difficult to manufacture, and years behind schedule. Intel made a high-profile declaration that Itanium was the future of computing and represented its only 64-bit platform. Then AMD announced its own AMD64 instruction set, which extended 64-bit computing to the x86 architecture. Intel didn’t change course immediately, but it eventually cross-licensed AMD64. This was a tacit admission that Itanium would never come to the desktop. Then, a few years ago, a high-profile court case between Oracle and HP put a nail in Itanium’s coffin. Today’s chips are the very definition of a contract fulfillment, with no improvements, cache tweaks, or other architectural boosts. Most, I suspect, will shed no tears for Itanium, particularly given its impact on the development of other, more promising architectures like PA-RISC and Alpha. But its failure is also a testament to how some of the ‘facts’ that get passed around CPU industry aren’t as simple as we might think. x86 is often discussed in disparaging terms as an outdated and ancient architecture, as if no one had the guts to take it outside and shoot it. But in reality, Intel made multiple attempts to do just that, from the iAPX 432 (begun in 1975) to the i860 and i960, to Itanium itself. And despite an emphasis on parallelism that sounds superficially promising, given the difficulty modern programmers have had with scaling applications to use multiple threads in an effective manner, Itanium represented another dead-end branch of research that never managed to deliver the real-world performance it promised on paper.

AVM Technologies, which holds US patent 5,859,547, first sued Intel back in 2010 claiming that the Intel Pentium 4 and Core 2 designs infringed its intellectual property – but it was dismissed for insufficient evidence. In January 2015, AVM refiled [PDF], claiming that Intel was continuing to infringe the patent in its Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge and Haswell designs. Earlier this month, a six-day jury trial considered the years of arguments and hundreds of submissions and ultimately reached the same conclusion as the earlier case: there was insufficient evidence. The co-inventor of the patent, Joseph Tran, is president of AVM. His earlier company, Translogic, had licensed a number of its patents to Intel, but not the '547 patent. When, in 2006, he came across an article that described technology very similar to his patent, he contacted Intel and had a number of licensing discussions with executives. In the end, the chip giant refused to license it because it said Tran was not able to show which Intel product specifically infringed the patent. Tran claims he did not have the money to afford the "extremely expensive infringement analyses demanded by Intel." Things were looking good for AVM and Tran just two months ago, when the judge refused Intel's motion to dismiss the entire case for being overly broad: that broadness being a key component in the massive $2bn estimate for damages if found guilty. The jury dismissed Intel no fewer than eight times when it tried to kill the case piece by piece. But in the end, it went the other way and after the six-day trial (the transcripts won't be available until August) the jury found [PDF] that Intel had not infringed AVM's patent. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment MORE Intel Patent Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Intel touts bug bounties to hardware hackers Website and Intel Security (McAfee) products excluded from 'Wild West' payouts scheme 2 Comments Intel reveals Optane will need a 7th-gen core and a PC-centric launch You're going to need a whole lot of Intel Inside to make this work 16 Comments Intel's data center boss Diane Bryant logs off Server silicon head unplugs after 30+ years at Chipzilla 3 Comments Intel loses its Lustre – Chipzilla bins own-brand HPC file system Between killing an OpenStack research team and killing IDF, we see a pattern here 15 Comments OpenStack: Pleeeeease stop panicking, Intel and Rackspace still love us Also, er, yeah, Chipzilla pulled the plug on that big project 6 Comments Regular or premium?

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Cheap gaming chips from AMD Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s cheaper Ryzen 5 CPUs By Jeremy Laird on May 11th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Serving up eight pukka CPU cores at a price mere mortals can afford was easily the most compelling part of the initial AMD Ryzen proposition. But there’s been some filling out of the Ryzen range since last we alighted the subject. Specifically, a load of quad-core and six-core models have hit retail. They’re significantly cheaper than the beefy eight-core beasts. Might they actually make more sense for gaming than those slightly flawed eight-core chips? It’s little more than journalistic OCD and of absolutely no consequence to the end-user experience. But it very slightly winds me up that AMD, like Intel, spurns logic with its CPU nomenclature. AMD has announced that Ryzen will come in three flavours for the foreseeable. Ryzen 7 is the performance king, Ryzen 5 balances price and performance and Ryzen majors on value. There are also – again for the foreseeable – three different basic configurations for Ryzen. Eight-core, six-core and quad-core. You might think they map neatly and logically to Ryzen 7, 5 and 3. But no, that would make too much sense. Ryzen 5 includes both six and quad-core models. Ryzen 3 has yet to be detailed. Anyway, the first thing to note about the latest quad and six-cores models is that some make a lot more sense in value terms than others. There’s about a £60 gap between the priciest six-core Ryzen, the £260 Ryzen 5 1600X, and the cheapest eight-core chip, the Ryzen 7 1700, for instance. Add about 5% to those numbers (and all the prices that follow, for that matter) for US $ prices. Given that you’re certainly going to also need a new motherboard and very likely some sticks of memory, too, the 1700 is the no brainer in that comparison. After all, you’re looking at perhaps £150 minimum for a decent X370 motherboard plus maybe £75 for 8GB of memory and perhaps a few more quid for sundry items like a new cooler. Factor in the motherboard, RAM and more and the cost of upgrading to Ryzen certainly adds up The plain old Ryzen 5 1600 non-X surely makes more sense at £219 given that it’s also six cores and likewise unlocked for easy overclocking, if you care about that sort of thing. It’s fully a £100 jump to the cheapest eight-core model from the Ryzen 5 1600. A similar logic applies to the quad-core models. The Ryzen 5 1500X clocks in at £179, which looks likes poor value when you can have 50% more cores for just £40 extra. To be honest, even the £159 Ryzen 5 1400 quad-core chip looks like marginal value when you factor in the overall costs of upgrading to Ryzen. Predictably, I’ve had a go with the two most difficult to justify models in the Ryzen 5 range, the 1600X and the 1500X. The former is clocked at 3.7GHz base and 4GHz Turbo, the latter at 3.5Ghz base and 3.7GHz Turbo. Both are a little quicker than their core-count-parity but cheaper siblings, the 1600 and 1400. But the point is that they’re broadly representative of the gaming experience you can expect from the six and quad-core breeds. Gaming joy in a small box? As it happens, when Ryzen was originally announced it seemed like the six core models could be the bang-for-buck sweet spot. Relatively affordable, reasonably high clocks for single threaded performance, plenty of cores and threads for multi-threading. Remember, every Ryzen can process two software threads in parallel per core. That’s pretty much how it pans out in practice. The 1600X makes similarly priced Intel processors look very, very silly in any software that’s multi-threaded, like video encoding. The catch, as it has been from the get go with Ryzen, is that the gaming performance is ever so slightly patchy. All Ryzen CPUs use the full eight-core processor die and disable cores in the two quad-core modules within the chip in symmetrical pairs. So, the configurations are therefore 4:4, 3:3, and 2:2 The benchmark numbers mostly look solid. But there’s no getting away from the fact that some games run tangibly less smooth on Ryzen than Intel CPUs. I had a good hard look, for instance, at Total War: Attila and every Ryzen chip I’ve dabbled with exhibits some stutter from which Intel processors simply don’t suffer. I even sense checked what I was seeing with passing colleagues. It’s unmistakable. And you simply wouldn’t spot it in the relatively small gap in average frame rate. It’s not a total deal breaker and most games run without such hitches. But for me, it slightly undermines Ryzen’s appeal for a dedicated gaming rig. As it happens, the quad-core Ryzen chip is no worse and indeed knocks out similar frame rates to the six-core model in most games. So, of all the existing Ryzen processors, it’s perhaps the quad-core 1400 that’s most compelling. It’s cheapest and you lose little in games. For the same price from Intel you’re looking at the quad-core, quad-thread Core i5-7400, which rocks in at 3GHz base and 3.5GHz Turbo but no scope for significant overclocking. Overall, the choice between the Core i5-7400 and Ryzen 5 1400 is awfully tough. But if the decision is being driven primarily by gaming concerns, then with a somewhat heavy heart I still lean Intel. As things stand, I think you’re probably guaranteed a great gaming experience even with that relatively lowly Intel Core i5 processor. To be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good. But just occasionally it will frustrate. The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment. I’m pretty sure every time a game felt a bit juddery I’d be wondering if the Ryzen CPU was to blame, even when the bottleneck was likely elsewhere. It’s a similar psychology that has always put me off multi-card graphics – that constant, niggling doubt whether it’s working properly. There’s not a lot in it, let’s be clear about that. But Intel retains its status as the go-to CPU option for gamers for now.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 00:19 GurtTractor says: From my experience of using my 1700x so far I can say that Total War Atilla is a bit of an outlier in terms of performance on these new CPUs. Empire Total War for example runs superbly, load is spread well across all threads, allowing me to run maximum size battles with no discernable slowdown. Total Warhammer has pretty consistent performance generally, though still can lag a bit in very large battles (maybe just because it is a bit more modern, though I get the impression that optimisation could be better). Atilla by comparison seems to run terribly, clearly lacking optimisation for high core count CPUs and/or the Ryzen architecture. Every other game that I have tried has seemed pretty solid on this CPU (Actually ARMA 3 is somewhat poorly optimised too). IMO the only two Intel chips that are worth buying at the moment are the low end Pentium G4560 which nearly matches the i3 chips at a much lower price, no competition from AMD for this one yet (Ryzen 3 should be soon), and the other chip that might be worthwhile is the i7 7700k which seems like the best chip if you really need that single core performance for high refresh gaming or productivity tasks that eat up clockspeed (I think some Photoshop stuff is mainly single core). Every other Intel CPU just seem seems like terrible value compared with the kind of general performance/price of the Ryzen chips. Like the 7600k vs the 1600 for example, 4 threads vs 12!! No 5Ghz overclock can really make up for that. Regarding the i5 7400 vs the 1400; you’re probably not going to be wanting to push the highest framerates with either CPU, but the eight threads of the 1400 vs the 4 of the 7400 should mean more consistent performance with most modern titles. Even if it is just for gaming I would definitely still go for the 1400 if that was my budget, here’s video comparing the two (not the most extensive of tests but I think it’s pretty fair) – link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 06:45 SquarePeg says: Thanks for the link at the bottom of your post. That was a very solid comparison between the Ryzen 1400 and the i5 7400. Seeing how so many games only make use of four threads I’m very interested to see how the Ryzen 3’s perform. A quick check on pcpartpicker shows the R5 1400 as low as $159.99 here in the US. So I’m wondering how low AMD will go with say the R3 1100. $99 to $119 at launch seems to be a reasonable expectation. If the Ryzen 1100 can easily overclock to 3800mhz+ it would be an fantastic value. Also, given that a socket AM4 system will be upgradeable for several more generations of Ryzen CPU’s it makes the Intel i5 7400 a hard sell. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Photo: Jim Gensheimer /Bay Area News Group No strongman can help you own your future 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Political analysts will long debate over where Brexit, Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen came from. Many say income gaps. I’d say ... not quite. I’d say “income anxiety” and the stress over what it now takes to secure and hold a good job. I believe the accelerations set loose by Silicon Valley in technology and digital globalization have created a world where every decent job demands more skill and, now, lifelong learning. More people can’t keep up, and clearly some have reached for leaders who promise to stop the wind. Let me elaborate through a few conversations, starting with Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, who recently remarked to me: “I believe my grandchildren will not drive.” Since he has teenage daughters, that means self-driving vehicles should be fully deployed in 25 years, at which time you won’t “steer” your car but will program it on a smartphone or watch or glasses. Sounds like fun — unless you’re one of the millions who drive a truck or cab for a living. But don’t think you’re safe as an accountant, either. Mark Bohr, Intel’s senior fellow for technology, explained to me that Intel’s main workhorse microprocessor today is the 14-nanometer chip it introduced in 2014. It packs 37.5 million transistors per square millimeter. By the end of 2017, thanks to Moore’s Law, Intel will begin producing a 10-nanometer chip that will pack “100 million transistors per square millimeter — more than double the previous density with less heat and power usage,” said Bohr. If you think machines are smart today, wait a year. It’s this move from 14-nm to 10-nm chips that will help enable automakers to shrink the brain of a self-driving car — a brain that has to take in sensor data from 360 degrees and instantly process whether it’s a dog, a human, a biker or another car — from something that fills a whole trunk to a small box under the front seat, so these cars can scale. When you get that much processing power putting out that much data exhaust with ever-improving software, you create a world where we can analyze, prophesize and optimize with a precision unknown in human history. We can see trends we never saw, predict when engine parts will break and replace them before they do, with great savings, and we can optimize everything — from the most energy-saving flight path for an airplane to the ideal drilling path for a natural gas well. I recently visited the control room at Devon Energy, a large oil and gas producer in Oklahoma City. It’s half a floor of computer screens displaying data coming out of every well Devon is drilling around the world. At the bottom of each screen are two boxes that blew my mind. One box displays how much money was budgeted to drill that particular well per foot, and the other box displays — in real time — how much the drilling of that well is actually costing as it bores through different rocks, and it’s updated every foot. A typical well might involve sending pipe 2 miles down and then turning horizontally for 2 miles east or west — with such precision it can hit a seam of gas as small as 20 feet wide. If you’re working on a Devon oil rig today, you’re holding a computer, not just an oily wrench. And if you’re getting a degree in auto mechanics at a community college today, it’s not to be a “grease monkey.” It’s to be a repairman for a computer with wheels. The notion that we can go to college for four years and then spend that knowledge for the next 30 is over. If you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, you have to be a lifelong learner. And that means: More is now on you. And that means self-motivation to learn and keep learning becomes the most important life skill. That’s why education-to-work expert Heather E. McGowan likes to say: “Stop asking a young person what you want to be when you grow up. It freezes their identity into a job that may not be there. Ask them how you want to be when you grow up. Having an agile learning mindset will be the new skill set of the 21st century.” Some are up for that, some not; and many want to but don’t know how, which is why the College Board has reshaped the PSAT and SAT exams to encourage lifelong learning. “Practice advances all students without respect to high school GPA, gender, race and ethnicity or parental education. And it’s free,” College Board President David Coleman told me. “Our aim is to transform the SAT into an invitation for students to own their future.” So the tough news is that more will be on you. The good news is that systems are emerging everywhere to enable anyone to accelerate learning for the age of acceleration. Step back from all of this and it’s clear that thriving countries today won’t elect a strongman. They’ll elect leaders who inspire and equip their citizens to be strong people who can own their own futures. Thomas Friedman writes a column for the New York Times.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Cheap gaming chips from AMD Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s cheaper Ryzen 5 CPUs By Jeremy Laird on May 11th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Serving up eight pukka CPU cores at a price mere mortals can afford was easily the most compelling part of the initial AMD Ryzen proposition. But there’s been some filling out of the Ryzen range since last we alighted the subject. Specifically, a load of quad-core and six-core models have hit retail. They’re significantly cheaper than the beefy eight-core beasts. Might they actually make more sense for gaming than those slightly flawed eight-core chips? It’s little more than journalistic OCD and of absolutely no consequence to the end-user experience. But it very slightly winds me up that AMD, like Intel, spurns logic with its CPU nomenclature. AMD has announced that Ryzen will come in three flavours for the foreseeable. Ryzen 7 is the performance king, Ryzen 5 balances price and performance and Ryzen majors on value. There are also – again for the foreseeable – three different basic configurations for Ryzen. Eight-core, six-core and quad-core. You might think they map neatly and logically to Ryzen 7, 5 and 3. But no, that would make too much sense. Ryzen 5 includes both six and quad-core models. Ryzen 3 has yet to be detailed. Anyway, the first thing to note about the latest quad and six-cores models is that some make a lot more sense in value terms than others. There’s about a £60 gap between the priciest six-core Ryzen, the £260 Ryzen 5 1600X, and the cheapest eight-core chip, the Ryzen 7 1700, for instance. Add about 5% to those numbers (and all the prices that follow, for that matter) for US $ prices. Given that you’re certainly going to also need a new motherboard and very likely some sticks of memory, too, the 1700 is the no brainer in that comparison. After all, you’re looking at perhaps £150 minimum for a decent X370 motherboard plus maybe £75 for 8GB of memory and perhaps a few more quid for sundry items like a new cooler. Factor in the motherboard, RAM and more and the cost of upgrading to Ryzen certainly adds up The plain old Ryzen 5 1600 non-X surely makes more sense at £219 given that it’s also six cores and likewise unlocked for easy overclocking, if you care about that sort of thing. It’s fully a £100 jump to the cheapest eight-core model from the Ryzen 5 1600. A similar logic applies to the quad-core models. The Ryzen 5 1500X clocks in at £179, which looks likes poor value when you can have 50% more cores for just £40 extra. To be honest, even the £159 Ryzen 5 1400 quad-core chip looks like marginal value when you factor in the overall costs of upgrading to Ryzen. Predictably, I’ve had a go with the two most difficult to justify models in the Ryzen 5 range, the 1600X and the 1500X. The former is clocked at 3.7GHz base and 4GHz Turbo, the latter at 3.5Ghz base and 3.7GHz Turbo. Both are a little quicker than their core-count-parity but cheaper siblings, the 1600 and 1400. But the point is that they’re broadly representative of the gaming experience you can expect from the six and quad-core breeds. Gaming joy in a small box? As it happens, when Ryzen was originally announced it seemed like the six core models could be the bang-for-buck sweet spot. Relatively affordable, reasonably high clocks for single threaded performance, plenty of cores and threads for multi-threading. Remember, every Ryzen can process two software threads in parallel per core. That’s pretty much how it pans out in practice. The 1600X makes similarly priced Intel processors look very, very silly in any software that’s multi-threaded, like video encoding. The catch, as it has been from the get go with Ryzen, is that the gaming performance is ever so slightly patchy. All Ryzen CPUs use the full eight-core processor die and disable cores in the two quad-core modules within the chip in symmetrical pairs. So, the configurations are therefore 4:4, 3:3, and 2:2 The benchmark numbers mostly look solid. But there’s no getting away from the fact that some games run tangibly less smooth on Ryzen than Intel CPUs. I had a good hard look, for instance, at Total War: Attila and every Ryzen chip I’ve dabbled with exhibits some stutter from which Intel processors simply don’t suffer. I even sense checked what I was seeing with passing colleagues. It’s unmistakable. And you simply wouldn’t spot it in the relatively small gap in average frame rate. It’s not a total deal breaker and most games run without such hitches. But for me, it slightly undermines Ryzen’s appeal for a dedicated gaming rig. As it happens, the quad-core Ryzen chip is no worse and indeed knocks out similar frame rates to the six-core model in most games. So, of all the existing Ryzen processors, it’s perhaps the quad-core 1400 that’s most compelling. It’s cheapest and you lose little in games. For the same price from Intel you’re looking at the quad-core, quad-thread Core i5-7400, which rocks in at 3GHz base and 3.5GHz Turbo but no scope for significant overclocking. Overall, the choice between the Core i5-7400 and Ryzen 5 1400 is awfully tough. But if the decision is being driven primarily by gaming concerns, then with a somewhat heavy heart I still lean Intel. As things stand, I think you’re probably guaranteed a great gaming experience even with that relatively lowly Intel Core i5 processor. To be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good. But just occasionally it will frustrate. The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment. I’m pretty sure every time a game felt a bit juddery I’d be wondering if the Ryzen CPU was to blame, even when the bottleneck was likely elsewhere. It’s a similar psychology that has always put me off multi-card graphics – that constant, niggling doubt whether it’s working properly. There’s not a lot in it, let’s be clear about that. But Intel retains its status as the go-to CPU option for gamers for now.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 00:19 GurtTractor says: From my experience of using my 1700x so far I can say that Total War Atilla is a bit of an outlier in terms of performance on these new CPUs. Empire Total War for example runs superbly, load is spread well across all threads, allowing me to run maximum size battles with no discernable slowdown. Total Warhammer has pretty consistent performance generally, though still can lag a bit in very large battles (maybe just because it is a bit more modern, though I get the impression that optimisation could be better). Atilla by comparison seems to run terribly, clearly lacking optimisation for high core count CPUs and/or the Ryzen architecture. Every other game that I have tried has seemed pretty solid on this CPU (Actually ARMA 3 is somewhat poorly optimised too). IMO the only two Intel chips that are worth buying at the moment are the low end Pentium G4560 which nearly matches the i3 chips at a much lower price, no competition from AMD for this one yet (Ryzen 3 should be soon), and the other chip that might be worthwhile is the i7 7700k which seems like the best chip if you really need that single core performance for high refresh gaming or productivity tasks that eat up clockspeed (I think some Photoshop stuff is mainly single core). Every other Intel CPU just seem seems like terrible value compared with the kind of general performance/price of the Ryzen chips. Like the 7600k vs the 1600 for example, 4 threads vs 12!! No 5Ghz overclock can really make up for that. Regarding the i5 7400 vs the 1400; you’re probably not going to be wanting to push the highest framerates with either CPU, but the eight threads of the 1400 vs the 4 of the 7400 should mean more consistent performance with most modern titles. Even if it is just for gaming I would definitely still go for the 1400 if that was my budget, here’s video comparing the two (not the most extensive of tests but I think it’s pretty fair) – link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 06:45 SquarePeg says: Thanks for the link at the bottom of your post. That was a very solid comparison between the Ryzen 1400 and the i5 7400. Seeing how so many games only make use of four threads I’m very interested to see how the Ryzen 3’s perform. A quick check on pcpartpicker shows the R5 1400 as low as $159.99 here in the US. So I’m wondering how low AMD will go with say the R3 1100. $99 to $119 at launch seems to be a reasonable expectation. If the Ryzen 1100 can easily overclock to 3800mhz+ it would be an fantastic value. Also, given that a socket AM4 system will be upgradeable for several more generations of Ryzen CPU’s it makes the Intel i5 7400 a hard sell. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for interests outside the United States. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that Flynn could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. Continued below.

The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin's firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing, prompted by Justice Department pressure, came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told the AP in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Kelner said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin's contention that Flynn didn't carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn's filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ___ Have a tip about this story?

Photo: Leow Ju-len The race to get autonomous cars on the road will be won by computing power, not horsepower mail print View all comments Tweet By Leow Ju-Len - todaycars@mediacorp.com.sg - Published: 4:00 AM, May 12, 2017 SANTA CLARA (california) — “We call this our comfort cam,” said Eran Sandhaus, vice-president of software and services for Delphi, a major car industry supplier, as he pointed to a small screen inside a self-driving Audi. A similar car had travelled more than 5,000km across America in 2014, with Delphi engineers doing only one per cent of the actual driving. Likewise, as soon as the Audi we were in pulled out from the car park, an engineer hit a button and the car took over, piloting itself along the streets smoothly, interacting with other traffic much the same way any driver would. The car chooses when to switch lanes by itself, signals its turns religiously and, truth be told, accelerates more steadily than most drivers here seem capable of doing. If anything, the remarkable thing about this autonomous car is how unremarkable it feels to sit inside it. Welcome to the future of driving. Or, indeed, not driving. “Autonomous” is the new buzzword when it comes to transport; and with road trials for autonomous cars being conducted — not just in Singapore, but around the world — that future could arrive sooner than you think. The key component of an autonomous car is not the car per se, but what is inside it — and not just under the bonnet of the car, either. The Audi, for example, has 26 sensors and cameras that let it “see” its surroundings, and the comfort cam lets passengers see what the car sees: An outline of the street, other vehicles, traffic lights, and so on. Sandhaus said it calms people down to look at the screen, especially if they are riding in an autonomous car for the first time. “What you see here is exactly what the ‘brain’ of the car sees, one-to-one,” said Sandhaus. This “brain” is powered by Intel, the chip-maker best known for its ubiquitous personal computing processors. The company scrambled to set up an Automated Driving Solutions division in December, after realising the huge potential for autonomous cars. Investment bank Goldman Sachs, for example, estimates that the market for such technology could grow to US$96 billion (S$135 billion) by 2025, and US$290 billion by 2035. While Intel declined to say how many people it has working on the technology, its Automated Driving group was carved out of the larger Internet Of Things team. But rather than striving to manufacture a self-driving car, Intel essentially aims to provide the guts of a system that car companies that use for their own products. More than 100 prototype autonomous cars are already powered by Intel chips, but the company sees the race as a team effort. In March, it bought Mobileye, an Israeli company that specialises in camera systems for self-driving cars. Along with that purchase came Mobileye’s relationship with some two dozen car makers. It would appear that the computing requirements present the real hurdle when it comes to autonomous cars. “We see this as a data challenge,” said Jack Weast, the chief system architect for Intel’s autonomous driving division. On a typical day, an autonomous car will generate four terabytes of data, he said. In contrast, a generous mobile data plan here gives you just six gigabytes a month. Weast said fully autonomous cars will require an “exponential” jump in processing power, compared to cars today that can govern their own speed or stay automatically within their own lane. Another key component is the accompanying infrastructure. “Connectivity is also important,” said Weast. “If you connect to the cloud, you can download high-definition map information, for example.” That would require a 5G connection, along with data centres that have enormous computing power. Once those pieces are in place, connected cars would be able to warn one another about road hazards, and communicate closely to pull off neat tricks such as driving in close formation. That reduces wind resistance, and can cut fuel consumption by 15 per cent. Those will not be the only benefits. Weast foresees an “incredible reduction in injury or loss of life” once autonomous cars are commonplace, because the vast majority of accidents are due to human error. Robo-taxis could also provide more mobility for the young and elderly, and could free up land used by parking infrastructure. “Autonomous vehicles are going to be very, very valuable to society at large,” Weast said. Already, BMW, Intel and Mobileye have announced plans to have a self-driving car for sale by 2021. The three will also put 40 autonomous BMWs on the road later this year; while Delphi said it wants to make its system available to car companies by 2019, at a cost of a few thousand dollars per car. Delphi could also have a driverless taxi service in operation in Singapore within three years, said Glen De Vos, the company’s chief technology officer. The company already has one autonomous Audi on trial in SIngapore, but will add two more cars next month. It is working with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to find out what is needed on the infrastructure side, while gathering data about how best to track a fleet of autonomous cars and optimise their use. “We’re not doing it as a science experiment. We want to work with the LTA to actually launch a commercial service,” said De Vos. After two more years of data gathering and a further two years of trials, Delphi could offer what Grab and Uber do today, but without a human behind the wheel. Asked to give the odds for Singapore becoming the first city in the world to make autonomous taxis a reality, De Vos said they are “fairly high”. “Singapore has a very progressive and thoughtful strategy for municipality planning,” said De Vos. “The government agencies really are thinking long-term.” mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Lifestyle READ COMMENTED “I love having camera phones” “Forgive my honesty, but is there a local fashion or modelling scene in Singapore today?” ’Twas the night before Christmas ’Genderless’ androgynous fashion on Tokyo runway bang on trend ‘X’ marks the sport ‘Smart’ denim promises touchscreen tech clothes Why are so many Muslims suddenly visiting Japan?

Andrew Cunningham - May 11, 2017 7:56 pm UTC Enlarge Intel reader comments 109 Share this story Remember Itanium? Intel's first crack at 64-bit server processors from circa the turn of the millennium? Well, two things: Intel is releasing four new 9700-series Itanium CPUs based on the "Kittson" architecture, and the chips are the last new Itanium processors that the company plans to ship. An Intel spokesperson confirmed to PC World that this was the end of the line for Itanium, which jibes with an agreement under which HP would pay Intel to continue developing Itanium chips through the end of 2017. Absent some kind of extension to that agreement, it's unlikely that anyone else is interested in keeping Itanium alive at this point. IT World reports that Hewlett-Packard Enterprise is the only vendor expected to ship servers that use the new CPUs. Kittson chips offer either four or eight CPU cores manufactured on Intel's circa-2010 32nm process, the same one used for the very first Core i3, i5, and i7 CPUs. All the Kittson chips support Hyperthreading and ECC DDR3. The quad-core chips sport a 130W TDP, while the octo-core versions have 170W TDPs. Further ReadingHP awarded $3B in damages from Oracle over Itanium database cancelation The original plans for Kittson involved making them socket-compatible with Xeon systems, giving Itanium users the benefit of newer chipsets and faster memory, and providing the other benefits of a more modern platform. In 2013, those plans were officially scaled back, making Kittson a drop-in replacement for older Itanium 9500 and 9300 processors using the LGA 1248 socket. Itanium and the IA-64 architecture were Intel's first effort to transition from 32-bit to 64-bit computing. The first products were server chips—consumer PCs back in the early 2000s were still some way off from hitting the 4GB RAM limit of 32-bit systems. But the original intent was for IA-64 to eventually replace the older x86 instruction set entirely. The problem was that IA-64 wasn't backward-compatible with x86 code, making any transition potentially costly and disruptive. The first nail in Itanium's coffin came in 2003, when AMD (then in its heyday) released its first 64-bit Opteron chip based on the AMD K8 architecture. That chip's AMD64 instruction set introduced 64-bit support but didn't break compatibility with regular 32-bit x86 code, letting IT shops make the jump to 64-bit hardware without also having to switch to 64-bit software all at once. AMD's approach was so successful that Intel actually adopted AMD's extensions, cementing what is now usually called x86-64 as the dominant industry standard. This left Itanium to die a long, slow death. Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.

FRIEDMAN New York Times May 11, 2017   Today’s Opinion stories The risks of oil trains A new approach on Korea Reading between Trump’s lines not so difficult ‘Animal House’ governance Owning your own future More Opinion »   PALO ALTO, Calif. — Political analysts will long debate over where Brexit, Trump and Le Pen came from. Many say income gaps. I’d say ... not quite. I’d say income anxiety and the stress over what it now takes to secure and hold a good job. I believe the accelerations set loose by Silicon Valley in technology and digital globalization have created a world where every decent job demands more skill and, now, lifelong learning. More people can’t keep up, and clearly some have reached for leaders who promise to stop the wind. Let me elaborate through a few conversations, starting with Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, who recently remarked to me: “I believe my grandchildren will not drive.” Since he has teenage daughters, that means self-driving vehicles should be fully deployed in 25 years, at which time you won’t “steer” your car but will program it on a smartphone or watch or glasses. Sounds like fun — unless you’re one of the millions who drive a truck or cab for a living. But don’t think you’re safe as an accountant, either. Mark Bohr, Intel’s senior fellow for technology, explained to me that Intel’s main workhorse microprocessor today is the 14-nanometer chip it introduced in 2014. It packs 37.5 million transistors per square millimeter. By the end of 2017, thanks to Moore’s Law, Intel will begin producing a 10-nanometer chip that will pack “100 million transistors per square millimeter — more than double the previous density with less heat and power usage,” said Bohr. If you think machines are smart today ... wait a year. It’s this move from 14-nm to 10-nm chips that will help enable automakers to shrink the brain of a self-driving car — a brain that has to take in sensor data from 360 degrees and instantly process whether it’s a dog, a human, a biker or another car — from something that fills a whole trunk to a small box under the front seat, so these cars can scale. When you get that much processing power, putting out that much data exhaust with ever-improving software, you create a world where we can <em>analyze, prophesize and optimize</em> with a precision unknown in human history. We can see trends we never saw, predict when engine parts will break and replace them before they do, with great savings, and we can optimize everything — from the most energy-saving flight path for an airplane to the ideal drilling path for a natural gas well. I recently visited the control room at Devon Energy, a large oil and gas producer, in Oklahoma City. It’s half a floor of computer screens displaying data coming out of every well Devon is drilling around the world. At the bottom of each screen are two boxes that blew my mind. One box displays how much money was budgeted to drill that particular well per foot, and the other box displays — in real time — how much the drilling of that well is actually costing, as it bores through different rocks, and it’s updated every foot! A typical well might involve sending pipe 2 miles down and then turning horizontally for 2 miles east or west — with such precision it can hit a seam of gas as small as 20 feet wide! If you’re working on a Devon oil rig today, you’re holding a computer, not just an oily wrench. And if you’re getting a degree in auto mechanics at a community college today, it’s not to be a “grease monkey.” It’s to be a repairman for a computer with wheels. The notion that we can go to college for four years and then spend that knowledge for the next 30 is over. If you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, you have to be a lifelong learner. And that means: <em>More is now on you</em>. And that means self-motivation to learn and keep learning becomes the most important life skill. That’s why education-to-work expert Heather E. McGowan likes to say: “Stop asking a young person WHAT you want to be when you grow up. It freezes their identity into a job that may not be there. Ask them HOW you want to be when you grow up. Having an agile learning mindset will be the new skill set of the 21st century.” Some are up for that, some not; and many want to but don’t know how, which is why the College Board has reshaped the PSAT and SAT exams to encourage lifelong learning. “We analyzed 250,000 students from the high school graduating Class of 2017 who took the new PSAT and then the new SAT,” College Board President David Coleman told me. “Students who took advantage of their PSAT results to launch their own free personalized improvement practice through Khan Academy advanced dramatically: 20 hours of practice was associated with an average 115-point increase from the PSAT to the SAT — double the average gain among students who did not. “Practice advances all students without respect to high school GPA, gender, race and ethnicity or parental education. And it’s free. Our aim is to transform the SAT into an invitation for students to own their future.” So the tough news is that more will be on you. The good news is that systems — like Khan-College Board — are emerging everywhere to enable anyone to accelerate learning for the age of acceleration.

FRIEDMAN Published 3:33 pm, Thursday, May 11, 2017 Palo Alto, Calif. Political analysts will long debate over where Brexit, Trump and Le Pen came from. Many say income gaps. I'd say income anxiety and the stress over what it now takes to secure — and hold — a good job. The accelerations set loose by Silicon Valley in technology and digital globalization have created a world where every decent job demands more skill and, now, lifelong learning. More people can't keep up, and clearly some have reached for leaders who promise to stop the wind. Let me elaborate through a few conversations, starting with Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, who recently remarked to me: "I believe my grandchildren will not drive." Since he has teenage daughters, that means self-driving vehicles should be fully deployed in 25 years, at which time you won't "steer" your car but will program it on a smartphone or watch or glasses. Sounds like fun — unless you're one of the millions who drive a truck or cab for a living. But don't think you're safe as an accountant, either. Mark Bohr, Intel's senior fellow for technology, explained to me that Intel's main workhorse microprocessor today is the 14-nanometer chip it introduced in 2014. It packs 37.5 million transistors per square millimeter. By the end of 2017, thanks to Moore's Law, Intel will begin producing a 10-nanometer chip that will pack "100 million transistors per square millimeter — more than double the previous density with less heat and power usage," Bohr said. If you think machines are smart today ... wait a year. It's this move from 14-nm to 10-nm chips that will help enable automakers to shrink the brain of a self-driving car — a brain that has to take in sensor data from 360 degrees and instantly process whether it's a dog, a human, a biker or another car — from something that fills a whole trunk to a small box under the front seat, so these cars can scale. When you get that much processing power, putting out that much data exhaust with ever-improving software, you create a world where we can analyze, prophesize and optimize with a precision unknown in human history. I recently visited the control room at Devon Energy, a large oil and gas producer, in Oklahoma City. It's half a floor of computer screens displaying data coming out of every well Devon is drilling around the world. At the bottom of each screen are two boxes that blew my mind. One box displays how much money was budgeted to drill that particular well per foot, and the other box displays — in real time — how much the drilling of that well is costing, as it bores through rocks, and it's updated every foot! A typical well might involve sending pipe 2 miles down and then turning horizontally for 2 miles east or west — with such precision it can hit a seam of gas as small as 20 feet wide! If you're working on a Devon oil rig today, you're holding a computer, not just an oily wrench. The notion that we can go to college for four years and then spend that knowledge for the next 30 is over. If you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, be a lifelong learner. Self-motivation to keep learning becomes the most important life skill. Education-to-work expert Heather E. McGowan likes to say: "Stop asking a young person what you want to be when you grow up. It freezes their identity into a job that may not be there. Ask them how you want to be when you grow up. Having an agile learning mindset will be the new skill set of the 21st century." That is why the College Board has reshaped the PSAT and SAT exams to encourage lifelong learning. "We analyzed 250,000 students from the high school graduating Class of 2017 who took the new PSAT and then the new SAT," College Board President David Coleman said. "Students who took advantage of their PSAT results to launch their own free personalized improvement practice through Khan Academy advanced: 20 hours of practice was associated with an average 115-point increase from the PSAT to the SAT — double the average gain among students who did not. "Practice advances all students without respect to high school GPA, gender, race and ethnicity or parental education. And it's free. Our aim is to transform the SAT into an invitation for students to own their future." The tough news is that more will be on you. The good news is that systems — like Khan-College Board — are emerging to enable anyone to accelerate learning for the age of acceleration. It's clear that thriving countries today won't elect a strongman. They'll elect leaders who inspire and equip citizens to be strong people who can own their futures. Thomas L.

Pre-order: Surface Laptop Battle of the Surfaces How to pick between the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro 4 By Jez Corden Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 1:00 pm EDT 46 Comments How does Microsoft's Surface Laptop stack up against the Surface Pro 4? Before the Surface Laptop, every Microsoft Surface computer had a "plot twist" — be it a tablet with a kickstand and a detachable keyboard, like the Surface Pro, the giant hinged touch display of the Surface Studio, or the pop-off keyboard base of the Surface Book. The Surface Laptop? It doesn't do anything special, but its premium construction makes it a desirable piece of tech. It's best compared to devices like the MacBook Air, and interestingly, Microsoft's own Surface Pro 4. If you're struggling to choose between the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Laptop, here's some specs and considerations I think you should make. Surface Pro 4 at Microsoft Surface Laptop at Microsoft Surface Laptop vs. Surface Pro 4 tech specs First of all, let's take a look at the raw tech specs. The Surface Laptop does beat the Surface Pro 4 on raw specs, sporting a modern Kaby Lake CPU and the latest Intel HD graphics, but that isn't the full story. Category Surface Laptop Surface Pro 4 Software Windows 10 S (Upgradable to Pro) Windows 10 Pro Display 13.5-inch PixelSense Display 12.3-inch PixelSense Display Display resolution 2256 x 1504 at 201ppi Aspect Ratio: 3:2 2736 x 1824 at 267ppi Aspect Ratio: 3:2 Processor 7th Gen Intel Core i5 or i7 6th Generation Intel Core m3, i5, or i7 (Skylake) Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB Solid State Drive (SSD) 128GB, 256GB, 512GB or 1TB Solid State Drive (SSD) Memory 4GB, 8GB or 16GB RAM 4GB, 8GB or 16GB Graphics i5 Intel HD 620, i7 Intel Iris Plus 640 m3 Intel HD graphics 510, i5 Intel HD graphics 520, i7 Intel Iris graphics Rear camera None 1080p with auto-focus Front camera 720p Windows Hello-compatible 1080p Windows Hello-compatible Speakers Omnisonic speakers with Dolby Audio Premium Front-facing stereo speakers with Dolby Audio Ports One full-size USB 3.0, Surface Connect, 3.5mm headset jack, Mini DisplayPort Full-size USB 3.0, microSD card reader, 3.5mm headset jack, Mini DisplayPort, Type Cover port, Surface Connect Sensors Ambient light sensor Ambient light sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer Security TPM chip for enterprise security TPM chip for enterprise security WiFi 802.11ac 2x2 MIMO Wi-Fi wireless networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible 802.11ac 2x2 MIMO Wi-Fi wireless networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.0 LE Bluetooth 4.0 LE Battery life Up to 14 hours (with W10S) Up to 9 hours Pen Surface Pen 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity Surface Pen 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity Magnetic storage Weight 2.76lbs i5/i7: 1.73lbs (786g), m3: 1.69lbs (766g) Dimensions 12.13 x 8.79 x .57 in (308.1 x 223.27 x 14.48 mm) 11.50 x 7.93 x .33 in (292.10 x 201.42 x 8.45 mm) Price £999 to $2199 $799 to $2599 Battle of the specs When it comes to raw specs, the Surface Laptop beats the Surface Pro 4 at almost every level. Sporting the latest Intel graphics and processors gives the Surface Laptop a decent boost over the Surface Pro 4. Additionally, to speculate, the fact that the Surface Laptop's internals are in a separate compartment to the screen itself should help with heat dissipation. The Surface Pro 4 can throttle under heavy load to prevent overheating, which prevents you from putting that Core i7 processor to its limit, without an external USB fan. If you go all the way up to the Surface Laptop and Pro 4's most expensive tier, both sport Intel Iris graphics, but the Pro 4 will always suffer from heat throttling. We haven't been able to test the Surface Laptop's heat dissipation in a graphics context yet, but I think it's fair to speculate that the Surface Laptop will trounce it for light gaming and other GPU-intensive tasks. As powerful as these devices are, both are best suited to light professional work, lighter gaming, and general desktop leisure activities. Whether you're browsing the web or using Microsoft Office, both devices will perform extremely well, and it's only when you head towards Adobe Photoshop and PC gaming that you will notice serious performance deltas between the two devices. Specs aren't the full story, however. This is as much a battle of form factors as it is power. Battle of the form factor The Surface Laptop packs a lot of power into a small package, but the Surface Pro 4 remains almost an entire pound lighter. Neither device is going to put you over the weight limit at an airport, but the Pro 4 has an extra trick up its sleeve. In situations where you don't need to type, such as using Cortana voice in the kitchen, or watching a movie on the plane — you can remove the keyboard (or indeed, not buy one at all, since it's not included in the price!). Using the Surface Pro's integrated kickstand, you have a wide range of versatile use cases for the Surface Pro, which might not be present in the Surface Laptop. Oddly, Panos Panay demonstrated that the Surface Laptop has Windows Ink support and a pressure sensitive display, but it has no "canvas" mode, since the hinge doesn't support 360 degrees of rotation. Inking on the Surface Laptop will be a clunky, awkward experience, for quick notes and annotations at best. If you were a student planning to write lecture notes by hand, you'd have to lay the Surface Laptop flat on its back, with the keyboard sticking up in the air — which is super dumb. The Surface Pro 4 on the other hand, combined with its kickstand and detachable keyboard, will support artists and intensive note taking sessions, either in OneNote or other compatible apps. The Surface Laptop might have the Surface Pro 4 beaten on raw power, but when it comes to versatility and getting the full use out of the hardware features you're paying a premium for, the Surface Pro 4 will be a safer bet for anyone wanting to ink more frequently. But what about the Surface Pro 5? To throw a wrench in the works, a "Surface Pro 5" may be on the cards, set to be announced very shortly, perhaps even in the next few weeks. While we're not expecting a huge rethink of the Surface Pro tablet, at the very least an update with new Kaby Lake processors and upgraded Intel graphics could be coming. USB-C Thunderbolt 3 would take a Surface Pro 5 to the next level, but considering Microsoft doesn't think the market is "ready" for USB-C just yet and opted to include it in the Surface Studio or Laptop, it doesn't seem likely. Before purchasing a Surface Laptop, you might want to wait until the Pro 5 gets announced — it might edge the Surface Laptop into second place for bang for your buck. Speaking of which, let's discuss price. Battle of the $$$ The Surface Pro 4 is cheaper than the Surface Laptop at every price tier, but not by a huge amount. There are a couple of "hidden" costs associated with both devices that you should be aware of. The Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S, which is a battery-life focused version of Windows 10 that only runs approved apps from the Windows Store. For general browsing and every day laptop use, the Windows 10 Store is more than adequate to serve most people's needs, with a steadily improving array of editing apps, games, and office-type applications. Until December, 2017, Microsoft will allow you to "unlock" Windows 10 S and upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for free, after which, there will be a $50 charge. The Surface Pro 4 on the other hand comes with full Windows 10 Pro out of the box, so there's no need to consider the upgrade cost if you're planning to buy after December 2017. However, the Surface Pro 4 doesn't come with the keyboard Type Cover, which adds another $130~ to the overall cost. While you can use a Surface with any Bluetooth or USB keyboard, trust us, you'll want a Type Cover. Final thoughts While the Surface Pro 4 is slightly cheaper, the gap is closed when you factor in the Surface Pro's type cover. At which point, this becomes a battle of functionality. The Surface Laptop beats the Pro 4 on specs, but the Surface Pro 4 has a removable keyboard and a highly retractable hinge for inking, which defeats the Surface Laptop for any interested artist or ink-favoring student. For every day use, and if you just want something a little more usual, the Surface Laptop will likely be the better option, with upgraded internals, and more than likely, superior heat dissipation, leading to less throttling. You will want to escape the confines of Windows 10 S, however, to get the most out of those powerful internals.

One usage scenario I have a lot is simply sitting around marking up student work with my stylus. The Surface pen is a far easier editing tool than traditional mouse/keyboard (or finger in touch only systems). The second is that I teach Chemistry, being able to simply cast my tablet to the screen and draw out a mechanism on the fly is great, especially when integrated with one note classrooms. 1 9 hours ago Reply Tim Stone A question for the reviewer: What is the battery life of the Surface Notebook running Win 10 Pro ?

I sold my laptop 2 years ago because I didn't feel any need for it once I bought Surface Pro 3. And, I haven't missed it. Surface Laptop is okay but it would have been a tougher choice if the keyboard could go 360 degrees. Because then it could have been a tablet alternative when you needed it to be. Using a pen would have also made much more sense. 0 9 hours ago Reply sholokov Correction needed..."opted NOT to include it..." 0 9 hours ago Reply alanSJ Jez, are you using British currency in this article? In the US, the MSRP for the type cover is $130, not $100. Also, wasn't there a recent article on this site where Panos was quoted "There's no such thing as a Surface Pro 5. It doesn't exist." during the Surface Laptop introduction? So, I'm not sure if you can rely on the SP5 getting "announced very shortly, perhaps even in the next few weeks." I think if a college student needs to make a decision now or soon, he/she shouldn't factor in the SP5. BTW, the SP4 is still a beast today. 1 9 hours ago Reply Jez Corden Yes, I prob was using UK currency, will fix. Sorry about that. 0 8 hours ago Reply DJCBS When was the last time Panos or Microsoft acknowledged the existence of something before it was announced? Yeah. Never. 0 8 hours ago Reply alanSJ Well, I don't think it's just MS. Every tech company, especially Apple, is super secretive about their projects. When they're ready to introduce a new product, they'd send out an invite to the press. The invite is normally a teaser which doesn't exactly tell you what the new product is. Then everybody will find out about it on the day of the press intro (unless there are leaks, of course). My point is, for Panos to say "There's no such thing as a SP5. It doesn't exist." just last week during the Surface Laptop intro and turn around to introduce the SP5 a few weeks later would be pretty awkward for him. I don't think the SP5 is going to come out in the next few weeks as Jez Corden speculates in this article. I think in the next few months is more reasonable. 0 7 hours ago Reply DJCBS I don't know when the SP5 will be announced but I'm pretty sure it will be. As for the awkwardness of Panos saying that...believe me, it wouldn't be awkward at all. He would probably even address it in the presentation. The reason he said it on the presentation of the Laptop is because he knows that the Surface Laptop is inferior to the Surface Pro line. If he said the SP5 exists there and then, he would pretty much be killing off any little chance the Surface Laptop had of success. The media already received the Surface Laptop with enough coldness. Admitting on the existence of the Pro 5 would just lead the headlines to be "Microsoft presents a Laptop but you're better off waiting just a little longer for their newest Surface Pro device". 2 7 hours ago Reply Aden Rossinni The SP 5 will not be announced, and why should it. The SP 4 is perfect still for at least a year. We DO NOT need another Pro at this stage. The SB could do with a II release before, but the, Ultimate mobile device is what I'm hanging out for. 0 6 hours ago Reply Brian Embry I am going to get either a Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book. I am leaning towards the Surface Book with Performance Base. For what I do tablet mode is becoming very necessary. I might consider the Laptop if it had a 360 hinge. 0 9 hours ago Reply MrElectrifyer How to pick? There's no contest in the first place. Surface Pro 4 all the way. The Surface Laptop literally just scraps all of the following advantages of the Surface Pro 4 and keeps the price tag: - It's 3 times as versatile (a mono Laptop vs a Tablet + Digitizer Drawing Board + Laptop in 1) - Can practically replace ALL your needs for pen and paper (something Satya was clearly too stupid to realize is a big factor for Students) - 2 higher quality webcams (5 MP and 8 MP vs 1 front-facing only 720p webcam). That rear camera is extremely handy for students going paperless, especially with Office Lens in OneNote ( https://is.gd/JqZnjr ) - A higher resolution display (funny how they increased the screen size and gimped the resolution) - A convenient storage expansion port (MicroSD card slot vs being stuck with what you bought or having some dongle sticking out of your Laptop) - Comes with Windows 10 Pro regardless of when you buy it - etc. It's basically an overpriced joke with the Surface brand attached to it. 0 9 hours ago Reply Ferenc Toth I have a feeling that the next gen Surface Pro will have Windows 10S to take advantage of the power lower power consumption. I wouldn't mind that, except I still need to run a few Win32 apps. 0 9 hours ago Reply Rufus Pearce If I am going to spend that much money on something, it sure as heck MUST have a removeable battery. 0 8 hours ago Reply Alberto Brusa But why? 0 8 hours ago Reply Aden Rossinni Why? 0 6 hours ago Reply Andrea Mangano Because if your battery breaks prematurely you have to send the whole product to Service. And if it breaks outside warranty the spare battery will be hard to find and you end in sending the product to service, paying a high price for a simple replacement. For normal notebooks you can find on the web spare batteries. With integrated batteries it could be a challenge having battery replaced. 0 5 hours ago Reply Alberto Brusa Is this when I mention I never knew my Pro had a mini SD port? 2 8 hours ago Reply alanSJ You learn something new every day.😉 0 8 hours ago Reply DAVEON1Y How does the surface book fit into this comparison? 0 8 hours ago Reply MrElectrifyer The Surface Book is the way to go if you want that extra performance offered by the dedicated GPU. Otherwise, the Surface Pro 4 is the way to go. The Surface Laptop, merely an inferior and overpriced joke with the same price tag as the Surface Pro 4. Only thing it has over the Pro 4 is the CPU, and as we all know, Kabylake only brought battery improvements, barely any performance improvements over Skylake. That's why it's still only "50% Faster Than MacBook Air" just like the Surface Pro 4. 0 6 hours ago Reply premsta Another possible choice is any of a number of third party 2-in-1s like the Lenovo Yoga or HP Spectre 360.

The ONLY thing the Laptop has over the Pro 4 is the processor which does NOT make that huge of a difference.Apart from that: - Screen resolution: Pro 4 is better - OS: Pro 4 is better (it cuts the need to get rid of Windows 10 S(hitty). - Front facing camera: Pro 4 - Speakers: Pro 4. - Sensors: Pro 4 has 3 extra sensors. - Weight: Pro 4   And then the Pro 4 also has: - a type cover which you CAN easily replace when it wears out, unlike the Laptop which had that unfortunate idea of covering the keyboard with Alcantara which, if it stains, it stains and it can't be user-replaced. - The ability to ACTUALLY USE the Surface pen since you can detach the keyboard of just flip it around. - Has a rear camera which allows you to take pictures of board annotations etc...which, for a STUDENT (you know, the supposed "target" of the Laptop) is quite useful. - It's lighter which, for a STUDENT, is also relevant   ALL of this while being CHEAPER than the Laptop EVEN when you add in the type cover.   Only a completely blind fanboy who lusts over every new shinny thing Microsoft slaps their logo on would EVER say the Laptop is better in ANY scenario than the Pro 4. It's not surprising that the Laptop had a lukewarm reception at best. It's overpriced and underspec'ed. A terrible deal for ANY users in ANY situation. And its competition isn't the niche Macbooks. It's Microsoft's own Surface Pro line AND Microsoft's OEM partners who are producing laptops that for the same prices are leaps and bounds better than the Surface Laptop.     I personally am waiting to see the Surface Pro 5. The Laptop is completely out of the question, even if my usage of the Pro 3 so far has been 90% as a laptop replacement ('cause, you know, that was the point of the product itself). 5 8 hours ago Reply ia_win @DJCBS We'll said. Add SD card support as well. Which for me deal breaker! No brainer at all. SP all the way. I am finding difficult to justify an upgrade from SP3 to SP4. 0 7 hours ago Reply LondonLumia Yep, got to agree. As a student I have to say my SP4 is so much more versatile than a normal laptop, for all the reasons you mentioned above. It can fit any use I need. The Laptop is a nice bit of kit but just not suited to students as well as the Pro line. The only real advantage of the laptop that I can see is a bigger battery, but the Pro has enough juice to work fine. 1 7 hours ago Reply Aden Rossinni Yeah, that's the problem of forgetting to take into consideration, emotion. Humans are emotional, and the bottom line doesn't always make or break a deal. Pure facts don't mean much. The SL will find takers because it's a laptop, because it looks great, because of the colours, because some people don't need all the cool things the SP has, so, just dismissing it based on a stupid like for like comparison is annoying and ignorant. You don't have to be a fan boy to want the SL. More than likely it will convert others. 0 6 hours ago Reply DJCBS "The SL will find takers because it's a laptop" - So are all the other Windows...laptops "because it looks great" - So do all the other Windows laptops on the same price range. In fact, the Surface Laptop looks pretty "meh. Seen that before" "because of the colours" - You mean silver? Or are you refering to those other colours which are NOT available outside the USA and even in the USA are only available in one model? "because some people don't need all the cool things the SP has" - Those also don't need a 1000€ laptop.     Thank you for proving with that "emotional response" that only a blind fanboy will buy the Surface Laptop ;) 0 1 min ago Reply MrElectrifyer Very well said! Also add: - Ports: Pro 4. It's hilarious how the lighter and thinner device has more ports 0 6 hours ago Reply Aden Rossinni I don't want to choose. I have the Pro 4, and I will be getting the SL. I have use for both. 1 6 hours ago Reply 21Vicroy I do have a SP4 and I have to say I am considering getting a SL. Having a stable surface (pardon the pun) to rest my hands on when I code and manage VM's is something I'd really want. granted there is Dell, HP and the like, but after experiencing the stability of the surface line I can't say I'm willing to go back to OEM's and their poor quality service. I just wish they'd announce a laptop or what ever with a Quad Core processor instead of a hyperthreaded dual core like the rest of their line up. Apple so far has a device that offers power over batter. MS needs that right now more than ever. I'd get a SB but it's over my budget -_- not to mention just as weak as the rest. 0 5 hours ago Reply infinihertz It's funny being at Build and watching a lot of people (certainly not all) with Surface Pros. Some of them are taking notes with the pen and using it as a tablet, but many others are typing with it on their laps like a laptop (many rooms don't have desks, just chairs) and I see them slide and almost fall to the floor. That's the main reason to consider the Surface Laptop form factor in my mind: what % of the time you will be typing *on your lap* vs on a table/desk. If almost always the latter, the SP4 makes more sense. If the former, I don't think it does. I have an SP4, and that specific use case is what makes me switch devices for events. I hope SP5 addresses that better, though honestly I'm not sure how they would. Maybe what I really want is a Surface Book that has a less wobbly display. 0 5 hours ago Reply DJCBS The only way Microsoft has to address that is by releasing a metallic type cover. It's not impossible though it'd then make it almost a Surface Book. 0 0 sec ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Its shares rose another 5%, for a 23% gain this week so far. By Tiernan Ray Updated May 11, 2017 1:50 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Nvidia's latest GPU technology is called "Volta," and the company says it can give a big lift to tasks such as artificial intelligence. Illustration: Nvidia Inc. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continue their miraculous week, the stock up $6.08, or 5%, at $127.37, after Wednesday’s 18% rise. That’s a tidy 23% for the week so far. Tuesday’s better-than-expected fiscal Q1 report was followed yesterday by the company’s annual analyst day meeting, which included details of a new chip design aimed at data center uses such as artificial intelligence. The chip is called “Volta,” and it is being compared today in various ways to Intel’s (INTC) capabilities. There were no updates on the financial outlook from Nvidia management, but the company did talk up what it believes are $70 billion worth of addressable markets for its products come 2020, and analysts seem encouraged by that today. As one analyst, Rosenblatt’s Hans Mosesmann, crowed today, "The level of disruption that the Nvidia GPU acceleration approach will do to the computing world will be epic in our opinion." Among the intriguing topics that emerged amidst everything else was that of “inferencing.” As I discussed in a November interview with Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, inferencing is the corollary of what happens in today’s machine learning. In machine learning’s “training” phase, which is where Nvidia is getting most of its GPU contracts, computing facilities learn how to understand information by sifting through large data sets. Inferencing is when the machine responds to an actual query from an internet user by applying the rules it has learned in training phase. Huang indicated to me in November that having his chips used for inferencing would spread their adoption to a much broader set of uses, where just about every Web page request could become a kind of inference. Loop Capital’s Betsy Van Hees reiterates her Buy rating, and raises her price target to $137 from $129, after concluding from the event that ”the story remains in the early innings." "Although we didn’t get the long- term model we were looking for at the Analyst Day held after the keynote, the executive presentations were impressive,” she writes. The stock can go higher, she thinks, "driven by continued YoY growth in PC gaming and robust diversification of the model." B. Riley’s Craig Ellis reiterates a Buy rating, and a $135 price target, writing that Nvidia “seems well positioned to stay at A.I.’s leading edge." Volta is "an AI-optimized beast, offering some exceptional performance gains versus Pascal,” the prior design, and he thinks it bodes well for the company’s data center business. However, it’s a big chip, at 815 square millimeters, so “yields for the big new part will need monitoring." In addition, an announced partnership with Toyota (TM) for autonomous driving seems to Ellis “a material positive and a further reason our segment estimates seem low beyond fiscal ’18." Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho reiterates his Buy rating and raises his price target to $145 from $130, writing that the new market size the company mentioned for data center chips is $30 billion by 2020, which is two-and-a-half times the current size. On Volta, he notes its performance capabilities are “20 times the performance of the next generation Skylake,” by which he appears to be referring to Intel’s current top-of-the-line PC processor. "With DC growing at a 60% CAGR,” observes Rakesh, "we believe a conservative ~25% share of the potential $30B DC TAM could be an incremental $3 on top of current F19E of $3.40." Rosenblatt’s Mosesmann reiterates a Buy rating, and a $152 price target. He found the event “impressive,” and thinks it all will “reset how the Street will view the company." Volta is "an accelerator monster at the limits of semiconductor manufacturing,” he writes. As for the Toyota win, it is “obviously strategic in nature and at this stage of the game a huge win for Nvidia given that there are two A.I. self-driving architectures: Intel and Nvidia." Mosesmann notes that inferencing "as a topic came up several times during the meeting and management indicated that it is a small market today." "It is relatively easy for Nvidia to start to address inferencing with Volta,” writes Mosesmann, "given the one-architecture approach the company is pursuing; not the case for new entrants." He likes the company’s decision to freely distribute the source code for its “Xavier” autonomous vehicles platform: During the Q&A portion of the investor meeting on the self-driving topic Jen- Hsun indicated that the fully programmable AI-based Nvidia Xavier platform has structural advantages given that it is entirely based on deep learning and is fully programmable today vs. the mix-and-match Intel approach of using CPUs, FPGAs, and custom ASICs (Mobileye). Another tidbit we thought intriguing is that Nvidia intends to open source Xavier (give away source code freely in order to accelerate adoption of deep learning). The open source move is clever given the company’s intention to push the limits of semiconductor technology which in a rapidly changing AI application and compute intensive environment will benefit Nvidia. Among those less impressed today is Wells Fargo’s David Wong, who reiterates an Underperform rating on the shares, and a $75 price target. Wong writes that the company “has done an excellent job of positioning itself with strong products and significant expertise in these emerging segments, though we believe that this is at least to some extent already reflected in the company’s stock price." Adds Wong, "Nvidia believes that its datacenter GPU TAM might rise to about $30 billion (HPC+deep learning training and inference). We think this might prove to be too optimistic."

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel AMT firmware suffers security flaw even when… Intel AMT firmware suffers security flaw even when machines are off By Mark Coppock — Updated May 10, 2017 4:49 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you're running a machine with an Intel vPro processor, then you need to keep your eyes open this week for an important security fix. Another security vulnerability has been revealed that poses a significant risk for a number of PCs running Intel chipsets or processors. This one’s a bit different — and potentially more dangerous — than many other vulnerabilities in that it targets business-class systems in particular. It can also affect machines that aren’t even running. The flaw, which exists in certain Intel chipset firmware versions utilized by some systems with vPro processors, affects the Active Management Technology, or AMT, feature. AMT lets administrators manage machines via remote connections, and the vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and utilize the same capabilities, Ars Technica reports. AMT is a part of the remote access features of some systems that allow remote access to a machine even when it’s shut down. As long as such a machine has power, it can by design be accessed with all the intended remote capabilities enabled. Intel designed AMT to demand a password before allowing remote access via web browser. Unfortunately, the flaw allows attackers to bypass the AMT system’s usual authentication requirement. Tenable Network Security, which has created what it characterizes as the first Intel AMT vulnerability detection capability, describes the flaw as follows: ” … we reduced the response hash to one hex digit and authentication still worked. Continuing to dig, we used a NULL/empty response hash (response=”” in the HTTP Authorization header). Authentication still worked. We had discovered a complete bypass of the authentication scheme.” As Ars Technica points out, the issue is made even worse by the AMT feature’s design, in which network traffic is passed through the Intel Management Engine and to the AMT, bypassing the operating system. That means that there’s no record of unauthorized access. Intel indicated in a blog post that PC manufacturers should be releasing patches for affected systems within the week. It also posts a tool to locate and diagnose vulnerable systems. Fujitsu, HP, and Lenovo have provided information on their own affected systems. So far, the Shodan security search engine has located more than 8,500 machines that are vulnerable to attack. Updated on 5-10-2017 by Mark Coppock: Clarified that the flaw exists in certain chipset firmware and not inherent in Intel vPro processors and removed the incorrect reference to any empty text field being able to bypass AMT authentication.

Related Stephen Colbert Takes Victory Lap After Donald Trump Calls Him "No Talent Guy" With "Filthy" Mouth Senate Intel Committee chair Richard Burr’s first question to acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe was to ask if he’d ever heard ousted FBI chief James Comey tell Trump he was not the subject of an investigation. In his letter firing Comey on Tuesday, Trump stated Comey had three times told him he was not under investigation. “Sir I can’t comment on any conversations the director may have had with the president,” McCabe responded, disappointing millions watching the hearing on TV and via livestream, not to mention website headline writers. However, McCabe said, when asked, that it is not standard practice for the FBI to inform someone they are not the subject of an investigation. Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner noted the timing of Comey’s firing was “especially troubling” to members of both political parties on the committee. McCabe appeared before the committee with CIA director Mike Pompeo, NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers, and National Intelligence Director Dan Coats.  Warner asked them whether they were certain Russian intel agencies were responsible for meddling in the presidential election in order to influence the outcome. Each man answered “yes.” Warner thanked them for that unanimous response, adding he appreciates their stating, for the record, that the assertion is “not a piece of fake news” – as Trump repeatedly has insisted. Warner also asked McCabe if, for however long he is acting FBI Director, would he commit to informing the committee if he became aware of any effort to interfere with the FBI’s investigation into Russian meddling. That investigation includes looking into whether any Trump campaign associates had contacts with Russian reps  during the campaign to affect the election outcome. “I absolutely do,” McCabe responded. “In light of what happened in the last 48 hours it is critically important we have that assurance,” Warner said, adding that he hoped McCabe would convey to bureau staffers that the committee is committed to supporting them in their efforts “and their independence.” McCabe also promised he would not update Trump on the investigation, which he called a “highly significant” probe, contradicting White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders who, on Wednesday called that investigation “one of the smallest things that [FBI] has got going on their plate.” He also shot holes into Sanders’ assertion, in explaining the firing, that Comey had lost the confidence of the bureau. “I hold Director Comey in the absolute highest regard,” McCabe said, adding, “I can confidently tell you that the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to” Comey. That in response to a question from Sen. Martin Heinrich. Warner earlier had said it is hard to avoid concluding that Trump’s decision to sack Comey was related to this investigation. Days before Comey was fired, he had asked the DOJ for a big boost in resources for his probe into Russia’s election rannygazoo, the NYT reported, citing four congressional officials. McCabe said he could not confirm that, adding that it is not typical for the FBI to request additional funding for a specific investigation.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « LG Innotek to Supply Apple with World's First 3D Facial Recognition Camera for the iPhone 8 | Main | Apple Invents Future USB-C, Lightning Connectors to light up in the Dark while Providing Status Information » May 11, 2017 AI Wars are almost reaching Fever Pitch with new Home Devices and Apple Fans look to WWDC 2017 for Apple's Response   There's no doubt that the AI war is going to be in full swing by Christmas. The leader for digital assistant home devices is currently Amazon with Google Home coming in a distant second place. Amazon just introduced a higher-end version of their device called 'Echo Show.' The new version comes with a 7-inch touch display at a killer price of only $230 for one or $360 for a pair.     Winning the home market for AI is important and it's ramping up towards fever pitch as Microsoft announced yesterday during their developer conference that they're working with HP and Intel on delivering more Cortana based devices. There's no doubt that over time their larger PC partners will also introduce products if the ones coming from Harman/Kardon and HP sell well over the holiday season.   It was revealed at Build that Microsoft is working with HP and Intel to bring more Cortana-powered devices to the world. HP will make a device with Cortana inside while Intel will work on a reference design.   It was also revealed yesterday that Intel has been aggressively developing technologies and products for the artificial intelligence (AI) market and has acquired companies including Altera, which focuses on FPGA technology, Nervana Systems for machine learning technologies and Mobileye, the largest ADAS supplier. The CPU giant's new processors codenamed Lake Crest, are currently in testing to be optimized for neural networks.   The company also has a new processor series codenamed Knights Crest that is designed to integrate its Xeon processor with Nervana's technologies.   Microsoft also made it known that other partners working with them include Volvo, Nissan, and BMW, which committed earlier this year to using Microsoft's in-car system with Cortana and Skype inside.   In a new report today we learn that Compal Electronics recently landed orders for a smart voice recognition device tied to AI technologiees that will be tied to 'wearable devices' from a U.S. company.   The device is expected to be released via a brand vendor in the third or fourth quarter and will feature voice and face recognition function and the Cortana system.   Last week Patently Apple posted a report titled "Inventec Lands First Order for Apple's Echo-Like Home Device with Siri," followed by a report titled "Apple's SVP Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller thinks that Echo-Like Devices should have a Display."   And lastly, we can't forget that Samsung is likely to enter the race as well now that their digital assistant Bixby launched in South Korea on May first for the Galaxy S8 and likely to hit the U.S. in a few months. Samsung is already adopting Bixby for appliances and it will be coming to their Gear smartwatch and new Galaxy C10 coming to China with a dual lens camera at mid-range pricing that could further hurt iPhone SE sales in that country even further, according to a recent Korean tech report.   Furthermore, we discovered yesterday that the U.S. Patent Office granted Samsung a design patent for an Audio device that no doubt will be for a home device for Bixby that comes with a display on a stand as noted below.   The fever pitch news around AI devices for the home comes as Apple's WWDC 2017 draws nigh. Not to overhype the event, but should Apple happen to announce a new Siri based device for the home in the Echo-class category, it's going to really make the upcoming event a much watch this year. The air will be crackling with excitement.   Such a device is going to fit in beautifully with Apple's HomeKit and help the smart home market accelerate.   Considering that most families will want several such devices laid out around the home, Apple is going to have to price their device aggressively. Amazon has the right idea because it's not just about the smart home, it's about ordering products and services too.   Microsoft has really been on a tear of late introducing new products that excite their base and they're definitely taking the AI war to Apple, just as they are with their mixed reality HoloLens headset.   The War between Microsoft and Apple seemed to be over with Apple crushing Wintel, but the tech giants are waking up and AI is front and center for both Microsoft and Intel.   There's nothing like a healthy tech war to get consumers fired up and this coming holiday season is really going to be interesting as Apple enters the race and goes head to head with Microsoft and their partners along with Amazon, Google and others. It's going to be a real slugfest.   Does Apple have a killer app to reveal next month that will separate the wheat from the chaff? Only time will tell.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Gets New Data Center Chief Intel's previous Data Center Group chief had to go on a leave of absence, leading the company to appoint a new head of this critical division. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 11, 2017 at 10:30AM On May 3, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) posted a letter penned by CEO Brian Krzanich discussing "changes to the company's leadership team." According to the note, Intel Data Center Group (DCG) chief Diane Bryant "has made the difficult decision to take a leave of absence from Intel to tend to a personal family matter," and would be gone for "the next six to eight months." Image source: Intel. Krzanich said in the note that "given the extended duration, an interim leader for the Data Center Group is not possible," which is why he just appointed current Client Computing Group (CCG) chief, Navin Shenoy, to take Bryant's place. The executive also explained that "information about the succession plan for Navin as the general manager of CCG will be provided over the coming weeks," and that executive Murthy Renduchintala "will be CCG's acting leader." Finally, Krzanich said that he'll reveal what Bryant will be up to next at Intel when she comes back. What does this mean for Intel? Navin Shenoy has quite a lot of experience under his belt. His biography on Intel's website says that before becoming the general manager of CCG, he was the general manager of Intel Asia Pacific, and before that he was "technical assistant to former Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini." "In that role," his biography reads, "he assisted Otellini in the development and implementation of Intel's long-term corporate strategy and the daily management of Intel's global business." Image source: Intel. Under Shenoy's (brief) tenure as the general manager of CCG (he took the position in April 2016), the division seemed to do well enough; in 2016, CCG's revenue grew slightly in a challenging personal computer market and operating profit surged to $10.65 billion, up from $8.17 billion in the prior year. Obviously, CCG and DCG are different businesses, but I think that Shenoy's experience and success in CCG should translate nicely to DCG. Indeed, if Shenoy did well in managing a business facing serious challenges, he'll probably be fine managing DCG, which has much better long-term growth prospects. What will Bryant do upon her return? Bryant is clearly a very capable executive as the performance of DCG over the last several years has undoubtedly demonstrated. In my view, Intel is better off with her than without her, and the language of Krzanich's email makes it plain that she and Intel are planning for her to return. The question, though, is what her "next challenging role" will be? From the email, it doesn't sound like Bryant will take over CCG since information about CCG's succession plan "will be provided over the coming weeks" but Bryant's new role won't be announced until she comes back in six to eight months. Intel's other major segments -- Programmable Solutions Group, Internet of Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, and Intel's fledgling Custom Foundry division -- all aren't likely to see their current general managers replaced in favor of Bryant. What I suspect that Intel might do, then, is create a new role for Bryant, as it did for current Intel executive Aicha Evans. Evans used to head up the company's Communications and Devices Group (iCDG), but was given the title of chief strategy officer. The key for Intel, though, is to make sure Bryant does, indeed, have an interesting and challenging role upon her return as Intel's emerging data center competitors would likely benefit greatly from hiring her away from Intel.    Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, CIA Director Mike Pompeo and NSA Director Mike Rogers are also scheduled to testify at the 10 a.m. hearing, which focuses on worldwide threats. Story Continued Below But the Intel panel still wants to hear from Comey, extending a bipartisan invitation to him to testify next Tuesday in a closed-door session. Senate Intel Chairman Richard Burr insisted Wednesday that his committee was still capable of handling its Russia probe but admitted Comey’s firing would create headaches for the investigation, Austin reports. GOP DISMISSES CALLS FOR SPECIAL PROSECUTOR — Both Burr and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) forcefully rejected Democratic demands for a special prosecutor to take over the Russia investigation, saying it would only hamper the current congressional probes. That didn’t stop Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), ranking member on the Intel panel, from shifting away from his past position and joining other Democrats to demand a special prosecutor intervene. Burgess, Austin and SMK with more: http://politi.co/2pAF2st Next stop: Possible partisan brawl — Now some Democrats say the confirmation of Comey’s successor should be put on pause until Republicans agree to their calls for a special prosecutor. “Senate Democrats wield little leverage to block Comey’s replacement from being confirmed,” SMK and Elana report. “But past FBI directors have earned essentially unanimous support from the Senate, steering the confirmation fight into uncharted waters if it turns into full-fledged partisan combat.” More: http://politi.co/2pAMWSl Related: 11 possible contenders to replace Comey, via Josh Gerstein: http://politi.co/2pAzqyo DRIP, DRIP, DRIP — Comey was fired just days after going to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to ask for more resources for the FBI’s investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia, the New York Times reports. Burr and Warner learned of Comey’s request Monday. The Intel panel leaders had requested the meeting with Comey to ask the FBI to speed up its probe so they too could accelerate their investigation. Matthew Rosenberg and Matt Apuzzo: http://nyti.ms/2pAsKQQ -Rosenstein, whom Trump had ordered to make a case against Comey in writing after already deciding to fire the FBI director, threatened to resign after the White House cast the deputy AG as the primary driver of the decision to dismiss Comey, the Washington Post reports. Philip Rucker, Ashley Parker, Sari Horwitz and Robert Costa: http://wapo.st/2pAuVnn -"Comey started receiving daily instead of weekly updates on the investigation, beginning at least three weeks ago," Shane Harris and Carol Lee report in the Wall Street Journal. "Mr. Comey was concerned by information showing possible evidence of collusion, according to these people." House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz has asked Justice Department inspectors looking into the FBI’s behavior in the run up to the 2016 election to expand their probe to include the situation surrounding Comey’s firing. Bianca Padró Ocasio: http://politi.co/2pAnPiA RYAN BREAKS HIS SILENCE — After more than 24 hours without so much as a public statement, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) broke his silence, defending the president for abruptly dismissing Comey. Ryan told Fox News’ Bret Baier that Trump’s decision was justified because Comey had lost the confidence of the president, lawmakers and senior DOJ officials, Rachael reports. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) also signaled his support for the president during a Playbook interview Wednesday evening. “I would argue that Comey made the FBI political,” McCarthy said. “For the good of the FBI and the country, it’s probably a good decision. So let’s move on.” Cristiano Lima: http://politi.co/2pAF6Io SENATE INTEL SUBPOENAS FLYNN — Leaders of the Senate Intel Committee subpoenaed any Russia-related documents from former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn Wednesday after his attorneys told the panel he wouldn’t cooperate without first being guaranteed immunity.

WEDNESDAY’S MOST CLICKED: Burgess’ story about Ted Cruz being the Senate GOP’s Obamacare repeal lynchpin was the big winner. DEMS: TRUMP ON ‘PATH’ TO IMPEACHMENT — The decision by Trump to fire Comey just brings the president that much closer to being impeached, House Democrats said Wednesday. “We should maybe have an impeachment clock. And if we had one, I think yesterday moved us about an hour closer to having that need,” said Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan. “We are certainly moving down that path,” Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego added. ‘Adopt-a-District’: Pocan and Gallego are working with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Indivisible on a campaign that helps voters in Republican districts organize town halls with nearby Democratic lawmakers if their GOP representatives decline to hold public events. Gallego recently visited GOP Rep. Martha McSally’s district and Pocan will hold a town hall in Speaker Ryan’s neighboring district Friday. Later Wednesday, the House GOP’s campaign arm sent out a fundraising pitch based on Democrats’ impeachment comments. “It's not unusual for parties to send out fundraising appeals that invoke political extremes to grab the attention of grass-roots donors,” Alex Isenstadt reports. “But the email left some senior Republican strategists scratching their heads, particularly at such a vulnerable time for the besieged White House.” http://politi.co/2pAImDD GOP SCRAMBLES TO KEEP AGENDA ON TRACK — Speaker Ryan was in Ohio Wednesday, touring a factory and trying to talk up tax reform. Instead, he was met with repeated questions from reporters about Comey’s firing. Cue a similar scene in the Senate Wednesday as GOP leaders struggled to quarantine the Comey fallout and keep their agenda on track. “The scrums of reporters haranguing senators over Comey reached new highs on Wednesday, creating unwieldy crowds and exasperated senators who kept getting asked the same question,” Burgess and Rachael report. “But inside the GOP lunch, the discussion was almost entirely related to repealing Obamacare, a topic that's difficult enough for Republicans to tackle, senators said.” More: http://politi.co/2pAvRrK WHATCHA TALKIN’ BOUT? House Republicans cheered their vote to repeal Obamacare last week in a grand way—heading to the White House Rose Garden for the type of celebration normally reserved for a bill being signed into law, not legislation that only passed one house of Congress. But back home in their districts this week, it seems they’ve forgotten how to talk about their plan. “In interviews and at town halls packed with pro-Obamacare protesters, Republicans have struggled to explain the plan they just approved,” Kyle reports. “Lawmakers are telling audiences conflicting things about how the bill would affect consumers. Others slammed a process they actively participated in or admitted they hadn’t read the entire bill before voting on it.” More: http://politi.co/2pANgAK Related: MacArthur besieged by criticism during marathon town hall — “At his Wednesday night town hall, Rep. Tom MacArthur, one of the chief architects of the revamped GOP Obamacare replacement plan, was called a liar,” Ryan Hutchins and Katie Jennings reports. “For nearly five hours, MacArthur faced an onslaught as he spoke here at a community center in the bluest town in this South Jersey-based swing district.” Much more: http://politi.co/2pANub9 LePAGE PASSES ON SENATE RUN — Controversial Maine Gov.

Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman, and Sen. Mark Warner, the committee's Democratic vice chairman, issued a joint statement Wednesday saying the panel decided to issue the subpoena after Flynn, through his lawyer, declined to cooperate with an April 28 request to turn over the documents. Flynn and other associates of President Donald Trump have received similar requests from the committee for information and documents over the past few weeks. Copies of request letters sent to longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page were shared with The Associated Press. Those letters, which were nearly identical, sought emails, text messages, letters, phone records or any other relevant information they have about meetings or contacts that they or any other individual affiliated with the Trump campaign had with Russian officials or representatives of Russian business interests. They also ask for information about any financial or real estate holdings related to Russia, including any since divested or sold. Stone, Page, Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort all received similar requests for information, a person familiar with the Senate investigation said. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the details of the committee's investigation. The requests sent to Stone and Page covered documents and information from June 2015 through Jan. 20 of this year. During that period, Flynn accepted tens of thousands of dollars from a Russian state-sponsored television network. He later worked as a foreign agent on behalf of a Turkish businessman, while serving as a top Trump campaign adviser. It also covers the postelection time period in which Trump and his transition team decided to appoint Flynn as national security adviser. Stone said Thursday that he will "fully comply" with the Senate intelligence committee's request for information and documents relating to its Russia investigation. Stone told NBC's "Today" he wants to testify, since members of congressional panels involved in the Russia probe "have disparaged me publicly." • Last month: Pentagon probes former Trump aide Flynn's foreign payments Flynn was fired by Trump after less than one month on the job. The White House said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials about his communications during the presidential transition with Russia's ambassador to the United States. The subpoena comes as both the Senate committee and its counterpart in the House are investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump associates colluded with those attempts to sway the election. Flynn's Russia ties are also being scrutinized by the FBI as it conducts a similar investigation. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena or say why Flynn declined to provide the information earlier. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are also separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. The top Democrat and Republican on a House oversight committee have said Flynn likely broke federal law by failing to get approval from the U.S. government to accept foreign payments and not disclosing them after accepting them. Among the payments they cited were more than $33,000 from RT, a Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda front for Russia's government. The network paid Flynn for attending a December 2015 gala in Moscow during which Flynn was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Turkish payments under scrutiny are part of $530,000 worth of lobbying and investigative work that Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, performed for a Turkish businessman. In March, Flynn and his firm belatedly registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for the work, acknowledging it could have benefited the Turkish government. On Wednesday, the AP reported that Flynn is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn's firm sent back last year to the client. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told the AP that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Microsoft More like this Which Mac should you buy? Tested: The truth behind the MacBook Pro's 'terrible' battery life Review: MacBook Air 1.86GHz Video MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac The MacBook Air has been such a hit for Apple the past few years that even Microsoft is making one. Starting at $999, the Surface Laptop sure looks good–it’s got a MacBook Air price, a wedge shape, weighs 2.76 pounds, the latest Intel core i5 processor, and a high-resolution display. Given that Apple hasn’t updated the MacBook Air in ages, the Surface Laptop attacks Apple at a vulnerable spot right in the midst of a product transition. Well played by Microsoft, but if you look a bit closer it sure looks like Apple’s got the Surface Laptop surrounded. The $999 laptop If there’s any place that Microsoft has got Apple over a barrel, at least for the moment, it’s at what you can buy for $999. The processors in the MacBook Air are two generations behind those in the Surface Laptop, and the Air’s screen isn’t Retina. Pexels The MacBook Air is a great deal, but will never get a better screen. But look closer: The Air’s got 8GB of RAM to the Surface Laptop’s 4GB. Microsoft cut the base specs of the Surface Laptop to the bone to get it to $999, and Apple doesn’t seem to be willing to ship a computer with 4GB of RAM anymore. The Surface Laptop also only has a single USB 3 port, while the Air has two. And while the Surface Laptop’s Mini DisplayPort works fine with external displays, the MacBook Air’s pulls double duty as a Thunderbolt 2 port. Still, the Surface Laptop is a modern computer and the Air is a couple of years out of date. If there’s any glaring weakness in Apple’s laptop line, it’s the company’s inability (or refusal) to bring its new, updated MacBook models to within hailing distance of the $999 price of the MacBook Air. Until Apple can do that, I guess the MacBook Air will keep kicking around? At some point it seems like Apple will need to bite the bullet and make a MacBook available for $999 or $1099, just so it can send the Air to the graveyard at last. In the meantime, Microsoft is there–with a high-resolution screen, if not a whole lot of RAM. The MacBook versus the Surface Laptop The true successor of the MacBook Air is, of course, the MacBook. And at $1299, the MacBook and Surface Laptop are pretty similar. The MacBook is three-quarters of a pound lighter, though its Intel m5 processor isn’t as powerful as the i5 processor on the Surface Laptop. Both devices offer 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, onboard Intel graphics, and a choice of colors. The Surface Laptop’s got a slightly larger screen, while the MacBook’s is a slightly higher resolution. Jason Snell The single-port MacBook stacks up to the $1299 Surface Laptop pretty well.  These are very similar laptops, though Apple has traded some weight and thinness for some processor power. Each has a single USB port, though Microsoft’s port doesn’t need to double as a charging connector or video-out port. But Apple’s choice of USB-C makes it seem like a more forward-thinking design; Microsoft’s single USB–3 connector already seems old school. In the end, it’s clear that with a single refresh–an extra port here, a newer processor family there–the MacBook is more than a match for the Surface Laptop at $1299, unless you believe that most regular users would prefer an extra three-quarters of a pound in exchange for a little more processor power. I don’t, to be honest. The MacBook Pro versus the Surface Laptop Apple The MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar has a couple advantages over the Surface Laptop, but also a higher price.  Around $1499, things get even more interesting. Because Apple chose to brand its 13-inch laptop without a Touch Bar as a part of the MacBook Pro family, it’s easy to forget that it is in many ways also a successor to the MacBook Air. While the MacBook traded weight for processor power, the 13-inch MacBook Pro (without Touch Bar) kept the weight–but kept the processor power, too. Unfortunately, its similarities in terms of specs are a bit lost in the price tag, which is $500 higher than the starting price of the MacBook Air. Still, compare it to the Surface Laptop: With 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, it’s in the ballpark–albeit $200 more expensive than that $1299 Surface Laptop model. The specs are the same, the displays are similar, and the MacBook Pro has two USB-C ports with support for Thunderbolt 3. Apple’s advantages When comparing Macs to PCs it’s easy to lose track of the biggest differentiator–Macs run macOS, and PCs run Windows. The fact is, if you prefer to run Windows, the Surface Laptop appears to be a great piece of hardware to run it on. If you prefer macOS–well, only Apple’s laptops will do that, and that’s part of their appeal. Jorge Arzac/IDG The Surface Laptop comes in four colors: Burgundy, Platinum, Cobalt Blue, and Graphite Gold. It is interesting that the Surface Laptop runs Windows 10 S, a variant of Windows 10 that will only run software that appears in the Windows App Store. One of the great advantages of the PC is that it can run the massive catalog of Windows software that’s out there–but the Surface Laptop won’t do that unless you pay for a full version of Windows 10, at which point Microsoft says your experience may degrade. It’s weird. In the end, though, what does the arrival of the Surface Laptop tell us about the current state of affairs in the world of Mac laptops? Apple’s got two solid answers to the Surface Laptop in the MacBook and the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar–one optimized for size, the other for speed. The MacBook could sure use an update, and it wouldn’t hurt if the MacBook Pro’s starting price got shaved down a little bit. At some point, Apple needs to sell a modern laptop within hailing distance of $1000. But I appreciate Apple’s refusal thus far to sell a $999 starter MacBook with the weak specs of the Surface Laptop–128GB of storage is tight, and 4GB of RAM is not so great either. In the meantime, the MacBook’s positioned quite nicely… it just needs an update. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The 12 Coolest Tech Products You'll Be Itching to Buy in the Next 5 Years We've seen the future, and it's full of personal robots, bionic lenses, and wireless electricity. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) May 11, 2017 at 6:00AM Image source: Getty Images. The next five years will likely prove more technologically transformative than the past five have been. If you're the least bit doubtful about that, consider that Popular Mechanics named Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface tablet -- running Windows 8 -- as one of the top 10 technology breakthroughs of 2012. We can do better -- we must do better.  Technology companies are dreaming up some of the most science fiction-like tech we've ever seen -- from wireless electricity to flying cars -- and we're just a few short years away from getting our hands on most of it. So take a look at these 12 amazing examples of tech wizardry that you'll be able to experience without the need of a time machine.  Image source: Intel.   1. Credit card-sized computers At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) this year, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced a modular computer called the Intel Compute Card that has all the elements of a full computer --- including processors, memory, storage, and wireless capability -- all slimmed down into an interchangeable card. Intel said in a press release, "Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs."  The cards would make it easy to upgrade all sorts of connected technology, from Internet of Things devices to computers. That could soon mean upgrading to the latest computer would be as simple as picking up a new compute card and popping it into your existing device. Image source: Ocumetics. 2. Implantable bionic lenses  Laser eye surgery has come a long way and can give you nearly perfect vision, but a company called Ocumetics is taking sight one step further. The company has created a bionic lens that's placed inside your eye and allows you to see three times better than 20/20 vision.  It sounds a lot like science fiction, but many companies and health researchers are experimenting with implantable technology to help improve everything from eyesight to brain functions. Ocumetics' Bionic Lens has been in development for years, and the company expects to bring it to market -- at a price tag of $3,200 per eye -- in the next two to five years. The company says the surgical procedure is painless and lasts just eight minutes. Image source: Microsoft. 3. Augmented-reality glasses  We're not talking about Google Glass here. The inability of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to get augmented reality (AR) off the the ground hasn't deterred Microsoft and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) from launching their own AR-glasses programs.  Microsoft's HoloLens allows users to view instructions, games, and other 3D holographic objects in front of them and move them around with their hands. The device is available only to developers right now -- at a hefty $5,000 price tag -- but the goal is for all of us to be using similar headsets very soon.  To that end, Facebook is reportedly working on its own AR glasses that will allow its users to interact with the digital world, and each other, in new ways. There's no timetable set for Facebook's AR glasses, but its latest release of AR and virtual-reality features on its flagship app indicate that it's more likely than not you'll be able to get your hands on AR glasses sooner rather than later.  Image source: Getty Images. 4. Roaming house robots This one sounds a tiny bit creepy. But it you want to take your home security system to the next level or want a small helper setting up reminders for you, then a roaming robot might just be for you.   Several of the small bots made their debut at CES this year, including a helper robot called Yumii Cutii that helps elderly people contact their family members and make doctor appointments. Other home-based robots can autonomously roam around the house like a security camera on wheels. Whether you prefer a helper or security bot, you're just a few years away from getting your hands on one.   Image source: LG. 5. Ultra-thin television screens Just as with smartphones, televisions are getting thinner, and over the next five years, you'll be able to buy the thinnest televisions screens you've ever seen. Earlier this year, LG released its ultra-thin W7 TV screen that measures just 2.57 mm thick. That's thinner than your fingertip! The 65-inch OLED display has 4K resolution, weighs just 17 pounds, and did we mention it's thinner than your fingertip? The "W" in the name stands for "wallpaper" and because of its thin design, all of the TV's internal component and HDMI connections are housed inside a sound bar that comes with the television. You can already buy the W7 for a cool $8,000, but you can expect that price to drop significantly over the next five years -- and to expect more companies to release their own versions.  Image source: Ford. 6. Self-driving cars Driverless cars are quickly becoming a reality, and by 2035, there will be nearly 12 million of them on the road, but you probably won't have to wait that long to get your hands on one. Ford is already developing its own autonomous cars and plans to offer them up for sale by 2021. The company recently made a $1 billion investment in an artificial-intelligence company, called Argo AI, that's creating the software for the vehicles. Ford is also boosting its autonomous fleet to 90 vehicles this year.   Ford is hardly the only company betting on driverless cars, of course. Google recently spun out its driverless-car unit into its own company, now called Waymo, that will start offering limited driverless-car services later this year. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has said his cars will be fully autonomous by 2020 as well, and the latest models come with all of the hardware to make them fully self-driving -- though the company hasn't released all the software to make those features functional. Image source: Getty Images. 7. Virtual-reality computers You may not want a virtual-reality (VR) headset yet, but over the next few years, high-end VR headsets are going to transform from the heavy, cumbersome, and wire-tethered devices they are now to standalone systems that run on their own operating system.  Oculus, which is owned by Facebook, is probably the most recognizable name in the VR space now, but Google is working on a new operating system based on Android that will allow VR headsets to work independently from smartphones and computers. In five years, you'll be able to strap on a headset, walk around in your home, and experience videos, games, and content without the need of a computer or smartphone. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes VR will be the next computing platform, so it's possible your computer purchase five years from now could be an all-in-one VR headset. Image source: Energous. 8. Wireless-electricity gadgets Mobile devices are awesome, but their battery power isn't always that great. So why not ditch the batteries and pull electricity out of the air? OK, that' s a bit oversimplified, but Disney Research has developed a room that powers lights and several mobile devices wirelessly by sending electromagnetic currents to them. The research wing of the House of Mouse built a specially designed room with aluminum panels and a copper pole in the middle. And a company called Energous showed off some charging stations earlier this year that will be able to charge mobile devices from up to 15 feet away. The company's WattUp technology sends a beam of electricity to mobile devices using radio frequencies. The company may still be a few years away from making wireless charging a long-distance reality, but in five years' time, you may be able to kiss your phone charger goodbye.   Image source: PowerVision. 9. Underwater drones Flying drones are so 2017. Imagine tossing your drone into the sea or lake and instantly live-steaming what it sees directly to your smartphone. Companies like PowerVision already have a drone for avid fishers, called the PowerRay, that let you know when you've gotten a bite on your fishing line, record the fish trying trying to get away in 4K detail, and snap a high-res image of the underwater fight.  The drone can dive to a depth of 98 feet and run for four hours, and the company envisions cinematographers using the drone for filming. The PowerRay drone starts at $1,488 right now, but in a few years, the price will come down -- it always does -- and you'll see a lot more consumers buying them for pure recreation. If all that weren't enough, the PowerRay can also be purchased with an optional VR headset that gives you a firsthand view of what the drone is seeing and gives the user the ability to control it with just a tilt of the head.  Image source: Uber. 10. Flying cars OK, so maybe you won't be able to actually buy a flying car five years from now, but you may be able pay for a ride in one. Uber recently announced at Uber Elevate its plans to help develop a system of piloted flying cars that people can share, just like its on-demand car rides, by 2022.  And Uber is far from the only company developing flying cars. Israel-based Urban Aeronatics recently introduced its Metro Skyway that's designed to shuttle four people above cityscapes in a hydrogen-powered airborne vehicle. The company's been working on the tech for more than a decade and believes it's five years away from a commercial launch. Some technology still needs to be perfected before flying cars come into their own, and there will probably be plenty of government hurdles but look to the skies in 2022, and you may just see your next ride.  Image source: Ralph Lauren. 11. Smart clothing Smartwatches and fitness bands are already going mainstream. Now, say hello to the next big thing: smart clothing. There are already shirts and bras on the market that track heart rate, activity, calories burned, and so on. Similarly, shoes can track distance covered, cadence, and duration, but you can expect their capabilities to keep expanding.  This tech will probably evolve from a tool for athletes to something we're all wearing to keep track of our health. Nike, Ralph Lauren, and Under Armor are the first movers in this space, but you can expect a lot more options in the coming years. Image source: Amazon.com. 12. Conversational AI-based assistants Artificial intelligence-based assistants already exist with limited capabilities. Siri, Cortana, and Amazon's Alexa can all answer questions, tell us the weather, and even make reservations. Over the next few years, however, voice-based AI assistants will continue to evolve and take over more tasks.  Machine learning and deep-learning AI assistants will become smarter, capable of answering far more questions and performing more complicated tasks. As such, you can expect most of us to have these assistants connected to our homes and acting as our own personal Jarvis.

By John Ribeiro Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 10, 2017 11:49 PM PT Credit: Martyn Williams More like this John McAfee’s new company could spoil the party for Intel’s McAfee spinoff Intel asserts trademark rights against John McAfee McAfee's business takes reputation beating after founder fled police Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key Intel has told a court that MGT Capital Investments has gone ahead with the announcement of the “John McAfee Privacy Phone,” even though the company that proposes to change its name to “John McAfee Global Technologies” has previously said that it did not plan to launch products and services under the McAfee mark. The chipmaker claims it acquired the mark when it bought McAfee Inc. in 2011, and has used and promoted it for security products, services, and publications for consumers and businesses. Security expert John McAfee has stated that he did not sign away rights to his personal name. Intel spun off last month its security business as a separate company, called McAfee, in which it now owns 49 percent of the equity, with the balance owned by investment firm TPG. The federal court had earlier refused John McAfee and MGT Capital a preliminary injunction until the resolution of the dispute on Intel’s transfer of marks and related assets containing the word McAfee as part of the spin-out. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] MGT Capital, which has John McAfee as CEO and executive chairman of the board, has indicated its interest in diversifying into the security market. It announced last month a privacy phone that will be “as hack proof as humanly possible,” with features such as a bank of switches on the back cover that will allow the user to physically disconnect the battery, the antennas for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and geolocation, the camera and microphone, and would also not allow the phone to connect to a Stingray or any other IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) catcher device. The phone will be available in August, MGT said. The company has referred to the phone largely as the Privacy Phone. But in a sentence lower down in the statement on its website it refers to “the John McAfee privacy phone,” which appears to have raised Intel’s concerns about the naming of the phone. John McAfee also referred to “The John McAfee Privacy Phone, by MGT,” in a tweet last month. In a submission to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, lawyers for Intel and McAfee have also objected to MGT asking for the depositions of McAfee’s CEO, Christopher Young, and Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, “even though Plaintiffs can point to no relevant, unique information that these chief executives possess.” The companies have also complained that MGT and John McAfee have not produced required documents for discovery. The plaintiffs, MGT and John McAfee, “have produced almost no documents and are refusing to answer even the most basic interrogatories,” according to a letter to the court, asking for a conference in connection with a motion for a protective order  to prevent the “harassing depositions” of the chief executives and another motion to compel MGT and John McAfee to “complete their document production and provide substantive responses to interrogatories about their name change and planned products and services.” In June last year, Intel sent a letter to MGT warning it of legal action if it changed its name “to one that includes the MCAFEE trademark or otherwise use the MCAFEE name as a trademark.” John McAfee does not have the right to use the McAfee name for security related goods and services, Intel added. John McAfee has said he had entered in 1991 into an agreement with McAfee Associates, a predecessor to McAfee Inc., to transfer certain assets to it in exchange for stock and a promissory note. But the entrepreneur submitted to the court that at no point in the agreement had he assigned the rights to his personal name through an assignment of trademark or otherwise, or agreed to restrict his right to do business using his own name. A recent settlement conference between the two sides failed. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

If you are a subscriber, simply log in or Subscribe now! WASHINGTON (AP) — Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn's firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. × Advertisement Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin's firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing — prompted by Justice Department pressure — came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told The Associated Press in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000 to his firm. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. In Monday's Senate hearing, Yates told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly. Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn's foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defense Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments, though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines, not prosecution. The Defense Department's inspector general is investigating. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told the AP he had not looked into Flynn's foreign agent disclosures but he "would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it's necessary." The panel's senior Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, added that Flynn's "work on behalf of Turkey while a top national security adviser for President Trump's campaign raises grave questions."

The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that Flynn could be targeted for blackmail.

In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin's contention that Flynn didn't carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn's filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ------ Have a tip about this story?

However, because the 2-in-1 tablet is almost two years old by now, there are a number of new devices that can rival its performance. Still sporting a Skylake chip, it can easily be taken to the court by a tablet that has the newest Kaby Lake processor. This is the case for the new HP Elite x2; a contender for the niche that the Surface Pro 4 currently owns. Skylake vs Kaby Lake Perhaps the biggest flaw of the Surface Pro 4 right now is the fact that it still uses the previous generation Intel processor. It has been almost three months since Intel released the Kaby Lake chips for tablets and hybrid devices. However, Microsoft is still taking its sweet time and delaying the release of the Surface Pro 5. On the other hand, for those who cannot wait for Microsoft any longer, the HP Elite x2 sports the latest generation of Intel processors available in the market; the Kaby Lake. This means, performance wise, the HP Elite x2 can outstrip the Surface Pro 4 with a considerable margin between them. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (via microsoftstore.com) Major specs upgrade Just like the Surface Pro 4, users can also choose between an i5 or i7 processor on the HP Elite x2. Furthermore, the HP Elite x2 supports a maximum memory of 16GB and 1TB of flash storage, similar to the Surface Pro 4. However, what the Surface Pro 4 does not have is the Intel HD Graphics 620 support. This part of the Kaby Lake is responsible for much of the native 4K video processing that the chip boasts. While the Microsoft’s tablet boasts a magnesium alloy chassis, the HP version is housed in a sturdy aluminum chassis. On the flip side, the Elite x2 is a tad thinner than the Surface Pro 4 at 0.36 inches thick. The HP Elite x2’s display was also upgraded from the 11.6-inch panel of the previous model to a 12.3-inch LCD display. It has the same resolution of 2,736×1,824 pixels as with the Surface Pro 4. Unfortunately, it is not made from the same PixelSense display as the Microsoft tablet. More juice and extra ports to boot Because the HP hybrid sports an Intel Kaby Lake chip, it means that power efficiency is considerably better than the previous iteration. In fact, HP boasts a 10-hour mixed use battery life on the hybrid tablet. Users get an extra hour when compared with the Surface Pro 4. HP Elite x2 (via hpstore.com) Apart from the impressive battery life, the Elite x2 also comes with a bevy of connectivity standards. To start with, the hybrid tablet has a USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3.0 port; something the Pro 4 users have been asking from Microsoft for a long time. In addition to this, it also has a full-sized USB 3.0 port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, microSD slot, and a SIM card slot. It is quite nice to know that the HP Elite x2, unlike the Surface Pro 4, has an extra connectivity feature apart from the usual Wi-Fi. Finally, the last piece of the puzzle is the Collaboration Keyboard and the Active Pen. The detachable keyboard functions the same way as the Type Keyboard for the Pro 4; the backlit keys have a 1.5mm travel for that solid and comfortable typing feel. Extra features and performance means extra pricey Unfortunately, the HP Elite x2 is a bit pricier than its counterpart. The Pro 4 starts at $899 while the Elite x2 begins at $1,099. However, the one important thing that need to be considered is the fact that the HP Elite x2 will go on sale sometime around July this year. The same cannot be said for the Surface Pro 4.

Mark Cardenas, right, D-Phoenix, speaks on the House floor during debate with Rep. Jeff Weninger, left, R-Chandler, regarding a tax credit bill at the capitol Wednesday, May 10, 2017, in Phoenix. Ross D. Franklin AP Photo Business May 10, 2017 9:05 PM Arizona lawmakers focus on tax breaks near end of session By BOB CHRISTIE and CLARICE SILBER Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story PHOENIX After approving a small teacher pay raise when they passed a $9.8 billion state budget package last week, the Arizona Legislature's 2017 session raced toward its conclusion Wednesday with Republican lawmakers focused on giving tax breaks to corporate interests to drive economic development in the state. The House joined the Senate in approving a new $10 million "angel investor" tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses and approved another measure that expands eligibility for a state job training fund to smaller businesses. Opposition to another economic development proposal designed to benefit big manufacturers like chip-maker Intel evaporated Wednesday after the sponsor narrowed an amendment that would have extended its scope. The House approved the measure and sent it to the Senate The measure by Rep. Jeff Weninger would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. Senate Bill 1416 also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. Weninger tried to amend the bill Tuesday to increase the amount of sales tax revenues normally sent to the state that cities could use to expand roads and other support facilities. Intel announced in February that it would finally complete a multi-billion dollar computer chip plant in Chandler that was build several years ago but never used. He narrowed that Wednesday and the bill passed on a 32-21 vote, with almost no Democratic support. It now awaits a final Senate vote. Also slipped into that measure is a tax break pushed by corporate jet seller NetJets exempting it from sales taxes. Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed the measure by Republican Rep. Jill Norgaard last month, but she revived it Wednesday. Norgaard called the measure a good part of the commerce package but said Ducey didn't assure he would sign it. However, its inclusion in the Intel bill that he and Republican legislative leaders back makes another veto unlikely. Democrats mainly opposed the tax breaks, saying the state has given away billions of dollars to special interests while the Republican majority begs poverty when it comes to social services and public schools "At the end of the day there will always be the excuse that we just don't have the revenue to provide for the developmentally disabled, we just don't have the revenue to provide for public schools," minority leader Rebecca Rios said. "And this is why." One Democrat backed the measure, Rep. Cesar Chavez of Phoenix. "Not only will SB1416 provide high-paying jobs to thousands of Arizonans, but it will catapult economic development in the right direction," Chavez of Glendale said. Left in the dust was a major rural development tax credit bill that was the subject of furious debate when Republican House members met Wednesday morning. Many rural Republicans urged backing for Senate Bill 1212, which would allow out-of-state companies that generate $50 million in rural investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell to generate cash to repay investors. Many Republicans also oppose the measure, which they say would create a program with little oversight and only a vague promise of benefits. Republican House Speaker J.D. Mesnard decided to withdraw a proposal he rolled out last-minute Tuesday that would have required school districts to spend half of their yearly inflation increases on teacher raises. The proposal, an amendment to an unrelated education bill, would have required school districts to spend about $38 million a year on raises for their teachers. The state budget passed last week gave teachers a 1 percent raise at the cost of $34 million. The House speaker said he wanted to focus on the issue and will continue to do so. In the Senate, the most contentious remaining issue was a restoration of a welfare cut Ducey made in his first year in office. The Republican governor pushed through a measure in 2015 that limited lifetime welfare payments to one year, the shortest in the nation. He has proposed a restoration with strings attached that has drawn opposition from minority Democrats. The strings include work or job training requirements for adults and that they ensure their children are regularly attending school. It also reduces or eliminates payments if the person is caught with a controlled substance or quits a job. As part of Ducey's plan to help drug offenders re-enter society, his proposal would allow people convicted of a drug offence to get food stamps and it waives licensing fees for those people. The Senate approved the repeal of a requirement that welfare recipients be fingerprinted in order to qualify for benefits. Lawmakers were pushing to adjourn Wednesday by nightfall, although that might be optimistic. Arizona state House Speaker J.D.

Franklin) PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona lawmakers completed their 2017 session Wednesday night by approving last-minute tax breaks for corporations and corporate jet buyers and only partially restoring welfare benefits to thousands of recipients who had lost them under a 2015 law pushed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. The tax breaks came despite criticism from minority Democrats who said there's no evidence similar cuts have boosted the economy and complained Republicans granted teachers just a small pay boost when they enacted a $9.8 billion budget last week. The Legislature approved a new $10 million "angel investor" tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses and approved another measure that expands eligibility for a state job training fund to smaller businesses. Opposition to another economic development proposal designed to benefit big manufacturers such as computer chip-maker Intel evaporated Wednesday after the sponsor narrowed an amendment that would have extended its scope.

"And this is why." One House Democrat backed the measure, Rep. Cesar Chavez of Phoenix. "Not only will SB1416 provide high-paying jobs to thousands of Arizonans, but it will catapult economic development in the right direction," Chavez said. Senate President Steve Yarbrough praised the bill, which will benefit Intel's operations in his hometown of Chandler. "We authorized a manufacturer to take the (sales tax) from their own facility, their own property where they are building in this case an enormous investment, and use that money to benefit the citizens of the community, whether it be roads or sewers or lights," Yarbrough said. "We think that's a wise investment." The Legislature adjourned for the year at an unusually early time: 7 p.m. Typically, the final day goes into the wee hours and has often extended until dawn. Left in the dust was a major rural development tax credit bill that was the subject of furious debate when Republican House members met Wednesday morning.

The session ended Wednesday after Republican lawmakers focused on giving tax breaks to corporate interests to drive economic development in the state. The Legislature passed a series of business tax breaks. One helps chip-maker Intel and other big manufacturers. Another creates a $10 million tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses, while a third expands eligibility for a state job training fund to smaller businesses. Another bill restores a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. Wednesday's action comes nearly a week after lawmakers passed a $9.8 billion budget. ___ 6:50 p.m. The Arizona Senate has approved what President Steve Yarbrough says is its last bill of the 2017 session. The Senate approved its most contentious remaining issue on a 17-12 vote. That measure would restore a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. The Republican governor pushed through a measure in 2015 that limited lifetime welfare payments to one year, the shortest in the nation. The chamber joined the House in voting to extend a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. Lawmakers voted 21-8 on the measure that also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. ___ 5:41 p.m. The Arizona House has approved what Speaker J.D. Mesnard says is its last bill of the 2017 session. Wednesday's 32-21 vote extends a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. It now goes to the Senate for a final vote. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 4:45 p.m. A bill that Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed has been revived on the last day of the legislative session. Ducey vetoed the sales tax exemption for people who buy partial ownership interests in corporate jets last month. The tax cut was backed by NetJets, a company owned by billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Lobbyists for NetJets testified that state sales taxes are forcing Arizona buyers to finalize deals in other states. Republican Rep. Jill Norgaard of Phoenix inserted the same language in a bill extending a research and development tax credit program and giving a big tax break to chip-maker Intel on Wednesday. Ducey said in a veto letter that the tax cut would likely have state budget implications and should have been part of discussions on spending and revenue priorities. Norgaard said the governor has not said if he supports her effort to revive the bill, but the bill helping Intel has broad support from top Legislative leaders. ___ 4:10 p.m. The House has given initial approval to a measure that would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. The House gave initial approval to Weninger's bill Wednesday and it awaits a formal vote. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 3:15 p.m. Republican House Speaker J.D. Mesnard has withdrawn his last-minute proposal requiring school districts to spend half of their yearly inflation increases on teacher raises. The amendment to an unrelated education bill would have required school districts to spend about $38 million a year on raises for their teachers. Mesnard says he wanted to focus on the issue and will continue to do so. The state budget passed last week gave teachers a 1 percent raise at a cost of $34 million. The Arizona School Boards Association quickly came out in opposition of the proposal. The group said the requirement directly violates a voter-approved law requiring the Legislature to provide yearly inflation increases and last year's Proposition 123, which added about $350 million in new funding for schools each year. ___ 1:46 p.m. The House has joined the Senate in voting to provide lawsuit protections for people who break into cars to rescue children or pets. The House approved House Bill 2494 by Republican Sen. John Kavanagh on a 35-20 vote Wednesday. Kavanagh revived it after it failed to get a House committee hearing. The Senate approved it for a second time on a 20-7 vote in April. The vote sends the measure to Gov. Doug Ducey's desk for consideration. Ducey mentioned the proposal in January's state of the state address and said he will sign the bill if it hits his desk. Republican Rep. Eddie Farnsworth said the bill is unneeded because of good Samaritan laws already in place and it wrongly raises animals to the level and rights of children. ___ 12:45 p.m. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has signed a bill that increases the personal income tax exemption and requires it to be adjusted annually for inflation. Ducey called for indexing the annual exemption to create a small tax cut in his state of the state address at a yearly cost of $2.8 million. But during budget negotiations, some House Republicans pushed for an increase in the personal exemption from $2,100 to $2,200 over two years. That adds nearly $11 million to the cost and saves the average taxpayer less than $5. The bill Ducey signed Wednesday also eliminates several tax credits that haven't been used in recent years. Ducey also signed legislation allowing unused parts of the state mental hospital in Phoenix to be leased to private operators. A proposal urging a reduction of the state transportation fleet was also signed. ___ 11:30 a.m. House Republicans are sharply divided on a proposal that creates a new tax credit plan for investments in rural businesses. Senate Bill 1212 would allow out-of-state companies who generate $50 million in investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell to generate cash to repay investors. House Republicans meeting Wednesday were split, with many rural members pleading for a vote on the plan and other members strongly opposed. Republican Speaker J.D. Mesnard says he hasn't decided whether to put the bill up for a vote on the final day of the 2017 legislative session. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club opposes the bill by Rep. T.J. Shope, saying the state should avoid adopting a complex tax credit scheme that lets the funding company profit for questionable results. ___ 11 a.m. The Arizona Senate has approved the repeal of a requirement that welfare recipients be fingerprinted in order to qualify for benefits. Wednesday's 20-9 vote was among the first of the expected final day of the 2017 legislative session. Just 7 of 1.1 million welfare recipients were found to have inappropriately applied for benefits in 2015. The state is expected to save more than $390,000 by stopping fingerprinting. The Senate also passed bills legalizing hemp farming and waiving taxes on the sale of U.S. gold coins. it also approved a bill increasing eligibility for a job-creation fund to very small businesses. ___ 3 a.m. The Arizona Legislature's 2017 session is expected to come to an end after the passage of bill requiring cities and counties to put sales tax increase measures before voters only during November general elections. The passage Tuesday evening broke a logjam that had threatened to extend the session into next week. With the deal, it's likely to end sometime Wednesday. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard had insisted that the Senate pass the bill before adjourning because it was part of a budget deal. Republican Sen. Kate Brophy McGee opposed the measure but finally agreed to back it after getting small concessions from Republican legislative leaders. Remaining issues include the partial restoration of a cut to welfare Gov. Doug Ducey pushed through in 2015 and a series of business tax breaks. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Michael Flynn, shown here in a February file photo, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totalling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client.  (STEPHEN CROWLEY / The New York times file photo)   By Stephen Braun And Chad DayThe Associated Press Wed., May 10, 2017 WASHINGTON—Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, U.S. President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totalling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for interests outside the United States. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump Article Continued Below The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. Just six days into his presidency, Donald Trump was informed his national security adviser had misled his vice-president about contacts with Russia. Michael Flynn resigned as Trump's National Security Adviser on February 13. (The Associated Press ) In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a “story to tell,” but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without “assurances against unfair prosecution.” Other congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm’s Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn’s misstatements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that Flynn could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant-general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin’s firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing, prompted by Justice Department pressure, came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice-President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin’s company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told the AP in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn’s firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn’t see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000. But Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law “says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material,” said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn’s foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin’s lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin’s company, Inovo BV.

He did it anyway In the filing, Flynn’s firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a “consultancy fee” came from the firm’s accounting records. Similar “consultancy fee” entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin’s statements and the filing, Kelner said: “We’ll stick with what’s in the filing.” Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel’s description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel’s work last year centred on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year’s attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn’s foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin’s contention that Flynn didn’t carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official.

Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) Published May 10. 2017 9:36PM  By STEPHEN BRAUN and CHAD DAY, Associated Press WASHINGTON — Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn's firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for interests outside the United States. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. Congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. On Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that Flynn could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin's firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing, prompted by Justice Department pressure, came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told the AP in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin's contention that Flynn didn't carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn's filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official.     Previous Article Next Article Loading comment count...

The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail.

In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. In Monday's Senate hearing, Yates told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly. Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn's foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defence Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments, though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines, not prosecution. The Defence Department's inspector general is investigating. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told the AP he had not looked into Flynn's foreign agent disclosures but he "would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it's necessary." The panel's senior Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, added that Flynn's "work on behalf of Turkey while a top national security adviser for President Trump's campaign raises grave questions." Flynn Intel's work last year centred on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. The Obama administration rebuffed Turkey's extradition requests. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will change that stance, though U.S.-Turkish relations have warmed under Trump, who congratulated Erdogan after a recent referendum expanded his presidential powers. International monitors called the referendum an undemocratic power grab. Alptekin said he disagrees with Flynn Intel's decision to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent because he says the work wasn't orchestrated by the Turkish government and he doesn't have any ties to Erdogan's administration. But Alptekin serves on an economic committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In its Justice Department filing, Flynn Intel also disclosed that Alptekin had consulted with Turkish government officials about the Gulen-related work. Flynn and Alptekin have yet to provide full and consistent explanations. Alptekin initially said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin also told the AP that his firm and Flynn Intel had agreed verbally in August to divide monthly $200,000 installments for lobbying, public relations, research and other work. That arrangement specified Flynn's firm would be paid $40,000 a month for lobbying and $15,000 a month for public relations, Alptekin said. Alptekin justified the two $40,000 payments— one in September and the other in October— as refunds, saying he saw no evidence that Flynn Intel performed any lobbying. But Flynn's firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, midway through the contract. And Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed in their paperwork with the Justice Department that it had lobbied a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ___ Have a tip about this story?

Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn’s foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin’s lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin’s company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn’s firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a “consultancy fee” came from the firm’s accounting records. Similar “consultancy fee” entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin’s statements and the filing, Kelner said: “We’ll stick with what’s in the filing.” Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel’s description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel’s work last year centred on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year’s attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn’s foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin’s contention that Flynn didn’t carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ___ Have a tip about this story?

Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON — Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a “story to tell,” but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without “assurances against unfair prosecution.” Other congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm’s Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn’s misstatements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin’s firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing — prompted by Justice Department pressure — came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin’s company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told The Associated Press in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn’s firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn’t see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000 to his firm. But Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law “says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material,” said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn’s foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin’s lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin’s company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn’s firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a “consultancy fee” came from the firm’s accounting records. Similar “consultancy fee” entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin’s statements and the filing, Kelner, said: “We’ll stick with what’s in the filing.” Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel’s description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. In Monday’s Senate hearing, Yates told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly. Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn’s foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defense Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments, though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines, not prosecution. The Defense Department’s inspector general is investigating. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told the AP he had not looked into Flynn’s foreign agent disclosures but he “would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it’s necessary.” The panel’s senior Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, added that Flynn’s “work on behalf of Turkey while a top national security adviser for President Trump’s campaign raises grave questions.” Flynn Intel’s work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year’s attempted coup against him. The Obama administration rebuffed Turkey’s extradition requests. It’s unclear whether the Trump administration will change that stance, though U.S.-Turkish relations have warmed under Trump, who congratulated Erdogan after a recent referendum expanded his presidential powers. International monitors called the referendum an undemocratic power grab. Alptekin said he disagrees with Flynn Intel’s decision to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent because he says the work wasn’t orchestrated by the Turkish government and he doesn’t have any ties to Erdogan’s administration. But Alptekin serves on an economic committee overseen by Turkey’s finance ministry. In its Justice Department filing, Flynn Intel also disclosed that Alptekin had consulted with Turkish government officials about the Gulen-related work. Flynn and Alptekin have yet to provide full and consistent explanations. Alptekin initially said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn’s foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin also told the AP that his firm and Flynn Intel had agreed verbally in August to divide monthly $200,000 installments for lobbying, public relations, research and other work. That arrangement specified Flynn’s firm would be paid $40,000 a month for lobbying and $15,000 a month for public relations, Alptekin said. Alptekin justified the two $40,000 payments— one in September and the other in October— as refunds, saying he saw no evidence that Flynn Intel performed any lobbying. But Flynn’s firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, midway through the contract. And Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed in their paperwork with the Justice Department that it had lobbied a House committee and an Arkansas state official.

By STEPHEN BRAUN and CHAD DAYAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article WASHINGTON — Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for interests outside the United States.

The session ended Wednesday after Republican lawmakers focused on giving tax breaks to corporate interests to drive economic development in the state. The Legislature passed a series of business tax breaks. One helps chip-maker Intel and other big manufacturers. Another creates a $10 million tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses, while a third expands eligibility for a state job training fund to smaller businesses. Another bill restores a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. Wednesday's action comes nearly a week after lawmakers passed a $9.8 billion budget. ___ 6:50 p.m. The Arizona Senate has approved what President Steve Yarbrough says is its last bill of the 2017 session. The Senate approved its most contentious remaining issue on a 17-12 vote. That measure would restore a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. The Republican governor pushed through a measure in 2015 that limited lifetime welfare payments to one year, the shortest in the nation. The chamber joined the House in voting to extend a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. Lawmakers voted 21-8 on the measure that also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. ___ 5:41 p.m. The Arizona House has approved what Speaker J.D. Mesnard says is its last bill of the 2017 session. Wednesday's 32-21 vote extends a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. It now goes to the Senate for a final vote. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 4:45 p.m. A bill that Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed has been revived on the last day of the legislative session. Ducey vetoed the sales tax exemption for people who buy partial ownership interests in corporate jets last month. The tax cut was backed by NetJets, a company owned by billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Lobbyists for NetJets testified that state sales taxes are forcing Arizona buyers to finalize deals in other states. Republican Rep. Jill Norgaard of Phoenix inserted the same language in a bill extending a research and development tax credit program and giving a big tax break to chip-maker Intel on Wednesday. Ducey said in a veto letter that the tax cut would likely have state budget implications and should have been part of discussions on spending and revenue priorities. Norgaard said the governor has not said if he supports her effort to revive the bill, but the bill helping Intel has broad support from top Legislative leaders. ___ 4:10 p.m. The House has given initial approval to a measure that would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. The House gave initial approval to Weninger's bill Wednesday and it awaits a formal vote. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 3:15 p.m. Republican House Speaker J.D. Mesnard has withdrawn his last-minute proposal requiring school districts to spend half of their yearly inflation increases on teacher raises. The amendment to an unrelated education bill would have required school districts to spend about $38 million a year on raises for their teachers. Mesnard says he wanted to focus on the issue and will continue to do so. The state budget passed last week gave teachers a 1 percent raise at a cost of $34 million. The Arizona School Boards Association quickly came out in opposition of the proposal. The group said the requirement directly violates a voter-approved law requiring the Legislature to provide yearly inflation increases and last year's Proposition 123, which added about $350 million in new funding for schools each year. ___ 1:46 p.m. The House has joined the Senate in voting to provide lawsuit protections for people who break into cars to rescue children or pets. The House approved House Bill 2494 by Republican Sen. John Kavanagh on a 35-20 vote Wednesday. Kavanagh revived it after it failed to get a House committee hearing. The Senate approved it for a second time on a 20-7 vote in April. The vote sends the measure to Gov. Doug Ducey's desk for consideration. Ducey mentioned the proposal in January's state of the state address and said he will sign the bill if it hits his desk. Republican Rep. Eddie Farnsworth said the bill is unneeded because of good Samaritan laws already in place and it wrongly raises animals to the level and rights of children. ___ 12:45 p.m. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has signed a bill that increases the personal income tax exemption and requires it to be adjusted annually for inflation. Ducey called for indexing the annual exemption to create a small tax cut in his state of the state address at a yearly cost of $2.8 million. But during budget negotiations, some House Republicans pushed for an increase in the personal exemption from $2,100 to $2,200 over two years. That adds nearly $11 million to the cost and saves the average taxpayer less than $5. The bill Ducey signed Wednesday also eliminates several tax credits that haven't been used in recent years. Ducey also signed legislation allowing unused parts of the state mental hospital in Phoenix to be leased to private operators. A proposal urging a reduction of the state transportation fleet was also signed. ___ 11:30 a.m. House Republicans are sharply divided on a proposal that creates a new tax credit plan for investments in rural businesses. Senate Bill 1212 would allow out-of-state companies who generate $50 million in investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell to generate cash to repay investors. House Republicans meeting Wednesday were split, with many rural members pleading for a vote on the plan and other members strongly opposed. Republican Speaker J.D. Mesnard says he hasn't decided whether to put the bill up for a vote on the final day of the 2017 legislative session. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club opposes the bill by Rep. T.J. Shope, saying the state should avoid adopting a complex tax credit scheme that lets the funding company profit for questionable results. ___ 11 a.m. The Arizona Senate has approved the repeal of a requirement that welfare recipients be fingerprinted in order to qualify for benefits. Wednesday's 20-9 vote was among the first of the expected final day of the 2017 legislative session. Just 7 of 1.1 million welfare recipients were found to have inappropriately applied for benefits in 2015. The state is expected to save more than $390,000 by stopping fingerprinting. The Senate also passed bills legalizing hemp farming and waiving taxes on the sale of U.S. gold coins. it also approved a bill increasing eligibility for a job-creation fund to very small businesses. ___ 3 a.m. The Arizona Legislature's 2017 session is expected to come to an end after the passage of bill requiring cities and counties to put sales tax increase measures before voters only during November general elections. The passage Tuesday evening broke a logjam that had threatened to extend the session into next week. With the deal, it's likely to end sometime Wednesday. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard had insisted that the Senate pass the bill before adjourning because it was part of a budget deal. Republican Sen. Kate Brophy McGee opposed the measure but finally agreed to back it after getting small concessions from Republican legislative leaders.

AP Exclusive: More inconsistencies in Flynn consulting work Associated Press | WASHINGTON (AP) — Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn's firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin's firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing — prompted by Justice Department pressure — came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told The Associated Press in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000 to his firm. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Kelner, said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. In Monday's Senate hearing, Yates told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly. Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn's foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defense Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments, though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines, not prosecution. The Defense Department's inspector general is investigating. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told the AP he had not looked into Flynn's foreign agent disclosures but he "would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it's necessary." The panel's senior Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, added that Flynn's "work on behalf of Turkey while a top national security adviser for President Trump's campaign raises grave questions." Flynn Intel's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. The Obama administration rebuffed Turkey's extradition requests. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will change that stance, though U.S.-Turkish relations have warmed under Trump, who congratulated Erdogan after a recent referendum expanded his presidential powers. International monitors called the referendum an undemocratic power grab. Alptekin said he disagrees with Flynn Intel's decision to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent because he says the work wasn't orchestrated by the Turkish government and he doesn't have any ties to Erdogan's administration. But Alptekin serves on an economic committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In its Justice Department filing, Flynn Intel also disclosed that Alptekin had consulted with Turkish government officials about the Gulen-related work. Flynn and Alptekin have yet to provide full and consistent explanations. Alptekin initially said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin also told the AP that his firm and Flynn Intel had agreed verbally in August to divide monthly $200,000 installments for lobbying, public relations, research and other work. That arrangement specified Flynn's firm would be paid $40,000 a month for lobbying and $15,000 a month for public relations, Alptekin said. Alptekin justified the two $40,000 payments— one in September and the other in October— as refunds, saying he saw no evidence that Flynn Intel performed any lobbying. But Flynn's firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, midway through the contract. And Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed in their paperwork with the Justice Department that it had lobbied a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ___ Have a tip about this story?

The session ended Wednesday after Republican lawmakers focused on giving tax breaks to corporate interests to drive economic development in the state. The Legislature passed a series of business tax breaks. One helps chip-maker Intel and other big manufacturers. Another creates a $10 million tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses, while a third expands eligibility for a state job training fund to smaller businesses. Another bill restores a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. Wednesday's action comes nearly a week after lawmakers passed a $9.8 billion budget. ___ 6:50 p.m. The Arizona Senate has approved what President Steve Yarbrough says is its last bill of the 2017 session. The Senate approved its most contentious remaining issue on a 17-12 vote. That measure would restore a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. The Republican governor pushed through a measure in 2015 that limited lifetime welfare payments to one year, the shortest in the nation. The chamber joined the House in voting to extend a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. Lawmakers voted 21-8 on the measure that also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. ___ 5:41 p.m. The Arizona House has approved what Speaker J.D. Mesnard says is its last bill of the 2017 session. Wednesday's 32-21 vote extends a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. It now goes to the Senate for a final vote. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 4:45 p.m. A bill that Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed has been revived on the last day of the legislative session. Ducey vetoed the sales tax exemption for people who buy partial ownership interests in corporate jets last month. The tax cut was backed by NetJets, a company owned by billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Lobbyists for NetJets testified that state sales taxes are forcing Arizona buyers to finalize deals in other states. Republican Rep. Jill Norgaard of Phoenix inserted the same language in a bill extending a research and development tax credit program and giving a big tax break to chip-maker Intel on Wednesday. Ducey said in a veto letter that the tax cut would likely have state budget implications and should have been part of discussions on spending and revenue priorities. Norgaard said the governor has not said if he supports her effort to revive the bill, but the bill helping Intel has broad support from top Legislative leaders. ___ 4:10 p.m. The House has given initial approval to a measure that would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. The House gave initial approval to Weninger's bill Wednesday and it awaits a formal vote. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 3:15 p.m. Republican House Speaker J.D. Mesnard has withdrawn his last-minute proposal requiring school districts to spend half of their yearly inflation increases on teacher raises. The amendment to an unrelated education bill would have required school districts to spend about $38 million a year on raises for their teachers. Mesnard says he wanted to focus on the issue and will continue to do so. The state budget passed last week gave teachers a 1 percent raise at a cost of $34 million. The Arizona School Boards Association quickly came out in opposition of the proposal. The group said the requirement directly violates a voter-approved law requiring the Legislature to provide yearly inflation increases and last year's Proposition 123, which added about $350 million in new funding for schools each year. ___ 1:46 p.m. The House has joined the Senate in voting to provide lawsuit protections for people who break into cars to rescue children or pets. The House approved House Bill 2494 by Republican Sen. John Kavanagh on a 35-20 vote Wednesday. Kavanagh revived it after it failed to get a House committee hearing. The Senate approved it for a second time on a 20-7 vote in April. The vote sends the measure to Gov. Doug Ducey's desk for consideration. Ducey mentioned the proposal in January's state of the state address and said he will sign the bill if it hits his desk. Republican Rep. Eddie Farnsworth said the bill is unneeded because of good Samaritan laws already in place and it wrongly raises animals to the level and rights of children. ___ Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. 12:45 p.m. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has signed a bill that increases the personal income tax exemption and requires it to be adjusted annually for inflation. Ducey called for indexing the annual exemption to create a small tax cut in his state of the state address at a yearly cost of $2.8 million. But during budget negotiations, some House Republicans pushed for an increase in the personal exemption from $2,100 to $2,200 over two years. That adds nearly $11 million to the cost and saves the average taxpayer less than $5. The bill Ducey signed Wednesday also eliminates several tax credits that haven't been used in recent years. Ducey also signed legislation allowing unused parts of the state mental hospital in Phoenix to be leased to private operators. A proposal urging a reduction of the state transportation fleet was also signed. ___ 11:30 a.m. House Republicans are sharply divided on a proposal that creates a new tax credit plan for investments in rural businesses. Senate Bill 1212 would allow out-of-state companies who generate $50 million in investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell to generate cash to repay investors. House Republicans meeting Wednesday were split, with many rural members pleading for a vote on the plan and other members strongly opposed. Republican Speaker J.D. Mesnard says he hasn't decided whether to put the bill up for a vote on the final day of the 2017 legislative session. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club opposes the bill by Rep. T.J. Shope, saying the state should avoid adopting a complex tax credit scheme that lets the funding company profit for questionable results. ___ 11 a.m. The Arizona Senate has approved the repeal of a requirement that welfare recipients be fingerprinted in order to qualify for benefits. Wednesday's 20-9 vote was among the first of the expected final day of the 2017 legislative session. Just 7 of 1.1 million welfare recipients were found to have inappropriately applied for benefits in 2015. The state is expected to save more than $390,000 by stopping fingerprinting. The Senate also passed bills legalizing hemp farming and waiving taxes on the sale of U.S. gold coins. it also approved a bill increasing eligibility for a job-creation fund to very small businesses. ___ 3 a.m. The Arizona Legislature's 2017 session is expected to come to an end after the passage of bill requiring cities and counties to put sales tax increase measures before voters only during November general elections. The passage Tuesday evening broke a logjam that had threatened to extend the session into next week. With the deal, it's likely to end sometime Wednesday. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard had insisted that the Senate pass the bill before adjourning because it was part of a budget deal. Republican Sen. Kate Brophy McGee opposed the measure but finally agreed to back it after getting small concessions from Republican legislative leaders.

Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman, and Sen. Mark Warner, the committee's Democratic vice chairman, issued a joint statement Wednesday saying the panel decided to issue the subpoena after Flynn, through his lawyer, declined to cooperate with an April 28 request to turn over the documents. Flynn and other associates of President Donald Trump have received similar requests from the committee for information and documents over the past few weeks. Copies of request letters sent to longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page were shared with The Associated Press. Those letters, which were nearly identical, sought emails, text messages, letters, phone records or any other relevant information they have about meetings or contacts that they or any other individual affiliated with the Trump campaign had with Russian officials or representatives of Russian business interests. They also ask for information about any financial or real estate holdings related to Russia, including any since divested or sold. Stone, Page, Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort all received similar requests for information, a person familiar with the Senate investigation said. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the details of the committee's investigation. The requests sent to Stone and Page covered documents and information from June 2015 through Jan. 20 of this year. During that period, Flynn accepted tens of thousands of dollars from a Russian state-sponsored television network. He later worked as a foreign agent on behalf of a Turkish businessman, while serving as a top Trump campaign adviser. It also covers the postelection time period in which Trump and his transition team decided to appoint Flynn as national security adviser. Stone said Thursday that he will "fully comply" with the Senate intelligence committee's request for information and documents relating to its Russia investigation. Stone told NBC's "Today" he wants to testify, since members of congressional panels involved in the Russia probe "have disparaged me publicly." • Last month: Pentagon probes former Trump aide Flynn's foreign payments Flynn was fired by Trump after less than one month on the job. The White House said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials about his communications during the presidential transition with Russia's ambassador to the United States. The subpoena comes as both the Senate committee and its counterpart in the House are investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump associates colluded with those attempts to sway the election. Flynn's Russia ties are also being scrutinized by the FBI as it conducts a similar investigation. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena or say why Flynn declined to provide the information earlier. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are also separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. The top Democrat and Republican on a House oversight committee have said Flynn likely broke federal law by failing to get approval from the U.S. government to accept foreign payments and not disclosing them after accepting them. Among the payments they cited were more than $33,000 from RT, a Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda front for Russia's government. The network paid Flynn for attending a December 2015 gala in Moscow during which Flynn was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Turkish payments under scrutiny are part of $530,000 worth of lobbying and investigative work that Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, performed for a Turkish businessman. In March, Flynn and his firm belatedly registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for the work, acknowledging it could have benefited the Turkish government. On Wednesday, the AP reported that Flynn is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn's firm sent back last year to the client. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told the AP that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries.

The session ended Wednesday after Republican lawmakers focused on giving tax breaks to corporate interests to drive economic development in the state. The Legislature passed a series of business tax breaks. One helps chip-maker Intel and other big manufacturers. Another creates a $10 million tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses, while a third expands eligibility for a state job training fund to smaller businesses. Another bill restores a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. Wednesday's action comes nearly a week after lawmakers passed a $9.8 billion budget. ___ 6:50 p.m. The Arizona Senate has approved what President Steve Yarbrough says is its last bill of the 2017 session. The Senate approved its most contentious remaining issue on a 17-12 vote. That measure would restore a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. The Republican governor pushed through a measure in 2015 that limited lifetime welfare payments to one year, the shortest in the nation. The chamber joined the House in voting to extend a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. Lawmakers voted 21-8 on the measure that also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. ___ 5:41 p.m. The Arizona House has approved what Speaker J.D. Mesnard says is its last bill of the 2017 session. Wednesday's 32-21 vote extends a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. It now goes to the Senate for a final vote. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 4:45 p.m. A bill that Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed has been revived on the last day of the legislative session. Ducey vetoed the sales tax exemption for people who buy partial ownership interests in corporate jets last month. The tax cut was backed by NetJets, a company owned by billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Lobbyists for NetJets testified that state sales taxes are forcing Arizona buyers to finalize deals in other states. Republican Rep. Jill Norgaard of Phoenix inserted the same language in a bill extending a research and development tax credit program and giving a big tax break to chip-maker Intel on Wednesday. Ducey said in a veto letter that the tax cut would likely have state budget implications and should have been part of discussions on spending and revenue priorities. Norgaard said the governor has not said if he supports her effort to revive the bill, but the bill helping Intel has broad support from top Legislative leaders. ___ 4:10 p.m. The House has given initial approval to a measure that would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. The House gave initial approval to Weninger's bill Wednesday and it awaits a formal vote. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 3:15 p.m. Republican House Speaker J.D. Mesnard has withdrawn his last-minute proposal requiring school districts to spend half of their yearly inflation increases on teacher raises. The amendment to an unrelated education bill would have required school districts to spend about $38 million a year on raises for their teachers. Mesnard says he wanted to focus on the issue and will continue to do so. The state budget passed last week gave teachers a 1 percent raise at a cost of $34 million. The Arizona School Boards Association quickly came out in opposition of the proposal. The group said the requirement directly violates a voter-approved law requiring the Legislature to provide yearly inflation increases and last year's Proposition 123, which added about $350 million in new funding for schools each year. ___ 1:46 p.m. The House has joined the Senate in voting to provide lawsuit protections for people who break into cars to rescue children or pets. The House approved House Bill 2494 by Republican Sen. John Kavanagh on a 35-20 vote Wednesday. Kavanagh revived it after it failed to get a House committee hearing. The Senate approved it for a second time on a 20-7 vote in April. The vote sends the measure to Gov. Doug Ducey's desk for consideration. Ducey mentioned the proposal in January's state of the state address and said he will sign the bill if it hits his desk. Republican Rep. Eddie Farnsworth said the bill is unneeded because of good Samaritan laws already in place and it wrongly raises animals to the level and rights of children. ___ 12:45 p.m. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has signed a bill that increases the personal income tax exemption and requires it to be adjusted annually for inflation. Ducey called for indexing the annual exemption to create a small tax cut in his state of the state address at a yearly cost of $2.8 million. But during budget negotiations, some House Republicans pushed for an increase in the personal exemption from $2,100 to $2,200 over two years. That adds nearly $11 million to the cost and saves the average taxpayer less than $5. The bill Ducey signed Wednesday also eliminates several tax credits that haven't been used in recent years. Ducey also signed legislation allowing unused parts of the state mental hospital in Phoenix to be leased to private operators. A proposal urging a reduction of the state transportation fleet was also signed. ___ 11:30 a.m. House Republicans are sharply divided on a proposal that creates a new tax credit plan for investments in rural businesses. Senate Bill 1212 would allow out-of-state companies who generate $50 million in investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell to generate cash to repay investors. House Republicans meeting Wednesday were split, with many rural members pleading for a vote on the plan and other members strongly opposed. Republican Speaker J.D. Mesnard says he hasn't decided whether to put the bill up for a vote on the final day of the 2017 legislative session. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club opposes the bill by Rep. T.J. Shope, saying the state should avoid adopting a complex tax credit scheme that lets the funding company profit for questionable results. ___ 11 a.m. The Arizona Senate has approved the repeal of a requirement that welfare recipients be fingerprinted in order to qualify for benefits. Wednesday's 20-9 vote was among the first of the expected final day of the 2017 legislative session. Just 7 of 1.1 million welfare recipients were found to have inappropriately applied for benefits in 2015. The state is expected to save more than $390,000 by stopping fingerprinting. The Senate also passed bills legalizing hemp farming and waiving taxes on the sale of U.S. gold coins. it also approved a bill increasing eligibility for a job-creation fund to very small businesses. ___ 3 a.m. The Arizona Legislature's 2017 session is expected to come to an end after the passage of bill requiring cities and counties to put sales tax increase measures before voters only during November general elections. The passage Tuesday evening broke a logjam that had threatened to extend the session into next week. With the deal, it's likely to end sometime Wednesday. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard had insisted that the Senate pass the bill before adjourning because it was part of a budget deal. Republican Sen. Kate Brophy McGee opposed the measure but finally agreed to back it after getting small concessions from Republican legislative leaders. Remaining issues include the partial restoration of a cut to welfare Gov. Doug Ducey pushed through in 2015 and a series of business tax breaks. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 11, 2017 12:32 PM PT Credit: Stephen Lawson More like this Intel ships latest Itanium chip called Kittson, but grim future looms HP plans to continue with Itanium in servers for HP-UX customers HPE's Itanium server refresh should come in mid-2017 Video Need a data center location? Iceland wants you Hewlett Packard Enterprises' HP-UX OS has been around for more than 30 years, and users may be looking to move on from the Unix-based OS. Now HPE is offering a way out of the ancient OS using containers, which are small buckets running instances of applications. The containers will be offered with the Linux OS. HPE will provide containers to transition from conventional mainframe-style OSes to new hardware like x86-based Xeon servers. In this case, HPE is trying to get users to transition from Itanium chips. Intel started shipping its last Itanium 9700 chips -- codenamed Kittson -- on Thursday. Correspondingly, HPE announced new Integrity i6 servers with the new chips. But the future of HP-UX servers is uncertain because Intel has no new Itanium chips beyond Kittson. "We will enable customers to re-host their HP-UX workloads on Linux-based containers running on industry-standard x86 servers in the future," said Jeff Kyle, director of product management for enterprise servers at HPE.  The Integrity servers are known for their rock-solid stability, which made them attractive to large organizations in sectors like finance and retail. But moving away from Itanium to x86 is a big investment in hardware and software changes. Moreover, companies are hesitant to quickly change IT infrastructures because downtime could severely hurt their bottom line. HPE is already making it easy to move from Itanium to x86 with a software tool and x86 servers with Itanium-like features. While newer x86 hardware can take on newer tasks like machine learning, HP-UX and Integrity were designed for old-school mainframe applications. Exactly how the containers will work isn't clear. It'll likely pull HP-UX workload instances and put them in Linux as micro-services. Containers are different from virtualization, which require hypervisors, software tools, and system resources. Containers allow customers to maintain mixed HP-UX and Linux environments and make the transition smoother. At the same time, Williams said HPE believes its HP-UX customers are important. HPE will continue to improve the Integrity i6 servers at the system- and the software-level, beyond just the processor. "This includes periodic future integrations with the evolving Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) technology and continued software innovation via yearly update releases," Williams said. Servers based on Kittson also support the OpenVMS OS, which previously belonged to HP, but now is being maintained by VMS Software. A key improvement in the Integrity i6 is its integration of 3Par all-flash storage. The servers, which are available through retailers, start at around US$14,500 for an entry level configuration.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Windows 10 IoT will now support high-end Intel processors, more 2 by Surur  @mspoweruser May 11, 2017 at 19:57 GMT11 hours ago At Build 2017 Microsoft announced some significant improvements to their Windows 10 IoT platform. The biggest is likely support for Intel’s full processor family, with the OS now supporting Intel’s full range of processors, from Atom to Core i7. This means that devices running Windows 10 IoT can now be as fast and responsive as any desktop PC, an important usability improvement when the OS can run devices as large and interesting as Kodisoft’s Interactive Table below. Other features added to the platform includes new support from Microsoft’s Azure cloud and more. See the list below: Windows 10 IoT Core support for Azure IoT Device Management, which provides highly scalable remote device management features. Turn-key connectivity to the Azure IoT Hub that offers reliable and secure device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging, scaling to millions of devices. Support for the upcoming Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service, which makes it easier to provision a connected device via Azure IoT services, leveraging Windows IoT TPM based security. Support for Project “Rome” that allows a user to launch an app or communicate with an app service on a remote device, enabling cross-device experiences using the Microsoft Graph. Support for Device Guard for IoT, which improves threat resistance by allowing only OS components and code signed by the OEM to load. This adds to the robust set of security features in Windows 10 IoT such as BitLocker and Secure Boot. Cortana, your personal digital assistant, is now available for you to integrate into your devices. Cortana will help you get things done by completing tasks and interacting with you using natural language in a consistent, contextual way. Microsoft also launched a newly designed Windows IoT website to help developers create devices such as next-generation point-of-sale devices, interactive tables, and intelligent digital signage.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 11, 2017 12:32 PM PT Credit: Stephen Lawson More like this Intel's Itanium, once destined to replace x86 processors in PCs, hits end of... Intel ships latest Itanium chip called Kittson, but grim future looms Intel's Itanium to live on as HPE commits to new servers with the chip Video Let's Play: Prey Hewlett Packard Enterprises' HP-UX OS has been around for more than 30 years, and users may be looking to move on from the Unix-based OS. Now HPE is offering a way out of the ancient OS using containers, which are small buckets running instances of applications. The containers will be offered with the Linux OS. HPE will provide containers to transition from conventional mainframe-style OSes to new hardware like x86-based Xeon servers. In this case, HPE is trying to get users to transition from Itanium chips. [ Further reading: 4 Linux projects for newbies and intermediate users ] Intel started shipping its last Itanium 9700 chips -- codenamed Kittson -- on Thursday. Correspondingly, HPE announced new Integrity i6 servers with the new chips. But the future of HP-UX servers is uncertain because Intel has no new Itanium chips beyond Kittson. "We will enable customers to re-host their HP-UX workloads on Linux-based containers running on industry-standard x86 servers in the future," said Jeff Kyle, director of product management for enterprise servers at HPE.  The Integrity servers are known for their rock-solid stability, which made them attractive to large organizations in sectors like finance and retail. But moving away from Itanium to x86 is a big investment in hardware and software changes. Moreover, companies are hesitant to quickly change IT infrastructures because downtime could severely hurt their bottom line. HPE is already making it easy to move from Itanium to x86 with a software tool and x86 servers with Itanium-like features. While newer x86 hardware can take on newer tasks like machine learning, HP-UX and Integrity were designed for old-school mainframe applications. Exactly how the containers will work isn't clear. It'll likely pull HP-UX workload instances and put them in Linux as micro-services. Containers are different from virtualization, which require hypervisors, software tools, and system resources. Containers allow customers to maintain mixed HP-UX and Linux environments and make the transition smoother. At the same time, Williams said HPE believes its HP-UX customers are important. HPE will continue to improve the Integrity i6 servers at the system- and the software-level, beyond just the processor. "This includes periodic future integrations with the evolving Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) technology and continued software innovation via yearly update releases," Williams said. Servers based on Kittson also support the OpenVMS OS, which previously belonged to HP, but now is being maintained by VMS Software. A key improvement in the Integrity i6 is its integration of 3Par all-flash storage. The servers, which are available through retailers, start at around US$14,500 for an entry level configuration.

Legislators approved providing another $10 million in state income tax credits for “angel” investors who put money into qualified small businesses and revamped a fund designed to provide grants to “microenterprises.” In the Senate, lawmakers gave final approval to a bill to restore two-year eligibility for cash assistance for needy families, the way it was before Gov. Doug Ducey signed legislation that cut the limit by half two years ago. The slog of voting Wednesday morning and afternoon finished a session that could have dragged on even longer, were it not for a deal struck Tuesday in the Senate on a bill to consolidate election dates. SB1152, pushed by Rep. Kevin Payne, R-Peoria, is intended to spark a lawsuit against the state of Arizona after lawmakers lost a previous legal battle over their right to consolidate elections at the Arizona Supreme Court. It may not have been a significant policy issue for most lawmakers, including Senate President Steve Yarbrough, R-Chandler. But Yarbrough noted that SB1152 was a critical part of getting enough support to approve a $9.8 billion budget a week ago, and the Senate needed to fulfill its obligation to pass the bill. “Once the commitment was made to get it up there, that became the problem,” Yarbrough said. Senate leadership was prepared to call upon Sen. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain HIlls, to fly back to the Capitol on Thursday from a week-long teaching course in Louisiana, with plans for a late-night vote on several bills shortly after he landed in Phoenix. Brophy McGee Instead, Sen. Kate Brophy McGee, R-Phoenix, reached a deal that ended her opposition to the bill. Her decisive vote on SB1152 allowed the Senate and House to move along and adjourn sine die on Wednesday, and in rare fashion — the last time the Legislature finished its work in the light of day was June 19, 2003. The big action left for Wednesday was the decision to provide even more financial incentives for manufacturers, some of whom already get special property tax treatment and a few of whom may be paying no state corporate income taxes at all. Yarbrough did not dispute that existing laws and what is in SB1416, approved by the Senate on a 21-6 vote, and the House by a vote of 32-21, will minimize what some companies pay not only to the state but also in local property taxes that support the city and school districts. The Senate president said that has to be weighed against the promise by Intel it will invest more than $7 billion to refurbish and finally occupy a now-vacant chip-manufacturing facility it built years ago in Chandler, Yarbrough’s hometown. That, he said, will create new revenue streams. “You’re missing all of those people who have jobs at Intel who make six-figure salaries, who pay income tax, who pay property taxes on their home, who pay sales taxes at all the places they buy stuff,” Yarbrough said. But House Minority Leader Rebecca Rios, D-Phoenix, said the record in Arizona disproves the theory that tax breaks for business will grow the economy. She cited a recent report that various tax exemptions and credits total $14 billion, more than the $9.8 billion state budget. But Rios pointed out that the current state budget is essentially equal to what it was a decade ago, “with more than half a million more people in Arizona.” “Where’s all this revenue that’s flooding into the state?” she asked. Rep. Pamela Powers Hannley, D-Tucson, took particular issue with provisions of the bill that extend special tax credits to firms to reimburse them for the cost of doing research and development. The state is forgoing millions of dollars of taxes, and that’s not the worst of it, she said. “This bill also gives away millions of dollars in research royalties into the future, with no end date,” Powers Hannley said, research that was financed by taxpayers in the first place. “Giving away all the intellectual property rights is a huge potential loss of future revenues,” she continued. “When the voters fund research or fund anything, the voters should get a return on their investment.” She said the benefit to the state amounts to “trickle-down economics.” Not all Democrats were opposed. “Not only will SB1416 create thousands of high-paying jobs to thousands of Arizonans, but will catapult economic development in the right direction,” said Rep. Cesar Chavez, D-Phoenix. He said graduates from the state’s three universities are “fleeing” because there are not enough jobs available. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard, R-Chandler, reflecting a philosophical difference between the parties, took particular issue with Rios’ contention the state is giving away tax breaks. “Not taxing something is not the same thing as giving it away,” he said. “‘Giving it away’ suggests we own it.” The money, Mesnard said, belongs to the taxpayers. “They own it and then we force it from them, yes, to provide services for various things,” he said. “But there’s a very important distinction.” The provisions in SB1416 come on top of the special tax treatment that certain large corporations already get. There are those research developments tax credits, which can be equal to 24 percent of what a company spends. Arizona also has created “foreign trade zones,” where the property tax on businesses is just a fraction of what it is on firms whose facilities are located elsewhere. Multi-state corporations are allowed to compute what they owe in Arizona corporate income taxes based entirely on what percentage of the products they make are sold in the state. That potentially reduces the liability to manufacturers whose products are made here and shipped elsewhere. That break is even more significant for firms like Intel, whose computer chips are sold to other firms nationally and worldwide, and Raytheon which has little Arizona audience for its missiles. SB1416 makes three major changes in existing laws. It would extend and expand tax credits manufacturers already get for creating new jobs. That credit is currently set to expire at the end of June. Another provision extends the tax credits available for expenses on research and development. And it would create an accelerated depreciation schedule for any equipment purchased by manufacturers. That break relates to the fact that Arizona law imposes property taxes not only on land and buildings but also any business equipment, from major presses to computers and desks. The value of that equipment is based on the purchase price, a figure that is adjusted annually for depreciation. SB1416 allows businesses to write off half the value in the first year alone, a move that provides an immediate break on what already is a reduced property tax rate. That will particularly help companies that are currently in the market for major new equipment, like Intel. Ducey has generally been favorable to new business tax breaks. But he’s also getting something in the legislation he did not want. Rep. Jill Norgaard, R-Phoenix, slipped in language which says that the sale of partial ownership shares of corporate jets is not subject to the state sales tax. Ducey vetoed a bill with only that language earlier this year because of the revenue implications. But he will have to accept it if he wants the rest of what’s in SB 1416 because he lacks the constitutional power to excise provisions of new laws he does not like. There was no immediate response from his office to what Norgaard had done.

The mega breakout started in April, leaving the shorts in a world of hurt. Most investors who are not in on GOOGL stock, however, have been left looking for entry points. Click to Enlarge Of course, that’s the challenge, isn’t it? While the rally is good news to those who are already long hot stocks like Alphabet, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), this poses a problem to potential investors. As fast as GOOGL has been rallying, it perpetually looks like it’s due for a pullback. Alas, dips have been scarce, and even when they do come, they barely register on anyone’s radar. This doesn’t mean that we have to stay on the sidelines. Three weeks ago, I shared a trade on GOOGL stock that delivered free profits out of thin air and with absolutely zero worry. Another successful trade (to prove it wasn’t a fluke) delivered a whopping $12 per contract in pure profits with zero out-of-pocket expense. Look, I can’t promise another $12 home run, but I can reset a new trade with profits in hand that would have similar prospects for success. How to Trade GOOGL Stock Now The Bet: Sell the Sep $805 naked put and collect $6 per contract. With a 15% price buffer, I have a 90% theoretical certainty that price will expire above my strike so I can retain the premium for maximum gains. Otherwise, I suffer losses below $799 per share. Usually I like to sell opposing risk for balance. The Hedge (Optional): Sell the Sep $1,100 call and collect an additional $6 per contract. This bearish bet also has a 90% theoretical chance of success, but if GOOGL stock rallies more than 15%, it could be painful. I would delay entry into this or overweight the bullish side 2-to-1 so I’d still be leaning bullish. Selling naked options is very risky business and is not suited for a lot of investors. But I could use spreads and still accomplish the same setup and yield more than 15% on risk. Spreads are by definition self-hedged alternatives to naked puts. If price goes against the trade, the damaged is relatively contained. Compare that to needing to spend $955 per share and hoping Alphabet rallies 15% through September. My setup will pay me, even if GOOGL stock does nothing through the fall season. E-mail sellspreads@gmail.com with questions or join me to learn more about options in a personal 1on1 webinar here.

Human Drivers 15 hours 48 min ago Comments by Tom Krisher, AP Auto Writer Automotive DETROIT (AP) — In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 kph) — just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn't dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there's the "California Stop," where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the "Pittsburgh Left," where it's customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Michigan, drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. "There's an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules," said Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school's autonomous car research. In this Tuesday, Dec. 13, 2016, file photo, an Uber driverless car waits in traffic during a test drive in San Francisco. In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robocars and is slowing their development. But experts say eventually the cars will coexist with human drivers on real roads. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That's because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. "Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don't understand social graces," said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University's Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing's giant traffic jams. In India's capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they're equipped with automatic emergency braking. "It's hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology," says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota's autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing's traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, said John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel's Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1 ½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That's equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng said. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the "Pittsburgh Left" by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. "You'll never be able to make up a person's ability to perceive what's the right move at the time, I don't think," said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long, who works in the traffic and public safety office. ____ Allen G.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Smart Stadium Market to Grow 30.2% CAGR to Hit $17.32 BILLION to 2021 Smart Stadium Market Smart stadium market size is estimated to grow from USD 4.62 billion in 2016 to USD 17.32 billion by 2021, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 30.2%, The smart stadium market is broadly segmented on the basis of software, services, platforms, deployment models, and regions. Download your sample copy of smart stadium market @ goo.gl/NnSpXW The initial findings about the market depicts that by the end of the forecast period, the software market is likely to achieve a winning imperative as the vendors will be offering an integrated software capable of performing the tasks efficiently and in real time. The digital content management would account for the largest share in the software segment owing to the rapid digitization and increased focus on sharing digital content with the users so they can avail offers and benefits; the network management software is expected to grow at the highest CAGR owing to the large number of devices that are connected to either wired or no-wired network in stadiums, which need to be identified and monitored. The various major smart stadium vendors profiled in the report are as follows: 1. Cisco Systems, Inc. (U.S.) 2. Fujitsu (Japan) 3. GP Smart Stadium (the Netherlands) 4. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. (China) 5. International Business Machines Corp, (U.S.) 6. Intel Corp. (U.S.) 7. Johnson Controls (U.S.) 8. NEC Corp. (Japan) 9. Tech Mahindra Ltd. (India) 10. Volteo (U.S.) The on-demand deployment model is expected to witness higher growth compared to on-, as well as account for the largest share in the smart stadium market as organizations are more focused on reducing operational costs while achieving with improved efficiency. Since the third-party vendors offer these services at a reduced cost and manage all the processes from deployment to maintenance, the stadium owners would be willing to prefer on-demand mode to the on-premises mode. The application management platform segment is expected to be the leading among all other platforms due to need for security policies to authenticate users and set expiration for access to data. The network management platform is expected to be the fastest-growing platform segment owing to the demand for remote management (while managing multiple geographical sites) and need to lower the management traffic. Europe is currently the largest contributor in the smart stadium market, while Middle East and Africa is the fastest-growing region and this trend is expected to continue till 2021. Access complete report on Smart Stadium Market @ goo.gl/M6ry5Z Several smart stadium vendors are leveraging on smart technology to develop better connected stadiums for sports fans in Europe and the Middle East; for instance Vodafone will design smart stadiums for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar and Intel would work with Croke Park stadium on the Smart Stadium Project. The driving factors in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region are increased adoption of digital technology and Internet of Things (IOT) and availability of adequate infrastructure for setting up of smart stadiums, along with increased spending by corporations in smart buildings to increase their efficiency.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global ESD Packaging Market to Grow at a CAGR of 8.2% by 2021 – Driven by an Increase in the Demand for Mobility in Electronic Devices Worldwide – Research and Markets The global ESD packaging market to grow at a CAGR of 8.23% during the period 2017-2021. The report, Global ESD Packaging Market 2017-2021, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. One trend in market is high adoption of technology in automobiles. The electrification and automation of automobiles have increased the demand for semiconductor wafers. Multiple types of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) are used in automobiles for airbag control, global positioning systems, anti-lock braking systems, car navigation and display, power doors and windows, infotainment, automated driving, and collision detection technology. The emergence of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence will lead to the emergence of self-driving cars in future. Companies such as Intel, Google, Uber, and Tesla are already investing and focusing on self-driving vehicles. In November 2016, for example, Intel announced its new division, Automated Driving Group, which will focus on autonomous driving. Intel has also tied up with automotive firms such as BMW for the division. According to the report, one driver in market is increasing miniaturization of electronic devices. There has been an increase in the demand for mobility in electronic devices worldwide. To be portable and cost-effective, devices need to be lightweight and small. Thus, the increased demand for mobility has translated into a trend toward the adoption of smaller devices. The popularity of smaller devices in multiple sectors such as telecommunications and automotive has, in turn, led to the miniaturization of semiconductor ICs.

Driven by an Increase in the Demand for Mobility in Electronic Devices Worldwide - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 11 May, 2017, 14:30 BST Share this article DUBLIN, May 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global ESD Packaging Market 2017-2021" report to their offering. The global ESD packaging market to grow at a CAGR of 8.23% during the period 2017-2021. The report, Global ESD Packaging Market 2017-2021, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. One trend in market is high adoption of technology in automobiles. The electrification and automation of automobiles have increased the demand for semiconductor wafers. Multiple types of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) are used in automobiles for airbag control, global positioning systems, anti-lock braking systems, car navigation and display, power doors and windows, infotainment, automated driving, and collision detection technology. The emergence of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence will lead to the emergence of self-driving cars in future. Companies such as Intel, Google, Uber, and Tesla are already investing and focusing on self-driving vehicles. In November 2016, for example, Intel announced its new division, Automated Driving Group, which will focus on autonomous driving. Intel has also tied up with automotive firms such as BMW for the division. According to the report, one driver in market is increasing miniaturization of electronic devices. There has been an increase in the demand for mobility in electronic devices worldwide. To be portable and cost-effective, devices need to be lightweight and small. Thus, the increased demand for mobility has translated into a trend toward the adoption of smaller devices. The popularity of smaller devices in multiple sectors such as telecommunications and automotive has, in turn, led to the miniaturization of semiconductor ICs. With the advances in technology, such as 3D ICs and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), as well as the changes in the designs of ICs such as finer patterning, electronic devices are becoming more compact and user-friendly. However, smaller and densely-built semiconductors, ICs, and PCBs have more chances of tribocharging, and thus require anti-static packaging.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 11, 2017 6:13 AM PT Credit: Intel More like this Intel ships latest Itanium chip called Kittson, but grim future looms Intel at a Crossroads With Itanium Intel's new Xeon server chip pushes Itanium closer to death's door Video Let's Play: Prey It’s the end of the line for Intel’s Itanium chip, a troubled processor family that spawned many product delays and bad blood between HP and Oracle. Intel on Thursday started shipping its latest Itanium 9700 chip, code-named Kittson, in volume. It’s the last of the Itanium chips, which first appeared in early 2001. Beyond Kittson, there will be no more chips coming from the Itanium family, an Intel spokesman said in an email. That ends a tumultuous, 16-year journey for Itanium, which Intel once envisioned as a replacement for x86 chips in 64-bit PCs and servers. Support for Itanium has dwindled over the past decade, which has led to its gradual death. Server makers stopped offering hardware, software development stalled, and Intel has been openly asking customers to switch to x86-based Xeon chips. The Itanium 9700 is an incremental upgrade to the previous chips, code-named Poulson, and is targeted at high-end servers running Unix. The only major customer for Itanium remains Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which is upgrading its Integrity i6 high-uptime servers with the new chips. The servers provide rock-solid stability and run on Unix-based HP-UX. Intel can now focus on Xeon, which was rebranded last week to account for new technologies like co-processors and faster interconnects. Itanium has been on the chopping back for a long time, and it’s demise isn’t a surprise. Itanium was developed jointly by Intel and the company originally known as HP (before its breakup into HP and HPE). HP was looking to replace its aging PA-RISC with a modern 64-bit server chip that could run legacy OSes like Unix. At the time, Intel wanted to break into the high-end server market with a lead partner like HP, and take on older mainframe architectures like Oracle/Sun SPARC and IBM’s Power. “At the time it looked like a viable strategy for what they were going after,” said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research When introduced in 2001, the Itanium instruction set was much more advanced than that of the x86. It had features like machine-check, ECC memory and RAS (reliability availability and serviceability). But the first Itanium chips were extremely power hungry. When employed by Motorola, McGregor was shown an early 1U server with two Itanium processors and a massive turbofan at the back. It was too power hungry, noisy and required a lot of cooling, he said. Intel hedged its bets and planned for Itanium 64—also called IA-64—to ultimately go down the stack from servers to PCs. But that never happened, and the market shifted quickly after AMD introduced the first 64-bit x86 server chips in 2003. That gave AMD a competitive edge over Intel, which still was offering 32-bit x86 chips. Intel got back to the drawing board and sped up the development of x86 chips with 64-bit extensions, which were released soon after. The transition disrupted Intel’s vision of Itanium as an architecture of the future for 64-bit servers and PCs. Instead, x86 chips started moving up the stack into more powerful servers. But the real hit on Itanium came in 2010. That year Microsoft stopped software support for Itanium, declaring that Windows Server 2008 R2 would be its last server OS to support Itanium. In March 2011, Oracle made a decision to stop writing software for Itanium, saying “Intel management made it clear that their strategic focus is on their x86 microprocessor and that Itanium was nearing the end of its life.” That spawned a legal battle with HP, which wanted continued Oracle software support and development for its HP-UX customers. Intel subsequently made a concerted push to move customers from Itanium to x86 in 2012 when it introduced the new 15-core Xeon E7 v2 chip with Itanium-like error correction and RAS features.  At the time, HP also made it easier to transition from Itanium to x86-based Xeon servers. The message from Intel and HP, notes Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research, was clear: It was time to move on from Itanium. But customers weren’t willing to move off Itanium, especially those users needing high-uptime servers to keep infrastructure stable and humming. HP remained committed to releasing servers based on the chip, and that contributed to Itanium surviving longer than expected. HPE has said it will keep support for Itanium servers up and running until 2025, and will release the latest HP-UX 11i v3 2017 update in June. Itanium 9700 is still there for those who need it, and they are socket compatible, meaning new chips can be plugged into existing servers with previous-generation Poulson chips. The servers are not for new workloads like machine learning or artificial intelligence, but for traditional mainframe-style workloads. Companies with machines running on HP-UX and Integrity will likely remain committed to Itanium, and won’t transition for many years. But that won’t stop HPE from trying to get customers to move to x86. HPE will enable “customers to re-host their HP-UX workloads on Linux-based containers running on industry-standard x86 servers in the future,” said Jeff Kyle, director of product management for enterprise servers at HPE. The new Integrity i6 is priced starting at $14,500 and is available through resellers. The servers have NVMe support and all-flash 3Par storage integration. Xeon and x86 will drive Intel into the future, especially with applications and data center designs changing. “[Itanium] will be remembered as one of those interesting architectural experiments. It lived a lot longer than others,” McCarron said. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Reload for more free profits. By Nicolas Chahine, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 11, 2017, 7:30 am EDT     Popular Posts: Trade of the Day: Go Long Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Before Earnings Trade of the Day: Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Is a Great Falling Knife to Catch 3 Bank Stocks That Can Bank You Free Profits Recent Posts: Go Long Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock for Free Trade Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Near All-Time Highs Without Fear Go Long Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock With No Money Down View All Posts Just two weeks ago Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) fell on earnings and I shared a bullish trade that delivered profits from thin air. Today INTC is falling again so I want to rinse and repeat the process knowing I have profits in hand. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr On Wednesday, INTC stock fell on a downgrade — this on a day where Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) rallied hard. This usually would be a bad omen for Intel bulls, but on the positive side, the downgrade had a muted effect and besides, it’s one person’s opinion and doesn’t change the facts. Click to Enlarge Fundamentally INTC is a long-term proven performer. Management rarely gives Wall Street reasons to punish it. It sells at a modest 15.6 times trailing price-to-earnings ratio, which is cheaper than its competitors. Furthermore, I don’t expect a deluge of downgrades, as the analyst ratings distribution is in balance and spread across three levels. So traders now need to get over the fear of catching the proverbial falling knife. It’s not usual habit for me to grab trash stocks that are falling, but when I see a quality name dip, I don’t mind taking the risk. I am a conservative trader so I won’t buy Intel stock at face value and without any room for error. After all, markets are at all-time highs. So I will use options to structure a trade setup that will generate income from proven support levels. INTC Stock Trade Idea The Bullish Bet: Sell the INTC Aug $32 put and collect 35 cents per contract. If price stays above my risk then I retain my maximum profits. Otherwise, I start losing money if INTC falls below $31.65 per share. Selling naked puts is not for the faint of heart, so I could use credit put spreads instead. The difference is that the spread’s maximum risk is finite, thereby greatly reducing the maximum exposure in case of a crash. It is important to note that using options virtually eliminates the need to be perfect with the timing of entry. Since all I need is that INTC stock price stay above my sold risk, I can profit even if it falls another 10% from here. Technically I do have to acknowledge the risk of losing the next two trend lines (pictured in the chart above). That would likely invite momentum sellers. Range has been tightening, so a move is imminent and it could very well be to the downside. Even then, there are other support levels that stand above my exposed risk. I am not required to keep my options trades open for the duration. I can close them for partial gains or losses at any time.

The Integrity i6 models represent an entire refresh of the Integrity server line, and use Intel Itanium 9700 series processors, otherwise known as the Kittson line. These servers also get extended memory. We're told the latest HP-UX* 11i v3 2017 update, scheduled to be released in June, supports the newest 3PAR storage, meaning all-flash arrays, we understand. HPE claims Integrity i6 and updated HP-UX provide: Better total cost of ownership Up to 50 per cent reduction in database support and license costs over Integrity i2 servers Enhanced system performance Improved system availability, data management and security HPE is keen to stress the longevity of the Integrity server line, with an Asia Pacific OEM partner quote asserting: "The new generation servers will enable us to continually provide our customers with the HPE Integrity servers through 2025 and beyond." As part of this the Integrity/HP-UX servers will have future integration with NVMe technology. HPE also says customers will get annual software updates and support until 2025 at least. Migration option In the future HPE will enable customers to move HP-UX workloads into Linux containers running on x86 servers, stressing that these will be high-speed ones. HPE says customers can choose to keep workloads on Integrity/HP-UX and get maximum performance or transition to a containerised/x86 HP-UX environment (and, El Reg storage desk would imagine, get less performance). +Comment Many will see the x86 Linux container re-hosting announcement as HPE bowing to the (seemingly) inevitable end of Itanium processor development, with no hardware refresh by Intel after Kittson. By 2025 we might expect x86 servers to be using persistent memory and new-generation communications fabrics such as Gen Z, as well as the expected Xeon processors that will follow Icelake (v8) and Tigerlake (v9) and probably the WhateverLake that follows that. The combination of persistent memory, next-gen fabrics and updated Xeons, with whatever fancy SoCs Intel by then provides for offload processors, will almost certainly drive standard x86 server performance well beyond i6 Itanium servers. If such servers can be implemented in a way to provide Itanium levels of reliability, availability and security, then using the Linux container migration route will become a no-brainer. This move by HPE demonstrates maturity and reality and gives Itanium customers a comfort blanket for the future. ® * Shouldn't that be HPE-UX now?

They were the Intel of graphic cards, so to say - they made the products everybody wanted. It's been a while since the company realized it could do more than that, so it started building more and more powerful chips, to the point where it's become the supplier of choice for several carmakers that are pursuing the development of autonomous technology. Even though not entirely absent, Toyota has been pretty quiet on this front for a manufacturer of its size, but has now announced it would start using NVIDIA's Drive PX platform developed by the IT company specifically for this purpose. “Toyota has worked on autonomous driving technologies for over 20 years with the aim of reducing traffic fatalities to zero as an ultimate goal, achieving smoother traffic, and providing mobility for all," said Ken Koibuchi, Toyota's executive general manager in a press release. "Through this collaboration, we intend to accelerate the development of autonomous driving systems that are even more safe and capable.” NVIDIA's tech is already used by carmakers such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Tesla Motors or Volvo, so this partnership puts Toyota on a pretty prestigious list. Engineers from both parties are already working on matching the new hardware with the existing sensors and software on Toyota's testing vehicles. “This is a very significant milestone for us,” said Danny Shapiro, head of automotive at Nvidia, quoted by Automotive News “Toyota is one of the largest automakers in the world,” he concluded, apparently oblivious to the fact the Japanese conglomerate is actually THE largest car manufacturer in the world. This announcement comes moments after Toyota President, Akio Toyoda presented the company's latest earnings numbers and declared he felt a "sense of crisis." Toyota ended the year on a downturn, and initial signs for 2017 - as well as specialists' forecast - suggest the losses will continue for the second year in a row. The president questioned the attention to customer feedback and the ability of the company's products to fulfill their expectations. To address that, Toyota has no chance but accelerate its self-driving program, so when the first systems hit the streets on production models (probably around 2020), it will be ready. Teaming up with NVIDIA sounds like a sound step toward that goal. toyota autonomous project Toyota NVIDIA autonomous self-driving load press release   An Ode to Embracing the Metric System The Dos and Don’ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Platform Sharing - When Expensive Cars Get Cheaper Platforms And Viceversa Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips DIY: How to Setup An Email Address In a BMW - An Easy Guide Eight Of The Most Anticipated Debuts At The 2017 New York Auto Show Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

The South Korean memory chip giant rose to become the world’s third-largest chipmaker by first-quarter sales, moving up two notches from a year earlier, according to data provided by research firm IC Insights. SK hynix raised $5.5 billion in sales for the first three months of the year, the data showed.  (Yonhap) The market researcher also noted SK hynix’s improvement from last year. “Memory giant SK Hynix made the biggest move in the 1Q ranking as compared to the full-year 2016 ranking,” said Bill McClean, president of IC Insights. “Spurred by the recent surge in the DRAM and NAND flash markets, the company moved up two spots in the top-10 ranking.” Micron also climbed up two spots to come in fourth. Infineon, which is headquartered in Germany, was a new entrant into the top 10 ranking this year, at 10th place. Korea’s top chipmaker Samsung Electronics came in second with $13.6 billion in sales, after US-based Intel with $14.2 billion.  Although Intel held a slim 4 percent lead over Samsung for the No. 1 position in the first quarter, the researcher noted that Samsung is on pace to displace Intel as the world’s largest semiconductor supplier in the second quarter. The top 10 semiconductor suppliers represented a combined 56 percent of the worldwide semiconductor market of $99.6 billion in the first quarter, the data showed. “The second quarter is forecast to be the first ever quarterly semiconductor market to exceed $100 billion,” McClean said. The researcher offered a prediction for further changes in the top 10 ranking throughout the year, considering expected mergers and acquisitions to follow in the market. “As would be expected, given the possible acquisitions and mergers that could/will occur this year, as well as any new ones that may develop, the top 10 semiconductor ranking is likely to undergo some significant changes over the next few years as the semiconductor industry continues along its path to maturity,” he said. US Qualcomm is in the process of incorporating Netherlands’ NXP, while several global chipmakers including SK hynix, Micron and Western Digital are racing to take over Toshiba’s NAND Flash unit.

Steve Yarbrough Submitted photo Pamela Powers Hannley top story Arizona Legislature ends term by passing slew of tax breaks for businesses By Howard Fischer Capitol Media Services May 10, 2017 Updated 14 hrs ago +2  Buy Now Sen. Steve Yarbrough Capitol Media Services / file photo +2  Pamela Powers Hannley Submitted photo Respond: Write a letter to the editor | Write a guest opinion Howard Fischer / Capitol Media Services/ House Minority Leader Rebecca Rios PHOENIX — State lawmakers completed the 2017 legislative session Wednesday evening with millions of dollars in new and expanded tax breaks for businesses that sponsors say will help economic development. Legislators approved providing another $10 million in state income-tax credits for “angel” investors who put money into qualified small businesses. They also revamped a fund to provide grants to “micro-enterprises” — essentially small businesses with few employees. Separately, they gave final approval to restoring lifetime eligibility for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to two years, the way it was before Gov. Doug Ducey signed legislation trimming that by half two years ago. But the measure includes some conditions on getting that second year of cash assistance, provisions Democrats said are designed to trip up recipients. But the big action Wednesday was the decision to provide even more financial incentives for manufacturers, some of whom already get special property-tax treatment and a few of whom may be paying no state corporate income taxes at all. Senate President Steve Yarbrough did not dispute that existing laws and what is in SB 1416, approved by the Senate 21-6 and the House 32-21, will minimize what some companies pay not only to the state but also in local property taxes. But he said that has to be weighed against the promises by firms such as Intel, which said it will be investing more than $7 billion to refurbish and occupy a vacant chip-manufacturing facility it built years ago in Chandler, Yarbrough’s hometown. And that, he said, will create new revenue streams. “You’re missing all of those people who have jobs at Intel who make six-figure salaries, who pay income tax, who pay property taxes on their home, who pay sales taxes at all the places they buy stuff,” he said. But House Minority Leader Rebecca Rios said the record in Arizona disproves the theory that tax breaks for businesses will grow the economy. She cited a recent report that various tax exemptions and credits in Arizona total $14 billion, more than the $9.8 billion state budget. But Rios said the state budget is essentially equal to what it was a decade ago, “with more than half a million more people in Arizona.” “Where’s all this revenue that’s flooding into the state?” she asked. “We have no proof that tax credits like this one are actually working,” added Sen. Martin Quezada, D-Glendale. Rep. Pamela Powers Hannley, D-Tucson, took issue with provisions of the bill that extend special tax credits to firms to reimburse them for the cost of doing research and development. She said the state is forgoing millions of dollars of taxes. But Powers Hannley said that’s not the worst of it. “This bill also gives away millions of dollars in research royalties into the future, with no end date,” she said, research that was financed by taxpayers in the first place. “Giving away all the intellectual-property rights is a huge potential loss of future revenues,” Powers Hannley said. “When the voters fund research or fund anything, the voters should get a return on their investment.” But not all the Democrats were opposed. “Not only will SB 1416 create thousands of high-paying jobs to thousands of Arizonans, but will catapult economic development in the right direction,” said Rep. César Chávez, D-Phoenix. He said graduates from the state’s three universities are “fleeing” because there are not enough jobs available. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard, reflecting a philosophical difference between the parties, took particular issue with Rios’ contention the state is giving away tax breaks. “Not taxing something is not the same thing as giving it away,” he said. “ ‘Giving it away’ suggests we own it.” The money, he said, belongs to the taxpayers. “They own it and then we force it from them, yes, to provide services for various things,” Mesnard said. “But there’s a very important distinction.” The provisions in SB 1416 come on top of the special tax treatment that certain large corporations already get, including those research-and-development tax credits, which can equal 24 percent of what a company spends. Arizona also has created “foreign-trade zones,” where the property tax on businesses is just a fraction of what it is on firms whose facilities are located elsewhere. And multistate corporations are allowed to compute what they owe in Arizona corporate income taxes based entirely on what percentage of the products they make are sold in the state. That potentially reduces the liability to manufacturers whose products are made here and shipped elsewhere. That break is even more significant for firms like Intel, whose computer chips are sold to other firms nationally and worldwide, and Raytheon which has little Arizona audience for its missiles. SB 1416 would also create an accelerated depreciation schedule for any equipment purchased by manufacturers. That break relates to the fact that Arizona law imposes property taxes not only on land and buildings but also on business equipment, from major presses to computers and desks. The value of that equipment is based on the purchase price, a figure that is adjusted annually for depreciation. This legislation allows businesses to write off half the value in the first year alone, a move that provides an immediate break on what already is a reduced property-tax rate. That will particularly help companies that are in the market for major new equipment, like Intel. On Twitter: @azcapmedia +2  Buy Now Sen.

May 10, 2017 — 9:33pm Flynn Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint WASHINGTON – The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena Wednesday to force former national security adviser Michael Flynn to turn over documents related to the panel's probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including possible ties between the Kremlin and the presidential campaigns. It is the first subpoena the committee has announced in the course of its Russia investigation — a step Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., was long reticent to take. But the chairman began signaling this week that if Trump surrogates did not turn over requested materials to the committee by Tuesday — a deadline that some missed — he and Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., might begin issuing subpoenas. "Everything has been voluntary up to this point, and we've interviewed a lot of people and I want to continue to do it in a voluntary fashion," Burr said Wednesday morning. "But if in fact the production of things that we need are not provided, then we have a host of tools," Burr added, indicating that a subpoena was one of them. Flynn has come under committee scrutiny over communications he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak while a representative of then-President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. Undisclosed payments that Flynn received from Russian-backed entities, such as Kremlin-sponsored television network RT, have also inspired questions from lawmakers looking into allegations of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Burr and Warner originally requested the documents addressed in the Wednesday subpoena in a letter dated April 28. In announcing the subpoena, the Senate Intelligence Committee said that Flynn "declined, through counsel, to cooperate with the Committee's request." The announcement comes one day after the Trump administration fired James Comey from his post as FBI director, citing his handling of a probe into Hillary Clinton's e-mails as the reason for his termination. Many Democrats and a few Republicans found the timing of the firing suspect, since it comes as the FBI is investigating Trump's campaign and transition team for alleged collusion with Russia. "The timing of this and the reasoning for it doesn't make any sense to me," Burr said Wednesday morning, noting that Comey's firing would make the committee's investigation "a little bit more difficult." "But it didn't make it impossible, so we'll continue," Burr added. The Flynn subpoena also comes one day before the committee is scheduled to hold an annual hearing with the heads of the various government intelligence agencies to discuss worldwide threats. The committee announced Wednesday afternoon that the FBI's acting director Andrew McCabe would attend the briefing in Comey's place.

Owens Published: May 11, 2017 7:49 p.m. ET Share Analysts cheer new data-center processor, investors send Nvidia market cap past $75 billion Nvidia The Tesla V100 chip is the result of $3 billion in R&D expenses, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang said Wednesday. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Shares of Nvidia Corp. established record highs for a second consecutive session Thursday, after analysts cheered the chip maker’s new data-center offering that Chief Executive Jensen Huang called “the most expensive computer project the world has ever done.” At the keynote address of Nvidia’s NVDA, +4.30%  annual GPU Technology Conference on Wednesday, Huang showed off the new Tesla Volta server processor architecture, the latest offering for Nvidia’s booming data-center business. He highlighted the gigantic expense of developing the Tesla V100 chip, which leverages Nvidia’s recent advances in deep learning. “The R&D budget was $3 billion and this is the first one, so if anyone would like to buy it, the price is $3 billion,” Hung said while holding the first V100 off the assembly line. Lots of fancy stats about Tesla Volta V100 processor. I like the $3 billion number, but programmers will like this:https://t.co/1L5Q9BddKs— Jeremy C. Owens (@jowens510) May 10, 2017 The Volta unveiling was one of the highlights of Nvdia’s GTC conference, which has grown in stature as the Silicon Valley company has become a leader in artificial intelligence, which it is marketing for data centers, high-performance computing and autonomous vehicles. Huang also announced a new partnership with one of the world’s largest car makers, Toyota Motor Corp. TM, +0.97%  , to incorporate the Drive PX platform into future Toyota self-driving automobiles. Huang’s speech came a day after Nvidia’s quarterly earnings report, which sent the stock to its second-largest one-day gain of all time as well as intraday and closing record highs as analysts frantically raised price targets. Shares gained another 4.3% to more records Thursday after analysts again praised the company for its new data-center offering and other efforts announced at GTC, sending Nvidia’s market capitalization higher than $75 billion for the first time. Nvidia’s market cap is now approaching chip companies like Qualcomm Corp. QCOM, -1.17%  and Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, -0.11%  , both of which are valued at roughly $81 billion. Nvidia stock is now up more than 250% in the past year, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22%  has increased 16% in the same time. RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on Nvidia to $150 from $138 on Thursday afternoon, thanks to “increased confidence around data-center growth” after an event for analysts at GTC. Analyst Mitch Steves also said he thinks total artificial-intelligence applications can grow faster than even the current rise for Nvidia’s server business, potentially at a rate of more than 200%. “For data center, we see no slowdown in sight and believe the segment can continue its torrid triple-digit growth in 2017 and beyond,” wrote Steves, who has an outperform rating on the stock. Don’t miss: Nvidia surges as AI drives deeper into the cloud In its session with analysts, Nvidia said that the total addressable market for its server chips will grow to $30 billion by 2020, giving plenty of opportunity for more growth. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts were skeptical of that figure, noting it is 60% larger than Intel Corp.’s INTC, -0.89%  industry-leading data-center group, but said they would “take some time to analyze the feasibility of such a ramp.” Still, Nvidia’s GTC presentations convinced those analysts on two important points. “While AI technology is nascent today, it will likely become pervasive in the future in fields ranging from transportation to medicine to security to finance, and Nvidia’s massive parallel architecture that forms the basis for GPUs makes the company uniquely (perhaps luckily) positioned to lead with technology (from chips to software to systems) to support the rapid growth of AI,” they wrote, while maintaining a hold rating and $124 price target. See also: Nvidia proves why it is the hottest stock on Wall Street J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur has a similar view of the company, maintaining a $122 price target and hold rating based on his belief that shares are “fully priced at current levels” while seeing a large growth opportunity. “We expect the data-center segment to grow strongly going forward as hyperscale customers continue to embrace GPU-accelerated deep learning for processing large data sets,” Sur wrote Thursday morning. “We are encouraged by strength in the automotive and enterprise segments as well, although strong adoption of autonomous driving in the market remains to be seen.” Sur called the Toyota partnership a “significant win,” and Susquehanna Financial Group’s Christopher Rolland concurred by calling it a “big win” that should be viewed as a negative for Mobileye NV MBLY, -0.37%  and its eventual owner, Intel. Pacific Crest Securities analysts also mentioned a threat to Intel, but in the data-center field. “Nvidia is actively touting its Tesla GPUs as able to replace hundreds of traditional servers with only CPUs in terms of deep learning computing performance, according to its internal estimates,” they wrote. “This could become a headwind to Intel’s DCG business until it releases its Crest family of AI chips.” Pacific Crest retained an underweight rating on Nvidia with a $99 price target, while Susquehanna maintained a neutral rating and $110 target.

Scott Applewhite/AP By Caitlin MacNeal Published May 11, 2017 12:19 pm Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Thursday met with the chair and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the panel’s hearing with members of the intelligence committee on world threats. Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (R-NC) told reporters after the meeting that it had been a previously scheduled chat. Initial reports suggested that it was an impromptu meeting, as Burr and Ranking Member Mark Warner (D-VA) left the hearing before it was over to meet with Rosenstein. The senators told reporters that they requested the meeting with Rosenstein ahead of Comey’s departure and that they discussed ways for the Senate committee to avoid interfering with the FBI probe of Russia’s election meddling.

Rosenstein has come under fire from Democrats for his role in Comey’s firing. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Thursday plans to send a letter to Rosenstein telling him that his “reputation for integrity and impartiality” is “now imperiled by your participation in the abrupt dismissal of FBI Director Comey,” according to the Washington Post. Schumer asked Rosenstein a series of questions about his role in the decision to fire Comey. In the letter, Schumer noted that reports on Trump’s reasoning for firing Comey cast doubt on the ostensible reasons for Comey’s departure laid out in a memo written by Rosenstein. “This skepticism, and indeed all of the circumstances surrounding Director Comey’s dismissal just as he was leading an investigation into the Trump administration’s and Trump campaign’s ties with Russia and President Putin’s interference with the 2016 election, have shaken public confidence in the Department, in your leadership, and in the administration of law and justice in our country,” Schumer wrote, per the Post.   ABOUT THE AUTHOR Caitlin MacNeal Follow @caitlinmacneal Caitlin MacNeal is a News Writer based in Washington, D.C.

That’s the highest since the third quarter of 2011 and a strong sign that the stock market’s current uptrend need not be interrupted by the headline-grabbing news from Washington. News changes all the time and investors must stifle their emotional reactions, focusing on the market’s own signals and on persisting themes like technology’s ever increasing importance. Corporate earnings have now beaten analyst estimates for 21 straight quarters. The market continues in a confirmed uptrend led by the Technology and Consumer sectors. Political earthquakes like firing the FBI Director will leave aftershocks, crowding out issues like tax law changes and tempering some of the optimism that buttressed stocks after the election. Nevertheless, the vital fundamental underpinnings of moderate (and increasing) GDP growth, historically low interest rates, low inflation and solid corporate earnings are intact. Technology, now the primary driving force for stock market values, is changing at an accelerating pace. Intel’s main microprocessor is the 14-nanometer chip it introduced in 2014. It packs 37 million transistors in a single square millimeter. By the end of this year, the company will begin producing a 10-nanometer chip that will pack 100 million transistors per square millimeter. This amazing exponential growth fuels the success of Nvidia (NVDA-$129) and Microchip (MCHP-$79). These two both reported earnings that smashed through estimates, raised their forecasts and continue to be among my top ten positions. Each even pays a modest dividend, making them essential holdings for retirement accounts. These are among the elite stocks whose success reflects the driving genius of visionary company founders. Apple (AAPL-$153) takes center stage in that group. It recently became the first company to reach $800 billion in market cap (market price times number of shares outstanding). Apple is up 75 times since 2007, when it introduced the iPhone. There will be increasing emphasis on the company’s newest developments as it approaches the ten-year anniversary of the iPhone this fall. When its price reaches $191.80, its market cap will hit a trillion dollars. Amazon (AMZN-$948) and Tesla (TSLA-$324) are also amazing investments created by visionary businessmen. Amazon trades at 83 times estimated forward earnings for the year. Highly competitive, its profit margins are deliberately thin but it has become a rock-solid financial giant with $22 billion in cash and only $8 billion debt. Free cash flow jumped 52% in its March quarter. Beyond its ever-expanding consumer sales, its Amazon Web Services division contributed only 10% of sales – but 89% of profits. Antitrust issues may eventually develop but its structure would permit successful division. Tesla continues to confound its skeptics. Sales growth is running well over 50% annually and a few analysts estimate profits in 2018. Meanwhile, production of its new Model 3 is scheduled to begin this summer. As today’s fast changing economy requires, the company is committed to the most advanced technologies. Its charging network is far ahead of its competitors, an advantage that will become more evident when the more affordable Model 3 hits the street. European economies are picking up speed, particularly in the EU. Irish-based Shire reported first-quarter earning of $3.63, up 14% from a year ago, handily beating estimates. Its late-stage pipeline is advancing, its valuation is quite reasonable and there is a modest dividend. My newest buy is Corning (GLW-$28), which was founded in 1851 and is now a very up-to-the-minute manufacturer of specialty glass for displays, communications and life sciences. Earnings are up and the company just increased its dividend. Historic market uptrends have been fueled by innovations that boosted productivity and enhanced our lives. The stock market recovered for seven years after the bitter 2007-2008 financial crisis. It paused in 2015 and most of 2016 before beginning a renewed uptrend. Sentiment is skeptical, always a good sign, and removing the struggling energy sector yields a valuation for the rest of the market that offers room to run.

Nadella told conference attendees that there will be more than 25 billion intelligent devices in the world by 2020, and the role of developers will be to extend new technologies to meet that challenge. "So, whether precision medicine or precision agriculture, whether it's digital media or the industrial Internet, the opportunity for us as developers to have broad, deep impact on all parts of society and all parts of the economy has never been greater," he said. More than 500 million Windows 10 users now can be reached through the Windows Store, Nadella noted, as well as 100 million monthly active users of Office 365, 140 million monthly users of Cortana, and 12 million organizational entities in the Azure Active Directory -- including small, medium and large businesses, as well as educational institutions. Microsoft offered a preview of Azure IoT Edge, a cross-platform runtime that allows cloud functionality to be run remotely on IoT devices. The technology runs on both Windows and Linux, and it can operate on devices smaller than a Raspberry Pi. Predictive Maintenance The company demonstrated how one of its clients, Swedish cutting tool manufacturer Sandvik Coromant, is using Azure IoT Edge, along with Cortana Intelligence and Dynamics 365, to predict machine breakdowns on a factory floor more than 100 times faster than traditional models. In another demonstration, Microsoft showed how Azure Stack, Azure Functions, Cognitive Services and commodity cameras could help manage worker safety on industrial sites. Because the camera can differentiate among industrial tools and workers, it could be used in a scenario to prevent an unauthorized worker from gaining access to a jackhammer or potentially dangerous tools, for example. In another demonstration, the company showed how Microsoft Graph is used with Office 365 to create Cortana skills that are pushed across devices -- for example to send out a meeting reminder, or to push a low fuel warning to your car's new Harman Kordan-developed Invoke smart speaker, which is powered by Cortana. Microsoft signed new agreements with HP to develop Cortana-based devices, and with Intel to develop Cortana-based reference platforms. Microsoft also has made the Cortana skills kit available for public preview, allowing developers to build skills for Cortana and publish it to the Cortana channel of the Bot framework. Microsoft demonstrated how multiple products, including Dynamics 365, Office 365, Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Teams, and others will be integrated into Tact, a new sales experience platform that can turn any AI-connected device into an AI-powered virtual sales assistant. Microsoft introduced Azure Cosmos DB, which it says is the first globally distributed data service that allows you to horizontally scale throughput and storage anywhere, with guaranteed low latency, high availability and consistency. Users can scale hundreds of millions of requests with a single click. Microsoft announced new MySQL and PostgreSQL-managed services joining the AzureSQL database, and provided an early preview of Microsoft's new database migration services. The company announced general availability of Visual Studio 2017 for Mac. It also announced general availability of Windows Server Containers support in Azure Service Fabric. Developers now can publish for Microsoft Teams, its new chat-based workspace in Office 365. The company introduced new Microsoft Graph APIs for developers, including APIs for SharePoint and Planner. Competitive Landscape Major cloud computing firms like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are pursuing different strategies to capitalize on emerging market opportunities, said Jeffrey Kaplan, managing director of ThinkStrategies. "The most obvious example is the latest smart devices that each of the companies are rolling out, which combine voice recognition, AI, communications and ambient computing capabilities to provide a widening array of consumer and collaboration applications for the home and office," he told TechNewsWorld. Microsoft's announcements targeted the core developer audience at the Build conference, noted Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "Not surprisingly, Azure is particularly strong in its support for Microsoft's individual and group applications, which aren't high priorities for some other cloud providers," he told TechNewsWorld. Microsoft is typically ranked second behind AWS in terms of the size of its facilities and business, but there is research showing that Microsoft is gaining share against AWS, King noted. Gupshup, a bot platform provider, announced an agreement to use Microsoft Cognitive Services on Interbot, its bot-to-bot communications platform, which will be used to develop bots for Microsoft Teams, Skype, Skype for Business, Cortana and other platforms. "There are a wide variety of applications for both B2B and B2C customers that will benefit from bots being able to more intelligently communicate with one another, leveraging Microsoft APIs and accessing Bing's knowledge graph," said Beerud Sheth, CEO of Gupshup. For example, bots will be able to perform news and sentiment mining in real time, as well as review and recognize images and videos and trigger appropriate actions as a result, he told TechNewsWorld. Customers want Microsoft to make their jobs easier, Sheth said. They want to see advances like support for edge computing, for example, which opens up paths to new projects or business opportunities. They want to see support for emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that enhance or broaden the appeal of their work.

Puskar, Associated Press Image 1of/1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 A self-driving Uber car stops at a red light in Pitts burgh. Does it know about the “Pittsburgh Left”? A self-driving Uber car stops at a red light in Pitts burgh. Does it know about the “Pittsburgh Left”? Photo: Gene J. Puskar, Associated Press The toughest challenge for self-driving cars? Human drivers 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving taxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robot taxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph — just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. There’s the “California Stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh Left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Mich., drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” said Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who leads the school’s autonomous car research. Latest business videos Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robot taxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require huge amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing’s giant traffic jams. In New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with emergency braking. “It’s hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” said John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter said. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing’s traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, said John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel’s Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That’s equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng said. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday, autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh Left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out whether a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. “You’ll never be able to make up a person’s ability to perceive what’s the right move at the time, I don’t think,” said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long, who works in the traffic and public safety office. Tom Krisher is an Associated Press writer.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Self-Driving Cars Will Drive 1 Stock Higher and Cripple Another The autonomous vehicle revolution will bring a host of changes -- some obvious, some less so. You can probably guess why it'll boost Delphi Automotive, but you might not have considered why it'll crush Axalta. Daniel Miller (TMFTwoCoins) May 11, 2017 at 4:22PM Investors sifting through the automotive sector for stocks poised to thrive over the coming decades as the industry evolves toward driverless vehicles don't have many options. Arguably, the best autonomous-vehicle pure play was Mobileye, which develops camera-based vehicle vision systems for a multitude of major automakers, but the company recently agreed to be acquired by Intel.  For those looking at auto industry suppliers with their eyes on the future, here is one stock to seriously consider and one company that could face a slow death thanks to the rise of autonomous vehicles. Turning into a loser? Axalta Coating Systems (NYSE:AXTA) is coming off a decent first quarter, but you should likely avoid this stock over the long term. In 2016, this vehicle coatings manufacturer generated 59% of its sales from its performance coatings segment, which sells the finishes used at body shops, independent shops and light-vehicle dealerships, among other areas. The other 41% of its sales were generated from its transportation coatings segment, which focuses on OEMs, such as the Detroit automakers. Here's the long-term problem for Axalta: Because between Axalta's two business segments roughly 60% of its business is reliant on cars needing refinished coats after crashes, its future is in jeopardy as the industry is marching toward driverless vehicles, which are expected to steeply reduce the number of car accidents. And that isn't a headwind that will turn up suddenly in 20 years once most vehicles become completely autonomous; it's a headwind that will have an immediate, albeit slowly increasing, negative impact. Vehicles are already being loaded with technology to make driving safer, such as lane control, blind-spot sensors, and driver assist. Image source: Getty Images. Another headwind that Axalta faces is simply the natural progression of driver behavior in larger markets all over the world. As larger markets become more developed, their car accident rates tend to consistently decline relative to the population, which would put pressure on the company's top-line growth in critical markets. Investors also should consider the behavior of global automakers broadly. Generally speaking, they're continuing to cut costs by consolidating their business among suppliers, giving the OEMs more leverage on pricing. It's already a common practice for OEMs to bring in multiple companies for a product, as a car often needs multiple coatings, to increase competition. This company has a healthy business at the moment, and it has been around for over a century. However, the auto industry is poised to change more in the next two decades than it has over the past century, and businesses like Axalta will need to adapt or face a slow death from the shifts wrought by autonomous vehicles. Turning into a winner? Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH) gave investors a lesson in addition by subtraction this week after it announced it would be spinning off its powertrain business as a completely separate, publicly traded company -- a move that helped drive Delphi's stock more than 10% higher on the day it was announced. In the press release regarding the plan, President and CEO Kevin Clark said: As a result of our strategy to grow and expand through organic investments, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships aligned to the safe, green and connected industry megatrends, our Electrical/Electronic Architecture and Electronics & Safety businesses are well positioned for significant growth as the only global provider of an integrated "brain and nervous system" of the vehicle. We have the advanced technologies, engineering capabilities, and cost structure to be a global leader in the rapidly evolving mobility sector. Image source: Delphi Automotive's May 3, 2017, spin-off presentation. While the powertrain business was a valuable one for Delphi, this spinoff will enable management of the remaining company to better focus on a future of driverless vehicles. This isn't a wildly new strategy for Delphi, either, as the company has been shedding its lower-margin segments for years. Since mid-2015, it has divested itself of its thermal, reception systems, and mechatronics businesses. Once its powertrain business is spun off, it will leave a company focused on end-to-end solutions for smart mobility and autonomous driving. Delphi will focus on the "brains" of the vehicle, which will include active safety and autonomous systems, data and services, and infotainment systems; it'll also focus on the "nervous system," which includes power and signal distribution, sensing, and over-the-air (OTA) and vehicle connectivity. With this spinoff, Delphi is going to increasingly become a popular investment for those looking to profit from the coming growth in autonomous vehicles and smart mobility. Management also estimates that between additional architecture, sensors, radar/lidar, and embedded controls and algorithms, as much as $5,000 content per vehicle could be added. That's a valuable chunk of a high-margin business, and Delphi seems poised to earn its fair share. Daniel Miller has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

The telecommunications giant will pay about $3.1 billion in an all-stock deal to acquire Straight Path Communications, which holds a treasure trove of wireless licenses useable in future super-fast next-generation 5G mobile and fixed broadband services. Straight Path, based in Glen Allen, Va., holds valuable spectrum licenses -- in the high-frequency bands of 28 gigahertz and 39 GHz -- for which devices and services are expected to be deployed over the next few years. These 5G services promise much faster speed than current wireless technology, as well as better connectivity and improved battery life.  "Think of it as Wi-Fi on steroids," said Roger Entner, founder of Recon Analytics. Beyond mobile service, 5G can supply improved wireless home broadband and connect a menagerie of connected devices, the deployment of which Intel expects to grow from 2 billion to 200 billion by 2020. Telecom providers continue to joust in a race to secure spectrum for 5G delivery. T-Mobile recently spent nearly $8 billion, its largest investment ever, in the recent FCC auction as part of its 5G plans. Both AT&T and Verizon have announced 5G trials to begin later this year. Eventually, 5G wireless can delivery speeds beyond 1 Gigabit per second (current mobile networks typically deliver in the tens of megabits per second). 5G standards have not been finalized yet, "but this gives Verizon an early lead on this high-frequency spectrum," Entner said. "But we know there will be spectrum auctions coming in the next few years. This is the first mile of a marathon run." Verizon will pay $184 per share of Straight Path stock, almost twice what AT&T had said it would pay for the company last month. Straight Path's shares were priced at $31.41 the day before its January 2017 $100 million settlement with the Federal Communications Commission for failing to timely deploy wireless services with its acquired spectrum.  At the time, the FCC charged Straight Path with "squatting" on wireless spectrum, which is considered a public resource.  As part of that settlement, Straight Path forfeited some spectrum to the FCC and must pay 20% of the proceeds from the sale to the U.S. Treasury. Straight Path was spun off from IDT Corp. after that company acquired the spectrum licenses from Winstar Communications, which filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The acquired swaths of millimeter wave spectrum can be used for 5G services nationwide, in the case of 39 GHz licenses, and the major markets (28 GHz), Verizon says.  Shares of Straight Path (STRP) dropped 20% in early trading to $178.20. Investors had hoped that the bidding war would continue, pushing shares as high as $235.88 on Tuesday and closed Wednesday at $233.79. After AT&T's bid became public, another unnamed bidding rival emerged, which Wall Street unearthed as Verizon.  Verizon will also pay to AT&T a $38 million deal termination fee. The boards of both companies have approved the transaction and expect to close the deal within nine months. Verizon (VZ) shares were down 0.5% to $46.13. The Straight Path acquisition tops off a wave of deals Verizon has made as part of its broadband and 5G expansion: in February, the $1.8 billion acquisition of fiber-optic XO Communications, which has a national fiber-optic footprint; a $1.05 billion three-year deal to buy at least that much optical fiber from Corning; and a $300 million contract, also for three years, with Prysmian Group for fiber-optic cable. "Verizon now has all of the pieces in place to quickly accelerate the deployment of 5G," said Hans Vestberg, Verizon's executive vice president and president of global network and technology said in a statement. "This is another step to build the next-generation network for our customers." Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

While 38 percent of respondents said ousting the director was appropriate, 54 percent said it was not, according to the NBC News/Survey Monkey online poll released Thursday. A plurality of respondents, 46 percent, also said they believed Trump dismissed the FBI chief because of how he handled the investigation into Moscow's interference in the election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. About a quarter of those polled, 24 percent, said they thought he was fired over his handling of the Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonWarren: Trump's voter fraud commission should be called ‘vote intimidation commission’ House Judiciary Dems call for hearings on Comey ouster Overnight Defense: Acting FBI chief contradicts White House on Comey | US-backed forces retake key Syrian city | Trump wants 'goddamned steam' on aircraft carriers MORE email investigation, while 22 percent chalked up the firing to being something else.

Rosenstein had questioned Comey's judgment and how he handled the investigation into Clinton’s private email server while she served as secretary of State. While White House aides stressed on Tuesday and Wednesday that Trump leaned on the Justice Department memo in firing Comey, the president bucked that account Thursday, saying he would have fired the FBI chief "regardless of the recommendation." The NBC/Survey Monkey poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday. “I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all,” Comey wrote in a letter to agents and friends on Wednesday that was reported by CNN. "I’m not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed." Comey’s dismissal comes amid an ongoing investigation into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russian officials in order to sway the 2016 election in the favor of Trump. A majority of respondents in the NBC/Survey Monkey poll, 55 percent, said they have less confidence in the Russia probe now that Comey is gone, while 36 percent said they have more confidence now. Comey, who ruffled feathers of both Republicans and Democrats throughout his tenure, has been the subject of public scrutiny for the past year, primarily over his handling of the Clinton probe. A majority of the survey takers disapproved of how Comey handled his top FBI position with 44 percent disapproving of his job, 25 percent approving and 28 percent saying they didn't know enough to say. Approval for how Comey handled the Russia investigation tied with the percentage of people who did not know enough to have an opinion at 34 percent, while 27 percent disapproved. In comparison, 57 percent of survey takers disapproved of how Comey handled Clinton’s email investigation compared to a mere 19 percent approval, while 20 percent of participants didn’t know enough to have an opinion. The online survey of 3,746 U.S. adults likely to vote was conducted May 10-11. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.

So how did that work out? (Yuriy Humber) the brief Tech companies are now trading like the utilities of old. Photo: iStock Businesstech stocks Tech companies have become a drag on economic growth The volatility of tech stocks has fallen below the volatility of utility stocks By David P. Goldman May 12, 2017 3:48 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 The stock market’s so-called Fear Index, the VIX gauge of implied volatility on S&P index options, traded this week at its all-time low of around 9.75%. Only on a couple of occasions during the past 30 years has VIX dipped this low, and commentators are puzzled by the apparent expectation of market stasis, despite the uncertainty of a new administration, the vagaries of Fed policy, and the worrying fact that US stocks are priced to perfection. There’s a simple answer to the riddle: It isn’t the same market. Once upon a time the US stock market had disruptive challengers changing the economic landscape — Apple, Google, Cisco, Intel and a half dozen other upstarts. The same companies are there, but they have morphed from the equivalent of Luke Skywalker to Jabba the Hut. Tech companies used to be aggressive growth stocks, the kind that young people bought for long-range gain, while retirees stuck to less-volatile instruments like utility stocks. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox The world officially went topsy-turvy this year, when the volatility of tech stocks fell below the volatility of utility stocks. The graph shows the implied volatility of options on the S&P tech sector ETF (ticker XLK) vs. the implied volatility of options on the S&P utilities sector (XLU). Options on volatile stocks cost more than options on stable stocks, because volatility increases the likelihood of a payout. Implied volatility is backed out of the prices of traded options, and reflects investor expectations about future stability. Why would investors expect less volatility from tech stocks than from utilities? Because they are utilities, that is, utilities with neither debt nor regulation. Power, water and sewer companies charge a stable fee to a predictable base of customers. They borrow heavily to build facilities, and are subject to public regulation, such that changes in interest rates and public policy can affect their value. Historically, though, they were widow-and-orphan stocks, the least risky sector of the equity market. In the disruptive days of the 1990s tech boom, the volatility of the S&P technology subsector was two to three times the VIX index. Today the implied volatility of XLK, the tech sector ETF, is actually lower than the VIX. The tech companies have brought down the overall level of market volatility. Tech companies now sit atop a virtual toll booth and impose a charge on a myriad of transactions. Like water and power companies, they have monopolies, although these monopolies are driven by the price of infrastructure and the network effect. Google has the Internet-advertising monopoly. Microsoft has the personal computer software monopoly. Amazon has the Internet sales monopoly. Facebook has the targeted advertising monopoly. And Apple has the oddest monopoly of all: it is the vehicle by which customers assert their individuality by overpaying the largest-capitalization company in the world. Jonathan Taplin observed in the New York Times: “In just 10 years, the world’s five largest companies by market capitalization have all changed, save for one: Microsoft. Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Citigroup and Shell Oil are out and Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon and Facebook have taken their place. They’re all tech companies, and each dominates its corner of the industry: Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market. In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.” No-one can challenge Google, because the network effect self-reinforcing: the more people rely on it for searches, the more comprehensive it becomes. Websites design their content and coding to maximize Google hits, enhancing its monopoly position. Few websites can survive without Google push ads, which means that Google can tax Internet traffic until the cost of advertising makes it unprofitable. No-one can challenge Amazon. The physical cost of its warehouse infrastructure places a formidable threshold in front of any would-be competitor, and it is a brave business indeed that would forego Amazon’s platform for Internet sales. That allows Amazon to charge a toll on roughly half of all E-commerce in the United States. Business startups used to have a shot at the big time. Now they are sharecroppers on the Amazon-Google-Microsoft-Facebook plantation. The monopolies allow them to make a living, but charge them a toll on every transaction steep enough to keep them small. Product quality has nothing to do with it (as any user of Microsoft Windows will attest). The technology itself fosters a winner-take-all environment, and the winner can squeeze future competitors. As Ryan Cooper wrote recently in The Week: “What makes Google’s search dominance profitable is network effects. Without a large internet to index, and a huge number of people looking for things online, even the best imaginable search would be worthless. The upshot here is that both Google’s overwhelming search dominance and their profitable exploitation thereof are almost wholly unmerited in terms of their actual product. Google is a fine tool, but what defines the company is luck. Its profits come from a largely unearned strategic position within a socially-created communication medium.” Ryan Cooper, Jonathan Taplin and other commentators have suggested some form of regulation or anti-monopoly action to break up the monopolies. Google has long anticipated the day in which the sharecroppers would rise up against the plantation house, and tries to insure itself against such action by cultivating political influence. In 2014, it spent more money lobbying than any other US company. Last year The Guardian described Google’s “revolving door” of senior government advisors hired to lubricate relations with European governments. At Barack Obama’s 2008 Democratic Convention in Denver, the Google party was the premiere event with security that rivaled that of the White House (I crashed it by means that I will not here reveal). Most persuasive is the fact that the tech companies trade like monopolies. They walk like a duck, quack like a duck, and fly like a duck. The collapse of market volatility betrays paralysis, not confidence. A market with no volatility has no upside, either. I do not believe that regulation or anti-monopoly action is much of a solution to the problem, although it might mitigate some of the baneful effects of the tech monopoly. The trouble is that the United States is still coasting on the impact of inventions first made practical in the 1960s and 1970s: mass-produced integrated circuits, inexpensive lasers, light-emitting diodes, and the Internet itself (a latecomer in 1983). The rise of Microsoft, Google, Apple and Facebook could not have been anticipated 40 years ago, even after the building-blocks were already on the market. We have yet to invent the next generation of technologies that will displace the existing monopolies. And until we make concerted effort to do so, the American economy will languish in the sort of stasis that the options markets reflect.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    I watched the recent Senate Hearing regarding Russian election interference with a combination of outrage and disgust. Much as I predicted, nothing was said that indicated anyone in the Trump administration — either present or former — had been guilty of collusion with Russia. The hearing embodied the misdirection and obfuscation that has been the hallmark of "Russiagate" from the beginning — in addition to showcasing the highly selective moral outrage of the former Obama administration and its officials. Sadly, the intelligence community (IC) continued its downward spiral in the public’s view — this courtesy of politically appointed officials and pliant, sycophant bureaucrats. As a retired CIA officer, this pains me. Let's examine some key points: Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper seemed to be forthcoming and honest in his assessment of the situation. His key observations were that 1) The Russians were also believed to have hacked into Republican party databases 2) The DNC was hacked following unheeded FBI warnings, 3) Putin sought to "advantage" Trump (I suppose much like Obama sought to "advantage" French President Macron by endorsing him last week!)…but most importantly, 4) Clapper continued to see no evidence of collusion with Russia. Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, however, was far more disingenuous and slippery in her testimony. From my optic, Yates was relying on the "secret" rubric heavily, yet was very happy to document her speculation, the bureaucratic processes she enabled and the steps taken to allay her "concerns" over Flynn’s relationship with Russia. I took careful note of some of Yates’ statements, and my 18 years CIA experience has helped me to read between the lines of her testimony — and I do not like what I see. When asked about Gen Flynn’s possible Russian collusion, for instance, Yates stated she couldn't answer, citing classified information as reason for declining. Oddly, she added that her "non-answer" neither implied his guilt nor innocence. Why would Yates add that disclaimer if she indeed had secret intelligence that Flynn was guilty of some crime? There isn't a logical answer to this. Such a statement, however, would make sense if Yates had no criminal evidence, but wished, hiding behind the curtain of secrecy, through inference to cast an unjustified shadow of suspicion on Flynn and by extension, the Trump administration — but without the messiness of an actual accusation. Yates’ response to the question as to why DOJ was concerned when one Trump White House official apparently lied to another was that it created a situation where Flynn was "susceptible to blackmail by Russia." That is a personal assessment — no more. As a Case Officer who dealt with Russian Intelligence Officers on a weekly basis for many years, I would consider blackmail a possibility — not a certainty. Yates’ actions here were possibly benign, but is that the real reason she notified the White House? It is CIA Operations 101 to build up book on one’s reporting sources (agents). Intel officers have to look at anyone’s actions or statements holistically — does Yates have a record that imparts trust? Should I, as a Case Officer, accept her testimony at face value? I am compelled to answer in the negative. How about this possibility? A partisan Yates (her answers to Sen Cruz’ questions dispelled any doubts as to her partisan mindset) notified the White House of her "concerns" about Flynn ostensibly to avoid his "compromise" — but this act represented another, subtle means for an ex-Obama official to "stick it" to the Trump administration? We must remember that official "concern for inappropriate behavior" can ultimately be a judgment call. We are expected, and have in the past, trusted public servants that claimed to have "classified information" and trusted that they would act in good faith and from impersonal motives. I would not trust Yates to fulfill these obligations. Why did Yates not simply say that she had classified information that Flynn had committed a serious violation? She could have done this without breaking any rules (Flynn was in fact fired for obfuscation/lying — but that is not a crime). By dwelling on her — Yates by "concern," and inferring guilt, she was attempting to sabotage the Trump administration. Yes — Yates obeyed the letter of the law, but much like Susan Rice, was playing "fast and loose" with the rules. This constitutes abuse of power in my book, plain and simple. An ornate theory? Yes, but not unprecedented — because I have personally seen this exact power play used in CIA as a means of character assassination. The name of Counterintelligence Chief James Jesus Angleton is rather infamous at CIA. A once brilliant officer, in his later years Angleton initiated a vicious "mole hunt" in the early 1960s, an action that destroyed careers by casting a shadow of suspicion on some Agency officers from which they never recovered. I am sure Angleton followed all of CIA’s CI investigatory procedures to the letter; but no solid evidence was ever uncovered. This was not necessary, however to crush careers and lives — inference amounted to accusation. I can imagine Angleton at a Senate hearing giving similar testimony to that of Yates, had he been asked — lending credibility to his phantom chasing by hiding behind the classified "curtain." Both Clapper and Yates pointedly denied leaking any information or knowledge of such leaks. Both denied targeting Trump or any other campaign officials. Interestingly, however, both stated that they had seen intelligence that included "incidental collection" of "unmasked" Trump campaign and administration officials. This seeming incongruence underlines that "unmasking" and "incidental collection" remain the crux of this entire affair — and the source of genuine scandal. Susan Rice’s continued refusal to testify before the Senate is a large part of the real story. The real story is not the accusation of Russian collusion — so far baseless — but is instead the Obama administration’s overreach responding to this Russian collusion allegation. The Obama administration gamed the system, to include using the intelligence community to unmask on a wholesale basis Americans in a sort of political fishing expedition. So what is the average American to take away from this Hearing Monday? Sadly, it is that Yates represents another highly partisan senior government official (Susan Rice would be amongst the others) who seems to have been all too willing to abuse the power of her office to effect political gain — at the expense of the prestige of not only Justice, but the IC. By playing right to the edge of legality, but perhaps never crossing it, I suspect both Rice and Yates will never see charges brought against them — because though they have violated no laws, I firmly believe they have acted in bad faith and unethically (shocking for Washington, I know!) Clapper in his testimony stated correctly that the goal of Russian interference in any Western election is for purposes of creating dissension and undermining trust in that society’s institutions. Unfortunately for us, we have any number of American officials who seem all too willing to assist Russia in that destructive mission. Scott Uehlinger is a retired CIA Station Chief and Naval Officer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Cisco’s Hyperinnovation Living Labs hosts 48-hour blockchain brainstorm The Innovation Hangar is well hidden within the historic structures of San Francisco’s Palace of Fine Arts. Look a little deeper within the domed scenery and you’ll find the hangar—a vast open space with a rounded ceiling and a length that seems to go on and on. Cisco’s CHILL (or Cisco Hyperinnovation Living Labs) invited executives, customers, thinkers, and innovators inside the hangar for a whirlwind 48-hour rapid prototyping lab on May 2nd and 3rd to discuss how to secure the digitized supply chain powered by blockchain. Glowing, blinking orbs are strewn across the expanse of the hangar—large lanterns specifically hung by CHILL Senior Innovation Architect Shannon Lucas to physically represent a blockchain. One hanging lantern turns red while the rest glow green. The red orb, representing one node in a blockchain that has been overtaken with malicious intent, begins to blink. The blinking signifies how the rest of the blockchain can detect the hack with transparency, and work to rectify it in real time. With blockchain, trust is distributed. Every participant is a part of the whole that controls the process. Soon, the blinking red lantern turns back into green: the invader has been pushed out. Rapid prototyping: Kill your darlings This is the reality that Cisco and companies like GE, DB Schenker, Citi, and Intel are trying to create—the most innovative concepts for blockchain and supply chain that can transform the industry as a whole. The CHILL process allows key players in this industry—experts, creatives, customers, executives, and most importantly, end users—to have a hand in the rapid prototyping process. The furious speed at which the teams work helps create somewhat of a pressure cooker where the best concepts rise to the top. See also: Cisco takes Berlin by 48-hour brainstorm CHILL is comprised of four main teams: the Concept team, the Build team, Insight team and the Investment Panel. Concept teams are comprised entirely of senior executives who have industry knowledge , budgetary responsibility, and can help drive the solutions they create after a lab. For this specific CHILL experience, Concept teams were split into five opportunity areas: Intelligence at the Edge, Securing the Virtual Supply Chain, Cross Border Transactions, New Ways to Move, and Safe, Certified, and Circular.  These five teams come up with the concepts that are then given to the Build team to actualize. Build teams are made up of designers, programmers, and creatives—the dreamers who can help bring the Concept team’s concepts to life. The Insight teams are filled with experts from various industries who help answer questions about the larger business world—everything from market to competitor analysis. The catch? Concept and Build teams must present their prototype to fifty end-users every 90 minutes; and if they don’t like it, the idea is scrapped and the teams start from scratch. By the end of the first day, the five Concept teams must have at least one prototype they have all agreed on, and Build team works through the night to make the prototypes come to life. It’s a hurricane of an experience that culminates with each team making a concept pitch at the end of the second day. These pitches represent the most innovative, user-tested thinking from the best in the industry. Impossible spaces Lucas and CHILL Innovation Architect Manager Alice Pollard designed the hangar’s speakers to blast the Star Wars theme song every time the 90-minute ideation period is up. The end users walk out of their set lounge at the cue of the theme to inspect any new ideas, a mark that teams recognize as the possible beginning or end to a prototype. The end user group is constructed from players across field and company—a vice president from one company may be working hand-in-hand with a factory floor foreman from another. A poster that hangs on the outside of the end users’ lounge reads “Killed any darlings lately?”A poster that hangs on the outside of the end users’ lounge reads “Killed any darlings lately?” with a tattoo design of a skull and banner that adds, “Set free that which you love”. This theme of trial-and-error is crucial to CHILL lead Kate O’Keeffe, who urges that the best ideas come from working, reworking, and reworking once more. Concept teams are formed in pods that create one whole circle, (called the “Arena”) while the Build team sits at workstations right in the middle. This physically prepares Concept teams to constantly keep their prototypes and end-users front-of-mind at all times. “Impossible spaces create impossible thinking,” says Pollard. The hangar is also outfitted with what the CHILL team refer to as “vignettes”, or real life replicas of supply chain locations—a loading dock with packages and a border control room help teams visualize their prototype as well as aid in presenting concepts to end users. To foster out-of-the-box thinking, the entire Innovation Hangar was transformed into a space to let CHILL participants dream big. Co-everything Supply chain is a crucial field for Cisco and other companies. The total of all the supply chains present at CHILL was half of a trillion dollars. CHILL helps determine the theme for each living lab brainstorm by keeping an ear to Cisco, its customers, and the industry. Cisco found that companies believed blockchain and security in the realm of supply chain could positively impact their business. Cisco Innovation Engineering Lead Anoop Nannra states that applying the blockchain to Cisco’s massive network of 500 million globally-deployed devices alone could create major disruption and transformation. See also: Supply chain digitization and positive impact “This process is all about creating concepts that Cisco and its customers will want to co-invest in,” says CHILL Prototyping Lead Justin Muller. The process of collaboration between companies can aid in improving supply chain as a whole. Citi Ventures’ Director and Co-Head of Strategic Growth Initiatives Emily Turner says that because Citi is so well-placed in supply chain, CHILL can help them learn even more. “Cisco is a role model in the space,” says Turner, “It has great skill with ecosystem engagement—we come here seeking things to learn.” Turner, joined by Citi colleagues Managing Director, Citi Commodities Jose Cogolludo and Global Head of Shipping and Logistics, Shreyas Chipalkatty, says he has two outcomes he’s looking for most from CHILL—the learning journey and the experience with co-creation and collaboration. All-nighter Concept teams aren’t allowed a bus ticket back to their hotel at the end of the first night without approval from the Build team. “The Build team needs to create five, shiny new prototypes by morning,” says Pollard. With the help of coaches, prototype pitches are practiced throughout the night and well into the second day. The crest of the CHILL event occurs late afternoon of day two, where Concept teams hit the stage, still under the mass of glowing lanterns. Innovation at it’s most creative, most pressurized form is presented to the CHILL constituency.  CHILL’S culmination occurs as teams pitch to the investment panel for funding.  Pathways for funding include building startups from scratch or creating joint projects.  It’s here where teams stand in front of Cisco executives as well as executives from their own companies. “CHILL is very structured in an un-structured way,” says Intel’s Vice President of Global Supply Management Jackie Sturm, “Everyone is open to the possibilities that we can solve for our businesses. My team is incredibly smart, we have a person in IT, a commodities trader, a manufacturer.” “I’m very excited for the end result,” adds Vice President of Customs at Schenker of Canada Limited, “CHILL is an opportunity to recreate and create value for supply chain. We’re all coming together as a group—to find a common solution to a problem is very rewarding.” Beyond innovation and the creation of new industry-breaking solutions, CHILL represents what can happen when peers from across fields come together to collaborate.

By Mike Berry Published in Commercial Real Estate May 11, 2017 2:01 pm Mike Berry of Hillwood Properties and Hillwood Urban. Uber’s April announcement that Dallas-Fort Worth has been selected as one of two test cities (Dubai, being the second) for its new airborne service, Uber Elevate, was exciting news for our entire region and for those of us on the Hillwood team. We’re thrilled that Frisco Station—the project we are developing in partnership with Van Trust Real Estate and The Rudman Partnership that will foster a productive, creative and inspiring environment—will be home to one of the first Vertiports in Uber’s network and an international focal point for what promises to be a tech story unlike any other. In the past few weeks, I’ve heard from colleagues and friends all over the country about the announcement, and many have been interested to know how our region was selected for such a high-tech pilot program (no pun intended). And then, this past week, Facebook formally opened its massive data center at AllianceTexas, which will bring more than $1 billion in total investment when complete. The bottom line: tech is riding high in North Texas and the rest of the world is taking note. This comes as no surprise to those of us who’ve been a part of the North Texas business community for any length of time. While we’re not historically mentioned in the same breath as Silicon Valley, North Texas has long been a major player in the tech industry. In fact, our two histories are somewhat similar. Whereas Silicon Valley was launched by Bill Hewlett and David Packard, we trace our roots to equally regarded pioneers—Erik Jonsson, Eugene McDermott, and Patrick Haggerty—founders of Texas Instruments. Both companies were founded in the 1930s, but became technology powerhouses in the 1950s. And, while Gordon Moore launched Intel in 1968, Ross Perot and Charles Tandy were just beginning to hit their strides with Electronic Data Systems and Tandy Corp./RadioShack, respectively. When Apple emerged in the 1970s, bringing the concept of the personal computer to general consciousness, it was actually RadioShack that brought it to the masses. Though it would be hard to convince anyone under the age of 40 today, RadioShack’s TRS-80 model outsold the Apple II by a factor of five—dominating the personal computer industry during the first half of the 1980s. All the while, defense companies like General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin Aero) and Bell Helicopter, among others, were beginning work on the advanced computer aircraft systems that, today, dominate the skies of the world. So where did our vibrant tech industry go after the 1980s? The truth is that it never really left. Today, Texas is the number two state for technology jobs in the nation, and even though the Austin area is home to Dell, North Texas clearly leads the state in technology jobs. According to Cyberstates 2017, the leading annual analysis of tech industry employment (compiled by CompTIA), North Texas added more than 3,000 technology jobs in 2016, bringing the region’s total to nearly 210,000 workers at close to 11,000 tech business establishments. Compare that number to Austin’s, which boasts 113,000 tech employees at 5,000 business establishments, and Houston’s, which has 136,000 employees at 8,100 tech companies.   Though both are impressive, and Austin continues to be a darling in the industry, North Texas is leading the way and is poised to see its biggest growth in the technology sector ever. Last year, The New York Times featured an in-depth story on the growth of the data center market in the region, highlighting the Facebook facility at AllianceTexas and the growth of data centers in Richardson’s Telecom Corridor and Collin County. Just within the past year in Collin County, we’ve seen Skybox Datacenters open the first phase of its 21-acre campus and Stream Data Centers expand its regional presence with the recent opening of a 16-acre campus. The increased presence of data centers in North Texas mirrors the rapid growth taking place across the region over the past decade. As more businesses and individuals relocate here, the demand for data has never been greater. Companies need more bandwidth as they transfer data to the cloud to make it easily accessible to employees at any location. Individuals are using greater amounts of data as they expand their use of video streaming services and integrate additional types of wireless technology, such as fitness bands and VR devices, into their daily lives. Growth is not the only thing bringing data centers to North Texas. Redundancy is another factor, especially at AllianceTexas where the Brazos Co-Op and Oncor come together at the same location to generate power independently. It also helps that Texas operates on its own electrical grid, separate from the rest of the nation. These combined factors mitigate the risk that data center operations will be disrupted by power outages. Affordable electrical rates stemming from deregulation are another thing working in our favor. We’re also seeing a new generation of tech incubators thriving. We’ve embraced this concept at AllianceTexas, providing assistance to two innovative and successful startup concepts, with Booster Fuels (on-demand, app-based fuel delivery service) and Pickup (on-demand, app-based pickup truck hauling service)—both of which have showcased our region in the national media. Hillwood’s not alone in this effort. Local incubators such as Tech Wildcatters are working with entrepreneurs to invest money, time, and resources into promising tech concepts. Local organizations are also creating an environment in which technology companies and startups will thrive. In 2015, the Dallas Regional Chamber partnered with D Magazine to create Dallas Innovates, a digital source offering news, features, profiles, and commentary that is relevant to entrepreneurs. Dallas Innovates supplements this news with a daily e-newsletter, speakers, and other events. In Richardson, the Tech Titans organization has become the largest technology trade association in Texas, representing more than a quarter million employees through 300 member companies. Tech Titans hosts more than 30 events annually and provides resources for growing future technology leaders, supports the current technology workforce, advocates for technology’s advancement in governmental arenas, and helps connect people within the industry. These are exciting times for technology in North Texas. This region is fully engaged in the technology sector, and we have the workforce in place to fulfill the ever-growing demand as more tech companies establish their footprint in our communities. With unprecedented resources and support available for technological innovation, what lies ahead could transform the way the rest of the world views this region.

MindMeld can create AI-powered conversational interfaces. MindMeld tech and its 10 patents surrounding AI and deep learning will be used to improve Cisco Spark and other Cisco collaboration products. The MindMeld platform for the creation of bots and voice-powered assistants launched last fall. The MindMeld API is currently being used by more than 1,200 companies around the world. Customers and investors include Google, Samsung, Intel, Telefonica, Liberty Global, IDG, USAA, Uniqlo, Spotify, and In-Q-Tel, a CIA investment fund. Cisco decided to acquire MindMeld, a company that’s been called “Siri on steroids,” because many bot experiences today are disappointing, IoT and applications VP Rowan Trollope wrote in a blog post today. “The rise of messaging apps, and the conversational bots which have followed, have given us a tremendous number of bots which are impressively bad at natural language conversation. They do OK with canned responses, but try to have a semi-unstructured conversation to get them to do something and the experience tends to be poor, frustrating and decidedly non-human,” he wrote. “Bringing the MindMeld team to Cisco is a giant leap forward in helping our customers experience the next generation of interactive, conversational interfaces.” Cisco collaboration software competition includes other enterprise chat players including Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts Chat, and Slack. The $125 million acquisition in cash and assumed equity awards is expected to close by Q4 of 2017.

In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. (AP) In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15mph (16 to 24kph) - just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn't dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there's the "California Stop," where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the "Pittsburgh Left," where it's customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Michigan, drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. "There's an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules," said Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school's autonomous car research. Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That's because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. "Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don't understand social graces," said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University's Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing's giant traffic jams. In India's capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they're equipped with automatic emergency braking. "It's hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology," says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota's autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice-president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing's traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, said John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel's Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyse four terabytes of data in 1½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That's equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng said. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the "Pittsburgh Left" by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes.      Still, some sceptics say computerised cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. "You'll never be able to make up a person's ability to perceive what's the right move at the time, I don't think," said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long, who works in the traffic and public safety office. - AP Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology Tesla starts selling solar roof Electric car maker Tesla has added another product to its lineup:...

Slideshow Nvidia Rolls Volta GPU For 'AI Revolution' Volta taps 12nm TSMC and Samsung HBM2 Rick Merritt 5/11/2017 01:21 PM EDT 2 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — Machine learning is sparking a new era in computing, according to Nvidia’s chief executive, who hopes that his latest GPU, Volta, becomes its favorite fuel. The Volta announcement was the centerpiece of a two-hour keynote at GTC on “Powering the AI Revolution.” The annual Nvidia event attracted a record of more than 7,000 attendees, thanks to rising interest in using an expanding array of neural networks across a broadening horizon of applications from agriculture to pharmaceuticals and public safety. Nvidia’s graphics processors hold a strong position in training neural nets for machine learning. “Every single cloud company in the world has Nvidia GPUs provisioned for a cloud service,” said founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. But it’s a hotly competitive field. More than a half-dozen startups are working on new architectures, two of them acquired last year by Nvidia’s largest rival, Intel, The x86 giant also bought established FPGA maker Altera, whose chips are used as accelerators in the data centers of Baidu and Microsoft. Rival AMD also is accelerating its rollout of new GPUs with its Vega chip due soon. However, AMD has only recently added a strong focus on machine learning to its pursuit of the game market. Nvidia is running as fast as possible to stay ahead. Its 815-mm2 Volta will pack 5,120 CUDA cores and 16-Mbytes cache to deliver 7.5 64-bit floating point TFlops. It is made in a 12-nm FinFET process at TSMC and is packaged with 16 GBytes of Samsung HBM2 memory running at 900 GBytes/second. Volta delivers a 50% better general-purpose performance than last year's Pascal, said Jensen Huang. (Images: EE Times) The Volta processors, called Tesla V100, can link to each other or to CPUs at 300 GBytes/s via an Nvidia proprietary NVLink. The chip also packs new instructions enabling 4x4 matrix operations that are at the heart of 640 new Tensor cores in the chip. The net result is a 50 percent performance boost over the Pascal chip that the company launched a year ago and started shipping last fall. Volta delivers 120 Tensor TFlops, 12 times the performance of Pascal on training jobs. With its Tensor cores, Volta is “no longer a general-purpose GPU architecture, so Nvidia cannot be accused of using its GPU hammer and seeing every problem as a nail,” said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research. “Although Volta is more efficient [than Pascal] running deep-learning workloads, Nvidia didn’t compare it with Google’s TPU ASIC.” Nvidia was vague on why it chose the TSMC 12-nm node. Mobile SoCs are racing into production with the 10-nm TSMC node, while the 12-nm node is based on a shrink of TSMC’s 16-nm process, Krewell noted. “It could be that the 12-nm node offered faster time-to-market, but Volta is also a huge die and is pressing the limits of die area.” “I think [that] Nvidia will wait until late Q3 or early Q4 to bring out a graphics-only version of Volta,” said Jon Peddie, principal of Jon Peddie Research. “That would be an appropriate time to do it as AMD will be bringing out their highly anticipated Vega in Q3, and if it’s as good as many people think it will be, Nvidia can push back with its GTX-based Volta.” Engineering managers from Amazon, Baidu, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Tencent released statements supporting Volta. They were joined by a technology leader from a U.S. national lab. As with past generations, Nvidia will supply not only chips, but its own systems, packing up to eight Voltas. They include two 2.2-GHz Xeon E5 processors and 128-Gbytes memory and draw 3,200 W to deliver up to 960 TFlops of 16-bit floating-point performance.

That's inference not training. EDIT: Nvidia seems to claim up to x12 for training and x6 inference.   "is still in PC game chips, but it's a market that is declining" Nope, PC gaming is growing and pretty nicely actually as there is a trend towards higher FPS, higher res and VR pushing ASPs up. PC gaming will keep growing until discrete glasses are good enough. AMD was out of the high end (above 300$) for an entire cycle , they get back into it with Vega and that will impact Nvidia's share and ASPs but the market itself is growing.

LEAD 14 Things Ridiculously Successful People Do Every Day Dr. Travis Bradberry shares the unique habits of some of the world's most successful people. Try them out and see where they take you. By Travis Bradberry Dr. Travis Bradberry is the co-author of Emotional Intelligence 2.0 and co-founder of TalentSmart, a San Diego provider of emotional intelligence tests and training, serving more than 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies. @talentsmarteq Author, Emotional Intelligence 2.0@talentsmarteq WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Having close access to ultra-successful people can yield some pretty incredible information about who they really are, what makes them tick, and, most importantly, what makes them so successful and productive. "Whenever you see a successful person, you only see the public glories, never the private sacrifices to reach them." - Vaibhav Shah Kevin Kruse is one such person. He recently interviewed over 200 ultra-successful people, including 7 billionaires, 13 Olympians, and a host of accomplished entrepreneurs. One of his most revealing sources of information came from their answers to a simple open-ended question: "What is your number one secret to productivity?" In analyzing their responses, Kruse coded the answers to yield some fascinating suggestions. What follows are some of my favorites from Kevin's findings. 1. They focus on minutes, not hours. Most people default to hour and half-hour blocks on their calendar; highly successful people know that there are 1,440 minutes in every day and that there is nothing more valuable than time. Money can be lost and made again, but time spent can never be reclaimed. As legendary Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller told Kevin, "To this day, I keep a schedule that is almost minute by minute." You must master your minutes to master your life. 2. They focus on only one thing. Ultra-productive people know what their "Most Important Task" is and work on it for one to two hours each morning, without interruptions. What task will have the biggest impact on reaching your goals? What accomplishment will get you promoted at work? That's what you should dedicate your mornings to every day. 3. They don't use to-do lists. Throw away your to-do list; instead schedule everything on your calendar. It turns out that only 41% of items on to-do lists ever get done. All those undone items lead to stress and insomnia because of the Zeigarnik effect, which, in essence, means that uncompleted tasks will stay on your mind until you finish them. Highly productive people put everything on their calendar and then work and live by that calendar. 4. They beat procrastination with time travel. Your future self can't be trusted. That's because we are time inconsistent. We buy veggies today because we think we'll eat healthy salads all week; then we throw out green rotting mush in the future. Successful people figure out what they can do now to make certain their future selves will do the right thing. Anticipate how you will self-sabotage in the future, and come up with a solution today to defeat your future self. 5. They make it home for dinner. Kevin first learned this one from Intel's Andy Grove, who said, "There is always more to be done, more that should be done, always more than can be done." Highly successful people know what they value in life. Yes, work, but also what else they value. There is no right answer, but for many, these other values include family time, exercise, and giving back. They consciously allocate their 1,440 minutes a day to each area they value (i.e., they put them on their calendar), and then they stick to that schedule. 6. They use a notebook. Richard Branson has said on more than one occasion that he wouldn't have been able to build Virgin without a simple notebook, which he takes with him wherever he goes. In one interview, Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis said, "Always carry a notebook. Write everything down. That is a million dollar lesson they don't teach you in business school!" Ultra-productive people free their minds by writing everything down as the thoughts come to them. 7. They process e-mails only a few times a day. Ultra-productive people don't "check" their e-mail throughout the day. They don't respond to each vibration or ding to see who has intruded into their inbox. Instead, like everything else, they schedule time to process their e-mails quickly and efficiently. For some, that's only once a day; for others, it's morning, noon, and night. 8. They avoid meetings at all costs. When Kevin asked Mark Cuban to give his best productivity advice, he quickly responded, "Never take meetings unless someone is writing a check." Meetings are notorious time killers. They start late, have the wrong people in them, meander around their topics, and run long. You should get out of meetings whenever you can and hold fewer of them yourself. If you do run a meeting, keep it short and to the point. 9. They say "no" to almost everything. Billionaire Warren Buffet once said, "The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say 'no' to almost everything." And James Altucher colorfully gave Kevin this tip: "If something is not a 'Hell Yeah!' then it's a no." Remember, you only have 1,440 minutes in a day. Don't give them away easily. 10. They follow the 80/20 rule. Known as the Pareto Principle, in most cases, 80% of results come from only 20% of activities. Ultra-productive people know which activities drive the greatest results. Focus on those and ignore the rest. 11. They delegate almost everything. Ultra-productive people don't ask, "How can I do this task?" Instead, they ask, "How can this task get done?" They take the I out of it as much as possible. Ultra-productive people don't have control issues, and they are not micro-managers. In many cases, good enough is, well, good enough. 12. They touch things only once. How many times have you opened a piece of regular mail--a bill perhaps--and then put it down, only to deal with it again later? How often do you read an e-mail and then close it and leave it in your inbox to deal with later? Highly successful people try to "touch it once." If it takes less than five or ten minutes--whatever it is--they deal with it right then and there. It reduces stress, since it won't be in the back of their minds, and it is more efficient, since they won't have to re-read or re-evaluate the item again in the future. 13. They practice a consistent morning routine. Kevin's single greatest surprise while interviewing over 200 highly successful people was how many of them wanted to share their morning ritual with him. While he heard about a wide variety of habits, most nurtured their bodies in the morning with water, a healthy breakfast, and light exercise, and they nurtured their minds with meditation or prayer, inspirational reading, or journaling. 14. Energy is everything. You can't make more minutes in the day, but you can increase your energy to increase your attention, focus, and productivity. Highly successful people don't skip meals, sleep, or breaks in the pursuit of more, more, more. Instead, they view food as fuel, sleep as recovery, and breaks as opportunities to recharge in order to get even more done. Bringing It All Together You might not be an entrepreneur, an Olympian, or a billionaire (or even want to be), but their secrets just might help you to get more done in less time and assist you to stop feeling so overworked and overwhelmed. What do you do to stay productive? Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me. Special thanks to Kevin Kruse for assistance with this post.

Much like an annual physical, a quarterly business check-up will allow you to avoid the financial pitfalls experienced by far too many pest management professionals. May 11, 2017 Jeff Fenner Subscribe Fleet Management Solutions, Sponsored by Fleetmatics How is success measured? It is not an easy question to answer and the metrics used to judge success often change with the trends of the time. Benchmarks are often set by your peers and by the profession you endeavor in.  In an industry like pest management which is dominated by small to mid-size businesses, time is a precious commodity few can afford to use unwisely. Determining what to benchmark in their business or what a benchmark actually is or does for the company, is an important first step in the process. The starting point for small business owners is to constantly evaluate the business and identify problem areas that need attention. To get a successful benchmarking program off the ground, it is wise to remember the following key steps: • Decide what needs to be done and how you want to accomplish it. • Set timeframes to achieve those goals. • Get to work and be very tactical. A tried and true tool that business owners can turn to comes from legendary management expert, author and consultant Peter Drucker.  Drucker’s often-referenced S.M.A.R.T. theory for setting and achieving goals has been used by generations of owners and managers looking to sharpen efficiencies and improve performance. Successful small business owners and management consultants will tell you having a plan to follow for benchmarking your company’s progress and setting goals is the “smart” thing to do.  The “smart” thinking movement was started by legendary management guru Drucker who, in the course of his storied career, consulted with a “Who’s Who” of Fortune 500 corporations including Coca-Cola, IBM, General Electric, Procter & Gamble and Intel to name a few. Drucker first introduced the S.M.A.R.T. theory of tracking goals in his 1954 book The Practice of Management to help business owners and managers set and measure their performance. Drucker encouraged managers not to get caught in the “activity trap” of being so deeply involved in the day-to-day activities of their business that they were unable to remember the main purpose or objective of their operation. The core principles of the S.M.A.R.T. theory have stood the test of time and resonate as strongly today as when Drucker first introduced them. As with any business theory, the final results depend on the execution. The following is a review of Drucker’s original theory and how small business owners can apply it to their business. Is Your Goal Specific? Small business owners should set very specific and clearly defined goals. Know what you want to accomplish, why the goal is important to your organization, and how you and your team will accomplish this goal.  Is Your Goal Measurable? Measurable goals include targets and benchmarks small business owners can use to track their progress along the way. Paint a clear target for yourself and your employees. Is Your Goal Achievable/Attainable? Any goal set by small business owners should be realistic. It is good to dream big but if the achievement bar is set too high, failure and its unwanted fallout will occur. Break down your goal(s) into smaller segments that allow you to easily measure achievement, and put you and your team into the best position to succeed. Is Your Goal Realistic? Do the goals you came up with make sense for your business? Certain goals may work for General Electric or Delta Airlines but how effectively can you apply them to a 15-person operation? Make sure the goals align with your resources and finances, your industry (i.e. snow and ice management), your customers and your employees. Is Your Goal Time-Related? When do you want to accomplish your goals? Set a realistic timeline for reaching your goal(s) and keeping the enthusiasm and momentum moving forward to a successful conclusion. So what is the payoff of going through the performance measurement and benchmarking process? First, is that you gain a clearer picture of your industry. You see what your peers are doing and how you measure up against them. Are your operating systems, equipment and technology, compensation levels, and marketing efforts ahead of the curve or lagging behind? The second benefit is that along the way you will learn things about your business that will help you expand, make it run more efficiently or more profitable. Talking to your technicians may produce ideas on how rescheduling routes can increase productivity or how a change in treatment protocol can lead to better results and more satisfied customers.  The third benefit is that going through the process will broaden your personal and professional horizons. You will become a better manager of people and process. You will learn things that can help your business expand and discover new revenue streams and markets. And most important of all, you will improve the overall health of your company.

The appeal for the original Itanium parts was support for RAS features, ECC, and cores focus on a wide, parallel architecture - the latest cores support 12-wide execution for example. For a short while, there was success: HP’s systems based on Itanium are advertised as high-uptime mission critical servers, and a number of customers cling to these systems like a child clings to their favorite blanket due to the way they are integrated at the core of the company. The main purpose was to compete against other mission critical servers and mainframes based on SPARC and IBM Power. So when the processors were initially delivered to customers, there was potential. However the initial impression was not great - they consumed too much power, were noisy, and needed over the top cooling. Over the years and generations of Itanium, the march into the x86 enterprise space with x86-64 drew potential Itanium customers away, then followed the drop of Microsoft's support for Itanium in 2008, and Oracle's dropped support in 2011. Xeon offerings were becoming popular, with CPUs incorporating the RAS/ECC features required, and Intel decided to slow down Itanium development as a result. In the meantime, due to the way the market was moving, HP transitioned a good part of its product stack to Xeons. Despite this, legal battles between HP and Oracle ensued given predicted support for HP-UX customers. At this point, there were fewer potential Itanium customers each quarter, although existing customers required support. Today marks the release of the final known variant of Itanium, the 9700 series, beyond assurance testing. Intel spoke to IDG, stating that this generation, code-named Kittson, would be the final member of the Itanium family. These chips are likely to only end up in HP-based Integrity i6 high-uptime servers running HP-UX, and start at $14500. Hewlett Packard Enterprise has stated previously that it will keep support for Itanium-based products until 2025, with the latest OS update (HP-UX 11i v3 2017) coming in June. As for the processors themselves, four 9700 processors form the stack, with quad-core and eight-core parts all with hyperthreading, differing in frequency, power, and L3 cache. Intel Itanium (Kittson) CPUs   Cores/ Threads Base Freq L3 TDP Cost* Itanium 9760 8/16 2.66 GHz 32 MB 170 W $4650 Itanium 9750 4/8 2.53 GHz 32MB 170W $3750 Itanium 9740 8/16 2.13 GHz 24 MB 170 W $2650 Itanium 9720 4/8 1.73 GHz 20 MB 130 W $1350 *Cost is listed for the equivalent Poulson CPUs. The base silicon comes in at 3.1 billion transistors, and are made on Intel’s 32nm process. Memory is supported up to DDR3-1067, with two memory controllers but support for scalable memory buffers is present. This is similar to the 9500 series, code-named Paulson. These chips are designed to be purely a drop into previous systems. Intel isn’t announcing an official press release around this, and unlike other ‘new architectures’, there are next to zero improvements. According to the documents, the only change is that the top two SKUs get a clock bump: There’s probably something new under the hood, perhaps for a specific end-customer, but at this time Intel is directing anything 9700 related to equate to the 9500 series. Customers still interested in Itanium are directed to HPE resellers.  Carousel Image from Konstantin Lanzet (Wikipedia) of Itanium 2 (Poulson) News Source: IDG Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 32 Comments View All Comments XabanakFanatik - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link Interesting how the Introduction document header says 9700 series, but the list of models beneath are all 95xx models. Document typo? Reply Ian Cutress - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link Parts of the document that mention the 9700 all seem to be copy paste of the 9500 sections. Reply LauRoman - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link I understand that it's an old architecture meant for some entities that smehow haven't moved off Itanium. Even if we forget the cost... 130W tdp for a quad core 1.73 ghz? Reply SarahKerrigan - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link A lot of the TDP is the uncore needed to support 8-socket glueless SMP. Reply mczak - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link I'd guess the actual power consumption is probably much lower (because the TDP compared to the much higher clocked, twice the core count versions is really incredibly high). Nevertheless, this is built on a 32nm process - you're not going to win any efficiency benchmarks using that... intel is lucky to still have a manufacturing plant for these new chips ;-). Reply DanNeely - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link Old fabs live for several generations past when they stop being state of the art. For Intel it's mostly chipsets and (I'm assuming) network adapters. Reply mczak - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link Yeah I know that was just a joke (by the looks of it, intel operates fabs back to 65nm). But just to put this in context, Ivy Bridge (built on a 22nm process) was released nearly exactly 5 years ago. The last "big core" x86 chips built on 32nm was Sandy Bridge over 6 years ago. Reply tipoo - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link So is Intels Itanium 'flop' still single handedly bigger than all of AMDs cashflow?

Reply Nagorak - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link Yeah, funny how abusing a monopoly position to freeze out the competition results in great profitability.

Chuck GrassleyChuck GrassleyGrassley: Branstad could be confirmed by next week GOP senators pitch Merrick Garland for FBI director Grassley: There will be a Supreme Court vacancy this year MORE (R-Iowa) says the FBI must confirm whether the agency is investigating President Trump. “It should confirm to the public whether it is or is not investigating the president. Because it has failed to make this clear, speculation has run rampant,” the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman said, according to a prepared statement for his committee’s executive business meeting. Trump claimed in his termination letter to FBI Director James Comey this week that Comey told him “on three separate occasions” he was not under investigation.

Grassley said Comey did not want to list names or tell them whether the president was under investigation because it would lead to a “slippery slope” in which other names could ultimately be revealed. “I understand why he took that position, but I don’t agree — at least not when it comes to the president and senior government officials. The American people deserve to know if senior government officials are under active criminal or intelligence investigation,” he said. The Iowa senator said rumors and conspiracy theories about the FBI being out to get Trump further damages Americans' trust in the nation’s democracy. “The intelligence community said that one of the Russians’ goals is to undermine the American public’s faith in our democratic institutions. Wild speculation that the FBI is targeting the president in a criminal or intelligence inquiry is not just irresponsible and unfounded,” he said. “It provides aid and comfort to the Russians and their goal of undermining faith in our democracy.” Tags Dianne Feinstein Chuck Grassley   View the discussion thread.

(AMD) Stock Will Rebound Recent Posts: 3 Stocks to Buy Thanks to Big Post-Earnings Discounts Why Groupon Inc (GRPN) Stock Is Far Too Scary to Be a Good Bargain 3 Reasons Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Will Rebound View All Posts For a little over a year, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) could do no wrong. AMD stock dipped below $2 in early February 2016. Over the next twelve and a half months, AMD stock rose about 700%, clearing $15 at the end of February 2017. It was a stunning run for a stock that had been “dead money” since the financial crisis. Source: Shutterstock The sentiment toward AMD stock has changed quickly, however. Advanced Micro Devices has declined about 32% since those late February highs, including a punishing 24% decline after Q1 earnings last week. The recent declines seem like too much. The core story that sent AMD stock rocketing higher in 2016 still holds. And there are still a number of reasons to believe that Advanced Micro Devices will rebound from the recent weakness — even if investors might need to be patient. AMD’s Ryzen Launch Is Working And Continuing The selloff in AMD stock didn’t come from Q1 numbers, which essentially were in line with expectations. And the best news in the first quarter was the strength in the recently launched Ryzen 7 CPU. Revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment increased 18% year-over-year, which Advanced Micro Devices management attributed to the Ryzen launch. Gross margin company-wide expanded 200 bps — again, due to Ryzen. Margin concerns long have kept a lid on AMD stock, as the Advanced Micro Devices historically has struggled with consistent profitability. The new Ryzen line has the ability to improve overall margins, and mitigate that problem. As Bank of America pointed out, Ryzen 7 allowed AMD to both take pricing and take share in desktop from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). The Ryzen line more generally has made Advanced Micro Devices a stronger competitor. And with Ryzen 5 launched in Q2 and Ryzen 3 due in the back half, the benefits to AMD stock haven’t been fully realized yet. Advanced Micro Devices: Naples Is On The Way Advanced Micro Devices is going after Intel in another area: datacenters. The Naples server CPU will be launched in late Q2, per CEO Lisa Su on the AMD Q1 conference call. And Naples seems a legitimate competitor to Intel’s Broadwell. And in datacenter, pretty much any kind of a win for Naples should benefit both AMD earnings and AMD stock. Advanced Micro Devices has basically no presence in servers, with its market share declining from 25% a decade ago to under 1% at the moment. Even single-digit share gains alone have the possibility of  driving double-digit revenue growth for AMD. Combined with operating leverage, any success from Naples — where early reviews seem reasonably strong — should set the stage for stronger earnings growth in the second half of 2017 and beyond.

The ubiquitous presence is in everything from data storage to streaming content to cloud computing to a million items that are ancillary but still directly related to performance from the cloud. That exposure to everyday life will only grow as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and consumer technology continue to grow. A new RBC research report notes that the largest cloud and hyperscale providers spend a staggering $60 billion in total capital expenditures each year. Cloud service provider capex grew 8% year over year in the first quarter but declined 14% quarter over quarter. However, the second quarter is expected to grow 17% quarter over quarter and a staggering 19% year over year. The report noted: We believe that there continues to be opportunity for increasing average selling prices and continued mix-shift to IT hardware-spend, including server CPUs and increased storage spend, as cloud data growth continues to outpace the overall market. Semiconductor and hard disk drive (HDD) companies stand to benefit the most, and these four top companies are the big winners. Broadcom This stock has been on fire over the past year and remains a top pick across Wall Street. Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) has an extensive semiconductor product portfolio that addresses applications within the wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial end markets. Applications for Broadcom’s products in these end markets include data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems and displays. Top Wall Street analysts like the leadership in the mobile, data center and broadband markets, and especially in the radio frequency (RF) arena. Many on Wall Street see a cyclical rebound in industrial and communications demand. Broadcom will report its most recent quarterly results at the end of this month. Broadcom investors are paid a 1.76% dividend. The Wall Street consensus price target for the stock is $249.03. Shares closed most recently at $231.33. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers, and the IoT is a big part of the shift. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. Earlier this year the company announced the purchase of Mobileye for $15.3 billion. The Israel sensor company gives the chip giant a leg up in the autonomous car competition, and it also adds many other capabilities. This is a big IoT segment going forward. First-quarter numbers were affected by lower data center spending, but with second quarter and year-over-year numbers expected to grow, the tech giant is well positioned for the future. Intel investors are paid a 3.03% dividend. The consensus price objective is $40.15. The shares closed most recently at $36.01. 24/7 Wall St. JPMorgan Stays Bullish on Semiconductor Equipment Stocks: 4 to Buy Now Pages: 1/2 « How Much Does a Boeing 737 MAX Cost?

Watch the action live in 360 degrees. https://t.co/4KP7YWjM3y— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) May 11, 2017 ADVERTISEMENT If you can't make it to Ponte Vedra Beach in Florida for this week's The Players Championship tournament, Twitter is offering almost the next best thing. From today (May 11) until May 14, PGA Tour is live streaming the event on Twitter and Periscope, in addition to a live virtual reality and 360 video of the 17th hole's island green at TPC Sawgrass. The 360 video can be viewed on phones by following @PGATour or via the PGATour stream. The live VR experience is available through the PGA TOUR VR Live app for Samsung Gear VR headsets on the Oculus store. READ NEXT Driving ambition: group of scientists create 3D-printed golf club Driving ambition: group of scientists create 3D-printed golf club By Stuart Hood PGA This live VR stream was made using Intel's True VR technology and shows footage from three VR cameras – one on the 17th tee, one on the walkway from tee box to the green, and one camera mounted in the water next to the island green. "The PGA TOUR has experimented with virtual reality content for nearly two years," said Rick Anderson, PGA Tour chief media officer. "We tested Intel’s True VR technology on a live basis at the Genesis Open in February and... decided that a live VR experience on one of the most dramatic holes in golf was something our fans would love". ADVERTISEMENT This is the first time Twitter has offered live 360 video during a major sports event and follows an announcement about the partnership earlier this year. Twitter’s live coverage of the PGA Tour, available weekly at pgatourlive.twitter.com, has averaged almost half a million viewers a day, more than 70 per cent of which are under 35 years old. This all forms part of a larger push into sports for the social network following its recent partnership with Sky Sports for Transfer Deadline Day. For an hour in the afternoon and evening on January 31, Twitter live-streamed news with Sky hosts Natalie Sawyer and David Garrido joined by Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry.

TECHNOLOGY Your IT Guy May Be Lying to You A new study reveals that tech people may not be as honest as you'd hope By Gene Marks Gene Marks is a columnist, author, and small business owner. He oversees the Marks Group, a 10-person technology consultancy to small and medium-size businesses. A certified public accountant, Marks has also worked in the entrepreneurial services arm of KPMG. He writes for The Washington Post, Forbes, and The Huffington Post. @genemarks Owner, Marks Group@genemarks 1 COMMENTS CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Everyone's got an IT guy. He's the geek in the office - or maybe he's part of a team of geeks if your company is of a certain size. Otherwise he's either your one full-time technical person or he works for an IT firm that you have under contract. And sorry ladies, but despite the tireless efforts to get more women working in technology, it's more likely than not that in 2017 your IT support person will still be a dude. You trust your IT guy, don't you? He's the person you go to when a printer or device breaks. You involve him in all decisions you make regarding technology. You ask him for recommendations when you're looking for a new application for your business. You rely on him to make sure all your systems are updated and current so that your network is protected against viruses and malware. You bounce ideas off him when it's related to tech. He fills a role in your company that no one else really fully understands - and seems wise in the dark magic of Microsoft, Google, Apple, Intel, Dell, Lenovo and other tech firms. This is his terrain and you pay him a wage, an hourly rate or a monthly support fee to be your company's representative in this dark, mysterious world. So here's a waker-upper: your IT guy may not be as trustworthy as you thought. A new study released by a cybersecurity firm called Bromium found that more than one in three "security professionals" (that's your IT guy, especially if you run a small business) isn't being honest with you. 35 percent admit to "circumventing, disabling or otherwise bypassing their organization's security" and one in ten have gone so far as to quietly pay ransomware demands without telling their boss (ransomware is the billion dollar industry where hackers manage to encrypt a victim's file and demands a small ransom - anywhere from $50 to $250 in bitcoin or some other digital currency - for the unlock key). "While we expect employees to find workarounds to corporate security, we don't expect it from the very people overseeing the operation," said Bromium co-founder and CTO Simon Crosby in a company blog. "To find from their own admission that security pros have actually paid ransoms or hidden breaches speaks to the human-factor in cyber security." Look, your IT guy doesn't have it easy. The ones serving small companies are assumed to be expert in many areas that require specialization - from networking to security to data management to the simple fixing of a printer. This may cause, according to this Tech Republic report, "security fatigue" or the "weariness or reluctance to deal with computer security." Many of the tech pros who responded to the study complained about all the things they had to do - like investigating security warnings, addressing password change requests, configuring changes, documenting issues - that they often throw their hands up in the air. Some, unfortunately, are not as vigilant as they should be or think they know more than they actually do. This is not a knock on the IT profession. Because I run a company that implements customer relationship management systems, I work with many competent and caring IT professionals. The Bromium study just reveals what we all know: IT guys, like everyone else in your company, are just human. When something bad happens on their watch, regardless of whether it's their fault or not, they're sensitive of being blamed. Many will choose to cover up a problem or, in the case of ransomware, pay a few bucks to make it go away, rather than risk looking incompetent. Bromium's solution is to be more wary, train your people and - surprise - buy one of their security monitoring products. These are not unreasonable suggestions. But in the end, particularly if you're a small business owner with many balls in the air, your exposure to this problem will come down to whether or not you hired the right IT guy (of firm) for the job. Is he honest, reliable and trustworthy? Do you believe what he's telling you? Does he do good work for others that you know and trust? Can you look him in the eye and figure out whether he's BSing you or not? The better you are at judging people the better the people you will hire to assume jobs that you don't have the time (or skills) to do - like information technology. For the rest of us who aren't as great judging people well...we'll just have to take our chances. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Adds Digital Identity Startup, Trust Stamp, to Its Membership Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Adds Digital Identity Startup, Trust Stamp, to Its Membership An elite alliance of the world’s leading blockchain innovators founded the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) in February 2017 to augment Ethereum and enable it to serve as an enterprise-grade technology, with research and development focused on privacy, confidentiality, scalability and security. This exclusive invitation only group has recently admitted Trust Stamp, an Atlanta Tech Village-based biometric identity startup, to its founding membership. Atlanta, GA, May 11, 2017 –(PR.com)– The EEA’s founding members include companies such as Accenture, BNY Mellon, Intel, J.P. Morgan, and Microsoft. The group is committed to developing new innovations within Ethereum as well as identifying and commercializing specific implementations to meet a growing number of enterprise needs. Trust Stamp has created a new paradigm for identity & trust using proprietary AI powered facial biometrics with proof of life to authenticate user identity offering enterprises a secure, low friction methodology to identify and recognize their customers. In 2016 Trust Stamp was recognized as one of the Top 30 Blockchain startups in the world and also won the Publicis90 Gold Award at Viva Technology in Paris.

Trust Stamp co-founder, Gareth Genner, said: “Ethereum offers numerous advantages in developing enterprise solutions, not least of which is the growing availability of open source implementations. Because of its immutability and security, a private Ethereum Blockchain is an excellent platform to store and share hashed biometric tokens.” Trust Stamp CEO and co-founder, Andrew Gowasack, said, “Blockchain deployment of our biometric identity solution is a key milestone on our development roadmap and the Alliance offers an exciting opportunity to collaborate and innovate with global thought leaders in the Ethereum Blockchain community.” CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Endonovo Evaluating Therapeutic Potential of Non-Invasive Electroceutical for Treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Next PostNext Lincoln International Represents Karoun Dairies in its Sale to Parmalat Search Recent Posts TeamTalk puts off CityLink fibre capex in deals TeamTalk puts off CityLink fibre capex in deals NZ median house price eases in April, number of sales tumble NZ median house price eases in April, number of sales tumble Readout of Meeting Between U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Israeli Justice Minister Shaked RSS RSS Feed Proudly powered by WordPress

Tom Krisher Associated Press May 11, 2017 Detroit—In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 miles per hour – just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In a few years, well-mannered, self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robocars and is slowing their development.  In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there’s the “California Stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh Left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Mich., drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” said Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s autonomous car research. How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing’s giant traffic jams. In India’s capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with automatic emergency braking. “It’s hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Ms. Winter says. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing’s traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, said John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel’s Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1-1/2 hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That’s equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Mr. Zeng said. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh Left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Windows 10 is now running on 500 million devices, Microsoft says The company also announced both Intel and HP are planning to pack Cortana voice assistant in their upcoming devices. By Sarmistha Acharya May 11, 2017 14:31 BST Windows 10 now on 500 million devicesMicrosoft Microsoft's latest Windows 10 is now running on 500 million devices since its release in July 2015. The announcement was made by company's chief executive officer Satya Nadella on Wednesday (10 May) at Microsoft's annual Build developer conference in Seattle. At the 2015 Build developer conference, Microsoft's Windows chief Terry Myerson said the company wanted to see Windows 10 running on 1 billion devices. "Our goal is that within two to three years of Windows 10's release there will be 1 billion devices running Windows 10," he had said. However, this time the company acknowledged that it would take longer time to reach that goal, although it did not set a new timetable for that. After the Windows 8 disaster, Windows 10 represents a comeback. Windows 8's ill-conceived design lead to a decline in PC sales and further contributed to the departure of Steve Ballmer, states an Associated Press report. The company even tried piggyback on Windows Phone devices, but the attempt went in vain. Microsoft points out this as reason for not meeting its one billion target in time. Gartner analyst Ed Anderson has said Microsoft is building its products with business and government agencies in mind. Microsoft is quite hopeful to win over consumers with Cortana voice assistant to rival Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. It recently unveiled an internet connected speaker featuring Cortana. The company announced on Wednesday both Intel and HP plan to pack Cortana in their upcoming devices. It also encouraged programmers to design applications that help Cortana perform the tasks the consumers want.

Self-driving truck goes 120-plus miles on delivery Michigan may not require a human in self-driving test cars DETROIT (AP) — In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 kph) — just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In a few years, well-mannered, self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robocars and is slowing their development. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there’s the “California Stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh Left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Michigan, drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” said Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s autonomous car research. Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing’s giant traffic jams. In India’s capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with automatic emergency braking. “It’s hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing’s traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, said John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel’s Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1 ½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That’s equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng said. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh Left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. “You’ll never be able to make up a person’s ability to perceive what’s the right move at the time, I don’t think,” said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long, who works in the traffic and public safety office. ____ Allen G.

Subscribe on iTunes http://apple.co/2eX6Eay ... Visit the online home of Playbook http://politi.co/2f51Jnf Good Thursday morning from San Francisco. And welcome to day three of “ComeyGate.” The past 48 hours has been a political and P.R. disaster for President Donald Trump and the White House. By all accounts, Trump’s decision to dump FBI Director James Comey wasn’t based on a methodical review of the facts. Instead, it appears like many of Trump’s more controversial decisions to be a gut driven response based purely on personal animus in this case -- Comey wasn’t loyal enough, didn’t support Trump’s claims that former President Barack Obama wiretapped him and wasn’t moving fast enough to find those responsible for leaks about Trump. Story Continued Below NEW QUINNIPIAC POLL -- “American voters, who gave President Donald Trump a slight approval bump after the missile strike in Syria, today give him a near-record negative 36 - 58 percent job approval rating, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released [Wednesday]. Critical are big losses among white voters with no college degree, white men and independent voters. … Today’s job approval rating compares to a negative 40 - 56 percent approval rating in an April 19 survey ... American voters’ opinions of several of Trump’s personal qualities are down: 61 - 33 percent that he is not honest, compared to 58 - 37 percent April 19.” http://bit.ly/2r4DTLx -- THOSE NUMBERS are brutal for Trump, particularly the losses among key demographics of the Trump coalition. It’s important to note: the poll was commissioned before Comey’s firing, so Trump’s approval is unlikely to rebound anytime soon. **SUBCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh REPLACEMENT WATCH -- Top Republicans on Capitol Hill tell us that Trump has been soliciting suggestions on who should be the next FBI director. The fact that Trump went ahead with firing Comey without a replacement in mind is stunning. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein – who played key roles in Comey’s ouster – are reportedly moving quickly to find a replacement, possibly coming up with a choice in the next few days, ABC News reports. However, that person will face a potentially brutal nomination hearing, as many Republicans and Democrats will use the hearings to vent their frustration over the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections. -- BUZZ -- KELLY AYOTTE FOR FBI? Ayotte, the former New Hampshire Republican senator who helped shepherd Neil Gorsuch through his Supreme Court confirmation process, would make sense: she’s a former state attorney general. Her confirmation would sail through the Senate. IT’S NOT JUST DEMOCRATS -- who are frustrated with Trump. Sen. Richard Burr has been one of the most upset by Comey’s dismal. This could be a big problem for Trump. The North Carolina Republican is leading the Senate probe into Russia. Burr and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) invited Comey to testify in private before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week. SOMETHING TO WATCH -- The Senate Intel Committee subpoenaed former national security advisor Michael Flynn – fired by Trump after being caught lying about his discussions with Russian officials – demanding any Russia related documents he has. See Ali Watkins’ piece http://politi.co/2qW4aP9 Flynn, who is under investigation over his failure to disclose Turkey lobbying, has refused to appear before the panel unless granted immunity. DEMOCRATS may be outraged by Comey’s firing, but there’s very little they can do about it except protest, for now. Democrats’ calls demanding a select committee and special prosecutor to look into Russia aren’t likely to happen at this point. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan have made that clear. But that isn’t stopping them from pushing to expand the Russia probe. (Big thanks to Bres for sending his late-night thoughts on the view from Capitol Hill) WE ASKED, YOU ANSWERED -- “Pete Sessions: Comey should have been removed ‘in a more gracious way,’” by Dallas Morning News’ Keven Ann Willey: “Texas GOP Rep. Pete Sessions of Dallas, whose father was the last FBI director ousted by a president, said Wednesday that ... the president, in a face-to-face meeting, should have given Comey the opportunity to step down. That would have avoided the issue of ‘a firing.’ That word, Sessions said, is ‘a tag on a man who ... performed reasonably well and it got out of hand.’” http://bit.ly/2pl9oE6 JIM COMEY’s farewell letter to F.B.I. staff: “I have said to you before that, in times of turbulence, the American people should see the FBI as a rock of competence, honesty, and independence. … My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.” http://bit.ly/2q5nEiZ ROGER STONE fires back at POTUS -- statement emailed at 5:47 a.m. this morning: “With all due respect to the President, I am not the source of the New York Times, Politico or CNN stories and have never claimed I convinced the President to fire FBI Director Comey. Both Politico and the Times claim to have multiple credible sources for their reports. I offered no comment. ... It has been my policy not to discuss the scope, subject or frequency of my occasional contacts with the President and I am not going to do so today.” http://politi.co/2q8bSmk COMING ATTRACTIONS -- NYT’s Mike Shear, Jennifer Steinhauer and Matt Flegenheimer: “Mr. Trump is weighing going to the F.B.I. headquarters in Washington on Friday as a show of his commitment to the bureau, an official said, though he is not expected to discuss the Russia investigation.” http://nyti.ms/2quYD2f -- “Trump and Putin to meet in July, Russian state media says,” by CNN’s Ben Westcott and Tomas Etzler: “U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July as part of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Russian state media said Thursday. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the announcement after meeting with Trump in Washington Wednesday, according to Tass. If confirmed, it would be the two men’s first meeting since Trump took power in January. The White House has yet to confirm.” http://cnn.it/2q8gUPT A BIG THANK YOU to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif), Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra for participating in our first Playbook Exchange in San Francisco. MCCARTHY, who has spoken to Trump about Comey’s firing, defended the president’s decision. Cristiano Lima reports: “McCarthy, broaching the subject for the first time since Comey’s ouster late Tuesday afternoon, said the director had drawn politics into the bureau by acting beyond the reach of his role. ‘I would argue that Comey made the FBI political,’ he said. ‘That’s probably not the place to be.’ McCarthy added that Comey had made himself ‘a household name,’ something he argued no FBI director should do.” http://politi.co/2q5eUK6 … The video http://politi.co/2q84szk ****** A message from PhRMA: Patients share the costs of medicines. They should share the savings. Robust negotiations between biopharmaceutical companies and insurers often result in significant rebates and discounts. Insurers should share more of these rebates with patients. Providing access to discounted prices at the point of sale could dramatically lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs.

But his choice of words may have doomed him with President Donald Trump. He found the testimony last week infuriating and griped about it extensively for at least two days, several associates and advisers said. ... [S]enior aides and other associates who know the president say the firing was triggered not by any one event but rather by the president’s growing frustration with the Russia investigation, negative media coverage and the growing feeling that he couldn’t control Comey, who was a near-constant presence on television in recent days. “Trump did not appreciate that Comey declared his campaign to be under investigation on live TV, said two people who know the president well. He didn’t like that Comey contradicted his unsubstantiated accusation that President Barack Obama tapped his phone line at Trump Tower. And Trump was displeased that the FBI seemed uninterested in pursuing investigations into the leaks he believes are weakening his administration.” http://politi.co/2r3LkTd -- “Inside Trump’s anger and impatience — and his sudden decision to fire Comey,” by WaPo’s Phil Rucker, Ashley Parker, Devlin Barrett and Robert Costa: “By last weekend, he had made up his mind: Comey had to go. At his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., Trump groused over Comey’s latest congressional testimony, which he thought was ‘strange,’ and grew impatient with what he viewed as his sanctimony, according to White House officials. Comey, Trump figured, was using the Russia probe to become a martyr. Back at work Monday morning in Washington, Trump told Vice President Pence and several senior aides — Reince Priebus, Stephen K. Bannon and Donald McGahn, among others — that he was ready to move on Comey. ... “Rosenstein threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the White House on Tuesday evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire Comey and that the president acted only on his recommendation, said the person close to the White House, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. … Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner — both of whom work in the White House — have frequently tried to blunt Trump’s riskier impulses but did not intervene to try to persuade him against firing Comey, according to two senior officials.” http://wapo.st/2pzuyti --“‘Enough Was Enough’: How Festering Anger at Comey Ended in His Firing,” by NYT’s Maggie Haberman, Glenn Thrush, Mike Schmidt and Peter Baker: “The chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who has been sharply critical of the F.B.I., questioned whether the time was right to dismiss Mr. Comey, arguing that doing it later would lessen the backlash, and urged him to delay, according to two people familiar with his thinking. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, at one point mulled similar concerns, but was supportive of the move to the president.” http://nyti.ms/2pzj3lz -- “Comey’s Firing Came as Investigators Stepped Up Russia Probe,” by WSJ’s Shane Harris and Carol E. Lee: “In the weeks before President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, a federal investigation into potential collusion between Trump associates and the Russian government was heating up, as Mr. Comey became increasingly occupied with the probe. Mr. Comey started receiving daily instead of weekly updates on the investigation, beginning at least three weeks ago, according to people with knowledge of the matter and the progress of the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe. Mr. Comey was concerned by information showing possible evidence of collusion, according to these people.” http://on.wsj.com/2qVMkM8 SUSAN GLASSER in POLITICO MAGAZINE -- “Russia’s Oval Office Victory Dance: The cozy meeting between President Trump and Russia’s foreign minister came at Vladimir Putin’s insistence”: “When President Donald Trump hosted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the Oval Office Wednesday just hours after firing the FBI director who was overseeing an investigation into whether Trump’s team colluded the Russians, he was breaking with recent precedent at the specific request of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “The chummy White House visit -- photos of the president yukking it up with Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak were released by the Russian Foreign Ministry since no U.S. press was allowed to cover the visit -- had been one of Putin’s asks in his recent phone call with Trump, And indeed the White House acknowledged this to me later Wednesday. ‘He chose to receive him because Putin asked him to,’ a White House spokesman said of Trump’s Lavrov meeting. ‘Putin did specifically ask on the call when they last talked.’” http://politi.co/2pyEV0A BACK IN THE FOLD -- “Sessions emerges as Trump’s most valuable ally,” by Eliana Johnson: “President Donald Trump was infuriated in early March when Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign. And yet, despite being legally sidelined from the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, the attorney general – the ultimate Trump loyalist — has now played an indispensable political role by helping slow it down. … At Trump’s request, Sessions and set forth their rationale in twin memos the following day. News of his meeting with the president – as well his memo, which advised Trump that ‘a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI’ – served as Trump’s first line of defense against accusations he had acted impetuously when he fired Comey without warning on Tuesday evening. “The drama was fresh evidence of Sessions’ role as a critical political player in the Trump cabinet. He has exhibited all the qualities of loyalty Trump most prizes: He was the first senator to endorse him, one of the only members of the upper chamber to embrace him enthusiastically during the presidential campaign, and, as his involvement in the Comey controversy demonstrates, has proved that he is willing to thrust himself into the breach and take political hits to advance the president’s interests. The president has rewarded that loyalty with trust. At the Department of Justice, he now enjoys full authority over the federal law enforcement apparatus.” http://politi.co/2q87Hqq THE APPRENTICE IN REAL LIFE -- “Trump holds auditions while Spicer’s away,” by Tara Palmeri and Hadas Gold: “Press secretary Sean Spicer’s absence from the briefing room on Wednesday comes at a tenuous time, as President Donald Trump has asked senior advisers for weeks if he needs to change the face of his administration, several White House officials and outside advisers to the president said. Trump was pleased with deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ performance on Friday, when she first filled in for Spicer on camera during the midday briefing, three White House aides said, adding that he has talked about grooming her for Spicer’s more visible role. They said the press team’s much-criticized handling of Trump’s decision Tuesday to fire FBI Director James Comey may have further made the case to Trump that Sanders should take over the podium. “Trump has asked senior aides for their opinions about her performance since Friday. He thought she did well again on Wednesday when she had the difficult task of taking questions about Trump’s blockbuster announcement that he’d ousted Comey, one White House official said. Sanders will cover the briefings for the rest of the week, since Spicer is on Naval Reserve duty, as he was last Friday when she took the podium. Naval reservists are required to serve one weekend per month and 10 days per year.” http://politi.co/2q5fffx TRUMPCARE WHIPLASH -- “MacArthur endures town hall trial-by-fire,” by Ryan Hutchins and Katie Jennings in Willingboro, N.J.: “At his Wednesday night town hall, Rep. Tom MacArthur, one of the chief architects of the revamped GOP Obamacare replacement plan, was called a liar. A man who said his wife had battled breast cancer stood to say MacArthur was the ‘single greatest threat to my family in the entire world.’ Another demanded to know whether it’s ‘true that rape can be considered a pre-existing condition.’ “For nearly five hours, MacArthur faced an onslaught as he spoke here at a community center in the bluest town in this South Jersey-based swing district. Dozens of protesters gathered outside, some lying on the parking lot holding signs in the shape of tombstones. Inside, the congressman was shouted down by constituents and others in the audience of 250 people. It was a prime example of the anger, confusion and raw emotion surrounding the GOP’s replacement health care plan, and a glimpse at why the party’s House majority suddenly seems in jeopardy in 2018.” http://politi.co/2q5VoN3 THE JUICE… -- SPOTTED: Sarah Huckabee Sanders at Tupelo Honey in Arlington on Wednesday evening, getting dinner with her family, including husband and three kids. -- FIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- BLOOMBERG this morning is officially announcing the Global Business Forum, a one-day event at the Plaza Hotel in New York City this September hosted with the Alibaba Group, Dangote Industries Limited, EXOR, and the MiSK Foundation.

Initially a ban on laptops and tablets was applied only to U.S.-bound flights from 10 airports in North Africa and the Middle East. The ban was based on U.S. fears that terrorists have found a way to convert laptops into bombs capable of bringing down an airplane. ...

[I]t’s time for Congress to get serious about performing its constitutional duties. ... First, the Senate must insist that Trump replace Comey with an independent and experienced new director, one who will commit to completing any investigations into the president now underway.

So why is a visit to the pharmacy different? Robust negotiations between biopharmaceutical companies and insurers often result in significant rebates and discounts. In fact, more than a third of the list price for brand medicines is rebated back to payers and the supply chain. Yet, unlike care received at an in-network hospital or physician’s office, patients with high deductibles or coinsurance pay cost sharing based on the list price of a medicine, even if their insurer receives a steep discount. Insurers should share more of the rebates they receive with patients. Learn more at http://onphr.ma/2pdaE7m. ****** SNEAK PEEK – SUSAN DOMINUS writes the cover of this Sunday’s N.Y. Times Magazine, “Is an Open Marriage a Happier Marriage? What the experiences of nonmonogamous couples can tell us about jealousy, love, desire and trust” – Dominus spent a better part of a year on the story: “Open marriages — and to a lesser degree open but nonmarital committed relationships — are still considered so taboo that many of the people I interviewed over the last year resisted giving their names, for fear not just of social approbation but also of jeopardizing their jobs. It is no surprise that conservatives would perceive the concept as a degradation of marriage, of a key foundation of society. But even among progressives, the subject typically provoked, I found, a curled lip or a slack jaw. The thought bubble, or expressed thought: How?

More than a third of the list price for brand medicines is rebated back to payers and the supply chain. Yet, unlike care received at an in-network hospital or physician’s office, patients with high deductibles or coinsurance pay cost sharing based on the list price of a medicine, even if their insurer receives a steep discount. Patients share the costs of medicines, so they should share the savings. Learn more about where the discounts are going at http://onphr.ma/2pdaE7m. ****** SUBSCRIBE to the Playbook family: POLITICO Playbook http://politi.co/1M75UbX ...

Law-breaking human drivers   11 May 2017 , 17:07 #Self-driving cars Image Credits: REUTERS In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 kph) — just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there’s the “California Stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh Left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Michigan, drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” said Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s autonomous car research. Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing’s giant traffic jams. In India’s capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with automatic emergency braking. “It’s hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing’s traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, said John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel’s Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1 ½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That’s equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng said. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh Left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. “You’ll never be able to make up a person’s ability to perceive what’s the right move at the time, I don’t think,” said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long, who works in the traffic and public safety office.

An atmosphere of crisis enveloped Washington in the first full day after the firing, which was announced Tuesday.  Cable news shows were thick with talk of a constitutional crisis and comparisons to the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s that brought down President Richard Nixon. On Capitol Hill, the fissures in the Republican Party over the episode were plain, with some prominent GOP lawmakers hitting Trump’s actions and others backing him up. Democrats, meanwhile, were united — and calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor to further investigate potential links between Trump’s 2016 campaign associates and Russia. ADVERTISEMENT The minority party also began to slow Senate proceedings to a crawl in protest of the president’s actions.  And the early evening, it emerged that the Senate Intelligence Committee had issued a subpoena for Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The subpoena requested “documents relevant to the Committee’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election.” Trump, never inclined to de-escalate, instead turned the temperature up even more via his Twitter account.  He attacked one Democratic critic, Sen. Richard BlumenthalRichard BlumenthalTHE MEMO: Trump deals with gravest crisis yet Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey fallout | Senate Intel subpoenas Flynn | Bots jump into net neutrality fight | Senators want WH answers on cyber policy Dem senator responds to Trump tweets: ‘Your bullying won’t silence’ me MORE (Conn.), for his past misstatements about his service during the Vietnam War.

Several surreal moments only heightened the tense atmosphere. Trump, having been criticized by opponents as “Nixonian,” chose to meet with that former president’s secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, in the Oval Office. Trump also met with Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov and the Kremlin’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. Kislyak is the central figure in the furor that led to Trump firing Flynn in February. Photos of Trump, Lavrov and Kislyak were disseminated by a Russian state-owned news agency, Tass, which was apparently allowed into a meeting that was closed to the American media. Meanwhile, CBS News secured a brief interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was dressed in a full hockey uniform at a Sochi ice rink. “We have nothing to do with” the firing of Comey, Putin said, adding that the episode would have “no effect” on U.S.-Russia relations.  At a more substantive level, confusion clouds some central elements of the story that the Trump administration is trying to tell.  One issue is when, precisely, Trump lost confidence in Comey. Another is what motivated Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to write a memo suggesting that Comey should be removed. The White House’s media briefing room was packed on Wednesday afternoon as spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders articulated the official line on those questions. Sanders said that Trump had “over the last several months” lost confidence in Comey. But a glaring apparent contradiction has not been resolved: why Comey was ostensibly fired for being unfair to Clinton just a week after Trump tweeted that the FBI director had been too lenient on the former secretary of State.   Sanders also asserted that Rosenstein had made his views of Comey clear, unbidden, in a meeting with Trump, who had then suggested he put his thoughts in writing. Once that had been done, the president moved promptly to fire Comey.  When asked by Hallie Jackson of NBC News whether Rosenstein had decided “on his own” to review Comey’s performance, Sanders replied, “Absolutely.” But at times,  the administration seemed itself to be caught up in the chaos.  A Washington Post report on Wednesday morning detailed how, the previous evening, White House press secretary Sean Spicer had given a late interview to the Fox Business Network on the White House grounds “and then disappeared into the shadows, huddling with his staff behind a tall hedge.”  The press secretary had then emerged to talk to other reporters, but only on the condition that the TV camera lights were turned off. The same story asserted that Spicer and his staff spent more than three hours on Tuesday evening “scrambling” to answer the question of why Trump had fired Comey. The Comey furor, and the way it has been handled by the White House, has given new ammunition to opponents of the president — not all of them liberals or Democrats. Trump “could not have done it in a more ham-handed fashion, even if you are among those who believe Comey merited dismissal,” said John “Mac” Stipanovich, a veteran GOP operative in Florida and a long-standing Trump critic. Stipanovich complained that the current administration is “the gang that can’t shoot straight,” a problem he attributed to a combination of Trump’s impulsiveness and his belief that White House aides are “too deferential to the boss.” Trump allies dispute those charges, as well as the broader argument that the president may be seeking to frustrate an investigation. Sam Nunberg, an adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign, suggested that the blame for the FBI director’s firing should be laid at Comey’s own door. “James Comey did this to James Comey,” Nunberg said. At the press briefing, Sanders pushed back against suggestions that Trump was working to frustrate any probe, asserting that “any investigation that was happening on Monday is still happening today.”  That argument will cut no ice with some Democratic lawmakers, who are already raising the prospect of impeachment — as Reps. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and Mark PocanMark PocanTHE MEMO: Trump deals with gravest crisis yet Dem reps: Trump is 'moving' toward impeachment Dem vows to storm Ryan’s district to protest health bill MORE (D-Wis.) did Wednesday — nor with the progressive activists who rallied outside the White House to protest Trump’s actions. By Wednesday evening, the number of Republican senators who had expressed concern or criticism over the president’s actions had grown to 12, according to The Hill’s count.  If that chorus grows in number or intensity, it will spell even deeper trouble for Trump.

Human drivers By TOM KRISHER May 11, 2017 1:13 pm 4 min read Share DETROIT (AP) — In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 kph) — just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there’s the “California Stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh Left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Michigan, drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” says Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s autonomous car research. Sign up for the online chat with Col. Brandon Pearce, NGA's chief information security officer, May 15, 12:30 p.m. Advertisement Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” says Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing’s giant traffic jams. In India’s capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with automatic emergency braking. “It’s hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s autonomous car unit. Commentary: The nobility of public service is making a comeback Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing’s traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, says John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel’s Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1 ½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That’s equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng says. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh Left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. “You’ll never be able to make up a person’s ability to perceive what’s the right move at the time, I don’t think,” says New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long, who works in the traffic and public safety office. ____ Allen G.

Engineering teams from the two companies are already developing sophisticated software on Nvidia's high-performance AI platform, Drive PX, but the formal announcement of collaboration was only made last night. "Toyota has worked on autonomous driving technologies for over 20 years with the aim of reducing traffic fatalities to zero as an ultimate goal, achieving smoother traffic, and providing mobility for all," said Ken Koibuchi, executive general manager at Toyota. "Through this collaboration, we intend to accelerate the development of autonomous driving systems that are even more safe and capable." The Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang, echoed these sentiments regarding safe and efficient personal transport. Huang asserted that the newly announced deal with Toyota was a significant indication that an autonomous future will become reality. Nvidia says that your in-car Drive PX supercomputer will be equipped with its next-generation Xavier processor. This hand-sized device will be capable of delivering 30 trillion deep learning operations per second. Much of the processing power will be used to make sense of the endless stream of information picked up by 360-degree coverage car sensors such as multiple cameras, lidar, radar and others. The system can receive OTA updates and learn to become smarter over time. Intel-Mobileye in denial? It looks like Nvidia is convincingly dominating the technology-automotive partnerships leaderboard. Toyota is the world's largest auto maker according to the most recent figures, so is a hugely significant prize. The EETimes spoke to analysts looking at the automated driving industry as a whole and though some warned that the industry was too young to predict with certainty, it looks like Intel-Mobileye and Google are very much in the sidelines. Chart from EETimes Intel's Katy Winter, VP and general manager of its Automated Driving Group issued a statement in response to Nvidia's news. Winter said that "Intel is the only company that offers a complete suite of solutions that OEMs and tier-one suppliers need to address this enormous data challenge". She went on to hint that Intel has some other as-yet unannounced partners working on Intel AI powered autonomous cars.

Home Business Business Comment No Panama hat – just leave the planet The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race George M. Mangion 11 May 2017, 9:25am Print Version Algorithms can now recognise handwritten language and patterns almost as well as humans Professor Stephen Hawking, the astrophysicist, has made a new documentary, Expedition New Earth, as part of the BBC’s new science season Tomorrow’s World.  In it he will claim that time is running out for Earth and if humanity is to survive climate change, asteroid strikes, epidemics and overpopulation we will need to exit our planet and venture further afield. Does this mean that while the Maltese electorate are being bombarded with new promises by political leaders ahead of the snap election next month nobody seems to care that our future on this planet is threatened? No politician doing the rounds in our homes promising heaven on earth has told us that our existence on this planet is short lived and that within 100 years (unless we slow the deterioration of the environment ) we will need to colonize another planet to ensure our survival.  But who cares about the future – we live for the day.  Another nasty feeling comes when we hear about the gigantic steps taken every day by artificial intelligence (AI).  Another ominous prediction by Stephen Hawking came when he exclaimed that “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race”.  Prof Hawking says the primitive forms of artificial intelligence developed so far have already proved very useful, but he fears the future consequences of creating something that can match or surpass humans would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an exponential rate. Hawking fears that humans, limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete with such superior machines and lose control.  For a moment, let us stop and take a look at major stages of human advancement over the centuries, starting with the ancient Greeks, who laid the foundations of democracy. The Greek philosopher Plato in his dialogues with Socrates pontificated on the importance of human values, which of course many centuries later are absent in the alien world of robots and soulless machines powered by artificial intelligence. This is a foreboding legacy. AI society is at a crossroads, one which promises great opportunities, but also considerable risks. It is no exaggeration to say that if we continue to take the wrong decisions it could threaten our historical achievements.  For example, Intel is smartly developing microchips that pave the way for sensor networks which potentially mimic the brain’s capacity for perception, action, and thought. Yet there is a contrary view to the claim that we lost our “Man versus Machine” fight. Some computer scientists believe that AI can be harnessed and be our servant, not master. In science fiction films such as Matrix, we see how futuristic devices will facilitate facial recognition, interpret human comments, self-drive cars, and perform complex language translations. Some of these devices no longer exist in the realm of fantasy but became real tools as a result of advances in science and social media. Recently, Baidu, the Chinese equivalent of Google, invited the military to take part in the China Brain Project. This involves running so-called deep learning algorithms over the search engine data collected about its users. Beyond this, a kind of social control is also planned. According to recent reports, every Chinese citizen will receive a so-called “Citizen Score”, which will determine under what conditions they may get loans, jobs, or travel visas to other countries.  On a positive note, there is little doubt that this resource can be of great value, especially in big data applications. Many organisations are now collecting more data than they did just a few years ago, making use of business intelligence and descriptive analytic technologies such as query, reporting, comparing and contrasting options so in the end the massive computer power so harnessed helps in analysing what has happened in the past and with use of predictive analytics techniques opens a window leading to accurate predictions.  Undoubtedly, artificial intelligence is fast becoming a major technology for prescriptive analytics, the step beyond predictive analytics that helps us determine how to implement and/or optimise optimal decisions.  Artificial intelligence in machines can even replicate human judgements previously considered to be too complex. Steely and devoid of emotions once activated it can supervise hundreds of skilled factory operators. As if by magic complex algorithms that ‘learn’ from past examples can relieve engineers of the need to write out every command.  It comes as no surprise that cash rich Google invested $400 million in this project, which in the near future may turn out to be the building block for functional robots.  The investment in robotics fires the gun to a race for design of superior machines with abilities to recognise objects, people and pets, and determine their own actions.  For example, can we imagine how in the near future one can own robots using artificial intelligence at home – which among other things (like faithful servants) warn us when to refill the cat food dish as they can sense the bowl is empty.  In business applications, it can assess future risks, quantify probabilities and in so doing, give us insights how to improve market penetration, customer satisfaction, security analysis, trade execution, fraud detection and prevention, while proving indispensable in land and air traffic control, national security and defence. This is not to forget mentioning a host of healthcare applications such as patient-specific treatments for diseases and illnesses.  Recently, Google’s DeepMind algorithm taught itself how to win Atari games. Algorithms can now recognise handwritten language and patterns almost as well as humans and even complete some tasks better than they. They are able to describe the contents of photos and videos. Typically the giant search engine firm itself, Google, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, is developing self-driving automobiles, smartphone assistants and other examples of machine learning while it is no secret that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and actor Ashton Kutcher, recently invested $40 million in an entity focusing on developing artificial brains.  The way forward beyond 2017 is awe inspiring as soon there will be computers running faster than human brains.  It is unstoppable – computing power will continue to grow at a fast rate.  Readers may well comment that this is a blessing showing how mankind has developed its ability to programme machines using computers running at incredible speeds – effortlessly solving practical problems.  The dilemma is whether all this computing power (now housed in Cloud) can be harnessed to be our servant.  The million-dollar question is – can we succeed to instill values in brains of such behemoths?  Not so fast – scientists warn us that such unbridled power threatens the very existence of mankind.  Simply put, its ecosystem consists of a special network programmed to learn as it stores memories, empowering the device to mutate beyond its original code.  Charlie Ortiz, heading the software company Nuance Communication, feels that increased AI might be useful to solve current problems that human intelligence cannot fathom.  In his opinion, there is no reason to assume that AI will harm us even if it becomes more complex than human intelligence, yet it is in our interest to set up safeguards that will firewall our own intelligence when AI (a new god) reaches its acme and possibly mutates to become our master. To conclude, no matter who wins next month’s hotly contested general election in Malta – whether it will be the ubiquitous Panama hat sympathisers or the “Maduma “ tribe, can we contemplate that within the next century due to climate change etc., there will be no room for “Torca” party apologists nor blue-leaning journalists. The exodus for humanity is to abandon earth and try to colonise another planet. That calamity will occur if Hawking’s ill-omened prediction is fulfilled.

By Chris Duckett for Null Pointer | May 11, 2017 -- 04:51 GMT (21:51 PDT) | Topic: Artificial Intelligence (Image: Nvidia) At last year's GTC conference, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang repeatedly said that the company was all in on deep learning, and it was the year that the company unveiled its solution for the datacentre, the DGX-1. Fast forward to 2017, and the company has grown its datacentre revenue from $143 million in Q1 2016 to $409 million in Q1 2017, and the major public cloud vendors have moved from offering few GPU computing options to all having a GPU product in their portfolio. In the space of 12 months, the datacentre sector has doubled the proportion of revenue it accounts for; it now sits at a touch over 20 percent of all company revenue, and approaching 40 percent of the revenue brought in by the traditional gaming GPU cashcow. With its seeming conquest of datacentre machine learning rolling on -- Intel would unsurprisingly disagree -- if Nvidia wants to continue the spread of artificial intelligence, it needs to look at edge devices. Within the bevy of announcements trotted out at GTC 2017, the company said it is open sourcing the deep-learning accelerator (DLA) found on its Xavier board targeted at self-driving cars. Xavier ticks the boxes for fitting into edge devices with its low power, and packing enough computational power to get by on AI inference tasks. In a perfect world for the company, once the DLA is available for all and sundry, it will start to find its way across the computing world into devices and platforms that Nvidia does not concern itself with. One executive remarked during a press briefing that they fully expect to see AI find its way onto phones in the near future. If such a situation comes to pass, then expect more expensive DGX devices to find their way out the door, and plenty more new Tesla Voltas to boost the datacentre bottom line. Elsewhere in Huang's keynote on Wednesday morning, the company took the wraps off Nvidia GPU Cloud (NGC), which allows developers to burst out workloads onto the GPUs within a DGX server, or the GPUs found in public cloud providers. NGC uses a software stack stored inside an NVDocker container, with Nvidia promising to fully test and maintain the images offered. The NGC image will also run on desktops that use a 1080 Pascal GPU. In the automotive sector, it was announced that Toyota has teamed up with Nvidia to use its Drive PX modules for autonomous operations in the Japanese giant's cars. Details on the exact timing for when the results of the partnership will appear were scant, with company spokespeople only reiterating the "next few years" timeline. The company also unveiled its Isaac robot simulator for training machines in a virtual world that tries to mimic real-world conditions as closely as possible -- the idea being that if robots need to perform dangerous tasks, or developers are looking to cut down the amount of training time, they can have neural networks trained much faster and safer than in the physical world. Despite the rapid-fire nature of the announcements at GTC, the thrust is clear: Nvidia wants AI to permeate every piece of computing it can. If Nvidia's datacentre business is able to replicate its performance over the past year and almost triple its revenue again, that would put it within range of overtaking gaming as the company's primary source of revenue. It's extremely unlikely to happen in the coming year, but nevertheless, Nvidia is making inroads in the datacentre on the back of AI, and it will force itself in deeper if consumer edge devices embrace its AI vision. A problem-solving approach IT workers should learn from robotics engineers Sometimes the most profound solution is to change the entire problem.

By Corinne Reichert | May 11, 2017 -- 05:46 GMT (22:46 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Samsung and Cisco have announced the deployment of their first 5G trial network using network function virtualisation (NFV) solutions across portions of Verizon's mobile network in the United States. The trial network solution, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, consists of a Cisco Ultra Services Platform 5G virtualised packet core with Cisco Advanced Services, as well as Samsung virtual RAN (vRAN) solutions. Latest Australian news CVC pricing has nothing to do with NBN user experience: Morrow NBN complaints double again; telco complaints jump by 30 percent: TIO Roadshow targeting additional websites in piracy case Telstra 4G used in disaster management drone trial Lawyers and insurers set for data breach payday In addition, the network uses Samsung's 5G radio base stations and 5G routers. Using Verizon's 5G Technical Forum specification, Samsung, Cisco, and Verizon undertook a series of network vendor interoperability tests (NVIOT) across the trial network in a bid to achieve core network, radio edge, and user device interworking and NFV. According to the three companies, their successful trials have proved "the readiness of key 5G technologies". "We're very excited about the possibilities this opens up in terms of network architectures, particularly in view of 5G's aim to connect new industries and empower unique service scenarios," Woojune Kim, VP and head of Next Generation Strategy at Samsung Electronics, said. "A shift towards network function virtualisation creates new opportunities in the industry value chain, enabling collaboration with pioneering industry leaders to bring greater value to consumers and businesses." The companies are also set to deploy pre-commercial 5G trial networks in 10 more US cities with partners Ericsson, Intel, LG, Nokia, and Qualcomm by mid-2017: Atlanta, Georgia; Bernardsville, New Jersey; Brockton, Massachusetts; Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas; Miami, Florida; Sacramento, California; Seattle, Washington; and Washington DC. According to Cisco, Samsung, and Verizon, each city comes with a different set of "test parameters", such as different vendors, geographical characteristics, population densities, and demographics. Their successful Ann Arbor trials show that 5G networks can be individualised using their multi-vendor solution, they explained. "Interoperability, a key milestone towards 5G commercialisation, allows for highly flexible network design to meet emerging 5G use cases," Adam Koeppe, VP of Network Planning at Verizon, said. Cisco first announced that it would be providing the pre-commercial 5G architecture for Verizon's trials back in February, including its virtualised, cloud-based 5G packet core as part of its Cisco Ultra Service Platform; mobile backhaul infrastructure to enable gigabit speeds for network transport; virtualised managed services; a new set of business applications; and a pre-release version of its 5G-enabled router. Its virtualised packet core is designed to "increase service velocity by providing on-boarding and operational simplification for virtual network functions (VNFs) that help enable individual applications to be delivered to customers in real-time", Cisco said. In addition, Cisco's virtual managed services software platform utilises virtualisation, automation, analytics, and cloud services to deploy network and security services including Cisco iWAN and threat-based security solutions in a faster and more efficient way. New business applications for connectivity and performance for VR and AR will also be explored by Cisco and Verizon through the partnership. Samsung has also been working with rival US mobile carrier T-Mobile on 5G lab tests and field trials, which are set to take place throughout 2017. The partnership will initially use T-Mobile's 28GHz mmWave spectrum in combination with Samsung's 5G proof-of-concept beam-forming technology in outdoor trials, as well as Samsung's pre-commercial system. Both T-Mobile and Samsung are involved in the US government's 5G initiative, with the former Obama administration announcing last July that it would be investing $400 million in conducting trials of the technology. T-Mobile, Samsung, Verizon, AT&T, HTC, Carlson Wireless Technologies, Nokia, Qualcomm, and Oracle are contributing to $35 million in additional funding, with Samsung also a board member on the project and slated to contribute specialists to work alongside 400 university researchers on network and mmWave radio technologies. Samsung has been working on 5G technologies for years; back in October 2014, it announced attaining mobile speeds of 7.5Gbps during stationary 5G network trials, and 1.2Gbps while in a moving vehicle travelling at more than 100km/h. In February, Samsung also said it would build the United Kingdom's first 5G network in London, working with radio broadcaster Arqiva. Working with SK Telecom in South Korea, Samsung last year similarly successfully tested handover between mmWave 5G base stations at 28GHz in an outdoor environment. Samsung has also been working on developing a 5G antenna and a power amplifier and a 5G RF Integrated Circuit (RFIC) that will be used in base stations and radio access products.

Published Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Google+ Permalink Share via e-mail TO ADD A MESSAGE 
 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE The Barack Obama administration holdovers in the U.S. government rushed President Donald Trump to directly arm the PKK terrorist organization's Syrian affiliate, the People's Protection Units (YPG), ahead of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's planned visit next week, fearing that Erdoğan could personally convince Trump otherwise, multiple Turkish officials told Daily Sabah. Trump's decision to directly arm the YPG on Monday came in the middle of a high level Turkish delegation's visit to Washington whose aim was to lay the groundwork for Erdoğan's trip, and discuss alternative military plans for the already ongoing military operation to liberate Raqqa. U.S. National Security Adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster and others told Turkish officials, among them the top commander of the Turkish military Gen. Hulusi Akar, Intel Chief Hakan Fidan and Chief Presidential Adviser Ibrahim Kalın that the administration had already taken the decision to arm the YPG. "The Americans have been trying to convince us that there was no quicker option to take Raqqa but the truth is that they themselves have been divided all along," said one Turkish official familiar with the issue. The Turkish delegation repeatedly told senior U.S. officials that such a decision would undermine President Erdoğan's first in-person meeting with President Trump, and both sides willingness to open a blank page following the Obama administration's disastrous relations with Ankara. "We came to the conclusion that Erdoğan's visit was the main reason for U.S. Central Command, and Obama appointees to rush such a decision, they were concerned by the fact that Erdoğan could very well talk Trump out of this," another Turkish official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with the government protocol. Several U.S. media outlets previously reported that the Raqqa plan was initially designed by the Obama administration, and was put on hold after Trump transition officials warned them about the consequences. Washington insiders were quick to point out a similar attitude that occurred following the constitutional referendum in Turkey, where the conflicting views of Trump and other officials serving him were revealed. One day after the vote, the U.S. State Department released a lengthy statement slamming the Turkish government's conduct during the referendum, and the White House Spokesman Sean Spicer followed suit. A couple of hours later, surprising many in Washington, Trump called President Erdoğan and congratulated him on his election victory, parting from the supposed official line. Several Obama holdovers in key positions that administer the fight against Daesh have not been fired. Brett McGurk, the Obama-appointed U.S. Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter Daesh, is seen too close to YPG by many in Ankara, and also among the architects of the U.S.'s Syria policy in the administration. McGurk kept his position after intensely lobbying the Trump transition team about his past track record in the George W. Bush administration. A news report also claimed on Monday that Gen. McMaster previously clashed with President Trump, and declined to fire a list of Obama holdovers at the National Security Council, who were suspected of leaking information to the press. Bloomberg View, referencing unnamed White House officials, reported that Trump had complained in front of McMaster in intelligence briefings about "the general undermining my policy," and given McMaster less face time. On Monday, the Americans tried to break the bad news to the Turks with a gesture. U.S. officials invited the Turkish delegation visiting the White House to meet Trump in the Oval Office. Trump and Turkish officials shook hands and pictures were taken. The positive and energetic manners made Turkish officials wonder whether the decision to arm the YPG was taken by the same person. One Turkish official said the invite echoed in Ankara as an effort to sweeten the bitter pill. A National Security Council spokesman refused to comment on the Turkish officials' statement, and referred the query to the Pentagon, which officially announced the authorization Tuesday. The U.S. State Department informed the senior officials in Ankara via a phone call by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday afternoon. "Secretary Tillerson subsequently spoke to his counterpart Foreign Minister Mevlut Çavuşoğlu, and other appropriate partners were notified as well," said a U.S. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 11, 2017 10:15 am Here’s what Microsoft announced on the day one of the Build conference (Image credit: Microsoft) Microsoft kicked off its annual Build developers conference on Wednesday with a jam-packed three-hour keynote. While the company is hardly announcing a new hardware at the Build conference, the focus will be entirely to solidify its position in the enterprise segment through various tools and services. A big theme of this year was Microsoft’s consistent efforts to push artificial intelligence (AI) into all its major portfolio, from Azure to Xbox and Office. Here’s what Microsoft announced on the day one of the Build conference, which is currently happening in Seattle. You can livestream the entire keynote from the Build 2017 site. Windows 10 hits a major milestone  Windows 10 is now running on over 500 million machines, which is a great start for a new operating system. Microsoft originally set the goal of reaching 1 billion devices by mid-2018, a goal that seems unlikely to hit. Windows 10 was released in 2015, and by the end of September it was at 100 million devices. HP’s Cortana speaker In an effort to beat Amazon and Google, Microsoft announced it has inked partnerships with HP and Intel to bring Cortana-powered voice-activated speakers to the market in the near future. Unfortunately, details aren’t available about the smart speaker. Earlier this week, Microsoft and Harman Kardon announced the ‘Invoke’ Cortana-powered speaker, which will hit the market later this year. Cortana skills  Announced at the Build conference was the new Cortana Skills set, which will allow third-party developers to create new skills  – or even port existing  Alexa skills for the Windows platform. This will definitely improve Cortana and make upcoming hardware much better. Microsoft’s presentation translator Powerpoint can now translate slideshows in real time. Essentially, the translator plugin will offer real-time translation of powerpoint presentations without removing the original formatting. A Microsoft Garage project, the plug-in uses Translation APIs to translate content from any Powerpoint presentation into 10 different languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish). The plugin can also provide translated subtitles in real-time. Visual studio for Mac Microsoft has announced its Visual Studio coding platform for the Mac. It basically allows developers to code apps using Microsoft’s development environment on Apple’s Mac OS. Previously it was available for preview.

Hbsgsujsgd Reply G gvcdsdh May 11, 2017 at 11:02 am The Windows Monopoly wasn't just about developers only developing for Windows. The success was down to Kernel Watson, who's Graphical OS ran Twice as fast and cost half as much. Intelligent Programmers knew back then to use Model, View, Controller techniques and cross platform toolkits such as QT to develop portable Apps. It was only after the year 2000, that the German Goverment began using Linux, Calligra, LibreOffice. Most people only need to just a few tasks. The Mother of all Monopolies is Innovation. Secure Computers that work with Voice Commands and offer greater mechanisms for employees to colloborate will extend this monopoly a further 20 years. If Gates knew this, he would not have ruined the Worlds best Software Development Organisation. He knows very little, he just had a 13 year old Sister who had little Shame, and dropped her knickers for Dirty old Ba5tards.

At the Embedded Systems Expo & Conference (ESEC) in Japan this week (May 10-12), Congatec announced an “extended standardization initiative” called ComX. The proposed standard builds upon existing computer-on-module hardware standards such as COM Express, Qseven, and SMARC to standardize APIs and middleware, including its new Cloud API. The spec also includes some hardware standardization for COM integration with carrier boards. No other COM vendor has yet endorsed the ARM and x86 compatible standard, which Congatec plans to advance through the PICMG (COM Express) and SGET (SMARC, Qseven) standards organizations. Without third-party support or even a published spec or white paper, it appears the ComX standard will be at least initially be deployed as an API/middleware standard for Congatec’s own COMs. ComX architecture (click image to enlarge) ComX will establish “additional design-in and API standardization on top of the core standards to further simplify the development of customers’ dedicated applications based on standardized embedded computing building blocks,” says Congatec in its rather vague press release. ComX will standardize APIs IoT, cloud, and EAPI, with specific support for “IoT gateways or embedded features of COM Express Type 7 server-on-modules,” says the company. The ComX standard will also include “approved circuit diagrams and logic for demanded carrier board implementations.” These are said to include “FPGA integration, switching logic for USB-C, or for SMART battery logic.” The standard covers both ARM and x86 based COMs, and presumably it’s also cross platform in terms of operating systems. Conga-UMX6 At ESEC this week, Congatec is demonstrating several of its COMs that tap early components of the ComX spec. Principal among these is a quick boot demo running on its NXP i.MX6-based, µQseven form-factor Conga-UMX6 module. The demo taps an i.MX6 quick-boot function that boots systems “in less than a second from power off to full operation including running applications,” says Congatec. “ComX standardization includes the CPU technology independent implementation of a carrier board,” stated Christian Eder, director marketing at Congatec, in relation to the quick-boot demo. “A clever designed carrier board can utilize I2S for ARM and HDA for x86 sound implementation.” Conga-SA5 In another demo, the Intel Atom E3900 (“Apollo Lake”) based Conga-SA5 SMARC 2.0 module is used to demonstrate “fully featured USB Type C connectivity with USB 3.1 Gen1, power and graphics.” The demo appears to use a ComX API detailing a standard way to interface with Type-C connectors. “System engineers don’t need to think about the interface setup anymore,” stated Eder. Conga-B7XD Congatec is also demonstrating its Intel 5th Gen Core Xeon D based Conga-B7XD COM Express Type 7 “server-on-module” supporting dual 10 GbE and 32 PCIe lanes. “Now we need to extend the EAPI standardization for server type functionality”, stated Eder in reference to the Type 7 standard. Finally, Congatec is showing its Cloud API running on its Linux-ready Conga-IoT gateway, a commercial version of the OEM-focused Conga IoT Gateway System reference design that was announced last August. The gateway is powered by an Intel “Bay Trail” Conga-QA3 Qseven module. Conga-IoT gateway (left) and Conga-QA3 module (click images to enlarge) The Cloud API, which is “a proposed element of SGETs API standardization, is intended as a “universal hub between local sensor networks and the IoT clouds. The API is said to offer “secure bidirectional data exchange with any suitable clouds,” using “the TLS secured MQTT protocol,” says Congatec.   Other embedded API and middleware stacks Congatec is not the only hardware vendor attempting to unify a diverse set of embedded boards with similarly standardized APIs, middleware, and IoT cloud connectivity. So far, most are focusing on their own products and/or hardware from ecosystem partners designed to work with them. Eurotech was an early leader in this area with its Everyware Software Framework (ESF), an IoT framework based on the Java/OSGi Eclipse Kura project. Adlink has its Smart Embedded Management Agent (SEMA) device management and SEMA Cloud solutions for its embedded boards. Just this week, Portwell announced a line of RS4U industrial computers that all share a Portwell API stack for remote monitoring and control. Advantech’s ELAA architecutre (click image to enlarge) Advantech appears to be after something more universal with its recently announced Embedded Linux & Android Alliance (ELAA) consortium, which hopes to standardize board adoption of an “open and unified architecture for embedded Linux and Android OS for industrial embedded and IoT application.” No other major hardware vendors have joined, however, so it appears to be mostly about Advantech gear. Dell is the force behind a new Linux Foundation hosted EdgeX Foundry project for standardizing middleware on IoT gateways around its FUSE project. EdgeX Foundry will establish an ecosystem of companies that offer interoperable, open source plug-and-play components.   Further information Congatec’s ComX announcement may be found here.   Related posts: COM Express Type 7 module has dual 10GbE and 32 PCIe lanes Mini Apollo Lake module takes the heat — and the cold Tiny µQseven module runs Android and Linux on i.MX6 COM runs Linux on Kaby Lake, supports Intel Optane Congatec’s first Apollo Lake COMs include SMARC 2.0 model ﻿COM Express "server on module" taps Skylake… Qseven computer-on-module debuts 3W Atom Industrial thin Mini-ITX runs on 7th Gen Intel CPUs Three more Apollo Lake COMs support Qseven and COM Express Compact module runs Linux on quad-core Braswell (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. Yeah. Bruins in the NHL lead came later from that occurred in Callahan show time hockey. Like you east York. Rear axle from Mars you'll sports like your criminal we ought to be in jail that's always okay. EEye dot com Bruins right there tied an. Anderson former Bruin intelligent AF personality when did fired his nine year NHL veteran Brian we. Saturdays game it's Brock bond and AT&T and star mark indiscriminate got a lot of losses. So he's taught right. On Sports Radio WB yeah. Player of the pro except a couple of issues as they always do rear but Aaliyah album coming up from the closet you know he is outweigh even I don't his last few weeks all sunshine and ultimately that's. Let's get into some of the good stuff before we get to a few of the issues relate maybe the only good think about Thursday's game. Pretty much every game this year you can count on David postured scored five goals since we last spoke while five more calm. 34% of the league years gone 28 games in the Bruins and this guy as this five. Bodies tied for the league leading goals was Sidney Crosby right now eighteen. According game when a Monday that brought the house Belmont that you call you hate those Monday. Yahoo!'s actually. I shut me up it was a pretty at this and I guess they'll you know best game of the week for sure. One man show breakaway Wednesday they'll come back against the caps they at least got the lose your point in DC on Wednesday and more beauties Thursday. One otherwise was a dud performance against the ads the David pasta night. On a stretch here with fourteen goals in his last seventeen games played. Tai Anderson crunch the numbers not for the website and came up with 56 bowl pace right now that he is on just based on the games he's played this year. And Andy and goals per game numbers self. Mr. pastoral simple and what are we what are we seeing here is this a legit superstar are we gonna get a little bit ahead of ourselves based on a 45 games sample for possibly start the year. I think he's the real deal and I think guy I mean. I thought he was on a six eagle pace but that's why I'm an English major not a business page I'll take your word for yes dike it played over don't know ideology I differed on anybody on math. Yeah I think he's a real deal I mean we saw glimpses of it is his. His rookie year we said Wallace this kid is something else how to how to pronounce get him in the draft you know when they got him some in the twenties when he fifth when he fifth. And then you know lashing he was dirty struggle a little bit mainly some animated Tony's kids who delete has figured out yet the first year then. They did the second year but not as this gets special I mean he's. He's doing things all pale we haven't seen since I was sitting in a mail in. No not China had to twist the knife to state a fact. You know liberal ones have not had a game breaker since I was Sagan as good as Marchand is he's. Firefights sniper goals coral that I don't I would often common game breaker but but passed an arc. As we shot the out all the time came overtime goal Monday night that's a game break a typo that's a that's the type a ball out of super stop school is. I don't know that he's gonna be. You know I think he's gonna be more vocal score than SATA I mean you know take a look at his points right here he's got. It's seventeen goals. Poses a says he has tried to slow 224 sixers so yes six helpers it's exactly so he's he's deathly more more of a sniper. That a that a set up man but I mean yeah if you got a guy whose push fifty goals play in a season that's supersize ours up it's on the. And oh that's in year aside in this league any mortgage Crosby had 51 when you're tied for the for the rocket Rashard but. Big it's fifty got to be off the charts I don't think you'll get there personally with that injury history you bring up. But hell I was look at before the year if he gets 122 point five you gotta be happy he stays healthy enough to get to a consist 125. He's gonna get. Easy go back into thirty by accident at this point. I think I mean based on what we've seen I think he's going to be California consistent 35 to four Google score I mean I I think that. And a skill on display if he's got a a pretty nice boy do you work and you know only. Geez 212 plus season door to a third seasons right now and I'm sold I mean I I don't that this kid's gonna Rick regressed at all. And he put some size on he's he's got a lot of grip and he goes to those greasy areas that a lot of guys who hit with his talent I don't like to go to one. He doesn't shy away from it you know he's got the chipped teeth and you know placed he's kind of got that like rodeo like hockey player look to a home that. You know that he's he's at he's a pretty tough kid man I I think he's he's gonna be a dynamic player. It's the big blog is the big question what kind of money he is he is going to be looking fought I don't think the bronze award above Darren I didn't see how he does this season but yet. You know he is there he's got to be restricted free age why just hold on general I'll get up so I don't have missed a lot of what it duty but they're locked in a sign it now obviously this is the worst time so I don't know they would get this is no like I know I get ahead of his final run the other way if they use the his agent guys calling you know they got this. You know play this season LB obviously I mean MIS. You know oil and less who knows what the Bruins had been very secretive I mean unless they don't once I'm now on or less popular fears injury concerns himself yes not a bunch I guess I shouldn't say that I don't on the media as he had a bunch Izzy and you only get three different injuries last year he missed them. He missed. The first 44 games he played in thirteen games last year he had. Hand injury he actually played in the world juniors or treatment right hand injury which that was the some controversy. You had a back issue. This year he had another we missed three games to torture when laws right on the upper body in history. And when they drafted and you mention why he felt point five he had a back injury. In the Swedish league which kind of hurt his stock a little bit that's kind of why he felt when he fifth overall when you were so. That's five different issues in the last three years I would say that's injury prone. Now I don't buy it I think I think he's just a hockey play a hockey players get hurt I mean obviously some guys and oracle. Always is arc you play a leaves a little guy on me look at Germany's east east W small but I I don't see is always knew we better not sign him while we've got to be he's got an injury I mean. But I have to sign every player has no every player in the league has it's some sort of injury history I don't think there's any concern whatsoever mean. You know he I think he fell on the draft not just for the injured big TV's final Lola TSB Swedish I think he wasn't third tier it yet and I know guys you know if but I can like him as a bad playoffs. Scouts kind of forget about no fault that and mean it it's kind of weird because the gas got behind a guy and he has about three months and all of a sudden. He's a forgotten man you know I mean I think that might have been a little bit of a case to the pots that I would will certainly a couple teams is everybody passed on a lot of teams passed on. But no I haven't actually no concerns whatsoever I mean you know you look at it every every player and every team it's up like BI and the incitement. Now every guy's been heard it at some point and you know last year every that you are playing hockey I mean you know it's just I don't think that he's riddler injury prone and. Well but I you're gonna hand out seven and a half billion a year to them and that's the money that was our talk and seven and half terrorist cinco got that money. OK after three years now let's that was Canada. Skewed assist on the side of the yeah but he's got what terror so it was a thirteen you sit here and eighteen if you're David pops the next agent. Don't you look at what he's done so far and you start talking about 77 and a half per you know million per season. I would say the Bruins would come back and say what you're saying we will let this play out receive full year you gotta stay healthy prove it. And I'll think that hit as far as I know his side's not clamored for a good idea or anything right now on I learned attic yet another return I mean I'm the only. Not again not the what the brought to surprise me if they're in a month they really they don't make amounts it always sent to a six year. You know. 32 million dollar extension some like I wouldn't ship surprise me at all. But the same time you know this kid's ease basically in a contract the air albeit a restricted free agent but you know he he he can still take into the clean as what it wants the F. The Wednesday night game was the rivalry game on ABC ends they actually talked about possibly its contract and it Bob McKenzie said he thinks it's gonna be minimum six years six million per. That'll be the starting point if you wanna sign into that kind of contract but the weird thing in NHL free agency is always. East you go for a bridge here. We seen a couple of them were players have Superman had one of those right PK Yemeni state animal to cheap for a couple years and then he signed this blockbuster. Two years later because he's it was like short term gain for the Canadian stating that the pay him. On a second deal but the third deal came up quicker and they had the blow the doors off and make the highest paid guy in the league self. As the Ottawa the Bruins finances will be in two years compared to now maybe he'll try to push data on just missed a short bridge year. And the player to know much room for. You know for debate except I guess you bring up Sagan and some of the other young players that the brewers about the last two years Doug Hamilton. And they did manage to get their way out of town. Yeah different circumstances different situations but would cost an apple Doug Hamilton a Seattle a play here rich because trade me right now sort of. We now I I think he's happy here I don't think he wants to go anywhere and I mean I I I would think he'd. Wanna stay I I would think he'd want a long term deal. I'm whether he signs it and you know an extension now or log waste of India. And what Bob McKenzie saying I mean a bomb public release candidate is from rewrite re pretty much why Clark yet. And 66 times six sounds about right I mean I would you know I mean I would love it like to go I mean. I think eight aids the most they can go I believe that's correct so I mean typically I mean he's he's had good I'd say you don't. Given meet in if you get him under six per year but yes six times six. I I do it now I wouldn't even mess sort of bridge abridged deal I'd I mean. You know he is young he's still the only twenty years old but in the last time the Bruins gave finally give big basic voluntarily gave to core contract he would add that that. Contract they gave no one year deal any any amongst the Iranian that a that's that's why he's making the money's Megan up is the Bruins allowed him. You know liberals go locked him up a lot cheaper and they kind of idol I think big for some reason weren't completely sold on but the time. And he made them pay fart not I think they should remember that you know when it comes. Pasternak. Mean it away don't you think the the losing of Sagan. Castle I mean at the Milosevic and these cases they. Mean potentially move them and probably did there are a lot of factors but because they let young talent go for the second contract. In the last ten years and number at times. Management is sort pressure here they they can't let this capital boss he can't let this player now. SER I don't think they even think that way I think that's just think the fans social meat out of the I us you know they the roles like. While we trade jolt the one we trader Phil Kessel trade tire we can't do this again I I it's it's history it's like. That was you know lists under different regimes different GM's different I mean it's history is later has they'll Jacobson nearly they would hear it. Well they sit in the offseason jolting Audrey and Gaza killed Joseph Thornton's got nine to do it nearly Joseph thought was before kneeling dream. It's it's just they are right I mean I know it's it's and violated the if you try if you animate. Think to make the joke of the broader trip pop that up before. Pause in don't do it because it. Is that joke is a million times ever and it's what and adds if Wembley of people make in the same joke it's not a good joke. But by a by all means this this kid at all clock c'mon man I give give them don't get in the filed but. I think he wants to be here if you can if you consigned him in keep him here I don't think that. To trade stuff it's all individual every play is individual idol. It's not just the fine it is explain you know they they weren't sold on jolt the one as a as a guy who's gonna get into the Stanley Cup. India we are at that point it help they were a point as a team more help them rock bottom and you know high draft pick and flipped for assets which they turned into cup ride I'm Natalie that was their plan from the get go I think it was state they'd. They were about to commit. Kind of similar so I guess you don't peak case to win in Montreal they're about to commit. This all kinds of money to a guy an ending and they got cold feet at the last minute and a and that's the liberal exhibit with the Latin and but he dressed Kessel after trading or is it right is they don't hesitate identity they bottomed out made and they locked out they've been noted that lucked out and get castle. I mean at no one like the bond trade the time the return was was terrible I mean it's still a bad trade. But I am I call Brad Stuart Marcus terminally pre reproduce exactly I was them but it will wooded and the Debian was. The most you know in the best most inadvertent salaried company history yet because that ended up allow them to you know bring in gyrate and survived of course you know that changed the whole complexion or future of the franchise shall. Yet data is that the return of the trade was on the end result if you really can't argue it in you know ten years later joked on he has been with Stanley Cup but he has a one yet itself. But that it traded Kessel they got the pick they got a Sagan and they treated say in and kick the can down the road for so many years at some point I wanna invest in young guys that you are going to be around. I guess my question to the throw an audio Saturday skate at six or seven sevenths and 97937. Stellar would be. The are you sold on pasta not that he's a superstar. As as much of a goal scoring stars we've seen the Bruins haven't. Why are somebody throw out David had a league leader in ending goals since in what 41 years says the zero. The supplement your eye on the nearly nearly didn't legally panel excelling as an art when you are Neil and guy he's gotten it may may have been as brazile down so. At this I don't expect him to win the Rashard this year again Ike he's gonna cool lot some especially with this team but what's most remarkable is. The Bruins are 25 in the league in scoring. He Stifel beat Italy think tied with Crosby now an eighteen goals he's got a 37%. Of their goals or something ridiculous right now. They scored six. 66 goals this year he is eighteen and a spot court when he ma forty sevens pretty crazy hours at. That's a pretty could job but I just can't keep up that pace eventually teams are gonna take you now. Right is also indicative of the lack of scorn from the rest of the line up to which which has been an issue to. You know we go we got a good game out of spoon you know look like all meant he could do this than big big elegant to viable lines but any doors album has a dubbed the next gaming. He just you know kind of that inconsistency would get mad at himself and he's in the similar postured I vote and that they came up together about the same time a few years ago they're both restricted free agents and they couldn't be anymore. Any further from one another terms stock right now Spooner prospect guys just exploding. Got law meets Boras she's 24 years old he's you know he's CA Dutch older you know he's. Cannot I don't would if the Bruins are frustrated with them a lot of law. What we know what that I with the plans I don't think he's going anywhere right now I mean in the ACC game against Florida he was great it was the best skater updating you on clos bump up the the the first Lionel while the try to creature you ride The Who and the third Peary the ends up you know set up the wall that the ten and the almost looked like the game winning goal until Florida tied it again and then Colorado I mean. I guess everybody look bad verse Colorado the other night shall mean to single sport or probable probably isn't fear because nobody really played good from who'd who build and on out. Shall I I just you know I like to see him. In be more consistent make as I can say it if you got Backus preachy in sport to play a while that's no that's a viable wind that's that's a good number two line play and then. You know you got a couple guys like you know Schaub has been scorn more than probably we expected. Don Moore what map last year gets back from injury you know those guys in your bottom six you know pretty good guys they have done them. Well when there's a roster changes for tonight's game as well on day at the kind in the young. Recent draft pick of the Bruins were receipt taking as the fourth round pick actually. Not like he was Los in the first round guy but. Mining came in as a 434014. We summer Linear for seven games yet back up tonight he's gonna be on the second line the quote unquote. The county line what do you call it. Great she Backus and hi it's nice that tells you need to know about explode thinks its borders game and your right it I actually wrote this down after the Monday game. Because originally it was on a post game and he was asked about Hillary said quote. Better when he wants the play he's a good player looking for more of that from them and quote I mean. Like Belichick would never say that about a player that Julien will call guys out and it's pretty clear what they think Spiller leads. Some nights they just feel like he's not printed and Thursday was a mess on the first goal is turned all over the place yet. He it's a he had at that doesn't think he's one of these draft picks that. You know has been considered inconsistent fought them I mean he eats he's look great to me he's looked like up you know law. At times of a pretty good number to Sandra I mean look okay got this could could could be a long term senator in this league and then. You know he goes on and on a slide Leahy he's he's not really get that done I mean of course. He is a natural Senna he's he's not playing his natural position right now shall. You know in part we take that into account but. At the same time I mean that's hockey at its. No real mystery to it if you if you get stuck in the when you play the winging AM in new do we need the one that and and I imagine they feel like he failed at center last year that's why he's a wing right now. Down we haven't really seen them much much right now and try and thorough Miami haven't seen a much this year and it ought alters are reluctant swell with close to use them there because it's you know kind of morbid to pass a role of and the third. But there when your third mine senate typically is a defense of died in Ryan's boredom you know defense hasn't been his Forte in his time in Boston so. Yeah I'd say it's up to keep and I ought to I am I guess I don't I don't mode that willing to trade him I know has been some scuttlebutt out there that you know his name is all about. I don't I mean GM's stock every every mean if if that was a criteria than every game everyone's available as you know guys get asked about. And I you know if if GMs aren't taken calls them not on the job. Just like it's a bad time to sign prospects pretty bad time to traits border until he starts putting it together consistently you know it's not gonna get much for Saturday skate here on Sports Radio WB Ike Hillard and rear admiral Lyndon byers and join us in the 4 o'clock hour we think we got out and mistrust they'll be last out to be telling it and what would stop lamp black Betty Graham jam they'll they'll remain out of that'll be like as a has beat a beacon also up. We're gonna do just quick five minute check in with mark giver of the Providence journal it is Intel on the united he's been watched him last the couple weeks and also just a quick. Little recap the some of the prospects and how did Dylan in the HL it's a 345 marks could be joining us. Presented by AT&T mobilizing your world and star markets he would makes a shine. Validate the producer today Al wanted to fire up the sound bite for you because speaking Thursday and closed its. Analysts say he's who he blasted after the game but who he blamed for Thursday night this as we said here they've lost to a row it's been an interesting week they had a pretty good when Monday although they blew a couple one goal leads Wednesday huge come out of that game feeling pretty good about. Yes the contest the minute battle back for point yet it's fellas. Dell is a good sign I mean obviously pulling down freed up that wasn't by. To be down three nothing for minutes up in the second period against a team might Washington on the road in the come out of to a point. I'll take it any any any time. There are a lot of problematic things like no doubt that. Power play could help us in the first period and failed to do that so they got to be better we need is some things tonight we can get them. He's got to be better a lot of things here that we can we can get better at and take responsibility. It allows Claudette to Thursday after the loss would fall on two not that are lead and 30 they come back Austin like it's yet Google's and eventually lose four to. So the two things Julian blames after the game he arc. The power play. And it could open. What do you make of that. Could open was not the guy that I that he was good nobody was really good in that game. Did he wasn't he he lets dump the other night I had no problem that you know you thought east mean I was at that last that long range goalie gave up. The Mitchell goal was was not that guy in the third and honestly got. Sometimes sights set a goal like that can beat a back breaker and you know like maybe woods is he's got to make some sage maybe might mean now a particular but. Close doesn't do it often he doesn't do it my time to. In all out but he gets pissed off Vinnie you know he I think what brutal little handle it I I have no problem at all. And also too I mean we don't know what else cloud said before at the natural I don't know that we do it rained who who'd been on the problem that was his only answer and he blamed the power play antidote. And that he actually did later blame we weren't Smart and early parts of the game we were little tired from playing the right to back nights we gotta be smarter. Let me just it's that's an eyebrow raiser when you gonna blame you're gonna point out two things you're gonna signal to things the coach one of the power polluting everybody's. You know your bros tenure in unhappy with it was a backup goaltender. Well that's it that's stretching is the it was a little barrel and it's an old enemies back at least out of that night so look if you can blame him for the first two Colorado Eagles there's. I for honesty I forget which one was built two goals he should act and you when you give up two goals like that the I have no problem the coach gone on I've known that's. Yeah I did Tuesday means that the one from what I've practicable and terrible goal that's it's terrible bowl and then a little windows on a breakaway. Now that you thought honest I mean off first who goes unto Sheen scored unassisted after a Spiller was all turnaround use on his back in front that. I'm that was the first goal Macinnis scored after crew died they don't the Blue Line and our players the short hander I I Nazi I'd have to look at the video. Two counts it's a couple days I don't remitted I suppose from Butler and it was a garbage goal I mean it's a save that any NHL goal he has the make. And you know that's that that can be the difference in the game it's got to be a backbreaking bullion and team battling back you might tied up. Well you know you get within a goal and an eagle is about arc arc crackle like I don't it won crystal what elephant that's all it takes men and in if that's it. Swings the momentum and ends up being the difference in the game in the coach calls a mild good needle. Approach stick your week it's like 125 nail the roster wise but it's not he's the goalie and he's out of it came it's not always the back up goalie he spoke earlier coaches all the finally joined that night when you get back have been. We got arise our level little bit it's he's obviously not as tilted his Tuukka. We know that so if he's if he gives a one bad goal tonight. You're gonna hang on to the podium at the site is exhibit B of why we lost the right but I like caller I just didn't think that was very good. There I got out I mean feats he says goalie play like crap any any said he said sowed the media again he doesn't torn off and he's got a lift clean all the players he does he's usually pretty good call I mean as far as not name and image hit in name names you obviously the goal he's got to make the save that obvious who started all but. I have no problem it's elaborate folic. He's like the utility guy and a baseball team who you know. You know went all for three or something and it's not he'd stay out of the game he was the goalie and he was the guy in net. Any was daddy when he did he was he could have been better in the and they could impossibly on the game. You know if if in the senate name and you know one of awful it are one of a defensemen I mean yeah who would double wasn't good and the goalie has the make saves I don't like that's fine I can hope rob what. Tell us would you think Sports Radio Debbie guys Bruins coverage here on Saturday skate three a five every Saturday Keller rear admiral from barge the sports Lyndon byers will be up and in it for we'll get a couple minutes with more giver of the Providence journal nature calls 6177797937. Is pasta not a superstar one about Steelers game of late couple polyps today. And Julian blaming the backup goaltender in part for Thursday night's loss more your calls and a reaction coming up a Sports Radio Debbie yet. You were listening to us Saturday skeet with a rear admiral and canned Laird. On Sports Radio WEEI. No I don't have. Senate differences in my. Go Vista to make the playoffs you know and have to experience them. I would test two in defending cup you know and and so so I'm I'm still focusing. It Abbas and like after the Yankee Thursday when he picked up the dome over eighteen type Sidney Crosby the league lead Saturday skater a portrait you to be I percent of my AT&T it's our market. Laird in the admiral. He's not your prototypical superstar he's going to be that weighs the benefit of the language barriers cities get the F nice sport chicklet there in the front month. Tom little guy not he's not physically imposing like former goal scoring stars the Bruins of that although he's beefed up a bit I think up. 68 was so the pal did she came into the league with. Yeah a few years ago that small and so I mean he's listed at six feet 182 compounds and many still 22 on the night. You know lot of guys EC still you know he's still grown back I think you know I mean he's still pretty you point. Why have him as a lead blowing you know it'll just still fill out at least 11 point two years old so even Sagan is well built it please. And it started remember when he was here he was he was actually nor did do probably similarities in size Sagan got a lot big a lot he was here but he doesn't he doesn't like Jack when he got here. When he lemmings aliens did pretty big idol operative and when he broke into the league. But you know he's like some pasta still 28 big east you know still finish of puberty disarm in some degree. What's also impressive as a possible like those of four power play goals the he's not played on the first power play as good eighteen and mostly it's on the strike he ultimately lead Geneva sprinkles. So Lisa the question. When does he get more power play time for a power play you that is. 25 in the league admiral 14%. Event at two power play goals the last eight games it's just not clicking. Julian blamed in part Thursday they give it up for short he's one of them in the first period did you know bundle to Ole hole. I don't exactly know where you would put him I think that's the problem in essence on that first unit but it's some political they have to keep him in there just for a couple reps I mean. All crew to the point if you have to I. Yeah I wanna great mysteries of that cover in the drones the last few years assembly is as you know what's close what's the method to close power play bad news because. You know he he refused to use my show on their fears you know Brad marsh on the one you know will be fought past the team's best schools score. And he couldn't you know he could buy his way into the popularly known in. Adult if Claudette some sort of communal meritocracy Durham practice talks all all what it is but it it makes no sense a lot of times you know to have. You best goal scored not on your number one unit when you know when you. You trying to trying to score against trying to win games I I don't know why I don't know why he doesn't have their. Again I don't know if it's some sort of an unknown meritocracy system that we don't know ball put. Could be it I think people brought up affected Bergeron because he's a right shot in the law of him in the middle there between the circles. It's going to be tough to put pasta knock on the left wing. He needs a guy that can feed them off the right sports. Gala warts and all are also could be like you just said there's such an oval load. A lot of tell there's a lot of talent on the first unit will put a guy like past that now you have to dangers units Jones that a in only eight by keeping him on the second unit Jimmy he's obviously. The most dangerous goals scored night you have him on on the second power play unit in you still vote PP one that's pretty potent itself and saw a case of the accident it takes fifty staffed eight minus the pot of the whole pot and it not working at all. But you know and in theory you know if you if you first unit is doing good. You know it nice second unit's debt that the best you know the best score in the legal saw that on May be maybe it's about balance and things off. With quote. But he added they opened its doors been on their fur a good stretch yeah he's a meritocracy you know yeah ideas that are exactly again like I said it's it's it's been a mystery since since closed been here as. Exactly which way how he handles Powell play I mean I. I know that would mean it was terrible for years and and I think when they brought Joseph Sakhalin. As an assistant aid aid it got better I mean it was one of the best power plays in the league you know last company has an industrialist it's like will will what happened I mean I don't think Louis Erickson was the key to the pros I'll play last year alike. So you know easily ideas are strong immense anger exploded gab but it's you know that you gotta stay ahead of fear you know if your coach in this eagle you're just make the proper adjustment I mean. And that's all usually uses is it just cat sometimes. Personal matter one take one guy out maybe put on the guy and I just you know just a small adjustment what did Dolan but you know I cannot think that the they cover pop label will come around at some point. You know this is too much skill analyst what skill when they Allen have a final four mean it is as much cannot soiree and others still. Ohio high among the skill to have one on you know it's just feel like they're goals ought to come at some point the those ago. On again listening in on your Saturday skate with only to rear admiral idol but there I don't but I don't blob. Are not like I say that you haven't. Show. It's great when you get a chance to talk art. It are you hit twenty or seven dollar odds for all baseball but there's always roll or hockey. He mimics a lot. I would drop a little disappointed in a lot the other night especially after I knocked it in it's it was spot on a little bit of an identity. Washington. Game. You know. As far as we're talking about sport out. I think you know the word I know we share instead. He wants a place on and he's not happy that he planned way so he's kinda. I used a chart outing in some way. And right now like for. It's like Canseco wrote its own and get something damn site too hot heat I know everybody moms who is our ability bought. He's just brutal on defense other and it gave the other night where spellbound I mean the mistake you're. Oh the skating ability. Orbit are not outweigh that the parents distinct. Mob like eight other approved. Fan but EDU beyond just though gold earlier in that period he had a brutal turnover in the neutral zone to crew meet like throne behind his back into the Red Line. And even even I was taken like you bad curbs got to step his game up at times here. Well that's what I'm talking about it's far too dull bit ticked I lucked out on the ankles. I mean he would have made a couple of stage. In that game sort of allow colts. When which which what did you blame for rear I disagreed and I I think in all I. Really. I was a pretty. It was held resentment on Ari. That Erik Cole a third wheel for sure yet the on the left wing restock it shorts and and then after up. They came back to make it to read so and to allow that goal that happened up. And take away the momentum that they act Colin Ellis Cilic but I don't think we do all I am totally out now. You know and everybody know what kind of ball you which like C. It sacred make you know not gonna happen right now. But when the real hot spots app and app and new years which he's not getting ready you know make it will serve up. Playoffs. What would you like this dot. Well that's the call Bob. Really get too obvious needs right now at a meeting it'll only for a veteran Winger deploy again they're the creature back slide or deceit and kinda tonight the analysts he or Frankfurt trying to come out of nowhere this team needs a top six Winger that that's an obvious ya have in San that did you know they they need to bring someone in a on the top six to score some goals is that it's not happening right now that to the degree needed to. They also have a continual rotation they try out a little for the you know the bottom paired defensemen kill morals going to be in their tonight for Colin Miller who had a nice goal. People he had the one power play goal the week break the tie it up in the third in DC as the capitals that was indelible moment yeah that's what you wanna see Colin Miller be doing on a regular basis but. IBC's much Cilic he's benched kneipher Jill moral soul. You know clearly they can use any veteran defenseman. Puck mover or otherwise chat Kirk's names thrown out forever but those would be to lobby of that at this yeah I don't know what's borders boaters not to negate to anybody that caliber. Now not cardinal now I I don't all of them really look at the money committed data I'd I don't hold that the gonna dump crew I know people keep mentioning his name I mean five it would be nice to get five million off the books that. Maybe spent somewhere else I think depriving enemy book and more just in to get some goals scored I don't think they have. You know I don't think they think that the a yield of the main issue right now is is goals go on this team and you know I'll take a look at the you know would tended freeagent side. You know this is tennis it's tie in with which teams. In you know global poverty is so aware of the announced platelets what did Dallas for example. The other anyone point out I know he's this. No brutal no hardly hear you have a hard time trading for anybody this year for juries nobody's out of it's you gotta wait a long time it would teams finally do fall out of that. The draft crop apparently is not very good this year so teams aren't really that psyched about tank. It's going to be hard to convince owners that they were gold the next Austin Matthews isn't dealt tonight with the leafs has apparently this draft crop not that good so. Not only is gonna be a he has gonna be very exciting. Here's a million finally got it. After only get life. Back again why I mean evacuate who he's he's unrestricted this year a sign that he got that. Monster deal I mean if for his agent. You know how I mean forty outlet that tank that was a lot of money Colorado gave him while Scott a ball to eight mile your obviously he got so it can still I mean he's you know he actually can still help ya. Just what don't Colorado man I mean because like you say everybody still alive but I mean Al west. You know I would say Colorado and Arizona I mean it I I know it's Eric early every pronounce and team but. I don't see them Yemeni eight points back already and it not they would have to LeapFrog vehicle would Dallas LA in Nashville to gets that's it just to the eighth seed. I think you know I think it's almost an impossible task so. You know he audacity style cable who let would you sell look at what was going to be free agents and why on bad teams and I thought it in I'm you know first good ideas as we started. It you know right away Jerome again the pop Saito Colorado jumps right out you know now obviously the deadlines with this team we've seen before you know I mean he does come for on the go around the in another name of course you know this is all along waited elbow like. If you know if Dallas is doesn't fix it goaltender and it and they play themselves. Out of play opposition Patrick shops at in on unrestricted free agent. You know have gets old war horses their Jack in all of us saw you getting don't know those are gay you know what tough. Those are pretty damn good all of us to bring a bit of rent couples might has like got off a sniper of that level. Who cares all the you know like you know it's it's complementary piece in the it would it be ideal again I'm just drawn now I'm just bailed thrown dots as. Look at it look at it potential free agents but you know it it could be some decent names you know. When the deadline rolls around. I'd Saturday skating here on sports rated BI LB will be joining us we think about top of the hour the UCS finest and the former Bruins will be hopping in now also up. We have coming up next more devers gonna be on. Which added a deep lengthy boring interviews. Hero sports rated RBI that was you know so we're double and a pivotal fight it gives me a five reject him. Guy covers products rose because dateline is coming up tonight so how's he been doing of late. Just a quick hit on a couple prospects down their old Garrett grizzly. The brusque the first round pick from a few years ago smoky short week. Get back your calls excellent seven service at 97937. Laird the admiral here Saturday's game Saturday's game continues here on Sports Radio WEE I can't land along with rear admiral from Parcells sports joining us on the foes for little stand behind in the Intel what's called that. Now we got that mark giver who is an accurate for the Providence journal who's been covering the. No problem. I'm doing good how are you guys. We're great sounds like kind and is back in tonight we saw him for a seven games here to start the year though without producing a point they set him back down now you're way how much have you seen them since send a what's the scouting report. Was able budget science although I was not last night's game. He's been in and out as a lot of young guys are you know he's the first you're probably can useful thing three games in three nights in the whole. All grind of the pro game. Play against. You know bigger men than he faced in college so he's been inconsistent which got. Ellis to be expected he's got some good games and he's done all the games where you know knows so much. Has he been put in a role to be a score down there or how they use them. Yeah he's in the top six a top sexual. On the foul play you know first off like you know he's in is go to position two we're up quite so it's gonna get down here. And have they been critical when he's disappeared for stretches as as you've highlighted as a given demon tough on him. Are all talk as the word but certainly the ultimate comparable. That's the way they trying to do without hero that's how was under which fascinating and not. And it continues under under Kevin being nobody gets a free ride if they're not doing what what they want. Them to do so yeah he's been held accountable at all. This is what you need to do and if you don't do it you know it's though. I don't told me when that person about what the thinking what are useful once he needs to be harder on aux. You know they don't want to be knowledge Ari whose lives are on Fox's as any guy you're in the seat but he needed to compete a little more on the or check on the wall whatever. So he's been working on that and and like I said there's been some easy he's been successful some nights some nights. Maybe not but. They're not trying to turn it turn into a defensive or by any means they're they're given them freedom to look to make his plays. And there are bad nights when he's done it. It's is that a positive out there he's played he's played well almost without. From what she seemed to this point. If he plays with Backus and Cree chief for a little stretch in your opinion is that the best option the Bruins have right now when you compare it to show all or or Spooner silly guys they've rotated their of that left wing. I would think so I think that tried those guys and you know with. Some success but not all the success that we'll have more. I believe that you know almost can't benign and some that puts up some numbers here over the next week that it's kind of a place holder for. A wreck in the trial. You know who you know relatively close used backed down near Providence stadium practioner a couple of days of the public on the road. Frankie may be out here again to look to start we. And we'll see where that takes some. A few little surprise that he didn't play at least one game in the American League worry before it goes back to Boston just began feet under him after a long way off. Like I say I think Stanton. And let Stanton wants an up and you know now. He's old maps spot or ranking. And not. Its future. Good point mark Deborah maligned from the Providence journal hockey writer covering Providence Bruins and now also of course a College Hockey here in the region. He joins us here a sports rated RBI while much alike mark his real quick a couple of of the potter prospects can give us a cliff notes if you would do it may be thirty seconds on these guys. A ball left Winger Jake to Brusca the Bruins took the first rounds couple years ago as he did not play much. Yeah he has C east another guy who gets a lot of minutes get stoplight time is put into the position played it would strengths as a as little more offensive player than anything else is kind of slow start numbers wise. He's won a Little League leaders in shots on goal but the ought. He's got four goals now the puck really have been gold in form. Almost started to a little bit lately he had he had a goal last night you know he's naked progress. I can see him being financial split down low shore what it is he's a ways away yet. Anybody you would compare to to stop stop your head. Geez I don't know if that's that's coffee he's a playmaker more up I'll play making Winger he's got a sniper in makes plays he can finisher playing. What but he makes a lot blisters like it's any Eagles looked up areas. It also I think you know get his goals that way what so wildly. They haven't been going to have much while. How about on the back end we saw Robby oh guerra to start the year but that he was sent down pretty quickly also guerra progressed. These savagery is ups and doubts he's got that long stick in the long reach Canada any skates pretty well for a big guy like he's got a lot to learn. In handling you know bigger guys around that along the boards playing record progress the guy Israel c'mon I think from the start of the season. Is about the prospect that a culture are actors were. He's a really good at the last couple weekends you do this skating ability to look. He carried the puck up the ice and then and then making plays once he gets up there like the I could see him getting getting a call at some point. It also need to. That's he's been good lately. They can use it of its interest say you know it's not looks like Colin Miller scratch tonight and until morrow is in those guys have been rotating media and maybe Chris look won't push either one of those duke. You'd like to think that right that that he could get those light a fire on those guys you baby a little bit but. No group than good I think it's it's only a matter time before he gets a real chance will look back on this year. While I don't know I don't know illegally out a quarter way through they're Chelsea's and so. Or maybe structure. Lastly tablet just who is the top guy in Providence for lack of better term now is there is there a prospect it's really banged on the door that we don't know about other than the ones you mentioned. While Peter so are are already let banging on the door but he's been very pleasant surprise of it linger from the Czech Republic. Or maybe it's all lucky when he 41 years old he. He's got ten goals in seventeen games got a real good feel around the net. You know can make a play all so he he just came back from the injury and he got a couple goals last night younger people out where the light. Pine and and not go right I don't know that so mark's case is not to NHL standards at this point I think he needs more time. Now here. What's coming off the injury and I think that's a factor but he's an easy looks like a very good prospect that a guy that will Plame leak that someplace just. This needs more seasoning. That's more giver who would. Joined as heroes Sports Radio Debbie I just couple quick minutes on the prospects Gillard rear admiral and nine in that they're talking about the Peters a lark Greer who is it's and they need to hear from about I'd seen play at all but he has. More than this he says the big body physical power for some people wanted to see him instead of the united that I can get behind and who was more than goals scored. Out university Denver scored twenty goals back to back years and forty games though he thought he said Peter Scolari for America Soledad bosom buddies assumption that the that there. Now lie so you know anyway that there's a couple guys in the opera bug selling anybody's like. The door they got to be up here right. Right he's right there waiting for the tropic of it right exactly you know I was thinking about that get a nice to know what did. If they try to hold looks you know like similar to what we last from a mean I kid. You know he's like. 1920s gangster with a Tommy got his packaged under the did he shoots all the plays and that's great I mean. I think he I think it's fantastic is that you know that's I produced goals whether prop rebounds. He's going to beat goalie with a good shot but that kid has an NHL caliber shot by definitely now. Is the rest of his game any joke elbow or is it going to be. That's the question of a trial right now a secure enough to what century exactly exactly coming off an injury you know would. You know what would know how desperate as you can be skate as good as he was prior to mean ideally Vizio about these should be fine. You know these guys taken enough time yelled and the other use they use a 100% on the comeback but. You know it that's a Katie he's he's definitely is a modified NHL shot. Hopefully he. Everything else and his game piceance help because if there's a kid if if the draws a count on him you know he K he's certainly their top six potential mallet what that show idea as.

SK Hynix Rises to World No. 3 in Semiconductor Market Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory May 11, 2017 11:21 SK Hynix became the world's third largest semiconductor maker thanks to a very strong global memory chip market. According to market research firm IC Insights on Tuesday, SK Hynix recorded sales of US$5.5 billion in the first quarter of this year, third only to Intel's $14.2 billion and Samsung Electronics' $13.6 billion. Last year, SK Hynix was in fifth place behind Qualcomm and Broadcom. The global memory chip market has been very buoyant since the second half of last year due to surging demand for smartphone and server chips. SK came in second in the DRAM market and fifth in NAND flash. Japan's Toshiba, which SK hopes to acquire, came in eighth with $2.9 billion, and Broadcom of the U.S., which is also eyeing Toshiba, ranked fifth with $4.1 billion.  Copyright © Chosunilbo & Chosun.com Previous Next All Headlines Back to Top

Reports said Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr, a Republican, and Democrat ranking member Mark Warner, said they had asked Mr Comey to appear before the committee next Tuesday. It was not immediately clear whether Mr Comey would accept the invitation, or if the testimony would be public or closed. Sen. Mark Warner says he and Chmn. Burr have invited James Comey to testify before the Senate Intel Committee on Tuesday. — via @MSNBC pic.twitter.com/4zmnh8vQWs — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 10, 2017 "[We sent out the invitation. We've not heard back yet, we just sent out the invitation this morning," he said, according to CNBC. “He was due to appear tomorrow with all the other heads of the intelligence community. My hope is that he’ll take advantage of this opportunity.” News of the invitation came as Mr Trump defended his decision to get rid of Mr Comey, a move that was widely criticised by Democrats and at least a dozen Republicans. Mr Trump said that the FBI Director “was not doing a good job”. The president did not explain more about the manner and timing of Mr Comey’s ousting. Mr Warner, along with many of his Democratic colleagues, has called for a special counsel in the Russia probe. Mr Comey reportedly found out that he had been fired on Tuesday around the time the news broke on television. Mr Trump, who received recommendations to fire Comey from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, wrote in a letter that he wanted to to “find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission”. “The president over the last several months lost confidence in Director Comey, the DOJ (Department of Justice) lost confidence in Director Comey, bipartisan members of Congress made it clear that they had lost confidence in Director Comey and most importantly the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director,” Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told a briefing.

Intel's Steven Meyer, Autodesk's Diego Tamburini and Microsoft's Michael Walton took the stage in a closing keynote panel discussion about IIoT best practices, moderated by our very own Karen Field, while Goodyear's Billy Ray Taylor set the morning tone with his talk on transformation and winning. Despite late evening activities the night before at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, attendees rose early to take a final stroll around the expo floor, where demos continued on the center stage and drone competition winners were announced. Don't miss our other conference coverage here.

LePage rules out Senate bid By Max Greenwood - 05/10/17 09:20 PM EDT 83   © Getty Images Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) is ruling out a 2018 Senate bid, according to a top adviser to the governor.  "Governor Paul LePage has helped the State of Maine achieve the largest number of private sector jobs in history, implement the largest tax cut in state history and implement reforms which have resulted in Maine showing a significant revenue surplus earlier this year, and, while these accomplishments are great, there is more to do," LePage's senior political adviser Brent Littlefield said in a statement Wednesday night. "Therefore the Governor will remain focused on the job at hand and not enter the United States Senate race in 2018," he added.  ADVERTISEMENT LePage said last May that he would weigh a Senate bid against incumbent Sen.

LePage, a Republican who is in his second term as governor, is set to leave office next year due to state term limits. It's not yet clear what his next move will be.  LePage was an early backer of President Trump's insurgent campaign and has remained a steadfast defender of the president in his early months in the White House.  LePage's decision not to run for office opens up the GOP field, at least for now, to state Senator Eric Brakey, a libertarian-leaning Republican who has been endorsed by Sen.

Brakey applauded LePage's decision not to run for Senate. "As he focuses on fighting for the people of Maine as our Governor, I look forward to working with him to end the reign of Angus King and restore liberty for little guy — not only in Maine — but down in Washington, DC," Brakey said in a statement.

WebOS has plenty of features. Vibrant greens. Cons Poor contrast. Uneven, inaccurate colors. Bottom Line LG's UH6100 line of 4K TVs can process HDR content, but budget prices mean lower-quality panels with poor contrast and uneven color. By Will Greenwald The good news about 4K TVs is that just about every manufacturer is now jumping on the high dynamic range (HDR) bandwagon, which means a wider range of colors along with darker darks and brighter brights. The bad news is that even if it supports it, a budget TV can only do so much justice to HDR content. LG's ultra high-definition (UHD, or 4K) UH6100 series is very affordable, with the 49-inch 49UH6100 model we tested available for $549.99. It also is loaded with connected features thanks to LG's top-notch WebOS platform. It's a shame that contrast is poor, and color range is uneven. //Compare Similar Products Compare LeEco Super4 X55   %displayPrice%%seller% Sony XBR-49X800D   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio M50-D1   %displayPrice%%seller% LG 55UH8500   %displayPrice%%seller% LG OLED65B6P   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio P50-C1   %displayPrice%%seller% SunBriteTV Pro Series Direct-Sun Outdoor TV SB-4217HD   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio D65u-D2   %displayPrice%%seller% Sony XBR-55X930D   %displayPrice%%seller% TCL 55UP130   %displayPrice%%seller% Editors' Note: This review is based on testing performed on the LG 49UH6100, the 49-inch model in the series. Besides the screen size difference, the 43-inch $449.99 43UH6100 is identical in features, and we expect similar performance from this model. Design Looking like your typical budget TV, the 49UH6100 is plain and unassuming. The screen is surrounded by a 0.6-inch flat, glossy black plastic bezel with no distinguishing features aside from a small LG logo and a power LED in the middle of the bottom edge. The TV sits on two long, curved plastic feet that are almost completely black, with silver-colored strips on their tops. An HDMI port and a USB port face left on the back panel. The other two HDMI ports, along with an Ethernet port, component video input, coaxial audio input, optical audio output, and an antenna/cable connector face directly back. Three HDMI ports are common for budget televisions, though four are preferable. While the 49UH6100 uses WebOS like LG's higher-end TVs, you won't find a motion-sensing Magic Remote in the box. Instead, it comes with a much more conventional 6.7-inch black wand with flat rubber buttons. The remote control has all of the necessary controls for navigating WebOS on the TV, including a direction pad, a number pad, playback controls, and four color buttons. However, the direction pad consists of rectangular buttons that feel indistinguishable from the rest of the remote, making them difficult to find under your thumb without looking. The remote buttons are not backlit. WebOS Even without a Magic Remote and air mouse-like cursor control, the 49UH6100 offers plenty of smart features thanks to LG's WebOS. Many common streaming media apps are available, including Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV, and YouTube, along with support for live TV either over the air or with your cable or satellite box through the built-in TV guide. WebOS also supports screen mirroring with Miracast and Intel Wi-Di, though Miracast support has been phased out in most current Android devices in favor of Google Cast, which isn't available here. There's also a web browser on the TV, though using it with the physical buttons is much more awkward than on other LG TVs with the Magic Remote for smoother cursor control. Performance and HDR Just because a TV can accept a high dynamic range (HDR) signal doesn't necessarily mean it can do it justice, and like many budget televisions, that's the case with the 49UH6100. We test TVs using a DVDO AVLab 4K test pattern generator, a Klein K-10A colorimeter, and Portrait Displays' CalMAN 5 software on a Razer Blade Pro notebook. After a basic dark room calibration using the 49UH6100's ISF Calibrated (Dark) picture mode, the 49UH6100 displayed a modest peak brightness of 172.13cd/m2 and a poor black level of 0.15cd/m2 for a 1,147:1 contrast ratio. This means that, even if the TV can process HDR10 content, you don't get a very good range of brights and darks. This is typical performance for budget-minded 4K TVs from major manufacturers—the similarly priced Sony XBR-49X800D shows similar contrast. Vizio's M-series is a bit more expensive, but its panel can get much brighter and darker for a far greater 40,670:1 contrast ratio. Color doesn't fare much better. The chart above shows Rec.709 ideal color values as squares and measured color values as dots. While the TV shows an impressive reach for greens, its reds fall slightly short, and cyan and magenta are very skewed. LG provides a full suite of calibration tools to fix these problems, but out of the box the colors simply aren't very good. Curiously, we've seen the best performance in this price range from lesser-known manufacturers, like LeEco's Super 4x series displays remarkably wide and accurate colors out of the box, and it boasts four times the contrast at 4,938:1. Viewing Experience Despite measured issues with picture quality, HDR content still looks fairly vivid and eye-catching on the 49UH6100. The TV's strong range of greens makes the "Jungle" episode of BBC's Planet Earth II on Ultra HD Blu-ray appear natural and colorful. However, darker parts of scenes, like the fur of lemurs, suffer from the TV's poor black levels—though the hairs can be clearly discerned under sunlight, their fine texture becomes a muddy blob of darkness in shady shots. And while the greens are exceptionally rich and detailed, blues and reds don't exhibit quite as much vibrancy. See How We Test TVs The Great Gatsby demonstrates the 49UH6100's weakness in dark scenes much more prominently. In the film's several dark settings, the characters' black suits disappear against the shadows of the backgrounds, showing very little texture or contour of the fabric. The white shirts and garden lights get satisfyingly bright to prevent the picture from looking too washed out, but anything very dark tends to simply vanish from a lack of deep black levels to provide more room for details in the shadows. Input Lag and Power Consumption Input lag is the amount of time between when a TV receives a signal and the display updates. In the ISF Calibrated (Dark) picture mode, the 49UH6100 shows a poor 75.7ms input lag. However, the Game picture mode displays a far better 16.7ms input lag, at the expense of further skewing the TV's colors cool. This is good performance for any 4K TV. Under normal viewing conditions, the 49UH6100 consumes 76 watts in ISF Expert (Bright) and other modes that push the backlight to full. The ISF Expert (Dark) picture mode cuts that down to 67 watts, slightly under the TV's power-saving APS picture mode. This is a bit lower than the Sony XBR-49X800D, which uses 89 watts. Conclusions The LG 49UH6100 sounds like a fantastic TV on paper, but it makes some major trade-offs in picture quality to hit its low price. While it's packed full of features, including LG's WebOS connected interface and support for HDR content, its poor black levels significantly hold it back, and its wider color gamut seems to only extend to greens. If you want an HDR-capable 4K TV on a budget, the LeEco Super4 X series offers fantastic colors, while the Vizio M-series provides remarkable contrast for its price. If you want strong picture quality with both excellent contrast and a wide range of color, you should prepare to shell out significantly more on a high-end LED TV like LG's UH8500 series.

WebOS has plenty of features. Vibrant greens. Cons Poor contrast. Uneven, inaccurate colors. Bottom Line LG's UH6100 line of 4K TVs can process HDR content, but budget prices mean lower-quality panels with poor contrast and uneven color. By Will Greenwald The good news about 4K TVs is that just about every manufacturer is now jumping on the high dynamic range (HDR) bandwagon, which means a wider range of colors along with darker darks and brighter brights. The bad news is that even if it supports it, a budget TV can only do so much justice to HDR content. LG's ultra high-definition (UHD, or 4K) UH6100 series is very affordable, with the 49-inch 49UH6100 model we tested available for $549.99. It also is loaded with connected features thanks to LG's top-notch WebOS platform. It's a shame that contrast is poor, and color range is uneven. //Compare Similar Products Compare LeEco Super4 X55   %displayPrice%%seller% Sony XBR-49X800D   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio M50-D1   %displayPrice%%seller% LG 55UH8500   %displayPrice%%seller% LG OLED55B6P   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio P50-C1   %displayPrice%%seller% SunBriteTV Pro Series Direct-Sun Outdoor TV SB-4217HD   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio D65u-D2   %displayPrice%%seller% Sony XBR-65X930D   %displayPrice%%seller% TCL 50UP130   %displayPrice%%seller% Design Looking like your typical budget TV, the 49UH6100 is plain and unassuming. The screen is surrounded by a 0.6-inch flat, glossy black plastic bezel with no distinguishing features aside from a small LG logo and a power LED in the middle of the bottom edge. The TV sits on two long, curved plastic feet that are almost completely black, with silver-colored strips on their tops. An HDMI port and a USB port face left on the back panel. The other two HDMI ports, along with an Ethernet port, component video input, coaxial audio input, optical audio output, and an antenna/cable connector face directly back. Three HDMI ports are common for budget televisions, though four are preferable. While the 49UH6100 uses WebOS like LG's higher-end TVs, you won't find a motion-sensing Magic Remote in the box. Instead, it comes with a much more conventional 6.7-inch black wand with flat rubber buttons. The remote control has all of the necessary controls for navigating WebOS on the TV, including a direction pad, a number pad, playback controls, and four color buttons. However, the direction pad consists of rectangular buttons that feel indistinguishable from the rest of the remote, making them difficult to find under your thumb without looking. The remote buttons are not backlit. WebOS Even without a Magic Remote and air mouse-like cursor control, the 49UH6100 offers plenty of smart features thanks to LG's WebOS. Many common streaming media apps are available, including Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV, and YouTube, along with support for live TV either over the air or with your cable or satellite box through the built-in TV guide. WebOS also supports screen mirroring with Miracast and Intel Wi-Di, though Miracast support has been phased out in most current Android devices in favor of Google Cast, which isn't available here. There's also a web browser on the TV, though using it with the physical buttons is much more awkward than on other LG TVs with the Magic Remote for smoother cursor control. Performance and HDR Just because a TV can accept a high dynamic range (HDR) signal doesn't necessarily mean it can do it justice, and like many budget televisions, that's the case with the 49UH6100. We test TVs using a DVDO AVLab 4K test pattern generator, a Klein K-10A colorimeter, and Portrait Displays' CalMAN 5 software on a Razer Blade Pro notebook. After a basic dark room calibration using the 49UH6100's ISF Calibrated (Dark) picture mode, the 49UH6100 displayed a modest peak brightness of 172.13cd/m2 and a poor black level of 0.15cd/m2 for a 1,147:1 contrast ratio. This means that, even if the TV can process HDR10 content, you don't get a very good range of brights and darks. This is typical performance for budget-minded 4K TVs from major manufacturers—the similarly priced Sony XBR-49X800D shows similar contrast. Vizio's M-series is a bit more expensive, but its panel can get much brighter and darker for a far greater 40,670:1 contrast ratio. Color doesn't fare much better. The chart above shows Rec.709 ideal color values as squares and measured color values as dots. While the TV shows an impressive reach for greens, its reds fall slightly short, and cyan and magenta are very skewed. LG provides a full suite of calibration tools to fix these problems, but out of the box the colors simply aren't very good. Curiously, we've seen the best performance in this price range from lesser-known manufacturers, like LeEco's Super 4x series displays remarkably wide and accurate colors out of the box, and it boasts four times the contrast at 4,938:1. Viewing Experience Despite measured issues with picture quality, HDR content still looks fairly vivid and eye-catching on the 49UH6100. The TV's strong range of greens makes the "Jungle" episode of BBC's Planet Earth II on Ultra HD Blu-ray appear natural and colorful. However, darker parts of scenes, like the fur of lemurs, suffer from the TV's poor black levels—though the hairs can be clearly discerned under sunlight, their fine texture becomes a muddy blob of darkness in shady shots. And while the greens are exceptionally rich and detailed, blues and reds don't exhibit quite as much vibrancy. See How We Test TVs The Great Gatsby demonstrates the 49UH6100's weakness in dark scenes much more prominently. In the film's several dark settings, the characters' black suits disappear against the shadows of the backgrounds, showing very little texture or contour of the fabric. The white shirts and garden lights get satisfyingly bright to prevent the picture from looking too washed out, but anything very dark tends to simply vanish from a lack of deep black levels to provide more room for details in the shadows. Input Lag and Power Consumption Input lag is the amount of time between when a TV receives a signal and the display updates. In the ISF Calibrated (Dark) picture mode, the 49UH6100 shows a poor 75.7ms input lag. However, the Game picture mode displays a far better 16.7ms input lag, at the expense of further skewing the TV's colors cool. This is good performance for any 4K TV. Under normal viewing conditions, the 49UH6100 consumes 76 watts in ISF Expert (Bright) and other modes that push the backlight to full. The ISF Expert (Dark) picture mode cuts that down to 67 watts, slightly under the TV's power-saving APS picture mode. This is a bit lower than the Sony XBR-49X800D, which uses 89 watts. Conclusions The LG 49UH6100 sounds like a fantastic TV on paper, but it makes some major trade-offs in picture quality to hit its low price. While it's packed full of features, including LG's WebOS connected interface and support for HDR content, its poor black levels significantly hold it back, and its wider color gamut seems to only extend to greens. If you want an HDR-capable 4K TV on a budget, the LeEco Super4 X series offers fantastic colors, while the Vizio M-series provides remarkable contrast for its price. If you want strong picture quality with both excellent contrast and a wide range of color, you should prepare to shell out significantly more on a high-end LED TV like LG's UH8500 series.

All rights reserved. jorik/Shutterstock.com Scientists Can Now Switch Between Electrons And Photons in a Single Transistor Welcome to the future. PETER DOCKRILL 11 MAY 2017   Researchers have developed a new kind of transistor laser that can switch between two stable energy states – electronic and photonic – which could one day enable data transfer 100 times faster than conventional digital devices. The transistor prototype features what's called bistability – the capability for a single switch to alternate between optical and electrical signal output – and could help lead to the development of light-based computer systems where data is shuttled in between semiconductors by photons instead of simply electrons.   "Building a transistor with electrical and optical bistability into a computer chip will significantly increase processing speeds," says microelectronics engineer Milton Feng from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, "because the devices can communicate without the interference that occurs when limited to electron-only transistors." In conventional electronic devices, microchips are made up of billions of tiny switches called transistors, which act as gateways to channel the flow of electrons across an integrated circuit. The problem with this model – which has worked pretty well for electronic devices for several decades up until now – is that as modern computer processors have become ever faster and more powerful, the number of transistors on them inevitably increases. This tendency is what's called Moore's Law – the famous prediction by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the transistor count on an integrated circuit will double every two years. Moore's Law has actually held up pretty well since it was first forecast back in the 1960s, but a range of technical issues are currently threatening to derail its continuation – which could put a stop to processors getting faster, if we can't think of new ways to build them. Chiefly, transistors have gotten so incredibly small now that it's getting harder to physically shrink them any further, and there are also concerns about how energy-efficient electron-based transistors will be if Moore's Law does continue in the future.   Besides those points, since light can travel significantly faster than electrons inside an integrated circuit, moving to photonics-based processors in place of solely electronic devices makes a lot of sense, which is why scientists are busy studying how we can develop light-based computers. To that end, Feng and fellow researcher Nick Holonyak Jr first developed the concept of the transistor laser back in 2004 – a semiconductor device that incorporates both electrical and optical outputs. "The fastest way for current to switch in a semiconductor material is for the electrons to jump between bands in the material in a process called tunnelling," Feng explained in 2016. "Light photons help shuttle the electrons across, a process called intra-cavity photon-assisted tunnelling, making the device much faster." In their latest research, the same team has now described how the transistor laser can switch between the two signals – a crucial distinction for optical computing, since despite the allure of photonics, the researchers say we will still need to accommodate electrons in future chip designs. "You cannot remove electronics entirely because you need to plug into a current and convert that into light," says Feng.   "That's the problem with the all-optical computer concept some people talk about. It just is not possible because there is no such thing as an all-optical system." In the new study, the researchers detail how they've got their bistable switch working at -50 degrees Celsius (-58 degrees Fahrenheit). The researchers further claim to have actually gotten the device working at room temperature – which is pretty important if we're ever going to use these transistors in actual devices – and will share details on how they accomplished that in an upcoming paper. As for when we'll see this kind of technology in our smartphones and notebooks, it's still not entirely clear. But it's a sure bet that when our microchips include billions of tiny lasers in them, a whole new kind of computing will become possible. "This is a single device that provides bistability for both electrical and optical functions with one switch," says Feng. "It is totally new, and we are working hard to find more new applications for the device." The findings are reported in the Journal of Applied Physics.

Digital Trends Home > Virtual Reality > Microsoft’s mixed reality headsets are… Microsoft’s mixed reality headsets are finally here, and you can pre-order Acer’s By Matt Smith — Updated May 11, 2017 10:44 am Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Windows Mixed Reality headsets will sell at much lower prices than previous models, and will support motion control without the need to set up external sensors. Microsoft maintained its commitment to Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) during its Day 2 keynote at Build 2017. There, the company announced retail availability of two headsets alongside the reveal of a Windows Mixed Reality motion controller. The first headset, from Acer, is now available for pre-order at $299. The second, from HP, will set you back $329. Though labeled as developer kits, the units are much more accessible than, say, the HoloLens. Microsoft said both headsets will be available for pre-order starting Thursday, May 11, on the Microsoft Store. Delivery is set for summer, though no specific date is set. This is not the first availability of Acer’s headset. Microsoft made an announcement regarding availability to “developer partners” at GDC 2017. However, that rollout was extremely limited. The headset could not be ordered at a retailer, so today’s reveal marked the headset’s first widespread availability. We recently had chance to try the headset, and were impressed by what we saw. The existence of WMR headsets, though exciting, is no surprise. The big reveal is Microsoft’s new Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers. While the existence of a controller for use with WMR is no shock — it was sure to happen eventually — the technology used is impressive. “Inside-out” tracking is the weapon of choice, which means the controllers rely on sensors in the headset itself instead of external units. This is the method used by Intel’s Project Alloy and Qualcomm’s Virtual Reality Development Kit, but neither of those have controllers. They use inside-out tracking to determine the headset’s position and orientation. Project Alloy can also see the user’s hands and use that as a method of control, but its imprecise. Microsoft says the controller will offer six degrees of freedom, and will be useful anywhere a headset’s sensors can detect them. That means they will work best when in front of the user, but may not work at all if held behind the user’s back. The company intends to treat the controllers as a platform, not a set-in-stone device. Representatives said partners are working on their own controllers, which “must adhere to a specification,” but may otherwise deviate. There’s still some vagueness in how Microsoft describes this relationship, so it’s unclear how common third-party controllers will be. Right now, Acer seems to be the only partner jumping on the bandwagon. A $399 bundle that pairs its headset alongside the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers will be available alongside the $299, stand-alone headset. The controllers are in their infancy. It’s hard to say how well the controllers will work, and Microsoft declined to provide demos at Build 2017. However, the aggressive pricing of Acer’s bundle seems a shot across the bow of Oculus and HTC, both of which charge $800 for their VR headsets with motion controllers included.

Macy’s, among other retailers, reported quarterly results that were at least as poor as expected, and in some cases worse. No sector traded higher this afternoon and the big losers were consumer discretionary and real estate stocks. WTI crude oil for June delivery settled at $47.83 a barrel, up 1.1% on the day and the highest closing price in 10 days. June gold added 0.4% for the day to settle at $1,224.20. Equities were headed for a lower close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.11% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down 0.20%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded down 0.20%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Thursday was Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) which traded down 1.39% at $68.35. The stock’s 52-week range is $48.04 to $69.71. Volume was nearly equal to the daily average of around 21.8 million shares. The company today announced its latest update to Windows 10. The Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) traded down 1.27% at $156.12. The stock’s 52-week range is $119.20 to $158.15. Volume was 25% below the daily average of around 4 million shares. The stock was downgraded by Atlantic Equities on valuation. American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) traded down 0.99% at $77.87. The stock’s 52-week range is $57.15 to $82.00. Volume was about 30% below the daily average of around 3.9 million. The company had no specific news Thursday. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) traded down 0.92% at $35.68. The stock’s 52-week range is $29.50 to $38.45. Volume was about 30% below the daily average of around 23 million shares. The company had no specific news Thursday, but last night’s strong report from Nvidia probably didn’t help the shares today. Of the Dow stocks, 12 are on track to close higher Thursday and 18 are set to close lower.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Watch Windows 10 running on ARM with full support for existing Win32 apps Emil Protalinski@EPro May 11, 2017 2:07 PM During a Windows 10 on ARM session at Build 2017, Microsoft shared some more details about Windows 10 on ARM. Not only will Windows 10 on ARM support Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, Win32 apps in the Windows Store, but also existing Win32 apps. Back in December 2016, Microsoft first revealed that it will allow Windows desktop apps to run on mobile ARM processors, but the company did not disclose a timeframe for when to expect such devices. Last month, Qualcomm shared that the first ARM laptops running Windows 10 won’t arrive until Q4 2017. “For the first time ever, our customers will be able to experience the Windows they know with all the apps, and peripherals they require, on a mobile, power efficient, always-connected cellular PC,” the session’s description reads. Watch Hari Pulapaka, Microsoft’s lead program manager in the Windows Core Kernel Platform Group, take it away: Pulapaka shows how well the x86 on ARM emulation layer works. In the video, you can see Edge and other first-party apps running without a hitch. Pulapaka then goes even further by downloading, installing, and running the x86 version of 7zip. The promise is "very close to native" performance, truly an impressive feat. This is possible because the emulator leverages the Windows on Windows (WOW) layer, the same one used to run x86 apps on 64-bit processors. But the real magic happens with Compiled Hybrid Portable Executable files, which are generated from ARM64 code. The whole process is seamless, meaning users will not have to do anything to run Win32 apps on devices with Snapdragon chips. In fact, it’s very likely that most people won’t even know the difference — Whether they buy a computer powered by an Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm processor, everything should largely work the same. Compare this to Windows 10 S, which only allows installing and running apps from the Windows Store, and it’s clear which types of devices will have the better experience. You may not be able to play demanding PC games on your ARM computer, but everything from casual games to complex software will apparently work just fine.

John CornynJohn CornynGOP senators pitch Merrick Garland for FBI director Overnight Healthcare: Portman, Toomey tasked with Medicaid talks | Trump threatens to stop ObamaCare payments | Senate defends writing health bill in private Intel chairman briefs Senate GOP after Comey firing MORE (R-Texas) added that Burr's briefing was largely focused on the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation.    "I think all he did was for those people who aren't on the Intelligence Committee or the Judiciary Committee [was] give an update on the progress of the investigation and the fact that he and vice chairman Warner are working well together to subpoena witnesses, to interview witness, to collect information," Cornyn added.    Burr confirmed that he briefed his caucus during their lunch on Thursday.    The Senate Intelligence Committee is investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election, as well as any potential connections between members of Trump's campaign and Moscow.    Members of the committee have stressed that its probe will keep moving forward even after Comey's firing. The former FBI director met with the Senate Intelligence Committee several times since it started its investigation.    Burr and Warner announced this week that they have subpoenaed former national security adviser Michael Flynn for documents tied to their investigation. They've also hinted they would be willing to subpoena former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page if he doesn't cooperate in their investigation.     Cornyn added that he thought the Flynn subpoena would be "important for other potential witnesses too, in terms of their cooperation."   Trump's decision to remove Comey shocked Washington, including Senate Republicans, and has sparked a landslide of press reports speculating about why he was fired and if it was related to the FBI's investigation into Russia's meddling in the White House race.    Comey reportedly asked Rosenstein for more resources for the bureau's investigation shortly before he was fired, though the Department of Justice has denied those allegations.    Burr told reporters after his meeting with Rosenstein that they didn't discuss Comey's firing but focused instead on coordinating their investigations on Russia's election interference.

Asked by Sinclair Broadcast Group reporter Michelle Macaluso about the reported threat, Rosenstein responded, "No, I'm not quitting." The statement contradicts a Washington Post report on Wednesday that said that Rosenstein had threatened to leave the Justice Department. The Post report said that Rosenstein, who wrote the memo to Trump recommending Comey's ouster, had threatened to quit because the White House had painted his recommendation as the driving force behind the FBI chief's termination. ADVERTISEMENT Other news outlets reported that Rosenstein was upset with the administration's portrayal of the matter.  Trump abruptly fired Comey on Tuesday, writing in a letter to the FBI chief that he no longer felt Comey was capable of leading the bureau.

Trump said on Thursday, however, that the decision to fire Comey was his alone and that he would have done so "regardless of the recommendation" from Rosenstein. Competing accounts of the firing have also emerged, saying that Trump had decided to fire Comey and asked Rosenstein to build the case for ousting the FBI director.

Some of the wealthiest and most influential entrepreneurs in the world dropped out of college. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg all left college before they could collect their diplomas. Peter Thiel even encourages talented students to drop out of college by funding a scholarship that awards recipients with $100,000 if they quit. This infographic, created by Funders and Founders designer Anna Vital, pinpoints the moments when some of the most successful millionaire and billionaire college dropouts decided higher ed wasn't for them. While staying in school as long as possible is proven to increase your wealth and future job prospects, these 10 accomplished entrepreneurs bucked convention and still achieved success. Michael Dell Michael Dell dropped out of University of Texas at Austin his freshman year at the age of 19. He would go on to found Dell Technologies and is now worth $20.9 billion. Steve Jobs The founder of Apple left Reed College when he was just 19, reportedly because it was too much of a financial burden for his family. Despite his short tenure at Reed, Jobs still found his time there valuable. In a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford, he credited a Reed calligraphy course for providing the inspiration for the typography he used on the first Mac. Julian Assange Before he was a controversial computer hacker, Julian Assange studied mathematics at the University of Melbourne. The Aussie WikiLeaks founder showed early indications of his anti-establishment ideals when he dropped out at the age of 19 over objections to the practice of students working on computer projects for the Australian military. Bill Gates Bill Gates attended Harvard for two years before leaving to build what would become Microsoft. The Harvard Crimson describes him as "Harvard's most successful dropout," and today he is the wealthiest person on the planet. Evan Williams Evan Williams grew up in Clarks, Nebraska, where his family ran a farm. He attended the University of Nebraska at Lincoln for three semesters before dropping out. Williams was a freelance software programmer for Hewlett-Packard and Intel before landing a gig at Google. He later quit his job at Google to build Twitter, and became a billionaire. Mark Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard, founded Facebook and became the 5th wealthiest man alive. According to the book "The Facebook Effect," it took him just five minutes to make the decision to quit college. Larry Ellison Today, Larry Ellison is known as a software billionaire and founder of Oracle. When he was growing up, however, his adoptive parents encouraged him to be a doctor. He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Chicago, but struggled with his medical courses and dropped out. Today he is worth over $55 billion. Jan Koum Immigrant entrepreneur Jan Koum worked his way through college only to quit before graduating. He would go on to work for Yahoo, and then to invent the incredibly popular messaging application WhatsApp. Travis Kalanick Before becoming the CEO and founder of Uber, Travis Kalanick studied computer engineering at UCLA. Kalanick decided to quit college just months before graduating to work for now-defunct peer-to-peer search engine Scour. John Mackey John Mackey studied religion and philosophy at the University of Texas before dropping out, borrowing $45,000, and starting a health food store called SaferWay in downtown Austin. Mackey grew his business into what is now organic grocery behemoth Whole Foods. Show Comments And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2017 is...

Startups, Biotech Edico Genome raises $22M to accelerate adoption of genomic analysis platform By Josh Baxt Post a comment / May 11, 2017 at 4:07 PM Shares62 San Diego-based Edico Genome has received $22 million in Series B financing to staff up and speed adoption of its Dragen genomic data platform. The round was led by new investor Dell Technologies Capital, and included previous investors Qualcomm Ventures, Axon Ventures and NuVasive CEO Greg Lucier. “We’re going to extend and expand the engineering, sales and marketing teams,” said Pieter van Rooyen, Edico’s president and CEO in a phone interview. “Our focus is to build out the team and grow revenue.” Dragen is designed around the company’s field programmable gate array (FPGA), a dynamic processor that can be reprogrammed whenever necessary. The company holds nine patents on the technology, which rapidly clarifies genomic data and could make it easier to use genomics to diagnose patients. “We take the data that comes off the sequencer, which is about a 180-gig file,” said van Rooyen. “We process and analyze it and the output is around a one gig file, and that contains all the variants associated with a specific patient.” Dragen’s biggest asset is speed. According to van Rooyen, the platform can process an entire genome in 20 minutes when used from a local server – as little as ten minutes when linked to the Amazon AWS cloud. Edico is building an impressive array of partnerships to extend the technology – IBM, Intel, Johns Hopkins – and van Rooyen hints there are others in the pipeline. In late 2015, Dragen collaborated with Illumina, Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City and Stephen Kingsmore on a groundbreaking study that showed whole genome sequencing could diagnose neonatal intensive care patients in 26 hours. The feat holds the Guinness record for fastest genetic diagnosis. The company hopes to build on this and other early successes, believing its FPGA technology gives it a distinct edge in both speed and price.  Still, there’s no shortage of competition: GenomeCloud, Genalice and DNAnexus are just a few of the companies offering similar services. Ultimately, van Rooyen and colleagues are betting the industry will standardize the genomic informatics pipeline, making data sharing more routine, and Edico will have a seat at the table. “We have a strong IP portfolio, and we’re in the process of becoming the industry standard for precision medicine analytics and data analysis,” said van Rooyen.

Pre-order: Surface Laptop Flip it good New ASUS VivoBook Flip convertible makes appearance ahead of launch By Dan Thorp-Lancaster Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 10:37 am EDT 7 Comments Alongside the new ZenBook Flip UX370, which we recently saw pass through the FCC, it looks like ASUS is gearing up to launch another convertible "Flip" notebook: the VivoBook Flip TP401. In an image included in a presentation from ASUS' latest financial results (via Notebook Italia), the new VivoBook Flip makes an appearance alongside its ZenBook sibling with the tagline "empowering luxury for everyone." Judging by the image, it looks like the ZenBook Flip UX370 — pegged as the "ultimate luxury" — will occupy the top of the range, while the VivoBook will sit somewhere below. There's not much else to glean, other than that the VivoBook Flip TP401 will come in at 15mm thick, which compares to 12mm for the ZenBook Flip. The overall designs look fairly similar, with the VivoBook able to flip its hinge 360 degrees to go from laptop to tent or tablet mode on the fly. It's likely we'll see the VivoBook Flip TP401 arrive with Intel's latest 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors, and Notebook Italia speculates it will pack a 14-inch display with up to 512GB of SSD storage, up to 16GB of RAM, and optional dedicated NVIDIA graphics. Take any talk of specs with the requisite grain of salt until we get a full reveal, however. In any case, it's likely we may see both notebooks launched at Computex 2017, which runs from May 30 through June 3, alongside more prominent gaming announcements from ASUS.

However, after using the ASUS Q324UA ($1,200 at the time from Best Buy), I'm a bit concerned. The Q324UA had horrible screen bleed, one of the worst keyboards I've ever used on a laptop, a misaligned bottom plate, very weak Wi-Fi and a bad Precision trackpad. The fan was also on a lot, even when doing basic tasks. Come on, Surface Pro 5. All I want is Kaby Lake and USB-C. 1 10 hours ago Reply Dojo005 So you returned it right? I'm assuming you had bought it .... 0 9 hours ago Reply besweeet Oh of course. That thing was frustrating. 0 9 hours ago Reply Pappale i use ASUS products since 2005... i had everything from them from motherboard, GPU, mobile phones, tablets and even laptops and never had any problems with them :)) 0 9 hours ago Reply besweeet Our quality standards must be different. 0 9 hours ago Reply OsirisGaming Or, you were just unlucky. I've seen some that were bad and some that were very good. It kinda goes with the era and the model too. Asus probably has many different companies build their stuff and not all will have the same quality control standards. 0 6 hours ago Reply besweeet Probably. The worst for me has been HP. I went through five Spectre x360's (four from different Best Buys, one from HP.com). All had various trackpad, USB-C, battery, coil whine and keyboard issues. Best looking 2-in-1 out there that's plagued with problems (for me at least). If only Apple made a touchscreen MacBook. IMO, MacBooks are the best Windows 10 laptops around. Sounds like a very fanboy thing to say, but of the several PC laptops I've tried over the past 6 months, my 2015 retina MacBook Pro does the Windows 10 experience much better -- including both the software and hardware. 0 6 hours ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Military & Intelligence 21:40 11.05.2017(updated 00:20 12.05.2017) Get short URL 52880253 Chinese computer scientists have developed a prototype of a groundbreaking new quantum computer, and promised to create a version as powerful as the world's most powerful supercomputer by 2020. RIA Novosti contributor Ilya Plekhanov explains how and why the world's leading military powers plan to convert these machines into powerful weapons. Last week, Chinese computing engineers announced that they had successfully created a quantum computer which is faster than the early generation of mid-20th century conventional computing machines.  The innovation, developed by researchers at the University of Science and Technology at Hefei, and presented in Shanghai last Wednesday, is groundbreaking because it uses the way particles interact at a subatomic level to make calculations. Conventional computers, on the other hand, make use of electronic gates, switches and binary code.  © Flickr/ Patrick IBM’s Quantum Computers to Open 'New Realm of Computational Power, Unachievable Before'Xinhua news agency explained that unlike conventional silicon chip-based computers, which render data in one of two states (1 or 0), quantum computers allow data to exist in both states simultaneously, giving quantum computers the ability to hold exponentially more information.  Quantum computers operate on quantum bits or 'qubits' – the unit of quantum information analogous to the classical bit. The computing power of a quantum computer grows exponentially as the number of quantum bits (or 'qubits') which can be manipulated is increased. Accordingly, a quantum computer with 50 manipulatable qubits would be more powerful than the Sunway TaihuLight, the fastest supercomputer in existence today (and also operating in China, incidentally). Chinese scientists say they are making rapid progress, and that they expect to build a quantum computer as powerful as a common laptop by the end of this year, and as powerful as the world's most powerful supercomputer by 2020. The Chinese prototype quantum computer system is said to already be over 24,000 times faster than its foreign counterparts. Commenting on this groundbreaking achievement by Chinese scientists, military observer and RIA Novosti contributor Ilya Plekhanov explained that purely theoretical computation capabilities aside, "the news is of great importance for the military sphere, where the possible use of quantum computers is being discussed with greater and greater frequency. All leading countries are aiming to be the first to create such machines." © US Air Force/Lockheed Martin Pilot ‘Doesn’t Have to Think About It’: New F-35 Weapon Crushes Moving TargetsPlekhanov explained that the first and most obvious military application for a modern, fully functional quantum computer is the capability to engage in near-instantaneous hacking into encrypted military servers, and those controlling the national infrastructure systems of the probably enemy. "In case of a military conflict, [having this capability] would give one side a huge advantage," the expert noted. US cybersecurity analysts have confirmed that other countries are already out there mining US systems, storing the data, and patiently waiting for the advent of quantum systems that would allow them to gain access to the most heavily encrypted US secrets. The speed of data computation and processing which quantum systems will allow for will also "significantly improve the work of unmanned and autonomous military vehicles, to which the conduct of military operations will be entrusted in the foreseeable future," Plekhanov noted. "Simply put, the military robots of the country that creates the first quantum computer will be able to make decisions faster, work more accurately, engage multiple targets, 'see' the battlefield better and calculate forward to greater depth than enemy robots. And this means that they would win battles," the observer added. © Sputnik/ Pavel Lisitsyn Russian combat robot. File photo © Flickr/ A Health Blog The Age of Artificial Superintelligence Plekhanov explained that quantum computers will also be used at various stages of the design of new weapons, new materials, "and even in the development of new strategies for warfare. [Battlefield] projections, naturally, are another area where quantum computers can be applied. Ray Johnson, the former technical director for Lockheed Martin, once said that quantum computers would be able to predict how satellite software behaves following a solar burst in the sun or a pulse from a nuclear explosion," something that's currently either very difficult or impossible to do. With the possible benefits of quantum computing self-evident, Plekhanov noted that multiple players, including Russia, China, the US, Canada, Japan, Israel and Europe are striving to get the upper hand, with China and the US battling for the top spot. Russia's Quantum Computing Research Earlier this year, Foundation for Advanced Research project head Maxim Vakstein revealed to Sputnik that the advanced military research agency had started work on the creation of a quantum computer based on superconductor technology in 2016, with "the technology that the project aims to create [allowing] our country to take a decent spot in the race to create the 'computer of the future'." © Flickr/ Bill Smith Quantum Stealth: Russian Scientists Developing Best Ever Invisibility CloakVakstein  did not offer any further details, but late last year, two leading Russian quantum computing research institutes – the Russian Quantum Center and the MISiS National University of Science & Technology, also announced the creation of a joint project known as Quantum Center, which aims at combining their efforts to create quantum computers. And quantum computing specifically for military applications hasn't gone without notice either, Plekhanov noted. Last year, the Russian state atomic energy corporation Rosatom, the Foundation for Advanced Studies and the Ministry of Education and Science signed onto a joint three-year project on the development of a quantum computer. Rosatom's nuclear weapons research institute at the All-Russia Research Institutes of Automatics (VNIIA) has been charged with taking the lead in organizing the project. © Wikipedia/ MISiS National University of Science and Technology MISiS Keeping tight-lipped on the details of the latter project, Sergei Salikhov, director of the Department of Science and Technology Ministry of Education and Science, did give a hint as to its objectives, saying: "This is the first time that we are joining such a serious project, where the boundaries of fundamental and applied science are somewhat arbitrary, and the results will be of significance importance to our country's defense capabilities." China and the US: Differing Approaches US experts have compared victory in the creation of the world's first powerful quantum computer with the moon landing, and added that a loss in the quantum computing race would be much more severe than the consequences of losing the race to the moon. In a recent interview for National Review, Dr. Chad Rigetti, a former member of the IBM's quantum-computing research group and now the CEO of his own company, Rigetti Computing, emphasized that "computing superiority is fundamental to long-term economic superiority, safety, and security."  © Photo: Northrop Grumman US Nuclear-Capable B-2 Bombers Get New Flight Management ProcessorsThe US, Rigetti said, must have a strategy that views quantum computing "as a way to regain American superiority in high-performance computing." Plekhanov noted that at present, "it is believed that investments into the development of quantum computers by companies such as Microsoft, Intel, IBM, D-Wave and Google make the US is the leader in this field. But such confidence may be deceiving." Last year, for instance, White House officials admitted that Washington's superiority in computer technology was "under siege," and that more investment was needed specifically in the area of quantum technologies. © AP Photo/ Li Xiang/Xinhua In this photo released by the Xinhua News Agency and taken on June 16, 2016, the Sunway TaihuLight, a new Chinese supercomputer, is seen in Wuxi, eastern China's Jiangsu Province Science education figures are indicative, Plekhanov wrote. Currently, US educational institutions produce just over half-a-million graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. In China, that figure is already 4.7 million, and growing. "China is already launching unhackable satellites with quantum-based communication systems, building quantum radars, hundreds of kilometers' worth of quantum communication lines, and creating the world's fastest supercomputers," the journalist added. © AFP 2017/ China's quantum satellite - nicknamed Micius after a 5th century BC Chinese scientist - blasts off from the Jiuquan satellite launch centre in China's northwest Gansu province on August 16, 2016 © Wikipedia/ MISiS Russian Scientists Developing 'Invisible' Data Transfer MethodEurope is focusing on the creation of its own quantum computer over the next ten years, investing the equivalent of about a billion dollars into its Quantum Technologies Flagship Program. Meanwhile, US state-based spending in the field of quantum developments is currently less than $200 million. The US, Plekhanov noted, is "pinning all their hopes on the success of private corporations." However, unlike the US, which has spread its considerable R&D spending on a broad range of perspective weapons, China, is focusing on long-term investments in a narrow range of areas, with projects outlined in detail years in advance. Ultimately, "if China manages to become the leader of the 'quantum revolution', then the geopolitical and military picture in the world will change dramatically," the observer concluded. ...

The new build is 16193, and the main new feature is the Story Remix app. As always though, there are a number of fixes, improvements, and known issues. Here's what got fixed and improved: PC Reset via Settings > Update & security > Recovery works again on non-English Insider Preview builds. Navigating to Settings > Personalization > Lock screen should no longer crash Settings app. We fixed an issue where Settings would crash on launch for Insiders using certain display languages, including Russian, French, Polish and Korean. If you were impacted by this on Build 16188, that means you won’t be able to open Windows Update to check for updates. However, your PC will download the new build in the background. Once the build is downloaded and staged, your device should automatically restart to install it when idle and outside of your configured active hours. Or you could go to Start and Power and choose to Update and Restart to install the build. We fixed the issue causing XAML designers in Visual Studio and Blend for Visual Studio to show an exception when a XAML file from a Universal Windows Platform project is opened. We fixed an issue resulting in some fonts not rendering properly in Greek or other single-byte system locales such as Hebrew or Arabic. We fixed an issue where the “clear all” button in Action Center wouldn’t work if a notification had been expanded. You can now use Ctrl + Win + N to directly open Narrator Settings. We fixed an issue where the Windows Store App Troubleshooter was erroneously showing the message “Not Fixed” instead of “Fixed” after following the steps to troubleshoot the error “Windows Store cache may be damaged”. We fixed an issue from recent flights that could lead to the PC no longer recognizing any USB device until the USB Root Hub had been disabled and re-enabled in Device Manager. Here are the known issues: Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) will fail to work on touch PC’s, showing a solid black window on launch. Non-touch enabled devices should not experience the issue. A temporary workaround if you would like to use WDAG is to go to Device Manager, expand Human Interface Devices and disable the “HID-compliant touch screen” and “Intel Precise Touch Device” if they are present. After a reboot try WDAG again. Re-enable these devices to restore touch. [DEVELOPERS] The XAML designer in Visual Studio 2017 hits an error causing a squiggle error under ThemeResource references to XAML’s generic.xaml resources. Some Insiders have reported seeing this error “Some updates were cancelled. We’ll keep trying in case new updates become available” in Windows Update. See this forum post for more details. Surface 3 devices fail to update to new builds if a SD memory card is inserted. The updated drivers for the Surface 3 that fix this issue have not yet been published to Windows Update. Outlook 2016 may hang on launch due to an issue where the spam filter gets stuck reading the Outlook Data File and the UI waits indefinitely for it to return. We’re investigating. We are investigating reports that Microsoft Edge fails to open PDFs with “Couldn’t open PDF. Something is keeping this PDF from opening” error. You will be unable to type in your password to log in to the Facebook, Instagram or Messenger apps. A workaround is to use the “Login with the browser” button. The Surface 3 issue has been there for a couple builds now, and presumably that firmware update is coming soon. To get today's build, head over to Settings -> Update & security -> Windows Update -> Check for updates. If you're not on the Fast ring yet, go to the Windows Insider Program tab and click 'Get started'.

Warner: Trump's actions cost us an opportunity to get to the truth    16 Hours Ago | 03:19 While newly fired FBI Director James Comey made mistakes, Sen. Mark Warner said he is offended by President Donald Trump's comments about him. "This is a continuing pattern of disrespecting the men and women who serve in our intelligence community," Warner told reporters after he and Sen. Richard Burr met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Warner, the ranking democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he believes Trump would be "better served" if he supported the intelligence community, rather than questioning the integrity of its leaders. Earlier Thursday, the president told NBC in an exclusive interview that he was going to fire Comey "regardless" of what the Justice Department recommended, contradicting what the White House said Wednesday. "Look, he's a a showboat, he's a grand-stander, the FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil. Less than a year ago, it hasn't recovered from that," Trump said at the White House. Sen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intel Committee, didn't directly respond to Trump's comments. While the Republican senator acknowledged Trump's authority to determine who leads the FBI, Burr reiterated his previous statement on Comey's removal, saying he found him to be incredibly ethical. Burr said the "lion's share of FBI employees" respect Comey. Sen. Richard Durbin, an intelligence committee member, chimed in via a tweet that Trump's interview comments showed the Russia investigation was a reason for firing Comey. Tweet White House officials are scrambling to justify the timing of Comey's termination, insisting that he lost his job because of his conduct in the probe into Hillary Clinton's emails last year. They said it had nothing to do with the FBI's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, which Comey first revealed publicly in March and includes any possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia. — CNBC's Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.

A self-driving car operated by the transportation company Uber stops at a red light in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In just a few years, self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with human drivers in many cities. (Gene J. Puskar/AP) By Associated Press By Associated Press May 11 at 1:09 PM In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, lawbreaking human drivers. That prospect is causing headaches for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit — which humans frequently exceed by 10 to 15 miles per hour. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double yellow line. But humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles, and other places, for instance, there’s the “California stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston, Massachusetts. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” said Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s self-driving car research. Although driverless cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic customs. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is super expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” said Missy Cummings, a Duke University professor who studies interactions between humans and self-driving cars. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe. There are narrow, busy streets in European cities, and a near free-for-all exists in the giant traffic jams of Beijing, China. In India’s capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. Already there have been cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with automatic emergency braking. “It’s hard to program-in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s self-driving car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors designed to assist drivers are already gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes companies developing driverless systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Someday self-driving cars will have common sense programmed in, so that they will cross a double-yellow line when needed or speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Still, some people involved in public safety say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. “You’ll never be able to make up a person’s ability to perceive what’s the right move at the time, I don’t think,” said New Jersey State Police Sergeant Ed Long. 0 Comments  Share on FacebookShare   Share on TwitterTweet Share via Email 0 Show Comments Discussion Policy Comments SuperFan Badge SuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.
