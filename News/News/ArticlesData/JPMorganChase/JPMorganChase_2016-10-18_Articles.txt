Copyright Mario Tama, Getty Images Advertisement Activist investor Nelson Peltz bought into General Electric Co. (IW 500/6) last year and went on to praise the growth potential he saw in the 124-year-old company’s shares. If he’s right, he’ll have to keep waiting. The stock is coming off its worst quarter in more than two years, posting a 5.9% drop in the three months ending Sept. 30. With the decline, GE is trading around the same level it was in October 2015, after Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP announced it had taken a $2.5 billion stake. The S&P 500 Index is up about 5% in that same span. “You have earnings risk, high expectations and weak underlying free cash flow, which to me is a pretty bad formula for a stock,” said Steve Tusa, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. who in May cut his rating on GE to underweight. “What you have is a good franchise where people expect too much out of it.” Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency What a President Trump Might Mean for the Internet of Things GE rallied last year as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt led a major transformation, shedding finance units and completing GE’s largest-ever industrial acquisition to reorient the business around energy, aviation and oil. While the company has continued to evolve, with an increasing focus on software, GE hasn’t been able to sustain the enthusiasm through 2016. When it reports third-quarter earnings this week, the Boston-based company will look to regain momentum and show investors that it can overcome a weak first half and persistently sluggish economy to deliver on growth expectations. That task became tougher after Honeywell International Inc. and Dover Corp. spooked industrial investors this month by trimming 2016 earnings forecasts. “They both cited some general industrial slowing, so that has made everyone nervous about the industrials,” said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who rates GE outperform. “If you feel like the macro is getting tougher, then that’s going to be a tough environment for investors.” Related GE Boosts Renewable-Energy Unit with $1.65 Billion Wind Deal GE Digs Deep on Digital Trian, which was co-founded by Peltz, Peter May and Ed Garden, last year revealed it held a roughly 1% stake in GE. The activist firm, which had been quietly buying shares for several months as GE traded in the mid-$20s, has taken a friendly and largely hands-off approach to the investment. “We’re very aligned with management, very aligned with the board,” Garden told Bloomberg in an interview last month. Trian declined to comment for this article. The move, seen as an endorsement of GE’s transformation strategy, generated a pop in the shares to almost $30 within two weeks. At the time, Trian said the stock, including dividends, could reach $45 a share by the end of 2017. ‘Optimistic’ Forecast GE closed Tuesday at $28.98 in New York, exactly where it was one year ago. The shares climbed as high as $32.93 a share in 2016, but they’ve slid since July, when the company reported an orders decline that jeopardized its ability to hit aggressive growth targets. The company has maintained its forecast of 2% to 4% organic growth for the year even as that metric fell 1% through the first six months and has remained weak across other industrial companies. Hitting the goal would require second-half growth of 5%, a target that “may be optimistic,” Karen Ubelhart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note. GE executives have said 2016 will be heavily weighted to late in the year, with gas-turbine shipments boosting earnings in the fourth quarter. GE declined to comment further. Related GE Drones to Squeeze More Savings from the Oil Patch GE Tabs Aviation Chief as Vice Chairman in Aerospace Nod Analysts have cut expectations for third-quarter adjusted earnings by about 2 cents in the past four weeks to 30 cents a share, according to an average of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The persistent lowering of expectations will make better-than-forecast earnings less meaningful, particularly if orders and free cash flow remain weak, said Tusa of JPMorgan. “It is a back end-loaded year, but it is a back end-loaded year that has undoubtedly, on an operating basis, been worse than expected,” said Tusa, whose price target is $28. As a result, investors are also questioning whether GE can achieve its earnings-per-share target of $2 in 2018, he said. Dray of RBC called the $2 forecast achievable if GE can make progress in the coming quarters on several fronts, including integrating assets acquired last year from Alstom SA and keeping the oil-and-gas division from falling more sharply than expected. GE’s prospects could depend less on near-term results and more on the ability to differentiate itself through its software business, according to Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co. Lack of growth in the industrial sector has made such efforts critical, he said, and GE is making progress with its Predix operating system and efforts to expand the GE Digital division. “This need to digitize to create customer and shareholder value is no longer optional and will require structural changes in the way industrial manufacturers create value,” Heymann, who rates GE outperform with a target of $38 a share, said in an Oct. 14 note. “GE is the vanguard of digitally enabled diversified industrials.” By Richard Clough Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTICE AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO CONTAIN INSIDE INFORMATION. Foresight Solar Fund Limited: Proposed Tap Issuance The Board of Foresight Solar Fund Limited (the 'Company') is pleased to announce a proposed tap issuance of up to 30,995,537 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (the 'New Shares'), representing approximately 9.99 per cent. of the Company's issued share capital at an issuance price of 103.00 pence per New Share (the 'Tap Issuance'). Foresight Group CI Limited (the 'Investment Manager') believes the UK solar market remains attractive, particularly given the recent recovery and positive momentum in UK wholesale power prices. As detailed in the Company's interim results released on 15 August 2016, the Investment Manager has identified an attractive pipeline of over 200MW to support the growth of the Company over the next twelve months.  From this pipeline, the Company has entered into exclusivity/binding agreements to purchase operational, fully accredited UK solar assets totaling 82MW which it expects to acquire before the year end. The assets under exclusivity are a combination of 1.4 and 1.3 ROC assets. The net proceeds of the proposed Tap Issuance will enable the Company to take advantage of these and other investment opportunities as and when they become available. The Tap Issuance is being conducted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, through a bookbuild process which will be launched immediately following this announcement.  Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited ('Stifel') and J.P. Morgan Securities plc, which carries on its UK investment banking activities as J.P. Morgan Cazenove ('J.P. Morgan Cazenove'), are acting as joint bookrunners in connection with the Tap Issuance.  Members of the public are not entitled to participate in the Tap Issuance. The Tap Issuance is being effected pursuant to the authority granted at the Company's General Meeting on 18 October 2016, permitting the allotment of up to 30,995,537 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (the 'Ordinary Shares') on a non pre-emptive basis. The Tap Issuance price of 103.00 pence per New Share is equal to the NAV per Ordinary Share of 100.7 pence as at 30 September 2016 plus an estimate of accrued income attributable to the Company since this date, plus a premium to cover issuance costs. The New Shares will, when issued, be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares, including in respect of the right to receive all future dividends and distributions declared, made or paid by reference to a record date falling after their issue, including without limitation an entitlement to the third quarterly dividend of 1.54 pence in respect of the period from 1 July to 30 September 2016, which was approved by the Directors on 18 October 2016 and will be paid on 31 December 2016. The Company will apply for admission of the New Shares to listing on the premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority (the 'FCA') and to trading on the main market for listed securities of London Stock Exchange plc (the 'London Stock Exchange') ('Admission'). It is expected that settlement of subscriptions in respect of the New Shares and Admission will take place and that trading in the New Shares will commence at 8.00am (London Time) on Friday 28 October. The Tap Issuance is conditional upon, inter alia, Admission becoming effective not later than 8.00am on Friday 28 October (or such later date as Stifel and J.P. Morgan Cazenove may agree with the Company and the Investment Manager) and the Placing Agreement dated 19 October 2016 among the Company, the Investment Manager, Stifel and J.P. Morgan Cazenove (the 'Placing Agreement') becoming unconditional and not being terminated in accordance with its terms. Further details of the Placing Agreement can be found in the terms and conditions of the Tap Issuance set out in the Appendix to this announcement (which forms part of this announcement) (the 'Terms and Conditions'). By choosing to participate in the Tap Issuance and by making an oral and legally binding offer to subscribe for New Shares, investors will be deemed to have read and understood this announcement (including the Appendix), in its entirety and to be making such offer on the terms and subject to the conditions in this announcement, and to be providing the representations, warranties and acknowledgements contained in the Appendix. Your attention is drawn to the detailed Terms and Conditions of the Tap Issuance set out in the Appendix to this announcement. Alex Ohlsson, Chairman of the Company, said, 'The recent upward movements in wholesale power prices have been positive for the sector, and the Company has identified an attractive pipeline of assets that will support the growth of the Company over the next 12 months.  Having secured exclusivity over an 82MW operational portfolio, additional funds raised can be deployed quickly into income generating assets thereby avoiding the impact of cash drag on investors.' Tap Issuance Timetable The timetable is subject to change at the discretion of the Company, Stifel and  J.P. Morgan Cazenove. The decision to allot any New Shares to placees pursuant to the Tap Issuance shall be at the discretion of the Company, Stifel and J.P. Morgan Cazenove. +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ |Tap Issuance opens |Immediately upon release of this | | |announcement on Wednesday 19 October | | |2016 | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ |Latest time and date for receipt of |01:00pm on Tuesday 25 October 2016 | |Tap Issuance commitments | | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ |Results of Tap Issuance announced and |Wednesday 26 October 2016 | |Trade Date | | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ |Settlement (T+2) |Friday 28 October 2016 | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ For further information, please contact: Foresight Group Elena Palasmith                epalasmith@foresightgroup.eu                 +44 (0)20 3667 8100 Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Joint Bookrunner) +44 (0)20 7710 7600 Mark Bloomfield Neil Winward Tunga Chigovanyika  J.P.

Details of the Placing Agreement and of the New Shares The Joint Bookrunners, the Company and the Investment Manager have today entered into a placing agreement (the 'Placing Agreement') under which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out therein, the Joint Bookrunners have agreed, as agent for and on behalf of the Company, to use reasonable endeavours to procure placees (the 'Placees') for up to 30,995,537 New Shares at a price to be determined following completion of a bookbuild process (the 'Tap Issuance'). The New Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (the 'Ordinary Shares'), including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of the Ordinary Shares after the date of admission of the New Shares, including the third quarterly dividend of 1.54 pence in respect of the period from 1 July to 30 September 2016, which was approved by the Directors on 18 October 2016 and will be paid on 31 December 2016. Applications for listing and admission to trading Applications will be made to the FCA for admission of the New Shares to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority (the 'Official List') and to London Stock Exchange plc (the 'London Stock Exchange') for admission of the New Shares to trading on its main market for listed securities (together, 'Admission'). It is expected that Admission will become effective on or around 8.00 a.m. on Friday 28 October and that dealings in the New Shares will commence at that time. Bookbuild The Joint Bookrunners will today commence the bookbuilding process for participation in the Tap Issuance by Placees (the 'Bookbuild'). This Appendix gives details of the terms and conditions of, and the mechanics of participation in, the Tap Issuance. No commissions will be paid to Placees or by Placees in respect of any New Shares. The Joint Bookrunners shall be entitled to effect the Tap Issuance by such alternative method to the Bookbuild as they may, in their absolute discretion following consultation with the Company and the Investment Manager, determine. Participation in, and principal terms of, the Tap Issuance 1.        Each of Stifel and J.P. Morgan Cazenove is acting as a bookrunner and agent of the Company in connection with the Tap Issuance. 2.        Participation in the Tap Issuance will only be available to persons who may lawfully be, and are, invited to participate by the Joint Bookrunners. The Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates are entitled to enter bids in the Bookbuild as principal. 3.        A single price of 103.00 pence per New Share shall be payable to the Joint Bookrunners as agent for the Company by all Placees whose bids are successful (the 'Placing Price'). The results of the Tap Issuance will be announced on a Regulatory Information Service ('RIS') following the completion of the Bookbuild (the 'Placing Results Announcement'). 4.        To bid in the Bookbuild, prospective Placees should communicate their bid by telephone to their usual sales contact at one of the Joint Bookrunners. Each bid should state the number of New Shares which the prospective Placee wishes to subscribe for at the Placing Price. Bids may be scaled down by the Joint Bookrunners on the basis referred to in paragraph 8 below. 5.        A bid in the Bookbuild will be made on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Appendix and will be legally binding on the Placee on behalf of which it is made and except with the Joint Bookrunners' consent will not be capable of variation or revocation after the time at which it is submitted. Each Placee's obligations will be owed to the Company and the Joint Bookrunners. Each Placee will also have an immediate, separate, irrevocable and binding obligation, owed to the Joint Bookrunners as agents of the Company, to pay in cleared funds immediately on the settlement date, in accordance with the registration and settlement requirements set out below, an amount equal to the product of the Placing Price and the number of New Shares such Placee has agreed to subscribe for and the Company has agreed to allot. 6.        The Bookbuild is expected to close no later than 01:00pm (London time) on Tuesday 25 October 2016, but may be closed earlier or later at the discretion of the Joint Bookrunners. The Joint Bookrunners may, in agreement with the Company and the Investment Manager, accept bids that are received after the Bookbuild has closed. 7.        Each prospective Placee's allocation will be agreed between the Joint Bookrunners (in consultation with the Company and the Investment Manager) and will be confirmed orally by either of the Joint Bookrunners (as agent for the Company) following the close of the Bookbuild and a trade confirmation will be despatched thereafter. This oral confirmation to such Placee will constitute an irrevocable legally binding commitment upon that person (who will at that point become a Placee) in favour of the Bookrunners and the Company to subscribe for the number of New Shares allocated to it at the Placing Price on the terms and conditions set out in this Appendix and in accordance with the Company's articles of association. All obligations under the Bookbuild and Tap Issuance will be subject to fulfilment of the conditions referred to below under 'Conditions of the Tap Issuance' and to the Tap Issuance not being terminated on the basis referred to below under 'Right to terminate under the Placing Agreement'. By participating in the Bookbuild, each Placee will agree that its rights and obligations in respect of the Tap Issuance will terminate only in the circumstances described below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by the Placee. 8.        The Joint Bookrunners may choose to accept bids, either in whole or in part, on the basis of allocations determined in agreement with the Company and may scale down any bids for this purpose on such basis as they may determine. The Joint Bookrunners may also, notwithstanding paragraphs 4 and 5 above and subject to prior consent of the Company (i) allocate New Shares after the time of any initial allocation to any person submitting a bid after that time and (ii) allocate New Shares after the Bookbuild has closed to any person submitting a bid after that time. The Company reserves the right (upon agreement with the Bookrunners) to reduce or seek to increase the amount to be raised pursuant to the Tap Issuance, in its absolute discretion. 9.        Irrespective of the time at which a Placee's allocation pursuant to the Tap Issuance is confirmed, settlement for all New Shares to be subscribed for pursuant to the Tap Issuance will be required to be made at the same time, on the basis explained below under 'Registration and settlement'. 10.      Except as required by law or regulation, no press release or other announcement will be made by the Joint Bookrunners or the Company using the name of any Placee (or its agent), in its capacity as Placee (or agent), other than with such Placee's prior written consent. 11.      To the fullest extent permissible by law, neither of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any responsibility or liability to Placees (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise). In particular, neither of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability (including to the fullest extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) in respect of the conduct of the Bookbuild or of such alternative method of effecting the Tap Issuance as the Joint Bookrunners and the Company may agree. Conditions of the Tap Issuance The Tap Issuance is conditional upon the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional and not having been terminated in accordance with its terms. The obligations of the Joint Bookrunners under the Placing Agreement in respect of the New Shares is conditional on, inter alia: (a)      agreement being reached between the Company and the Joint Bookrunners on the number of New Shares to be issued pursuant to the Tap Issuance; (b)      none of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Investment Manager contained in the Placing Agreement being untrue and inaccurate or misleading (in the good faith opinion of the Joint Bookrunners) on the date of the Placing Agreement and at all times before Admission by reference to the facts and circumstances then subsisting, in each case in a manner, or to an extent, which is material; (c)       each of the Company and the Investment Manager complying with its obligations under the Placing Agreement to the extent the same fall to be performed prior to Admission; (d)      the Company allotting, subject only to Admission, the New Shares to the Placees in accordance with the Placing Agreement; and (e)      Admission taking place by not later than 8.00 a.m. (London time) on Friday 28 October 2016. If (i) any of the conditions contained in the Placing Agreement, including those described above, are not fulfilled (or, where permitted, waived or extended in writing by the Joint Bookrunners or have become incapable of fulfilment on or before the date or time specified for the fulfilment thereof (or such later date and/or time as the Joint Bookrunners may agree), or (ii) the Placing Agreement is terminated in the circumstances specified below, the Tap Issuance will not proceed and the Placees' rights and obligations hereunder in relation to the New Shares shall cease and terminate at such time and each Placee agrees that no claim can be made by the Placee in respect thereof. Any such extension or waiver will not affect Placees' commitments as set out in this announcement. Neither of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) in respect of any decision they may make as to whether or not to waive or to extend the time and/or the date for the satisfaction of any condition to the Tap Issuance nor for any decision they may make as to the satisfaction of any condition or in respect of the Tap Issuance generally, and by participating in the Tap Issuance each Placee agrees that any such decision is within the absolute discretion of the Joint Bookrunners. Right to terminate under the Placing Agreement At any time before Admission, the Joint Bookrunners are entitled to terminate the Placing Agreement by giving notice in writing to the Company and the Investment Manager if, amongst other things, in their opinion (acting in good faith and following consultation with the Company to the extent practicable) (i) any of the Company's or the Investment Manager's warranties or representations contained in the Placing Agreement are not or cease to be true and accurate or have become misleading, in each case in a manner, or to an extent, which is material in the good faith opinion of the Joint Bookrunners; or (ii) there is a material breach by the Company or the Investment Manager of their respective obligations under the Placing Agreement; or (iii) there has been a material adverse change in the condition, financial, operational or otherwise, or in the earnings, management, business affairs, business prospects or financial prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, or the Investment Manager and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, since the date of the Placing Agreement; or (iv) the occurrence of a force majeure or market disruption event as specified in the Placing Agreement which is of such severity or magnitude as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the Tap Issuance or which the Joint Bookrunners consider to be material. Upon such notice being given, the parties to the Placing Agreement shall be released and discharged (except for any liability arising before or in relation to such termination) from their respective obligations under or pursuant to the Placing Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. By participating in the Tap Issuance, Placees agree that the exercise by the Joint Bookrunners of any right of termination or other discretion under the Placing Agreement shall be within their absolute discretion and that they do not need to make any reference to Placees and that the Joint Bookrunners shall not have any liability to Placees whatsoever in connection with any such exercise or failure so to exercise. No Prospectus No offering document or prospectus has been or will be submitted to be approved by the FCA or submitted to the London Stock Exchange in relation to the Tap Issuance and no such prospectus is required (in accordance with the Prospectus Directive) to be published and Placees' commitments will be made solely on the basis of the information contained in this announcement (including this Appendix) released by the Company today and any information publicly announced to a RIS by or on behalf of the Company on or prior to the date of this announcement and subject to the further terms set forth in the contract note to be provided to individual prospective Placees. Each Placee, by accepting a participation in the Tap Issuance, agrees that the content of this announcement (including this Appendix) is exclusively the responsibility of the Company and confirms that it has neither received nor relied on any other information, representation, warranty, or statement made by or on behalf of the Company, the Investment Manager or either of the Joint Bookrunners or any other person and none of the Company, the Investment Manager, either of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates will be liable for any Placee's decision to participate in the Tap Issuance based on any other information, representation, warranty or statement which the Placees may have obtained or received. Each Placee acknowledges and agrees that it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other position of the Company and the Investment Manager in accepting a participation in the Tap Issuance. Nothing in this paragraph shall exclude or limit the liability of any person for fraudulent misrepresentation by that person. Registration and settlement Settlement of transactions in the New Shares following Admission will take place within the system administered by Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited ('CREST'), subject to certain exceptions. The Joint Bookrunners and the Company reserve the right to require settlement for and delivery of the New Shares (or a portion thereof) to Placees in certificated form if delivery or settlement is not possible or practicable within the CREST system or would not be consistent with the regulatory requirements in the Placee's jurisdiction. Following the close of the Bookbuild for the Tap Issuance, each Placee allocated New Shares in the Tap Issuance will be sent a contract note stating the number of New Shares to be allocated to it at the Placing Price and settlement instructions. Each Placee agrees that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed in accordance with the standing CREST or certificated settlement instructions that it has in place with the Joint Bookrunners. The Company will deliver the New Shares to a CREST account operated by Stifel as the Company's agent and Friday 28 October 2016 will enter its delivery (DEL) instruction into the CREST system. The input to CREST by a Placee of a matching or acceptance instruction will then allow delivery of the relevant New Shares to that Placee against payment. It is expected that settlement will be on 28 October 2016 on a delivery versus payment basis in accordance with the instructions set out in the trade confirmation. Interest is chargeable daily on payments not received from Placees on the due date in accordance with the arrangements set out above at the rate of two percentage points above LIBOR as determined by the Joint Bookrunners. Each Placee is deemed to agree that, if it does not comply with these obligations, the Joint Bookrunners (as agent for the Company) may sell any or all of the New Shares allocated to that Placee on such Placee's behalf and retain from the proceeds, for the Company's account and benefit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any interest due. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the aggregate amount owed by it and may be required to bear any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (together with any interest or penalties) or other similar taxes imposed in any jurisdiction which may arise upon the sale of such New Shares on such Placee's behalf. If New Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees should ensure that the trade confirmation is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person within that organisation. Insofar as New Shares are registered in a Placee's name or that of its nominee or in the name of any person for whom a Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for such person, such New Shares should, subject as provided below, be so registered free from any liability to UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. Placees shall not be entitled to receive any fee or commission in connection with the Tap Issuance. Representations and warranties and further terms By participating in the Tap Issuance, each Placee (and any person acting on such Placee's behalf) irrevocably acknowledges, confirms, undertakes, represents, warrants and agrees (as the case may be) with each of the Joint Bookrunners (in its capacity as a bookrunner and agent of the Company, in each case as a fundamental term of its application for New Shares), the following: (a)      it has read and understood this announcement, including this Appendix, in its entirety and that its acquisition of New Shares is subject to and based upon all the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings and other information contained herein and undertakes not to redistribute or duplicate this announcement; (b)      that no offering document or prospectus has been or will be prepared in connection with the Tap Issuance and it has not received and will not receive a prospectus or other offering document in connection with the Bookbuild, the Tap Issuance or the New Shares; (c)       the Tap Issuance does not constitute a recommendation or financial product advice and no Joint Bookrunner has had regard to its particular objectives, financial situation and needs; (d)      that the Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company are listed on the premium listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange, and that the Company is therefore required to publish certain business and financial information in accordance with the rules and practices of the FCA and that it is able to obtain or access such information, or comparable information concerning any other publicly traded company, in each case without undue difficulty; (e)      that none of the Company, the Investment Manager the Joint Bookrunners any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees or any person acting on behalf of any of them has provided, and none of them will provide, it with any material regarding the New Shares or the Company or any other person other than this announcement, nor has it requested either of the Joint Bookrunners, the Company, the Investment Manager, any of their respective affiliates or any person acting on behalf of any of them to provide it with any such information; (f)       unless otherwise specifically agreed with the Joint Bookrunners, that it is not, and at the time the New Shares are subscribed for, neither it nor the beneficial owner of the New Shares will be, a resident of Australia, Canada, Japan or South Africa and further acknowledges that the New Shares have not been and will not be registered under the securities legislation of Australia, Canada, Japan or South Africa and, subject to certain exceptions, may not be offered, sold, transferred, delivered or distributed, directly or indirectly, in or into those jurisdictions; (g)      that it is not within the United States and will not be within the United States at the time that any buy order for New Shares is originated by it; (ii) is acquiring the New Shares in an 'offshore transaction' as defined in Regulation S under the US Securities Act; and (iii) is not acquiring any of the New Shares as a result of any form of 'directed selling efforts' (within the meaning of Regulation S under the US Securities Act); (h)      it is not within Australia, Canada, Japan South Africa or any other jurisdiction in which it is unlawful to make or accept an offer to subscribe for the New Shares, and it will not offer or sell such New Shares into any such jurisdiction; (i)       that the content of this announcement is exclusively the responsibility of the Company and that neither of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees or any person acting on behalf of any of them has or shall have any liability for any information, representation or statement contained in this announcement or any information previously or subsequently published by or on behalf of the Company or the Investment Manager, including, without limitation, any information required to be published by the Company pursuant to applicable laws (the 'Exchange Information') and will not be liable for any Placee's decision to participate in the Tap Issuance based on any information, representation or statement contained in this announcement or otherwise. Each Placee further represents, warrants and agrees that the only information on which it is entitled to rely and on which such Placee has relied in committing itself to subscribe for the New Shares is contained in this announcement and any information previously published by the Company by notification to a RIS, such information being all that it deems necessary to make an investment decision in respect of the New Shares and that it has neither received nor relied on any other information given or representations, warranties or statements made by either of the Joint Bookrunners, the Investment Manager or the Company and neither of the Joint Bookrunners, the Investment Manager or the Company will be liable for any Placee's decision to accept an invitation to participate in the Tap Issuance based on any other information, representation, warranty or statement. Each Placee further acknowledges and agrees that it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other position of the Company in deciding to participate in the Tap Issuance. None of the Company, the Investment Manager, the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates has made any representations to it, express or implied, with respect to the Company, the Investment Manager, the Tap Issuance and the New Shares or the accuracy, completeness or adequacy of the Exchange Information, and each of them expressly disclaims any liability in respect thereof.

and (ii) it is and will remain liable to the Company and/or the Joint Bookrunners for the performance of all its obligations as a Placee in respect of the Tap Issuance (regardless of the fact that it is acting for another person); (l)       if a financial intermediary, as that term is used in Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive, that the New Shares subscribed for by it in the Tap Issuance will not be subscribed for on a non-discretionary basis on behalf of, nor will they be subscribed for with a view to their offer or resale to, persons in a member state of the EEA other than Qualified Investors, or in circumstances in which the prior consent of the Joint Bookrunners has been given to the proposed offer or resale; (m)     that it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell any New Shares to the public in any member state of the EEA except in circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive which do not result in any requirement for the publication of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of that Directive;

It further confirms that it relied on its own examination and due diligence of the Investment Manager, the Company and their respective associates taken as a whole, and the terms of the Tap Issuance, including the merits and risks involved, and not upon any view expressed or information provided by or on behalf of either of the Joint Bookrunners; (z)       that in connection with the Tap Issuance, a Joint Bookrunner and any of its affiliates acting as an investor for its own account may take up New Shares in the Company and in that capacity may subscribe for, retain, purchase or sell for its own account such Ordinary Shares in the Company and any securities of the Company or related investments and may offer or sell such securities or other investments otherwise than in connection with the Tap Issuance. Neither of the Joint Bookrunners intends to disclose the extent of any such investment or transactions otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligation to do so; (aa)         that in making any decision to subscribe for the New Shares, it acknowledges that the Company has been established in Jersey as a listed fund under a fast-track authorisation process and is therefore only suitable for professional or experienced investors, or those who have taken appropriate professional advice. It further acknowledges that regulatory requirements which may be deemed necessary for the protection of retail or inexperienced investors, do not apply to listed funds and it accepts the reduced requirements accordingly; (bb)       that in making any decision to subscribe for the New Shares, it is responsible for ensuring that all aspects of the Company are acceptable to it. It further acknowledges that investment in listed funds may involve special risks that could lead to a loss of all or a substantial portion of such investment.  It further confirms that it fully understands and accepts the nature of the Company and the potential risks inherent in investing in the Company; (cc)     that these terms and conditions and any agreements entered into by it pursuant to these terms and conditions and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with such agreements shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and it submits (on behalf of itself and on behalf of any person on whose behalf it is acting) to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts as regards any claim, dispute or matter arising out of any such contract, except that enforcement proceedings in respect of the obligation to make payment for the New Shares (together with any interest chargeable thereon) may be taken by the Company or either of the Joint Bookrunners in any jurisdiction in which the relevant Placee is incorporated or in which any of its securities have a quotation on a recognised stock exchange; (dd)    that the Company, the Investment Manager, each of the Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the representations, warranties and acknowledgements set forth herein and which are given to each Joint Bookrunner on its own behalf and on behalf of the Company and are irrevocable and it irrevocably authorises the Company and each of the Joint Bookrunners to produce this announcement, pursuant to, in connection with, or as may be required by any applicable law or regulation, administrative or legal proceeding or official inquiry with respect to the matters set forth herein; (ee)    that it will indemnify on an after-tax basis and hold the Company, the Investment Manager, each of the Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates harmless from any and all costs, claims, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) arising out of or in connection with any breach of the representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings in this Appendix and further agrees that the provisions of this Appendix shall survive after completion of the Tap Issuance; (ff)      that it has neither received nor relied on any inside information concerning the Company in accepting the invitation to participate in the Tap Issuance; and (gg)     if it is a pension fund or investment company, its acquisition of New Shares is in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The foregoing representations, warranties and confirmations are given for the benefit of the Company, the Investment Manager and the Joint Bookrunners and are irrevocable. Each Placee, and any person acting on behalf of the Placee, acknowledges that none of the Company, the Investment Manager or either of the Joint Bookrunners owes any fiduciary or other duties to any Placee in respect of any representations, warranties, undertakings or indemnities in the Placing Agreement. By participating in the Tap Issuance, each Placee (and any person acting on the Placee's behalf) subscribing for New Shares acknowledges that the New Shares have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act and that the New Shares are being offered and sold only in an 'offshore transaction' within the meaning of and in reliance on Regulation S under the US Securities Act. Please also note that the agreement to allot and issue New Shares to Placees (or the persons for whom Placees are contracting as agent) free of stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax relates only to their allotment and issue to Placees, or such persons as they nominate as their agents, direct from the Company for the New Shares in question. Such agreement also assumes that the New Shares are not being subscribed for in connection with arrangements to issue depositary receipts or to issue or transfer the New Shares into a clearance service. If there are any such arrangements, or the settlement relates to any other dealing in the New Shares, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax or other similar taxes may be payable, for which none of the Company, the Investment Manager or either of the Joint Bookrunners will be responsible and the Placees shall indemnify the Company, the Investment Manager and each of the Joint Bookrunners on an after- tax basis for any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax paid by them in respect of any such arrangements or dealings. If this is the case, each Placee should seek its own advice and notify the Joint Bookrunners accordingly. None of the Company, the Investment Manager or either of the Joint Bookrunners are liable to bear any transfer taxes that arise on a sale of New Shares subsequent to their acquisition by Placees or for transfer taxes arising otherwise than under the laws of the United Kingdom. Each Placee should, therefore, take its own advice as to whether any such transfer tax liability arises and notify the Joint Bookrunners accordingly. Furthermore, each Placee agrees to indemnify on an after-tax basis and hold each Joint Bookrunner, the Investment Manager and/or the Company and their respective affiliates harmless from any and all interest, fines or penalties in relation to stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax and all other similar duties or taxes to the extent that such interest, fines or penalties arise from the unreasonable default or delay of that Placee or its agent. Each Placee and any person acting on behalf of each Placee acknowledges and agrees that the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates may, at their absolute discretion, agree to become a Placee in respect of some or all of the New Shares. When a Placee or person acting on behalf of the Placee is dealing with the Joint Bookrunners, any money held in an account with any Joint Bookrunner on behalf of the Placee and/or any person acting on behalf of the Placee will not be treated as client money within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the FCA made under FSMA. The Placee acknowledges that the money will not be subject to the protections conferred by the client money rules; as a consequence, this money will not be segregated from such Joint Bookrunner's money in accordance with the client money rules and will be used by that Joint Bookrunner in the course of its own business; and the Placee will rank only as a general creditor of that Joint Bookrunner. All times and dates in this announcement may be subject to amendment by the Joint Bookrunners (in their absolute discretion). The Joint Bookrunners shall notify the Placees and any person acting on behalf of the Placees of any changes.

If he’s right, he’ll have to keep waiting. The stock is coming off its worst quarter in more than two years, posting a 5.9 percent drop in the three months ending Sept. 30. With the decline, GE is trading around the same level it was in October 2015, after Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP announced it had taken a $2.5 billion stake. The S&P 500 Index is up about 5 percent in that same span. Nelson Peltz Photographer: Kevin Lorenzi/Bloomberg “You have earnings risk, high expectations and weak underlying free cash flow, which to me is a pretty bad formula for a stock,” said Steve Tusa, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. who in May cut his rating on GE to underweight. “What you have is a good franchise where people expect too much out of it.” GE rallied last year as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt led a major transformation, shedding finance units and completing GE’s largest-ever industrial acquisition to reorient the business around energy, aviation and oil. While the company has continued to evolve, with an increasing focus on software, GE hasn’t been able to sustain the enthusiasm through 2016. Tougher Task When it reports third-quarter earnings this week, the Boston-based company will look to regain momentum and show investors that it can overcome a weak first half and persistently sluggish economy to deliver on growth expectations. That task became tougher after Honeywell International Inc. and Dover Corp. spooked industrial investors this month by trimming 2016 earnings forecasts. “They both cited some general industrial slowing, so that has made everyone nervous about the industrials,” said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who rates GE outperform. “If you feel like the macro is getting tougher, then that’s going to be a tough environment for investors.” Trian -- which was co-founded by Peltz, 74, along with Peter May and Ed Garden -- last year revealed it held a roughly 1 percent stake in GE. The activist firm, which had been quietly buying shares for several months as GE traded in the mid-$20s, has taken a friendly and largely hands-off approach to the investment. The move, seen as an endorsement of GE’s transformation strategy, generated a pop in the shares to almost $30 within two weeks. At the time, Trian said the stock, including dividends, could reach $45 a share by the end of 2017. GE rose 0.7 percent to $29.19 at 12:43 p.m. in New York, up less than 1 percent from a year ago. The shares climbed as high as $32.93 a share in 2016, but they’ve slid since July, when the company reported an orders decline that jeopardized its ability to hit aggressive growth targets. ‘Best’ Assets Peltz on Wednesday defended the investment, saying in a CNBC interview that GE has the “best set of industrial assets on the planet” and that he’s not concerned about the prospect of a bad quarter. Trian planned to stay with GE for “a long time,” he said. The firm declined to comment for this article. GE has maintained its forecast of 2 percent to 4 percent organic growth for the year even as that metric fell 1 percent through the first six months and has remained weak across other industrial companies. Hitting the goal would require second-half growth of 5 percent, a target that “may be optimistic,” Karen Ubelhart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note. GE executives have said 2016 will be heavily weighted to late in the year, with gas-turbine shipments boosting earnings in the fourth quarter. GE declined to comment further. Analysts have cut expectations for third-quarter adjusted earnings by about 2 cents in the past four weeks to 30 cents a share, according to an average of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The persistent lowering of expectations will make better-than-forecast earnings less meaningful, particularly if orders and free cash flow remain weak, said Tusa of JPMorgan. “It is a back end-loaded year, but it is a back end-loaded year that has undoubtedly, on an operating basis, been worse than expected,” said Tusa, whose price target is $28. As a result, investors are also questioning whether GE can achieve its earnings-per-share target of $2 in 2018, he said. Software Business Dray of RBC called the $2 forecast achievable if GE can make progress in the coming quarters on several fronts, including integrating assets acquired last year from Alstom SA and keeping the oil-and-gas division from falling more sharply than expected. GE’s prospects could depend less on near-term results and more on the ability to differentiate itself through its software business, according to Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co. Lack of growth in the industrial sector has made such efforts critical, he said, and GE is making progress with its Predix operating system and efforts to expand the GE Digital division. “This need to digitize to create customer and shareholder value is no longer optional and will require structural changes in the way industrial manufacturers create value,” Heymann, who rates GE outperform with a target of $38 a share, said in an Oct. 14 note. “GE is the vanguard of digitally enabled diversified industrials.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Joshua Lott/File PhotoMore By Richa Naidu and Dan Freed (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp , the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell. Like rivals JPMorgan and Citigroup , Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain's surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share. Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Net profit in Bank of America's trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi. Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co's by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's by 3.7 percent. Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index <.BKX>. DUAL ROLES After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders. "Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry," said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt "comfortable" with the bank's current governance. Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

Nigerian banks are safe and stable, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Director, Banking Supervision, Mrs. Tokunbo Martins, stated at the 329th meeting of the Bankers’ Committee held last week in Lagos. The apex bank’s assurance came despite unfavourable performances of top global lenders. Earnings by three of the world’s biggest banks- Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo – declined during the third quarter, ended September. Mrs. Martins assured customers that Nigeria’s financial sector is safe and sound, although she admitted that the nation’s banks are facing economic challenges. She said the lenders have strong capital buffers to weather the crisis. She dismissed reports published by Arqaam Capital, a foreign Investment and Research firm based in UAE insisting that some Nigerian banks are in crisis.  “Yes there was discussion around the stability of the banking sector. But even without the discussion, as Director Banking Supervision of the Central Bank of Nigeria, I can tell you that the report is false,” Mrs Martins said, adding, “ the banks are adequately capitalized, so the report is not true. That does not mean that the banking sector is not feeling the economic headwinds. The headwinds are also in every other jurisdictions. It is not strange. So, non-performing loans at 11.7 per cent is not what we should focus on”. She assured that Nigerian banks have the capacity to absorb whatever losses that  may arise from the level of non-performing loans in the industry. “But the fact is, do the banks have the capacity to absorb any further loses that would arise? The answer is that they do. They have very strong capital buffers. Another thing that is important is, do the banks have the capacity to generate huge income to absorb those loses? “Yes they do,”she said. “The underlying assets of the banks are still there and they are good. So, I think you should totally dispel or ignore that type of story. It should be expected to have Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). It is not the reason why any jurisdiction should be demonised. There are other jurisdictions that have NPLs as high as 15 per cent, 35 per cent and so on,” she argued.   Global banks’ earnings decline Citigroup’s net income fell 9.5 per cent to $3.8 billion, from $4.2 billion the same quarter a year ago. Revenues were also down 3.8 per cent to $17.8 billion during the July-September period, from $18.5 billion the same period last year. After the release of the results, shares of Citigroup fell 2.4 percent to $48.39 after opening Friday at $48.60 on the US stock market. At JP Morgan Chase, net income fell 7.3 per cent to $6.3 billion. That’s was down from $6.8 billion. Revenues, however, rose 8.5 percent to $25.5 billion after posting $23.5 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Shares of the bank fell 2.2 percent to $67.30 after they began the day at $68.80. Stirred with illegal banking activities, Wells Fargo’s earnings were highly anticipated. The bank said Friday its net income fell 3.4 percent to $5.6 billion in third quarter of 2016, from $5.8 billion during the same period a year ago. Revenues were up 1.8 percent to $22.3 billion from $21.9 billion. After opening at $45.17, shares of Wells Fargo fell 1.8 percent to $44.33. “I am deeply committed to restoring the trust of all of our stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders, and community partners,” new President and CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. “We know that it will take time and a lot of hard work to earn back our reputation.” The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a $185 million fine for the illegal banking practices at Wells Fargo that dated to 2011, after employees opened millions of accounts and applied for half a million credit card accounts that were not authorised by consumers, in order to boost sales figures and meet sales targets. Wells Fargo fired 5,300 of its employees involved in the scandal. Then-CEO John Stumpf agreed last month to forfeit his equity awards valued at $41 million and retired Wednesday from the company. Wells Fargo & Co’s profit dropped for the fourth straight quarter as it set aside funds for potential legal costs from a bogus account scandal that cost former Chief Executive and Chairman John Stumpf his job. The bank still posted net income that topped analyst estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. Revenue rose two per cent to $22.33 bilion in the third quarter ended September 30, while non-interest income fell 0.4 per cent to $10.37bn. Net income applicable to shareholders fell 3.7 per cent to $5.24bn, or $1.03 per share, from $5.44bn, or $1.05 per share, a year earlier.   Stakeholders speak Former Executive Director, Keystone Bank, Richard Obire, said the decline in earnings of some leading global banks should not affect Nigerian banks because many of those lenders had already cut their dollar credit commitments to Nigeria due to the ongoing forex crisis. He said: “I do not see a strong link between these banks and the local banks and with the rise in crude oil prices, and continuous backing of the CBN, Nigerian banks will rise above the storm,” he said. He said that local banks have to shore up their capital positions to continue to surmount whatever economic-induced challenges that confront the banks. Oils sector analysts, Michael Stephens, said that Brent crude, the international oil price benchmark, initially dropped by 1.3 per cent to a little above $51 a barrel, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dipped back below $50. The oil price recovery from below $43 per barrel a month ago, he said, represents positive dimensions to oil dependent economies including Nigeria. But other analysts expect oil to remain in a relatively narrow, if volatile, range until the next OPEC meeting in November and are buying and selling on any significant price movements higher or lower. Oil’s major producers and traders are betting that market optimism over a supply deal being agreed next month will prove to be misplaced. Investors have pushed the oil price above $50 in the past two weeks, but Reuters says “the people who produce, refine, ship or trade the real stuff on a daily basis” are putting their money on the rally continuing.   Health of the banks The CBN has also reiterated that no bank in the country is in distress, just as it reassured bank customers that their deposits are safe. The acting Director, Corporate Communications, CBN, Mr. Isaac Okorafor, said the attention of the central bank was drawn to the malicious rumours and unfounded speculations that some banks might have gone or be going into distress. He condemned the report as been totally false, saying, “in the strongest terms that these rumours and speculations are untrue and do not reflect the actual health of the individual banks and, indeed, the entire banking industry.” It, however, pointed out that no bank in the industry is in distress. “Therefore, the CBN would like to request the public to ignore speculations or rumours to the contrary as they could only be the handiwork of mischief makers who do not mean well for the Nigerian banking system and its economy. As the regulator of the industry, the CBN hereby reassures the banking and general public that their deposits remain safe in any Nigerian bank. There is therefore no need for panic withdrawals from any bank. “Going by both the CBN’s Examination Reports as well as analysis from market watchers, International Credit Rating Agencies, and Development Finance Institutions, the Nigerian banking industry remains strong in spite of the global economic challenges emanating from the collapse of global commodity prices. We therefore urge the banking public to remain calm and go about their normal businesses without panic. It is important that we do not create problems when none exists,” it added. Therefore, there is need for the central bank to take urgent step to arrest harmful marketing strategy because of its likely negative consequence on the industry. “The CBN wishes to state, and emphatically so, that it has not liquidated Skye Bank or any other deposit money bank for that matter. The bank also wishes to reiterate its earlier assurance that Skye Bank is not in distress and remains a healthy bank in the Nigerian banking system. Indeed, the health of the Nigerian banking system remains strong, all banks in Nigeria are safe and depositors have no cause to fear over their deposits,” further statement from the apex bank said.   Banks boost non-oil export CBN Director, Research and Development, Dr. Uwatt Uwatt said banks remain engine block of the economy and is doing everything possible to boost economic recovery. Speaking at the seminar for finance correspondents in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, he said there is need to reduce the cost of loan-able funds to non-oil exporters as such would raise production volumes and boost the country’s foreign exchange earnings. He explained that to check this trend, the apex bank canvassed for improved cheaper credits to everyone on the agric-value chain and also introduced the NIRAL scheme to de-risk agric lending. He also said the N200 billion Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme and N220 billion Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) were also instituted to enable small businesses access cheap funds. Uwatt who spoke on the theme: ‘Overview of non-oil sector in Nigeria’, said the drop in prices of crude oil in international markets has rekindled the need to revamp the non-oil sector. “Declines in global crude oil prices have triggered major headwinds for the economy. Continued dependence on oil poses a big threat to economic stability. The nation is now trying to retrace its steps from over dependence on oil for major part of its revenues,” he said.

 Chase is more than doubling its commitment to small businesses Andrew Meola Oct. 18, 2016, 4:34 PM 865 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Samsung Rewards could spur Samsung Pay adoption Vantiv has made a key acquisition The American Express lawsuit could be headed back to court JPMorgan Chase is more than doubling its Small Business Forward program with a $75 million commitment over the next three years, the bank announced Monday. The money will support small businesses owned by women, minorities, and veterans. The $75 million includes a $1.9 million grant to the Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO), which links small business owners with alternative funding when they cannot qualify for standard loans. “Recent research from ICIC shows small businesses are more likely to hire from distressed neighborhoods where unemployment is high, reinforcing that small businesses are critical for employment,” said Janis Bowdler, Head of Small Business Initiatives, Global Philanthropy, JPMorgan Chase. “Increasing access to capital to underrepresented small businesses is vital to economic growth and the communities they serve. Small Business Forward will support a wide, diverse base of entrepreneurs so that economic growth is shared by all.”   On top of this, Chase has also extended its collaboration with nonprofit lender LiftFund with a $4.6 million grant for its new LiftUP Initiative, create more opportunities for diverse small businesses in Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. This grant will provide quicker and less expensive loans to small business owners through an online program, with the goal of shortening loan approval time from an average of five weeks to just four days. Small businesses represent 99% of US companies, 54% of total sales, and 55% of all jobs, according to the US Small Business Administration. These businesses need capital in order to grow, but small businesses are underfunded — only half of small businesses with $100,000 to $1 million of annual revenue received at least some of the financing they applied for from large banks in late 2015. This is partially because banks have retreated from this segment because issuing loans to small businesses using the traditional underwriting model is expensive. This leaves a massive amount of unfulfilled loans that we estimate reached $96.5 billion in Q4 2015. Alternative lending companies have stepped in to capitalize on the opportunity available in helping meet more small business' lending needs.Alternative small business lending platforms use machine learning and digital tools to extend credit to a wide array of small businesses quickly and efficiently, particularly to those that have been rejected by banks. Alternative small business lending companies provide digital platforms that connect small business borrowers to capital using nontraditional means. We estimate that alternative small business lenders originated $5 billion and had a 4.3% share of the small business lending market in the US in 2015. But alternative small business lending platforms will originate $52 billion and gain a 20.7% share of the total market by 2020, driven by the continued growth of new players, increased borrower awareness and interest, and most importantly, major partnerships with big banks. Evan Bakker, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on small business alternative lending that analyzes the market opportunity for alternative lenders, forecasts the market share and volume growth of alternative lending platforms, profiles key players, and addresses the main industry risks. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Alternative lending platforms are in a position to capitalize on this underfunding and also take share from banks. These companies use machine learning and digital tools to extend credit to a wide array of small businesses quickly and efficiently. We estimate that alternative lending companies' share of the small business lending market in the US will reach 20.7% by 2020. Alternative lenders are now partnering with banks and this will propel growth going forward. New lenders are finding opportunities to offer white-label services to major banks. We expect banking partnerships, like the one between JPMorgan and OnDeck, to add 7.7 percentage points to the alternative lending industry's market share by 2020. A flurry of new lenders have entered the market, but it's still early innings. A handful of small business lenders, from Funding Circle to Credibly, have entered the market and this is creating challenges as customer acquisition costs rise and alternative lending companies struggle to differentiate themselves. In full, the report: Forecasts the market share and volume growth of the small business alternative lending sector, and breaks down the main growth drivers.

The Micex Index of 50 stocks added 0.5 percent to 1,967.10 by 6:15 p.m. in Moscow, having lost 2.2 percent in the previous four sessions. Bonds also rose, pushing yields on five-year local-currency OFZs down three basis points to 8.77 percent after rising to the highest in two months Monday on concern tensions with the U.S. over Syria may lead to new sanctions. The ruble strengthened 0.3 percent to 62.9475 per dollar. While OPEC’s decision to limit output for the first time in eight years last month turned the ruble into the world’s best-performing currency after Mexico’s peso, the benefits have yet to filter through to stocks. The Micex has fallen while oil has climbed 12 percent since the agreement on Sept. 28. “A potentially higher oil-price range is the catalyst for upgrading Russia,” JPMorgan analyst Adrian Mowat said in an e-mailed note, raising Russian stocks to overweight from neutral. “Valuations in Russia are cheap." Political Concern Russian shares on the Micex index are trading at 6.2 times estimated 12-month earnings, the lowest level among emerging markets, and half the valuation for MSCI Inc.’s emerging-market gauge. JPMorgan said that the energy sector stocks are pricing in $45-per-barrel oil, not $50. Brent crude retreated 0.3 percent to $51.39 a barrel on Tuesday. The dollar-denominated RTS Index is up 30 percent this year, the fourth-biggest gains among equity indexes worldwide. Germany on Monday joined the U.S. and Britain in weighing fresh sanctions against the Syrian and Russian governments over the bombardment of Aleppo, a development that could “pose some risks to OFZs,” according to Morgan Stanley. “We still see OFZs as an attractive carry trade in the medium term," analysts including Gordian Kemen said in an e-mailed note.

As the group chief security officer for Barclays, he has a squad of elite ex-government agents patrolling the company’s digital perimeter. He also has a hefty budget to acquire state-of-the-art technology to protect Britain’s second-biggest bank from cyber attacks. But Oerting, with no small dose of grudging admiration, says his adversaries excel at something that can’t be addressed with deep pockets or killer software: They’re superb networkers. “The organized crime groups in cyber are sharing much better than we are at the moment,” says Oerting, a Dane with a square jaw and the watchful eyes of a cop who’s investigated the underworld for 35 years. “They are sharing methodologies, knowledge, tools, practices—what works and what doesn’t.” Illustrator: Matt Chase Illustration: Matt Chase Now he and his counterparts at other big banks are doing some networking of their own. Oerting, who led the European Cybercrime Centre in The Hague before joining Barclays in 2015, has assigned some of his people to join allies from four other big U.K. banks at an operations center in London’s Canary Wharf complex. They sit side by side with police officers from the U.K. National Cyber Crime Unit. The idea is that this industry-government “fusion cell,” the Cyber Defense Alliance, will let the sleuths swap tips, techniques, and hunches the same way the bad guys do. “To do this right, you need to have trust,” Oerting says. “If I give information to another bank about my breaches, I don’t want to see this on the front page of the newspaper the next day.” The effort, the first of its kind in the U.K., mirrors a similar initiative in the U.S. called the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, a nonprofit in Pittsburgh that brings together academics, corporate security executives, intelligence operatives, and law enforcement officials. Barclays has also installed an analyst at Interpol’s cyber investigations unit in Singapore. Joining forces marks a big change for institutions long reluctant to share information about their IT systems, let alone how they’re compromised. They’ve decided they better reboot that mindset fast if they want to counter the online onslaught assailing their walls. In the second quarter of this year, cybercriminals tried to inject more than 1 million malware programs into financial companies worldwide, a 50 percent jump from the same period in 2015, according to Kaspersky Lab, a global cybersecurity company. Troels Oerting Photographer: Simon Dawson JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have all been cyberjacked in some way in the past couple of years. So has Swift, the cross-border payments messaging network that constitutes the global economy’s circulatory system. No surprise, then, that banks are throwing a lot of treasure at the problem. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in September that he expected the bank’s $600 million annual outlay on IT security to soar to $1 billion in the next few years. Yet cyberthieves are getting wilier by the day. In so-called ­ man-in-the-middle attacks, they pretend to be trusted organizations to trick targets into sending them money or data. That happened in February when unidentified fraudsters sent fake Swift messages to the New York Fed, directing it to wire almost $1 billion from the accounts of Bangladesh’s central bank to accounts they controlled. The fraudsters got away with $81 million before the authorities caught on. As many as a dozen other lenders may have been similarly targeted. A rapidly escalating scheme is “ransomware,” where criminals use viruses to seize virtual control of a company’s computers and refuse to release them until they’re paid off, invariably in bitcoin. Then there are “whaling attacks.” By using sophisticated e-mails that pretend to be from a trusted friend or institution, frauds trick top corporate executives into divulging personal details. Thieves can then impersonate the execs and direct subordinates to transfer company funds to their own accounts. Even projects that bankers believe are top secret turn out to be far from it. A major U.S. lender recently learned that a supposedly unknown prototype for its new online portal had become a hot topic in a chat room used by criminals. Hackers were already testing malware on the site, says Alastair Paterson, the CEO and co-founder of Digital Shadows, the cyberdefense company that uncovered the scheme. Many of the instruments in such skulduggery are free or for sale on the web. Password-cracking programs with names such as Hashcat and Medusa have become staples of the digital toolkit. Thanks to bitcoin, it’s easy to buy more sophisticated penetration code and even ready-made hacks on the dark web, the subterranean layer of the internet untouched by conventional search engines. Cyber attacks are becoming even more spectacular. In September, Yahoo! disclosed that hackers had stolen the names, passwords, birth dates, and other personal data of more than 500 million users. Governments, organized crime gangs, and hacktivists have never been better equipped to damage a bank’s most valuable asset: its reputation. Financial companies are responding by dispatching their personnel to learn the dark arts of the digital world and share their knowledge with colleagues. On a recent morning, about a dozen men and women are tapping on computers in a training center near Cambridge, England, as part of an “ethical hacking” course taught by 7Safe, a British cybersecurity company. The pupils, a mix of corporate IT guys in jeans and polo shirts and hoodie-clad coders from a “white hat” collective called Hacker House, are working through a series of penetration tests on a fictional entity dubbed BeSureBank. One of the trainees, a young would-be cyberconsultant, is using a tool called Metasploit to expose BeSureBank’s IT specs in a process called enumeration. In minutes she’s scrolling through a catalog of the bank’s databases, ports, operating software, and, best of all, the usernames for all the accounts on the network. Next she starts cracking the passwords for those accounts by employing John the Ripper, an open source program that computes character combinations until it finds a match. Soon enough she’s logging in to the system with the administrator’s password. The consultant surveils another user’s keystrokes in real time and figures it could be a senior executive at BeSureBank accessing a sensitive database. “I’m sniffing the keystrokes,” she says to herself. “So that’s cool.” The lesson concludes when all the trainees launch a “payload,” or virus, into BeSureBank’s system and take it down in a simulated DDoS attack, or distributed denial of service. In the real world, this type of assault mobilizes networks of hijacked computers called botnets to overwhelm the target. Such operations are on the rise in finance. On the morning of Jan. 29, a payday for many employees, unidentified hackers launched a DDoS attack on HSBC’s U.K. site and took it offline for a few hours until the bank could repel the incursion. During a break in the class, a couple of corporate security directors grumble that their jobs aren’t getting any easier when so much data is flying out the door of their companies. It’s an important point. Every day employees at any number of companies take their work home with them on laptops, smartphones, and tablets. They log in to their banks’ networks from trains, conferences, airport lounges. So, too, do customers and myriad fintech startups that are increasingly augmenting banking services with innovative offerings of their own. In January 2018 a European Union law, Payment Services Directive 2, will require lenders to let outside companies access their customers’ accounts and connect their applications to the banks’ own systems. Banks, in other words, will start to look less like isolated fortresses and more like open-border platforms hosting numerous apps and services, like Google’s Android system. While digitization may be the future, it poses a major security migraine. “Every time there is a new app or a new channel opened, that provides criminal opportunities,” says Jamie Saunders, the director of the U.K. National Cyber Crime Unit. “Banks are taking enormous care to design security into their apps, but as the technology evolves, the criminal will evolve, too, and vulnerabilities will open up.” By then, Oerting plans to be drawing strength from his networking push and the next generation of cyberdefenses. He helps select and mentor promising startups in the accelerators that Barclays runs in Tel Aviv, London, and other cities. He’s championed Post-Quantum, a startup that recently went through the bank’s U.K. accelerator program. Post-Quantum’s military-grade encryption for instant messaging, which has been tested by NATO, is being eyed for deployment to top Barclays bankers. The company also protects digital documents by splitting the “master keys” needed to unlock files into pieces and distributing the code to different keepers. That way, “when a hacker comes in, there’s nothing to hack,” says Andersen Cheng, Post-Quantum’s CEO and the former chief operating officer of Carlyle Group’s European venture fund. For all the whiz-bang technology and talent at Oerting’s disposal, he’s still paranoid something terrible might happen now that we’ve entered the age of the spectacular attack; just look at how Russian hackers reportedly made off with e-mails from the Democratic National Committee during the U.S. presidential primaries. “My nightmare is to wake up one morning and realize we’ve lost data for millions of credit cards, or a huge amount of money, or in-boxes of e-mails for top executives,” Oerting says. “There is no such thing as absolute security.” At least by working together, the banks hope they’ll be in a better position to improve their odds.   —With assistance from Donal Griffin.   Robinson covers finance from London.     Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Construction is set to start in November and wrap up in mid-September 2017. (Photo: CH Architects) An effort to bring residential and business redevelopment into three Detroit neighborhoods is getting a boost from JPMorgan Chase, the mega-bank that has committed to investing $100 million in the city. Chase announced that Detroit won a competitive $5 million grant for the Detroit Strategic Neighborhood Fund, a $30-million project that will boost inclusive development in three areas of the city: The West Village neighborhood on the city's east side, the Clark Park area in southwest Detroit and the Livernois-McNichols area in northwest Detroit. Construction on the first of what will be at least 12 projects funded through the neighborhood fund is set to begin in November. Called The Coe at West Village, the $3.8 million project will build eight new townhouses along Coe Street and four apartments with first-floor retail along Van Dyke near where the two roads connect, with 20% of the residential property set aside as affordable housing. The development is by Woodborn Partners, whose managing partner, Clifford Brown, said construction is expected to be finished by mid-September 2017. ► Related: State to babysit Detroit demolition program The Strategic Neighborhood Fund is a collaboration between the city and the nonprofit community development organizations Invest Detroit, the Detroit Development Fund and Opportunity Resource Fund. "We are making progress on something Detroiters have waited for for a long time, and that is redevelopment in our neighborhoods," Mayor Mike Duggan said at a news conference announcing the grant. Duggan said the Strategic Neighborhood Fund fits in with the city's strategy to rebuild the city's neighborhoods on the 20-minute neighborhood model. The model calls for densely populated, walkable and safe neighborhoods where residents have easy access to shopping, groceries, restaurants, recreation, transit, parks and schools within a 20-minute walk. Duggan said the three selected neighborhoods already have some of the basic elements needed for such a neighborhood and only need  "an intense effort where everybody comes together" for redevelopment.

Construction is set to start in November and wrap up in mid-September 2017.  (Photo: CH Architects) Peter Scher, Chase's head of corporate responsibility, said thriving neighborhoods are critical to Detroit's comeback, and while redevelopment in downtown and Midtown should be celebrated, too often that means pushing out people on the lower end of the economic scale "Too many people are being left behind," Scher said. Detroit's award was one of several granted to efforts in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Miami and New York. They money is part of the bank's 5-year, $125-million neighborhood development initiative. David Blaszkiewicz, president and CEO of Invest Detroit, said the Strategic Neighborhood Initiative will bring residential and business development projects in the three targeted neighborhoods with input from residents and others in the communities. He said about 60% of the projects will be new construction, but there also will be an emphasis on adaptive reuse of existing properties. "What we're trying to do is match the needs of the neighborhoods with the real estate," Blaszkiewicz said. The size and scale of the projects will vary, but "most of them are going to be mixed use projects, meaning we've got both housing and commercial, and in most of them, they'll house first-floor retail as part of the developments."

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is continuing its push to snag wealthier credit-card users and gain market share by introducing a top-tier small-business card with richer rewards than products from rivals. Called Chase Ink Business Preferred, the card offers users an 80,000-point signing bonus when it rolls out later this year, according to Pam Codispoti, president of branded cards for the New York-based bank. Business owners earn 3 points a dollar for the first $150,000 spent on travel, telecommunications, shipping and advertising on social-media and search engines. Purchases after that limit or in other categories earn 1 point per dollar. “The credit-card space is incredibly competitive, and we want to be aggressive in investing in the best products,” Codispoti said in a telephone interview. “Customers tell us the way they’re marketing their products and services is changing—they’re spending more on things like Facebook paid search. To have the opportunity to earn triple points on that is important to them.” Banks have turned to fee-rich credit cards as stubbornly low interest rates crimp profits elsewhere. The frenzied competition has forced them to boost spending on incentives, debut rewards-heavy products and bolster existing offerings. In August, JPMorgan made waves when its new Sapphire Reserve card became available with a 100,000-point signing bonus. The escalating card wars have become costly—American Express Co. lost its largest co-brand relationship with Costco Wholesale Corp. to Citigroup Inc. after it couldn’t come to an agreement with the retailer on fees. American Express, which is scheduled to report third-quarter results after markets close Wednesday, calls itself the top credit-card issuer for U.S. small businesses, according to a presentation in March. The New York-based company doesn’t disclose total purchase volume for the category. Small businesses spend about $61.6 billion a year on JPMorgan’s cards, $28.4 billion on Bank of America Corp.’s and $28.2 billion on Capital One Financial Corp.’s, according to a June 2015 edition of the Nilson Report.  The Chase Ink Business Preferred card’s signing bonus kicks in after users spend $5,000 within the first three months, said Codispoti, who spent almost 12 years at American Express before joining JPMorgan in 2014. The $95 annual fee is waived for the first year if the account is opened at a branch. Users can pool rewards points with JPMorgan’s other cards, she said. Potential rewards The new card’s $150,000 limit for triple points means higher potential rewards than JPMorgan’s existing small business cards, Ink Plus and Ink Cash, as well as competitor offerings including the AmEx Business Gold Rewards charge card. That comes with a 25,000 point signing bonus and triple points in one of five categories on the first $100,000 in purchases. American Express has slumped 14% this year, the second-worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, after competitors bid away some of its biggest partnerships with retailers, airlines and other companies. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chenault, who’s been shaking up management and reshaping divisions, vowed to trim $1 billion in expenses by the end of 2017. Felicia Mowll, an AmEx spokeswoman, declined to comment on the competitive landscape for small-business credit cards beyond the company’s Oct. 5 statement announcing expanded rewards for its business Platinum card, with a $450 annual fee. Cardholders now earn 1.5 points per dollar on business purchases of at least $5,000 and get 50% of their points back on first- and business-class airline tickets booked through American Express Travel Services. During a conference call last week, an analyst asked JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake how much more share the bank wanted to grab. It already has about one-fifth of credit-card volume, according to Betsy Graseck, a Morgan Stanley analyst. “It’s a very competitive business and it’s very profitable,” Lake responded. “All other things being equal, we would like to continue to gain share.” American Express Co.Costco Wholesale Corp.JPMorgan Chase & Co.Small BusinessTechnologyNew York Get Crain's Small Business Alert Sign up for our FREE weekly Small Business Alert email newsletter.

In South Florida, a $250,000 two-year grant to Accion will help increase the lending organization’s capacity to serve more micro- and small-business owners, launch its Community Advantage loan program, and expand operations to include Broward County. Accion provides loans up to $50,000 and offers free financial education to small businesses. JPMorgan Chase also will be supporting Grameen America with a two-year $500,000 as it expands to Miami-Dade County. Grameen’s pioneering microlending program will provide small loans to Hispanic women to help them build businesses, achieve higher family incomes and develop entrepreneurial skills. Small businesses are growing fastest among people of color, particularly Latinas and African American women, yet Brookings Institution research shows minority-owned businesses rely significantly more on investments of personal or family wealth than on outside debt or equity. Moreover, only 16 percent of conventional small-business loans go to women entrepreneurs, a U.S. Senate report found, and despite the higher startup rate for African-American owned businesses, these businesses received less than two percent of SBA loans in 2013. Launched in 2014, Small Business Forward is a global initiative to support small businesses with the potential to grow, offer quality employment, and generate financial security and economic opportunity for vulnerable populations and their communities by connecting capital with highly targeted technical assistance and support networks to help small businesses grow sustainably.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 19, 2016 at 10:21AM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Look around the economy right now and there are very few reasons to explain why banks performed so well last quarter, in many cases comfortably exceeding analysts' estimates. When it comes to the nation's biggest banks, in fact, one could argue that there's only one. As the deluge of bank earnings has come in over the past week, the one area in which JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) all performed well in was trading -- that is, their Wall Street operations. Banks and trading operations Since the Dodd-Frank Act was passed six years ago, banks have been forced to scale back their high-risk/high-reward proprietary trading desks pursuant to the so-called Volcker Rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. This rule largely limits a bank's ability to trade to facilitating the sale and purchase of securities for institutional customers such as hedge funds, university endowments, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, among others. This is known as market making. Instead of simply identifying an opportunity to make money by, say, buying a particular type of bond on the open market, banks can only do so if a client wants to offload those securities. This allows banks to facilitate transactions for clients, but ostensibly reduces the size of trading operations and thereby limits the risk of loss at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup -- the nation's biggest universal banks. This is particularly important in a financial system like ours in the United States, where taxpayers shoulder the ultimate risk of loss from imprudent trading operations. We do so by way of the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, which would cover any trading losses that eat into a bank's insured deposits. Trading bonanza But even though the trading operations at these banks have been scaled back, they still contribute to these banks' bottom lines. Indeed, if there was one single reason that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup all outperformed expectations last quarter, this was it: JPMorgan Chase saw trading revenues climb 33% compared to the year-ago period. Citigroup reported a 16% year-over-year increase. And Bank of America's trading revenue was up 14%. This should matter to investors because trading revenue is notoriously volatile. Some quarters, it's way up, as it was last quarter. But other quarters, it's way down, as it was in the third quarter of last year, when trading revenues fell by double digits. To this end, the dismal trading results from the year-ago quarter also help explain why they were so much higher in the latest quarter on a year-over-year basis. The point here is that the sustainability of these banks' upbeat performances last quarter is far from certain. If interest rates don't begin rising in earnest or regulatory and compliance costs don't miraculously decline, then it will continue to be difficult for these banks to reach their profitability targets in the quarters ahead.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is to announce Wednesday morning that it has made a grant of $5 million toward a $30 million Strategic Neighborhood Fund to drive inclusive economic growth in Detroit's neighborhoods. The fund will support the Detroit Strategic Neighborhood Initiative, a collaborative partnership between Invest Detroit, the Detroit Development Fund and the Opportunity Resource Fund. The new fund will dedicate resources toward commercial and residential real estate, jobs and community infrastructure in three Detroit neighborhoods — West Village, Southwest Detroit and Livernois-McNichols — over the next decade. City officials, business leaders and community organizations were among those present for the official announcement Wednesday morning at Van Dyke Street and Coe Avenue in West Village, where Clifford Brown is developing a mixed-use building with 11-13 residential units and another 1,100 square feet of retail. "This announcement from J. P. Morgan Chase is another example of its deep commitment to Detroit and revitalizing its neighborhoods," Mayor Mike Duggan said in a news release. "Thanks to this funding, we are going to start seeing new small businesses open, existing businesses expand and new residential developments take place in several key areas of the city. This fits in perfectly with our strategy to revitalize our neighborhoods." This newest grant is part of Chase's $125 million, five-year neighborhoods initiative in cities around the country. It will help finance 12 key multi-unit residential, business and mixed-use developments, four in each neighborhood, to create density and tie in with bus and and other essential services. The Strategic Neighborhood fund recently received $4 million from a grant from Reimagining the Civic Commons, a national initiative to revitalize and connect public spaces in urban areas. "J.P. Morgan Chase's $5 million award provides a variety of financing resources to elevate core strengths in three distinct neighborhoods, while creating a development template to apply in additional neighborhoods," said Dave Blaszkiewicz, president and CEO of Invest Detroit. Atlanta, Chicago, Miami and New York also got $5 million grants, the first from the five-year neighborhoods initiative.

For the IMF, it is about “too slow growth for too long” that only “benefits too few”. But for the World Bank, the lingering price volatility of commodities, chiefly among them is the oil price, has not only supported in causing growth challenges for emerging market economies, but created a spill effect. The example was Nigeria. The spill effect was cited as the Sub-Saharan Africa, which depend on the country to progress economically too. The distortion from commodity price crisis has caused global banking industry huge losses in terms of impairment charges and write offs, yet with sizeable debt portfolio. Nigerian banking industry is not an exception. Of course, more than half of the country’s banking industry risk portfolio are from oil and gas related issues, with the rest being a spillover effect of the same sector’s challenge. But facts are fast emerging that Nigerian banking industry are not in the “woods” alone. Just last week, earnings of three of the world’s biggest banks- Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, recorded decline during the third quarter of 2016, as their respective financial statements have shown. Citigroup’s net income fell 9.5 percent to $3.8 billion, from $4.2 billion the same quarter a year ago. Revenues were also down 3.8 percent to $17.8 billion during the July-September period, from $18.5 billion the same period last year. After the release of the results, shares of Citigroup fell 2.4 percent to $48.39 after opening Friday at $48.60 on the U.S. stock market. At JP Morgan Chase, net income fell 7.3 percent to $6.3 billion. That’s was down from $6.8 billion. Despite the challenges, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has maintained that banks in the country are holding fast their respective capital adequacy ratio, allying the fears of failures. Even on the sidelines of the meetings in Washington, CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, assured that it is still an ongoing work with respect to supervision of the banking industry and maintaining the important, reiterating that no bank in Nigeria is in distress. Just like bank in emerging economies, these three global giants manifested a threat of challenges with earnings capacity. JP Morgan Chase, although recorded 8.5 percent to $25.5 billion after posting $23.5 billion in the third quarter of 2015, it was not as usual. Troubled with illegal banking activities, Wells Fargo’s earnings were highly anticipated. Its net income fell 3.4 percent to $5.6 billion in third quarter of 2016, from $5.8 billion during the same period a year ago. But in response to the report of the Dubai-based Arqaam Capital, CBN described it as false and overstatement of issues by the company. It also ruled out the report and reiterated that Deposit Money Banks in the country are sound and have strong capital buffers, despite obvious challenges associated with oil and commodity dependent economies across the globe. The Director of Banking Supervision, Mrs. Token Martins, at the Bankers Committee meeting, he said: “That seven banks are undercapitalised is absolutely not true. “But that is not to say that the banking sector is not feeling the economic headwinds. They are, just like those in every other jurisdiction. It is not strange. Non-performing loans (NPLs) at 11 per cent is not what we need to focus on. “What we need to focus on is if the banks have the capacity to absorb losses that would arise from those NPLs? And the answer is yes. They have very strong capital buffers. “Another thing that is important is that Nigerian banks have very huge capacity to generate income to also absorb those losses, if they do arise. And then the loans that are non-performing now, can they re-perform? Yes, because the underlying assets are still there and they are good,” she said. According to her, the fact that the country has NPLs at a period like this should be expected and is not a thing that any jurisdiction should be demonised about or ridiculed by any report. “There are countries that have NPLs as high as as 15 per cent, some 30 per cent and some countries in Europe have NPLs as high as 80 per cent,” she noted.

From the perspective of their benchmark interest rates, they are looking increasingly similar. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 18, 2016 at 6:11PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The United States has now experienced eight consecutive years where its primary short-term interest rate benchmark has been, for all intents and purposes, 0%. In this way, the American economy is starting to look more and more like that of Japan, which has seen short-term rates near the "zero-bound" for more than two decades. For investors in banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), this has significant implications, as all of those institutions will make much more money if and when rates eventually rise. Japan 2 Year Government Bond Interest Rate data by YCharts. Japan vs. United States To be clear, there's no question that the U.S. economy has stronger fundamentals than Japan's, which should give investors hope that rates here won't stay as low for as long. Most importantly, we have population growth, while Japan doesn't. Over the past five years, Japan's population has shrunk by 1 million, according to The Washington Post. That equates to somewhere around a negative 0.2% annual growth rate. By contrast, while there aren't enough babies born in the United States each year to offset deaths, the population is still growing thanks to positive net immigration. The latest data shows that the U.S. population is expanding at somewhere around 0.8% a year. On top of this, we've learned over the past decade that the United States is sitting on some of the greatest oil and natural gas reserves in the world. This is an enormous advantage, given that economic growth is literally and figuratively fueled by energy. Japan, by contrast, is the second-largest net importer of fossil fuels in the world, behind only China. This was one of the principal reasons, in fact, that Japan tried to expand its territorial empire so aggressively in the lead-up to World War II. Normalized interest rates But even though our economy is predicated on stronger fundamentals than Japan's, that doesn't mean that interest rates are bound to rise anytime soon. Sure, the Federal Reserve increased the fed funds rate by a token 0.25% last December, but it's since been reluctant to go further. Analysts and commentators in the financial community talk about this in the context of "normalized" interest rates. The underlying assumption is that rates will at some point return to historically "normal" levels given inflation expectations over a long period of time. But the problem with this assumption is that there's simply no such thing as a historically normal interest rate. One could even go so far as to argue that the most normal rates we've experienced since the mid-1950s are the ultra-low rates right now. As you can see in the chart below, this has been the only period in which the Fed Funds rate has held steady for a long stretch of time. Effective Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts. Anyone who invests in bank stocks needs to take note of this. The primary bull thesis right now underlying shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others, is that they will make gobs more money once rates rise. And that's true: Bank of America says it'll earn around $7.5 billion more in pre-tax net interest income if rates increase by only 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point. JPMorgan Chase would earn $3 billion more under the same scenario. And while Wells Fargo doesn't disclose a precise dollar figure, it too would see its earnings go up by something like 2% if rates headed higher. The point here is that interest rates are the single most important catalyst for bank stocks, but we have no idea if or when they'll rise. You should accordingly approach the sector with humility.

Surprise: Banks have thrived in the post-Brexit world CNBC 10/18/2016 Evelyn Cheng Major banks have topped expectations so far this earnings season, helped primarily — and a bit ironically — by post-Brexit market volatility that spurred a surge in bond trading.  Quotes in the article SPDR® S&P Bank ETF KBE ▲ 40.32 +0.15 +0.37% Deutsche Bank AG DBK ▼ 14.98 -0.06 -0.37% Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS ▲ 211.15 +1.52 +0.73% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 77.63 -0.39 -0.50% The surprise U.K. vote in June to leave the European Union was supposed to destabilize the financial system, but has had limited effect so far. It was more of an event for early summer, and the only evidence of the surprise vote right now is the drop in pound sterling, said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie. Benchmark global sovereign bond yields touched all-time lows in July and August after Brexit. Signals that central bank policy might be changing also contributed to the move in rates, and benchmark yields began recovering in the last several weeks. That's all to the benefit of fixed income and currency trading desks. "Anything that influences people to trade, buying or selling, that's better for broker-dealers," said Brandon Swensen, co-head of the fixed income desk at RBC Global Asset Management. "Volumes translate to revenues." As a result, a surge in fixed income trading revenue has been a consistent theme for the earnings and revenues beats from four major banks that have reported so far. "There's been a certain amount of volatility in interest rates (given) concern about the Fed in raising rates, reluctance of other central banks to continue with" quantitative easing, Macquarie's Wizman said. "Generally customers have sought to protect themselves from a back up in rates." Goldman Sachs (GS) said Tuesday that net revenues in fixed income, currency and commodities client execution rose 49 percent in the third quarter of this year from the same period in 2015, based on accounting including the debt valuation adjustment. That gain topped a 16 percent rise expected by KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl, and followed JPMorgan (JPM)'s 48 percent rise in fixed income markets revenue and a 35 percent jump for Citigroup (C), based on their earnings reports released last Friday. "Rates performance was particularly strong, with good client activity, as markets remained active throughout the quarter, post the Brexit vote and in anticipation of central bank actions as well as money market reform," JPMorgan said in its earnings press release. JPMorgan holds the largest global market share of fixed income and currency trading by revenue, according to analysis of rankings from 2013 to the first half of this year from Deutsche Bank Securities. Citigroup is second, followed by Deutsche Bank (DBK-DE), the data showed, while Goldman Sachs fell to sixth place in the first half of this year from fifth place last year. Bank of America (BAC) also said fixed income trading revenue jumped 32 percent year-over-year. Morgan Stanley is the only major bank left and is expected to report earnings Wednesday. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the firm to report earnings per share of 63 cents on revenue of $8.17 billion. Elevated activity in fixed income trading is expected to continue, especially on growing expectations of a Fed rate hike later this year and market talk of the European Central Bank winding down its asset purchase program known as quantitative easing. That potentially supports further gains in the fixed income trading business for the major banks. "We think whether it be in the U.S. elections or what's happening with central banks in Asia or Europe, there remain more volatility ahead," Swensen said. Analysts also pointed to benefits for fixed income desks from the resurgence in corporate debt issuance in the middle part of this year, after the risk-off sentiment last August and at the start of the year. That said, the third quarter rise in fixed income trading revenue "wasn't so much about tailwinds as it was not having so many headwinds for the quarter, and of course it translated nicely for us," Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said Tuesday on the bank's conference call. The bank stocks haven't responded significantly. Goldman Sachs shares were up 1.8 percent on the day as of early afternoon Tuesday trade, while the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) (KBE) was 1.4 percent lower over the last five trading days. "The market hasn't given banks credit for trading-related beats this quarter," KBW's Kleinhanzl said in a Tuesday note.

However, the Tuscan bank did not shut the door completely on a rival capital-strengthening blueprint submitted last week by veteran banker and former industry minister Corrado Passera. Monte dei Paschi, which emerged as the weakest lender in the latest round of Europe's stress tests this summer, needs to raise cash and get some 28 billion euros of bad loans off its balance sheet quickly to avert the risk of being wound down. The bank spurned Passera's first, 11th-hour approach in late July, opting instead for a salvage plan arranged by JP Morgan which had won preliminary approval from the European Central Bank. Since then however, the JPMorgan-led plan has stalled because of scant investor interest, and Passera has come back with a revised scheme which, according to sources close to the proposed deal, has the backing in principle of private equity funds including Warburg Pincus. Tuesday's board meeting, which was called to examine Passera's plan after he presented his new proposal to the bank on Oct. 13, lasted eight hours - an indication he may have been taken more seriously than in July. Passera was also asked by market regulator Consob to explain his plan on Tuesday. Passera's proposal involves a 2.5 billion euro capital increase reserved for private equity funds including Warburg Pincus and a 1 billion euro share sale to existing Monte dei Paschi investors. "It could be a wonderful plan if it goes like it should," Passera said on his way in to the Consob meeting. Monte dei Paschi shares were nearly 13 percent higher at the close of trading on expectations Passera's scheme would get some traction. In a statement after its board meeting, the bank confirmed its "firm" intention to press ahead with the JPMorgan deal and present a business and capital-boosting plan to the market on Oct. 24. However, it said that after that date, the board would proceed with an in-depth study of Passera's plan, already started by advisers. JPMorgan is now looking at a revised proposal which would involve Monte dei Paschi raising up to 2 billion euros via a debt-for-equity swap to be launched in November, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank would then launch a capital increase of up to 3 billion euros as early as Dec. 5, the day after a referendum on constitutional reform that could topple Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government. However, sources say JPMorgan appears to have so far failed to find an anchor investor that would commit money to the capital increase. Detractors of Passera's plan in turn say his preliminary proposal is non-binding, does not name any of the private equity funds he claims are willing to invest, and is subject to due diligence. Some sources expect the two sides to eventually strike a compromise, but others say that is unlikely to happen given time constraints and personal rivalries.

However, the Tuscan bank did not shut the door completely on a rival capital-strengthening blueprint submitted last week by veteran banker and former industry minister Corrado Passera. Monte dei Paschi, which emerged as the weakest lender in the latest round of Europe's stress tests this summer, needs to raise cash and get some 28 billion euros of bad loans off its balance sheet quickly to avert the risk of being wound down. The bank spurned Passera's first, 11th-hour approach in late July, opting instead for a salvage plan arranged by JP Morgan which had won preliminary approval from the European Central Bank. Since then however, the JPMorgan-led plan has stalled because of scant investor interest, and Passera has come back with a revised scheme which, according to sources close to the proposed deal, has the backing in principle of private equity funds including Warburg Pincus. Tuesday's board meeting, which was called to examine Passera's plan after he presented his new proposal to the bank on Oct. 13, lasted eight hours - an indication he may have been taken more seriously than in July. Passera was also asked by market regulator Consob to explain his plan on Tuesday. Passera's proposal involves a 2.5 billion euro capital increase reserved for private equity funds including Warburg Pincus and a 1 billion euro share sale to existing Monte dei Paschi investors. "It could be a wonderful plan if it goes like it should," Passera said on his way in to the Consob meeting. Monte dei Paschi shares were nearly 13 percent higher at the close of trading on expectations Passera's scheme would get some traction. In a statement after its board meeting, the bank confirmed its "firm" intention to press ahead with the JPMorgan deal and present a business and capital-boosting plan to the market on Oct. 24. However, it said that after that date, the board would proceed with an in-depth study of Passera's plan, already started by advisers. JPMorgan is now looking at a revised proposal which would involve Monte dei Paschi raising up to 2 billion euros via a debt-for-equity swap to be launched in November, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank would then launch a capital increase of up to 3 billion euros as early as Dec. 5, the day after a referendum on constitutional reform that could topple Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government. However, sources say JPMorgan appears to have so far failed to find an anchor investor that would commit money to the capital increase. Detractors of Passera's plan in turn say his preliminary proposal is non-binding, does not name any of the private equity funds he claims are willing to invest, and is subject to due diligence. Some sources expect the two sides to eventually strike a compromise, but others say that is unlikely to happen given time constraints and personal rivalries.

The blockchain-powered post-trade prototype was built by Axoni. The other participating institutions are Credit Suisse, Citigroup Inc, financial data and technology provides Thomson Reuters Corp and IHS Markit, as well as business consulting firm Capco. Thomson Reuters is the parent company of Reuters News. Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data-sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained worldwide popularity because of its usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets across practically all industries. Smart contracts, on the other hand, are self-executing transaction agreements. Greg Schvey, Axoni chief executive, said the blockchain-enabled post-trade processing system could translate into substantial cost savings for the financial companies involved in the transaction. "The parties run a node that connects them with others on the network," he told Reuters in an interview Schvey said the current processing of equity swaps could be cumbersome and time-consuming, with each individual dealer having its own internal systems and a single trade going through several such systems. Given the complex nature of equity swaps, trades often break down because of the myriad layers of processing a transaction goes through before being completed, he added. "What happens now is that with this technology, the parties to the transaction, by virtue of the way blockchains work, are both co-processing and simultaneously running the same code, updating the state of that contracts over time, such that it removes the room for misalignment." The pilot project started in June. In early September, the participants conducted a diverse set of 133 structured test cases to assess the capabilities of blockchain technology for use with equity derivatives, Axoni said. "The proof of concept has shown that blockchain technology lends itself well to solving for the operational complexity and volumes of equity swaps lifecycle processing," said Roman Eisenberg, global head, prime services technology, at Credit Suisse. "This can possibly present an opportunity to not only save costs but also reduce operational risks while growing the client offering," he added.

The surprise U.K. vote in June to leave the European Union was supposed to destabilize the financial system, but has had limited effect so far. It was more of an event for early summer, and the only evidence of the surprise vote right now is the drop in the pound, said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie. Benchmark global sovereign bond yields touched all-time lows in July and August after the Brexit vote. Signals that central bank policy might be changing also contributed to the move in rates, and benchmark yields began recovering in the last several weeks. That's all to the benefit of fixed income and currency trading desks. "Anything that influences people to trade, buying or selling, that's better for broker-dealers," said Brandon Swensen, co-head of the fixed income desk at RBC Global Asset Management. "Volumes translate to revenues." show chapters <p>Banks beat, but why no rally?</p> <p>CNBC&#039;s Bob Pisani takes a closer look at bank earnings trends, and why banks have been selling off despite good news. The &ldquo;Fast Money&rdquo; traders weigh in.</p> Banks beat, but why no rally?    Monday, 17 Oct 2016 | 5:42 PM ET | 02:57 As a result, a surge in fixed income trading revenue has been a consistent theme for the earnings and revenue beats from four major banks that have reported so far. "There's been a certain amount of volatility in interest rates (given) concern about the Fed in raising rates, reluctance of other central banks to continue with" quantitative easing, Macquarie's Wizman said. "Generally customers have sought to protect themselves from a backup in rates." Goldman Sachs said Tuesday that net revenue in fixed income, currency and commodities client execution rose 49 percent in the third quarter of this year from the same period in 2015, based on accounting including the debt valuation adjustment. That gain topped a 16 percent rise expected by KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl, and followed JPMorgan's 48 percent surge in fixed income markets revenue and a 35 percent jump for Citigroup, based on their earnings reports released last Friday. "Rates performance was particularly strong, with good client activity, as markets remained active throughout the quarter, post the Brexit vote and in anticipation of central bank actions as well as money market reform," JPMorgan said in its earnings release. US 10-year Treasury yield year to date Source: Reuters JPMorgan holds the largest global market share of fixed income and currency trading by revenue, according to an analysis of rankings from 2013 to the first half of this year by Deutsche Bank Securities. Citigroup is second, followed by Deutsche Bank, the data showed, while Goldman Sachs fell to sixth place in the first half of this year from fifth place last year. Bank of America also said fixed income trading revenue jumped 32 percent year over year. Morgan Stanley is the only major bank left and is scheduled to report earnings Wednesday. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the company to post earnings per share of 63 cents on revenue of $8.17 billion. Elevated activity in fixed income trading is expected to continue, especially on growing expectations for a Fed rate hike later this year and market talk of the European Central Bank winding down its asset purchase program known as quantitative easing. That potentially supports further gains in the fixed income trading business for the major banks. "We think whether it be in the U.S. elections or what's happening with central banks in Asia or Europe, there remain more volatility ahead," Swensen said. Analysts also pointed to benefits for fixed income desks from the resurgence in corporate debt issuance in the middle part of this year, after the risk-off sentiment last August and at the start of the year. That said, the third-quarter rise in fixed income trading revenue "wasn't so much about tail winds as it was not having so many headwinds for the quarter, and of course it translated nicely for us," Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said Tuesday on the bank's conference call. The bank stocks haven't responded significantly. Goldman Sachs shares were up nearly 2 percent midafternoon Tuesday, while the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) was 1.4 percent lower over the last five trading days. "The market hasn't given banks credit for trading-related beats this quarter," KBW's Kleinhanzl said in a Tuesday note.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon offered a read-between-the-lines prediction that the next U.S. president will be Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle,” Dimon, 60, said Monday at a conference sponsored by the New York-based bank, when asked what advice he’d give an incoming U.S. leader. The remark was met with loud applause. Partisan lawmakers haven’t been able to pass budgets or tackle issues including immigration and trade, he said. “We’re not acknowledging all these problems. We’re not getting that stuff done.” While Dimon’s comment was largely predictive, and stopped short of an endorsement, it makes him one of few heads of a large bank to publicly wade into the election. He prefaced the remark with a poke at Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has proposed “extreme vetting” of people entering the U.S. and vowed to build a wall along the border with Mexico, labeling some immigrants from that country “rapists.” “First of all, I want to say if you are Muslim, African American, an immigrant, a Mexican, you are completely welcome at JPMorgan Chase,” Dimon said. “Three of my grandparents immigrated from Greece, and you know, I don’t think any of them graduated high school to tell you the truth. How proud would they be to see their grandson run JPMorgan Chase." With three weeks to go before election day, Clinton is leading Trump by an average of 6.9 percentage points in national polls, according to RealClearPolitics. In 2008, Barack Obama won the presidency by 7.2 points, a margin that narrowed to 3.9 points when he was re-elected in 2012. Blankfein’s Reluctance Most Wall Street leaders have shied this year from indicating which candidate they want to see in the highest U.S. office. Such an endorsement risks backfiring at a time when the industry faces populist anger across the political spectrum. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein declined in February to take sides, saying his imprimatur could harm that person’s chances. “I don’t want to help or hurt anybody by giving them an endorsement,” he told CNBC. In the U.K., bankers were ineffective in persuading Britons to vote against leaving the European Union. A roster of financial industry leaders including Dimon backed then-Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in warning of economic fallout. The measure known as Brexit passed in June. During this year’s contentious U.S. campaign, Dimon has repeatedly emphasized the need for bipartisan collaboration. In 2012, he said he was still “barely” a Democrat and criticized the economic views of some politicians in Clinton’s party. Moelis’ Prediction Ken Moelis, the veteran dealmaker who runs his own investment bank, predicted in late September that Trump would win because voters are eager for a new approach. But that was before a 2005 video surfaced in which Trump bragged about being able to do anything to women because of his fame. Several women soon went public with accusations he sexually assaulted them. Trump has slid in polls while denying the allegations. There is a “desperate desire to change,” Moelis said of his prediction at the time. Still, he added, “either one of them can blow it.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is conducting a “deep dive” into its sales practices after rival Wells Fargo & Co. settled a probe into the opening of unauthorized accounts. While JPMorgan found some lapses, the problem wasn’t “systemic,” Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Friday in a conference call with journalists, adding that the review is ongoing. “We will occasionally find issues,” she said. “The important thing is we are focused on finding them. We’re not seeing anything rising to the level where we would be concerned.” Banks are under increased pressure from lawmakers and customers to avoid abuses after Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million to resolve investigations into bogus accounts. Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf, who stepped down this week, had promoted the cross-selling of products, such as pitching credit cards to deposit account customers. Wells Fargo said it fired 5,300 employees over fake accounts, and Lake said that JPMorgan has already taken action in instances of staff misbehavior. ‘Right behaviors’ “We can’t have zero defects,” Lake said. “Our incentive compensation is designed for the right behaviors.” Wells Fargo is eliminating products sales goals for members of the retail banking team, and new CEO Tim Sloan said that he is “deeply committed” to restoring trust in the San Francisco-based company. Customer visits to branches declined about 4% in September, the month that the settlement was announced, compared with August, the lender said Friday in a presentation. There was a 30% reduction in the number of consumer checking accounts opened, and a decline in credit-card applications. Wells Fargo shares have lost 18% this year through Thursday. Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said rivals need to be sensitive to risk of employee abuses in an era of increased scrutiny. “When regulators start digging deep, they like to find things," Miller said in a Bloomberg Television interview Friday. “We’re very concerned that regulators really dig, coming after these banks too aggressively."

Alamoudi will be responsible for JPMorgan’s operations and strategy in the kingdom, the bank said in a statement Tuesday. He was previously CEO of JPMorgan Saudi Arabia Ltd., the local investment banking unit, and will report to Sjoerd Leenart, senior country officer for the Middle East, Turkey and Africa, and Khaled Hobballah, head of Middle East and North Africa markets. Al Deweesh will continue to act as head of investment banking for Saudi Arabia and report to Karim Tannir, Middle East and North Africa investment banking head. JPMorgan has had a role on some of the most high-profile deals in Saudi Arabia as the government seeks to build a $2 trillion sovereign-wealth fund and reshape the economy away from its reliance on oil sales. The bank advised the Public Investment Fund on its $3.5 billion investment in Uber Technologies Inc. in June and has an advisory role on the planned sale of shares in state oil company Saudi Aramco, people familiar with the matter said in April. The bank is also one of the global coordinators on the kingdom’s debut international bond sale, which is due to be completed this week. Even amid the slump in oil revenue there is a “huge opportunity here,” and JPMorgan planned to increase headcount in the kingdom by about 10 percent this year, Alamoudi said in an interview with Bloomberg in January.

By: Reuters | Published: October 18, 2016 6:17 PM Net income applicable to shareholders jumped to .10 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from .33 billion a year earlier, while earnings per share rose to .88 from .90. (Reuters) Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a stronger-than-expected 57.9 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday as revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities surged. Net income applicable to shareholders jumped to $2.10 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.33 billion a year earlier, while earnings per share rose to $4.88 from $2.90. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $3.82 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was the bank’s second straight rise in quarterly profit after four quarters of decline. Revenue from trading fixed-income securities, commodities and currencies increased 34 percent to $1.96 billion, helping to boost total net revenue by 19 percent to $8.17 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.42 billion. Goldman joins JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp in reporting stronger revenue from trading, which got a boost from Britain’s surprise vote to quit the European Union as well as from uncertainty about monetary policy in the United States and elsewhere. Goldman’s chief rival, Morgan Stanley, is due to report results on Wednesday, wrapping up what has been a better-than-expected reporting period for big U.S. banks. The bank’s annualized return on average common equity – a measure of how well a company uses shareholder money to generate profit – was 11.2 percent in the quarter and 8.7 percent for the first nine months of the year. Many investors think ROE should be at least 10 percent to cover the cost of capital. Goldman’s shares, which have fallen 6.2 percent this year, were up 1.37 percent at $171.32 in premarket trading. “We saw solid performance across the franchise that helped counter typical seasonal weakness,” Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement. Goldman, like other big banks, has been slashing costs and streamlining its businesses to help make up for sluggish revenue from trading and investment banking as well as to meet stricter capital requirements imposed after the financial crisis. Operating expenses in the latest quarter rose 10.07 percent to $5.3 billion, while compensation costs – the bank’s biggest expense – rose 36.4 percent to $3.21 billion. Goldman embarked on a cost-saving program earlier this year that it hopes will result in annual savings of $700 million. Overall trading revenue rose 16.7 percent to $3.75 billion. Investment banking revenue, which includes income from advising on mergers and acquisitions as well as underwriting bond and share offerings, fell 1.2 percent to $1.54 billion. Goldman Sachs topped all banks globally in M&A fees in the quarter, a slow one for deals, but trailed JPMorgan in revenue from underwriting bond and equity offerings, according to Thomson Reuters data. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings fell to $46 million from $416 million. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The bank’s annualized return on average common equity – a measure of how well a company uses shareholder money to generate profit – was 11.2 per cent in the quarter and 8.7 per cent for the first nine months of the year. Many investors think ROE should be at least 10 per cent to cover the cost of capital. Goldman’s shares, which have fallen 6.2 per cent this year, were up 1.37 per cent at $171.32 in premarket trading. “We saw solid performance across the franchise that helped counter typical seasonal weakness,” Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement. Goldman, like other big banks, has been slashing costs and streamlining its businesses to help make up for sluggish revenue from trading and investment banking as well as to meet stricter capital requirements imposed after the financial crisis. Operating expenses in the latest quarter rose 10.07 per cent to $5.3-billion, while compensation costs – the bank’s biggest expense – rose 36.4 per cent to $3.21-billion. Goldman embarked on a cost-saving program earlier this year that it hopes will result in annual savings of $700-million. Overall trading revenue rose 16.7 per cent to $3.75-billion. Investment banking revenue, which includes income from advising on mergers and acquisitions as well as underwriting bond and share offerings, fell 1.2 per cent to $1.54-billion. Goldman Sachs topped all banks globally in M&A fees in the quarter, a slow one for deals, but trailed JPMorgan in revenue from underwriting bond and equity offerings, according to Thomson Reuters data. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings fell to $46-million from $416-million.

Although deposit totals fluctuate greatly day to day, the FDIC reports its June 30 measurement every year. In 2015, Jackson County's 12 commercial banks held deposits of just over $2.99 billion. This year, with Bank of America no longer in the mix, deposits were $3.15 billion. Umpqua Bank increased its market share to 18.76 percent with deposits of $591.4 million. U.S. Bank narrowed the difference between first and second in the market with deposits of $563.3 million, upping its share to 17.87 percent after claiming 16.25 percent with $486.3 million in 2015. JPMorgan Chase overtook Wells Fargo for the No. 3 slot, with a market share of 15.94 percent and deposits of $502.5 million. Medford-based People's Bank of Commerce moved up to No. 7 with 6.78 percent of the market and deposits of $213.7 million. Although it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, Rogue Credit Union had Jackson County deposits of just under $713.6 million on June 30. Rogue CEO Gene Pelham said the sale of local Bank America branches, along with other disruptive forces in the financial industry, had boosted deposits. "Our new members cite the sale of branches, branch closures, and the challenges of integrating systems for merged institutions as reasons for moving," Pelham said. Overall deposit growth is reflective of the economy, he said. "Housing values are growing again, so there is additional equity to pull out," Pelham said. "What's been the best indicator I've seen for us is that our recreational vehicle portfolio has grown somewhat dramatically. That's showing the comfort level people have for buying discretionary items."

The money will help establish the $30 million Strategic Neighborhood Fund, which will support resources directed toward commercial and residential real estate, jobs and infrastructure as part of the Detroit Strategic Neighborhood Initiative. Mayor Mike Duggan says that the money being announced Wednesday will help “new small businesses open, existing businesses expand and new residential developments take place.” Initially, it will target the West Village, Southwest Detroit and Livernois-McNichols neighborhoods and help finance multi-unit residential, business and mixed-use developments to add neighborhood density and tie in with major transportation lines.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Campaigns tussle over PAC money Wednesday Oct 19, 2016 at 3:23 PM Oct 19, 2016 at 3:23 PM By Jason JordanThe Evening Tribune Getting money out of politics was a rallying cry of both the Democratic and Republican parties during primary season. Now, in the 23rd Congressional District, the issue has come to a head. On Monday, Democratic challenger John Plumb’s campaign circulated an email, pointing out that his opponent, Rep. Tom Reed (R-Corning) has taken more than $300,000 in donations from Financial Services Industry Political Action Committees (PACs). Reed and his campaign would later respond. “Congressman Reed keeps making the problems in our rural communities worse by voting in Washington to rig the system in favor of big banks and special interests — and now they’re rushing to his defense and paying huge sums of cash to try to keep him in Washington,” Plumb said. “Tom Reed embodies the worst of our broken political system and it is deeply disturbing that he continues to get away with it while our working families suffer. Tom Reed spends his time in Washington putting special interests ahead of our district. I will do things differently and put service to our communities first." Reed has raised nearly $300,000 from Financial Services, Insurance and Real Estate Industry PACs this cycle alone, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. “More than 60 percent ($1,744,193) of (Reed’s) funds have come from special interests this cycle. That should be no surprise as Reed has consistently voted for Wall Street at the expense of families here in Western New York, the Southern Tier, and the Finger Lakes,” a Plumb campaign statement charged. Some of those donations came from the likes of powerhouse financial industry leaders including, the American Bankers Association, American Express, Credit Suisse Securities, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, and the Mortgage Bankers Association, according to Federal Elections Commission (FEC) filings. The Plumb campaign has also received money from PACs, but only to the tune of 18.45 percent of his total campaign fundraising ($247,755), according to the FEC. Filings turned up no monetary support from the Financial Services Industry for the Democrat. On a call with reporters Monday afternoon, Reed largely tried to stay above the fray and avoid a back and forth on the issue. “I’m not going to get into that. That’s kind of the politics of DC to have that tit-for-tat conversation. I’m worried about the American people and the people of the district and their interests,” Reed said. “That’s where the focus needs to be.” Reed said that there were more important factors for voters to weigh. “We think races are won and lost on the records that are put out there, and it’s ultimately up to the people. Regardless of where the money comes from, your record and the effort you put into the office is what determines the outcome,” he said. Reed suggested that Plumb's campaign is influenced by the deep pockets of outside forces. “This is politics from DC, trying to come into the area and we subscribe to the thought that to represent people, you have to listen to people and put the work in. That’s what we try to do and we believe we’re going to be successful in November because people at the end of the day will respect what we’ve tried to do as opposed to what my opponent has tried to do during the campaign,” he said. Later in the call, Reed touted the fact that more than 1,500 individuals have contributed to his campaign. However, their donations make up only 37 percent ($861,634) of his fundraising total. “We’ve had over 1,500 folks from New York supporting us, and the support has been overwhelming. I support full transparency when it comes to campaign finance reform and will continue to support it because that may be the best medicine for the shenanigans that may be involved with money in politics,” he said. Asked to point out anything specific he disagreed with in Plumb’s FEC filings, Reed declined. A spokesperson for the campaign however, was not so hesitant to fire back. "It's absurd that DC John Plumb's campaign would attack Tom when Plumb's campaign is benefiting from a quarter million dollars from Nancy Pelosi's PAC. Plumb is bought by the very DC insider who convinced him to move here and run for Congress," said Amy Hasenberg, Tom Reed for Congress spokeswoman. A search for the quarter million dollar Pelosi PAC donation could not be independently verified. However, a search of the Congressional Leadership Fund turned up a similarly sized expenditure made Oct. 10 by the Conservative Congressional Leadership Fund in the amount of $299,000 to defeat Plumb: the single largest independent expenditure of the campaign. Plumb will be holding a campaign event in Ithaca today to unveil his policy priorities on government ethics and campaign finance.

The company plans to price its 13 million shares at $13.50, with an overallotment option for an additional 1.95 million shares. At this price, the entire offering, including the option, is valued up to $201.825 million. As for the underwriters in this offering, JPMorgan is acting as lead book-running manager. Jefferies and Piper Jaffray are book-running managers. William Blair is acting as lead manager for the offering, and Brean Capital, BTIG, Janney Montgomery Scott, Ladenburg Thalmann and Roth Capital Partners are co-managers for the offering. This biopharmaceutical company is developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize its PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action. The current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology. Research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and protein biologic drug candidates. Nektar creates innovative drug candidates by using its proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of pharmacophores to create new molecular entities. Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule. Its drug candidates are designed to improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for patients by improving the metabolism, distribution, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life and/or bioavailability of drugs. The overall objective is to apply its advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including research and development funding and working capital. Shares of Nektar were trading down 5% at $13.32 on Wednesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $21.00 and a 52-week trading range of $10.52 to $19.98.

Today, Thomson Reuters reported that earnings for the S&P 500 Index are expected to grow 0.5 percent in the third quarter, which would end four consecutive quarters of negative growth. Revenues are also expected to grow 2.5 percent, which will end six consecutive quarters of negative revenue growth. With only 14 percent of the S&P 500 reporting so far, this is shaping up to be a well above-average earnings season. Both the number of companies beating (80 percent) and the magnitude by which they are beating (7.3 percent) are both well above average, according to Thomson Reuters. You can partly thank bank stocks. All the big banks — JPMorgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, PNC, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Comerica and Regions Financial — have beaten their top- and bottom-line estimates, in some cases by a substantial margin. That's important, because financials are the second largest sector in the S&P 500, after technology. Financial earnings are now expected to be up 6.7 percent, well above the 1 percent gain expected on October 1st. The question is, what about the rest of the market? In Energy, we got an important report from Halliburton this morning, which surprised everyone with a 1-cent profit, well above the 6-cent loss expected. This is important, because estimates for energy stocks were one of the only sectors under pressure since earnings season began. It's not clear if other oil service names will report similar results, but Halliburton made it clear that margins in North America had improved. Beats like this will help change the tone around Energy. That's what Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar seems to be trying to do: change the tone. He said that "as we look forward, we expect an increased commodity price to stimulate rig count growth ... things are getting better for us and our customers." He did remain cautious around fourth quarter customer activity due to holiday and seasonal weather-related down times—but you get the point. The bottom line is that many in the oil business are expressing more confidence about oil floating in a $50-$60 range in 2017. That's a big positive for perceptions about earnings in the fourth quarter. Which brings us back to the main question: can the outsize earnings and revenue growth continue with other sectors? How about technology? Semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holdings reported a solid quarter. Intel had a strong beat, but guidance was disappointing. Still, that beat by Intel has moved up earnings expectations in that sector. Technology is now expected to see earnings growth of 5.7 percent, up from 4.9 percent before Intel reported. And results appear to be improving for the biggest stock of all: Apple. Samsung's woes appear to be helping Apple: Earnings estimates have been rising for the biggest stock in the S&P 500. Apple reports next Tuesday. The next big test will come later on Thursday and Friday, when a number of big industrials report: General Electric, Honeywell, Illinois Tool Works. Honeywell already warned, so that is certainly an issue. GE, however, should report number modestly above the same period last year. They have a long history of beating estimates: They have beaten estimates in nine of the last 12 quarters.

The five biggest U.S. investment banks reaped $20.7 billion in revenue from bond and stock trading in the third quarter, the most for the typically slow summer period since 2009. The gains came even after the world’s 10 biggest firms, including European banks that haven’t yet reported third-quarter results, sliced more than 5,000 front-office trading and investment-banking jobs in the past seven years, according to Coalition Ltd. Investment banks have been eliminating workers as new regulations and low interest rates crimp profit and as widespread adoption of electronic trading makes some jobs obsolete. Alarmed at a particularly weak third quarter last year, Morgan Stanley slashed 470 jobs, or about a quarter of its fixed-income division. The result? Third-quarter bond-trading revenue almost tripled to $1.5 billion, the New York-based company said Wednesday. “We had a better quarter,” Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told analysts. “What I’m pleased about is, we did it with 25 percent less people.” The five firms -- JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley -- posted a 26 percent jump in combined quarterly trading revenue from the previous year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. All of the banks exceeded analysts’ expectations for bond trading, spurred by the surprise U.K. referendum to leave the European Union, divergent views on the direction of central-bank rates and changes in money-market regulations. JPMorgan held the top spot in fixed income, reaping $4.3 billion in revenue, while Morgan Stanley remained No. 1 in equities, taking in $1.9 billion. Net income climbed 47 percent at Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street firm most dependent on trading. It was up 57 percent at Morgan Stanley. And investment bank divisions within JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup also boosted profits. Goldman cut roughly 10 percent of its fixed-income staff this year, double the company’s usual rate. About 250 people were affected, the Wall Street Journal said in January, suggesting the New York-based company had about 2,500 employees in the division at the beginning of the year. The slimmed-down operation pulled in $1.96 billion in third-quarter revenue, a 49 percent increase. “We had excess on Wall Street for quite a while relative to the business that was being done,” Charles Peabody, an analyst at Compass Point Research and Trading, said in a phone interview. Banks “are serious about the expense discipline and the potential for positive operating leverage once these markets return on a sustainable basis.” Some of the gains may be due to Deutsche Bank AG’s woes, according to John Gerspach, Citigroup’s chief financial officer. The Frankfurt-based lender has said it’s losing out on business as it battles to retain confidence amid mounting legal charges. The firm might scale back its U.S. presence as part of a restructuring, people familiar with the matter said this week. Questions Remain A lingering question is whether the recent gains signal a long-awaited rebound in fixed income. Momentum has continued in the first two weeks of the fourth quarter, which should benefit from the U.S. election and an expected Federal Reserve rate increase, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said last week. Still, it’s too early to say whether the market’s improvement will last, bank executives said. “One quarter doesn’t make a trend, and we’re pretty comfortable with the decision we made” last year to dismiss traders, Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview. “We’re not changing our strategy.” Should the rise in trading convince executives the market has returned, it’s unlikely they’d go on a massive hiring spree, according to Shannon Stemm, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. “They’ve gotten more efficient as a result of the restructuring of the last few years,” Stemm said. “Some of these businesses are scalable, so you don’t need to hire a lot more people if volumes return.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The big banks are seeing stronger results even though the interest-rate and regulatory environments haven’t changed, factors that the banks have blamed for disappointing results in the past. The reasons: a mix of insecurity over the British pound driving investors toward stocks and commodities; stabilizing credit and increased consumer borrowing; and the costs of regulatory compliance have leveled off for many of the big banks.

Under normal circumstances, these shock politicised developments would send the rand tumbling but the currency was remarkably poised, it said in its weekly overview of the South African economic and investment landscape. "The local currency and bond markets, which are forward-looking barometers, are telling us that despite unsettling current events the outlook is improving." OAM said further that financial markets are increasingly discounting a South Africa under improved leadership.  Although there is unlikely to be a change in ANC leadership until the end of 2017, there is light at the end of the tunnel, OAM said. South Africa economic review • During the past week, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was summoned to appear in court and Public Protector Thuli Madonsela was prevented by President Jacob Zuma’s interdict application from releasing her much-awaited state capture report. READ: Gordhan will stand his ground • Mining production increased in August by a stronger than expected 2.5% month-on-month, reversing a similar magnitude decline in July. On a year-on-year basis, mining output fell by 0.2% - a substantial improvement on July’s -5.4% and the -4.0% consensus forecast. By sector, iron ore and platinum group metals (PGMs) increased production on the month by 11.7% and 8.5%. Iron ore production has soared around 40% over the past five months while PGM production is recovering on confidence that a strike will be averted in the sector. Firmer global commodity prices should maintain the recent stabilisation in mining output although the long-term health of the industry will depend on greater regulatory certainty. • Manufacturing production fell again in August by -1.0% month-on-month following the -1.9% decline in July. Of the ten manufacturing sectors, only two showed positive growth in August. Glass and non-metallic minerals, and furniture and related, grew production by 0.6% and 3.7%. On a year-on-year basis manufacturing production growth gained from -0.3% in July to 2.2% but this is attributed to base effects. The latest decline is consistent with the slump in the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) from 52.5 in July to a sub-50 contractionary reading of 46.3 in August. The PMI subsequently gained to 49.5, which although still contractionary, signals a stabilization in manufacturing output in the final month of the third quarter. The week ahead • Consumer price inflation: Due on Wednesday 19th October. According to consensus forecast consumer price inflation (CPI) is expected to nudge higher from 5.9% year-on-year in August to 6.3% in September moving back above the SA Reserve Bank’s 3-6% target range. The previous month’s low CPI number was helped by a 99c/litre petrol price cut, which in September was followed by a price cut of just 18 cents. Core CPI, excluding food and petrol, is expected to remain unchanged at 5.7%. Retail sales: Due on Wednesday 19th October. Retail sales growth is expected to slow further from 0.8% year-on-year in July to 0.5% in August, hampered by declining consumer confidence. Consumer confidence is being affected by poor jobs growth, rising interest rates, weak credit demand, and declining expansion in household disposable income. Technical analysis • While the rand has broken below key resistance levels versus the dollar at R/$ 14.20 and 13.80 the strengthening trend is not confirmed by momentum indicators, signalling that the currency is overbought. • The US dollar index is testing a major 30-year resistance line, which if broken will pave the way for further strong gains in the currency. • Following the Brexit vote the British pound hit its weakest level against the US dollar since 1985. The £/$1.30 level provides key support, which if broken would open up a Fibonacci projected target of £/$1.20-1.24. • The long-term JPMorgan global bond index bull trend remains intact, with the yield targeting a new low during the fifth and final wave. • The US 10-year Treasury yield has broken below key resistance levels of 1.6% confirming that the major bull trend in US bonds is likely to continue as the deleveraging phase is still in its early stages. • The benchmark R186 SA Gilt yield has compressed to its lowest level since “Nenegate” last year falling below key resistance at 9.0%. The yield is now testing the bottom of the current consolidation channel at 8.5%, which if broken will target a yield of 8.0%. • The MSCI World Equity index has broken downward from a rising trend-line which has been intact since the 2008/09 global financial crisis. Given the magnitude and duration of the 2009-2015 bull market the overall correction is likely to reach a downside target for the MSCI World Equity index of 1 400. • Since the 1950s the Dow Jones and S&P 500 have displayed 7-year up-cycles and the top of the current US equity cycle is likely to have just occurred. The next major wave down will complete the 16-17 year secular bear market that started in 2000. The secular bottom should occur between mid-2016 and mid-2017. • The S&P 500 index has broken to new record highs but the rally is not being confirmed by momentum indicators, which suggests the market is overbought and in danger of correction. A further negative signal is that the Dow Jones Transport Index, traditionally a lead indicator for the broader market, is underperforming the broader index. • Despite this year’s price rally Brent crude’s break below the key $30 support level in February suggests a continuation of the weakening long-term trend to a downside $25 target. Copper is regarded a reliable lead indicator for industrial commodity prices and barometer of global economic growth. Despite its recent rally the copper price broke below the key $4 500 support level in February suggesting further downside ahead.  • Gold has developed an inverse “head and shoulders” pattern, which indicates further upward momentum and a test of the $1400 target level. • The JSE All Share index is testing an important resistance line but if this remains unbroken the index is likely to move back below the 24-month moving average at 50 900 in turn opening a downside target of 45 000. A break above 54 200 on the JSE All Share index would project an upward move to 60 000 marking a new high for the JSE. The bottom line • In June Goldman Sachs’ Christian Mueller-Glissman, based in the UK, warned of a rising risk of a large global equity market decline: “With bond yields close to all-time lows and a large proportion of fixed income offering negative rates, “safe assets” and “hedges” for equities are more scarce. Real bond yields are low despite the start of a Fed rate hike cycle and bonds discount too little inflation in our view. As a result, they are also a source of risk.” • Inflation expectations have increased sharply over the past month. In the UK, the five-year “break-even” rate, a gauge of inflation expectations derived from the yield difference between conventional sovereign bonds and inflation-linked bonds, has surged higher in the past month from 2.6% to 3.1%. The US five-year break-even rate has climbed from less than 1% in February to just under 1.6%. • Inflation expectations have been fanned by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen’s speech at the weekend at a Boston Fed conference. Yellen stated that it might be wise for the Fed to run a “high pressure economy”, whereby the Fed maintains accommodative monetary policy for longer in order to boost the labour participation rate. The speech hints at a willingness to overshoot the Fed’s 2% inflation target. • China, which rocked global financial markets last year on fears that it would export deflation to the rest of the world, reported a rapid acceleration in inflation readings in September. China’s consumer price inflation (CPI) surged from 1.3% year-on-year in August to 1.9% in September, while producer price inflation (PPI) accelerated from -0.8% to 0.1 turning positive for the first time since 2012. • At this stage one cannot be sure whether the uptick in inflation expectations and concurrent rise in bond yields is a short-term reaction or the start of a sustainable change in trend. A rise in global inflation would require a shift towards inflation-driven investing.  • What would inflation-driven investing entail? Higher than expected inflation would damage the outlook for emerging market currencies, as markets increasingly discount a tightening of global monetary conditions. Global bond prices would also fall accompanied by the prices of so-called “bond-proxy” stocks, which have been favoured in the current zero interest rate environment for their high dividend yields. Such stocks would typically include consumer staple stocks with attractive dividend yields but modest real growth prospects. • Certain sectors would benefit from the effect of rising inflation. Gold and precious metals would flourish. Among equity sectors, bank stocks in developed economies would celebrate the return of higher interest rates and a steepening in the yield curve, promoting greater interest margins and bank profitability.

By JosephAdinolfi Markets reporter Treasury prices fell Wednesday after fluctuating between gains and losses for most of the session as investors sold U.S. government bonds to hedge their credit risk ahead of a massive offering of Saudi Arabian debt. Yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, climbed early in the day as the underwriters of the $17.5 billion deal sold Treasurys to lock in the spread between the U.S. government bonds and the Saudi sovereign-bond offering, said Tom di Galoma, managing director for Treasury Trading, at Seaport Global. Bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction. But they tipped lower in afternoon trading likely because the deal’s underwriters—a group that includes J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -0.56% HSBC HSBC, -0.70% and Citigroup Inc. C, -0.36% —bought back those bonds and delivered them to their clients, bond strategists said. “In essence, they’re guaranteeing a rate to the issuer where they price,” said Larry Milstein, managing director of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. They soon ticked higher in afternoon trading after the Fed’s Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes about the U.S. economy, suggested it expanded at a steady, but unspectacular, rate in September. The yield on the two-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, -0.27%  declined 0.4 basis point to 0.803%, while the yield on the 10-year note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.40%  added 0.4 basis point to 1.752%. The 30-year yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.04% climbed 0.5 basis point to 2.515%. The Saudi auction, helped to shift bond traders’ focus away from U.S. monetary policy—the dominant trading theme in recent months—and away from a troubling report on the U.S. housing market as the market waited for the deal to price. The offering represents Saudi Arabia’s first debt sale to international investors. Low oil prices have forced the country to find new revenues to plug a gaping hole in its budget, The Wall Street Journal reported. Also on investors’ radar were speeches by Federal Reserve members. San Francisco Fed President John Williams spoke at a diversity conference at Rutgers University, but the noted Fed hawk said nothing about monetary policy. Later in the day, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the Fed could afford to be patient about raising rates. New York Fed President William Dudley is expected to speak after the close On the economic front, housing starts fell 9% in September, but the weakness in starts was partially offset by a jump in building permits, which suggests that the starts number could soon rise.

Okt 2016 15:08 MESZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Firmen: KBW Nasdaq Bank Index Morgan Stanley AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung ^BKX 85,44 +0,09 MS 40,265 +0,295 Foto anzeigen Victor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images. The bank posted earnings of 81 cents per share on revenue of $8.9 billion. Morgan Stanley (MS) joined its Wall Street peers in the third quarter on Wednesday by easily topping profit expectations. The bank posted earnings of 81 cents per share on revenue of $8.9 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected 63 cents profit and sales of $8.17 billion. Return on average common equity was 8.7 percent. Shares gained more than 1 percent in premarket trading. The 17th-largest bank by assets had faced challenges in trading and its fixed income, currencies and commodities operation, but that segment posted a strong quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion. Trading has been a strong point for Wall Street banks this quarter, with Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) all reporting strong growth. Morgan Stanley was the last of the big Wall Street banks to report earnings. Morgan Stanley earnings for the same period in 2015 were 34 cents per share, putting this quarter's gain at 139 percent. "This quarter we saw record revenues in wealth management and a strong performance in our sales and trading business. While the environment was more challenging for our equity underwriting and asset management businesses, our expense initiatives remain on track," Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said in a statement. "Overall the results reflect steady progress against our long term strategic goals." Morgan Stanley's earnings were expected to get a boost from the bank's role in Microsoft (MSFT)'s acquisition of LinkedIn, a $26.2 billion deal that has been part of a recent uptick in deal volume. Morgan Stanley shares were up about 1.5 percent year to date as of the end of trading Tuesday. Indeed, investment banking was a strong source of revenue in the quarter at $1.1 billion, in line with estimates. Wealth management revenues came to $3.9 billion, slightly ahead of expectations, while wealth management missed with $552 million, against a $590 million estimate. Analysts have been watching bank earnings closely for the effects of the Brexit vote in particular and market volatility in general. The U.K. vote in June to leave the European Union was expected to destabilize the financial system but thus far has mostly affected the British pound sterling. Banks are hoping the Federal Reserve hikes rates soon. Eight years of near-zero funds rates have hurt bank margins, and the sector has broadly underperformed the rest of the market. The KBW Nasdaq Bank (^BKX) index is down about 1.8 percent year to date, though the sector has beaten the market lately. Banks are up 6.4 percent over the past three months. Morgan Stanley said it repurchased about $1.25 billion worth of its own stock during the quarter.

Equity swaps are financial contracts that allow participants to benefit from the returns of an equity security or index without purchasing it. They typically involve agreements between parties that can last up to one year. In order to conduct these transactions, many firms — both dealers and financial firms — have built their own systems, which require bespoke connectivity to one another. These firms must also constantly monitor factors that might affect the transaction, such as fluctuations in equity prices, Libor rates, and unexpected actions by corporations — some of which require manual updates to the contracts. And largely because of this complexity, there is no centralized repository for the clearing or reporting of equity swaps. The system is designed to solve several major pain points for institutions executing equity swaps. First, it provides a standardized framework that all parties can connect to, eradicating the need for multiple bespoke connections. Second, it automatically absorbs relevant information from Thomson Reuters' feeds to enable the automatic implementation of changes to the contract that result from changes in price, etc. And finally, the blockchain provides an immutable record of the contracts that have been executed, and under what conditions, enabling people with access to the blockchain to detect any errors almost immediately. This also limits the possibility of disputes or discrepancies.  The successful testing of this system means a real-world application for blockchain in financial services is closer than ever before. The involvement of multiple major banks is key, as the success of any blockchain technology requires widespread adoption of the same system. This testing scenario was also much more complex than many blockchain-based financial services prototypes to date. And Axoni and the FS providers involved claim that they carried out 133 different trials, which had a 100% success rate. This suggests that blockchain technology is passing the prototype and proof-of-concept stage, where it has long languished, and moving toward real-world implementations.  Blockchain technology, which is best known for powering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is gaining steam among finance firms because of its potential to streamline processes and increase efficiency. The technology could cut costs by up to $20 billion annually by 2022, according to Santander. That's because blockchain, which operates as a distributed ledger, has the ability to allow multiple parties to transfer and store sensitive information in a space that’s secure, permanent, anonymous, and easily accessible. That could simplify paper-heavy, expensive, or logistically complicated financial systems, like remittances and cross-border transfer, shareholder management and ownership exchange, and securities trading, to name a few. And outside of finance, governments and the music industry are investigating the technology’s potential to simplify record-keeping. As a result, venture capital firms and financial institutions alike are pouring investment into finding, developing, and testing blockchain use cases. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, have begun researching the technology in-house, or have helped fund startups with products rooted in blockchain.  Jaime Toplin, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on blockchain technology that explains how blockchain works, why it has the potential to provide a watershed moment for the financial industry, and the different ways it could be put into practice in the coming years. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Spending on capital markets applications of blockchain is expected to grow at a 52% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2019, according to Aite Group, to reach $400 million that year. Banks and major financial institutions are working both collaboratively and independently to develop blockchain tech. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, like R3 CEV or Chain. And many are investing in the technology on their own as well. Putting blockchain to use for real-world transactions is likely not that far off. If working groups' tests are successful, firms could be using it to transact real value as early as the end of this year and we could see widespread industry application within the next few years.  In full, the report: Examines the funding increases that are pouring into blockchain Assesses why blockchain is becoming so popular and what factors are driving up increased research and development Explains in full how blockchain technology work and what assets make it valuable and vulnerable Identifies pain points in the financial industry and profiles how various firms are using blockchain to solve them Demonstrates the challenges to mainstream adoption and their potential solutions To get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.
