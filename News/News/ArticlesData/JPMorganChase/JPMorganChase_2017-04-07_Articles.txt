Recently, those same stocks have backed off as investors took profits, and more importantly, concerns over regulatory and tax reform and a sharp drop in loan growth hit the top stocks. While first-quarter earnings may not be blockbuster, increases in net interest margins should help buffer the slowdown in loan growth. In a new research report, JPMorgan makes the case that bank stocks are attractively valued now relative to the overall market, and with the prospect of rising rates, and a less onerous regulatory tone, the rest of 2017 looks bright. The analysts also note that despite the big moves in the sector, banks are trading in the middle of the range over the past 25 years in periods of economic recovery. These five stocks are rated Overweight at JPMorgan. Bank of America The company posted solid fourth-quarter results, and it expects a significant increase in net interest income for the current quarter. Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) is a ubiquitous presence in the United States, providing various banking and financial products and services for individual consumers, small and middle market businesses, institutional investors, corporations and governments in the United States and internationally. It operates some 5,100 banking centers, 16,300 ATMs, call centers, online and a mobile banking platform. The company is one of the larger lenders to the oil and gas industry, and it told analysts earlier this year that it had set aside more money for coverage of loans to the industry that may go bad. Overall credit quality remained strong, while consumer portfolios continued to improve and commercial portfolios remained stable with energy improving. Trading was soft in the fourth quarter but should price up in the first quarter. Bank of America investors are paid a small 1.35% dividend. The JPMorgan price target for the stock is $25, and the Wall Street consensus price target is $25.39. The stock closed Thursday at $23.26 per share. Citigroup This top bank is trading at the same level it was in the summer of 2015. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. It provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services and wealth management. Trading at a still very cheap 10.7 times estimated 2017 earnings, this company look very reasonable in what is becoming a pricey stock market. A continuing stock buyback program at the bank is a positive. The bank’s institutional clients group appeared to be holding its ground last quarter, and while guidance when it released the quarter in January was conservative and somewhat disappointing, the stock appears cheap at this level. Citigroup investors are paid a 1.07% dividend. The $65 JPMorgan price target is more or less in line with the consensus price objective of $64.74. Shares closed most recently at $59.89 apiece. 24/7 Wall St. 5 Red-Hot Large-Cap Tech Stocks That Should Beat Earnings Estimates Pages: 1/2 « Disappointing Payrolls Report for March, With Payrolls Revised Lower for February and January Comcast Offers Mobile Service, YouTube Takes on Cable TV » Read more: Banking & Finance, Analyst Upgrades, featured, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), PNC Financial Services (NYSE:PNC), SunTrust Banks, Inc.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Market JPMorgan’s 125-year courtship of GE is paying off handsomely JPMorgan’s 125-year courtship of GE is paying off handsomely The century-old connection between General Electric Co. and what is now JPMorgan Chase & Co., which dates back to the days of Thomas Edison, has become one of the most lucrative relationships in corporate America. By: Bloomberg | Published: April 7, 2017 7:26 PM The century-old connection between General Electric Co. and what is now JPMorgan Chase & Co., which dates back to the days of Thomas Edison, has become one of the most lucrative relationships in corporate America. (Source: Reuters) No CEO is showering money on Wall Street like Jeffrey Immelt. And no Wall Street CEO is catching more of it than Jamie Dimon. The century-old connection between General Electric Co. and what is now JPMorgan Chase & Co., which dates back to the days of Thomas Edison, has become one of the most lucrative relationships in corporate America. Over the past five years, Immelt’s GE has paid Dimon’s JPMorgan $167 million in merger and acquisition fees, as GE jettisoned lending units to revive the parent company following the financial crisis. The question now is whether the good times are ending as GE’s restructuring is nearly complete and its pool of capital available for deals is shrinking. “The major pieces have been taken care of at this point,” said Jeff Windau, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. “That was kind of an extraordinary period of time for them.” If Wall Street is happy with all the dealmaking, investors are less so. While GE’s shares jumped 23 percent in 2015, they stalled last year, gaining just 1.4 percent to trail the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and were down 5.3 percent this year through Thursday. The lackluster performance has triggered increasing pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management to cut costs to boost the stock. JPMorgan’s leading deal role shows once again the value of relationships on Wall Street — in this case, really old relationships. In 1892, John Pierpont Morgan’s Drexel Morgan & Co., a predecessor to today’s bank, helped form GE by arranging the merger of Edison’s company and a rival business. In the modern era, JPMorgan’s GE business was taken up by the bank’s legendary deal adviser Jimmy Lee, who advised on transactions ranging from the company’s sale of NBC in 2009 to its sweeping exit from finance. Lee died unexpectedly in 2015 at the age of 62. JPMorgan’s fees since 2012 were twice as much as runner-up Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s $83 million, according to an analysis for Bloomberg by consultant Freeman & Co. But Goldman Sachs’s fortunes may be turning. It’s got the most potential fees from GE in the pipeline, at about $40 million, Freeman said. $1.6 Billion on Fees As a longtime serial dealmaker and bond issuer, GE has been a good friend to all of Wall Street, of course. Over the past five years, it’s spent $1.6 billion on fees for deals, bond sales and capital-markets advice, according to Freeman. And last year, on M&A advisory services alone, the manufacturing giant was the top corporate spender, shelling out $166 million to investment banks, exceeding Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable. “Everybody wants to do business with GE,” said Jeffrey Nassof, a director with Freeman’s consulting business. Amid rising deal-related costs, investment banks are increasingly focusing “on the big fee-paying clients rather than smaller firms. GE is obviously the biggest of the big, so everybody wants to focus on firms like that.” GE said in an emailed statement that “selectively engaging investment banking advisers has been critical” in recent years as GE tilted its operations toward industrial manufacturing. A JPMorgan representative declined to comment. GE’s dealmaking ramped up to an unprecedented pace in 2015 with Chief Executive Officer Immelt’s strategy to sell consumer businesses and the portions of GE Capital that didn’t directly support its industrial divisions. The narrowed focus would be on making gas turbines, oil-drilling equipment, ultrasound machines and jet engines. Over that period, GE also closed its largest-ever acquisition, in a $10 billion deal for Alstom SA’s energy operations, and agreed to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc. GE Capital Effort JPMorgan was tasked with overseeing the GE Capital effort, which included dozens of separate deals covering about $200 billion of assets. Among the larger transactions, GE sold a private-equity lending unit to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $12 billion and a health-care finance business to Capital One Financial Corp. for about $9 billion. The GE Capital plan reached its unofficial conclusion last week when the company wrapped up the sale of its French consumer business, GE Money Bank, which included about $4.4 billion of assets. GE has showered some of its fees on smaller investment banking firms, especially Centerview Partners, a so-called boutique firm started in 2006 by veteran bankers Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan. Centerview worked with JPMorgan on the GE Capital sales and snagged a lead role on GE’s tie-up with Baker Hughes, which will create one of the industry’s largest oilfield equipment and servicing companies. You might also want to see this: Centerview Revenue Centerview has earned about $30 million in GE fee revenue since 2012, not counting the Baker Hughes deal, according to Freeman. Centerview didn’t respond to a request for comment. The good times for dealmaking may be ending, or at least slowing down, as GE’s new portfolio takes shape. Its bond sales — and the fees those bring — are also tapering off. The company paid only $96 million in debt-related fees last year, the lowest amount in 15 years, according to Freeman. Wall Street needn’t fret too much, though. A few more disposals are still possible, including Edison’s old light-bulb operation and an industrial-solutions unit. GE still has about $10 billion of unallocated capital for use on deals, share buybacks and the like, down from about $30 billion, including leverage, early last year. “They’re always going to be finding new areas that they think are important,” said David Ravenscraft, a University of North Carolina business professor who has taught M&A-focused executive education courses for GE. “There are some signs that there’s a slowdown, but they’re in it for the long haul.” No Comments.

On Thursday, Kashkari did. In an essay published on the Minneapolis Fed's website with a picture of crossed fingers, Kashkari said he strongly disagreed with the rosy picture Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co., painted Tuesday in his annual letter to shareholders. Their back-and-forth encapsulated the fundamental debate taking shape in Congress and the Trump administration over how to remake Obama-era banking regulations. Bank stocks are about 20 percent higher today than just before Election Day as investors speculated the new president would significantly reduce rules and costs on the industry. Dimon's missive often generates news for its breadth — 46 pages this year — and his views on the political and economic situations around the world. This year, many news accounts of the letter zeroed in on Dimon's argument that megabanks like JPMorgan Chase have boosted capital, liquidity and risk controls and, in the event of a crisis, could be wound down without getting a bailout from taxpayers. That risk is often called "too big to fail," referring to the notion that megabanks are so important to the U.S. and global economies, that governments and taxpayers can't let them die. "Essentially, Too Big to Fail has been solved — taxpayers will not pay if a bank fails," Dimon wrote. He added now is a good time for the U.S. to rework regulations put on banks, principally from the Dodd-Frank law, in the wake of the 2008 bank-led economic collapse. Kashkari, who as a Treasury Department official in 2008 oversaw the U.S. government's bailout of giant banks, has argued for years that the "too- big-to-fail" risk still exists. Last year, his first year at the Minneapolis Fed, he led a yearlong review involving economists and bankers from around the country that ended with a legislative proposal calling for giant banks to raise more equity and take other steps to diminish the risk to taxpayers in a crisis. In his essay, Kashkari said Dimon's argument relies on an unrealistic assumption — one that didn't work in 2008 — that holders of bonds issued by giant banking companies will bear their risk in a crisis. "It sounds like an ideal solution," Kashkari wrote. "The problem is that it almost never actually works in real life." Again and again, governments dealing with banking crises have not imposed losses on bank bondholders because of the likelihood that bondholders at other, similar banks will fear similar losses and cash them in. "Only true equity should be considered loss-absorbing in a crisis," Kashkari said. The Minneapolis Fed chief wrote that he agreed with Dimon that regulatory complexity in the banking industry needed to be reduced. After large banks have been required to raise more equity, Kashkari said, "I believe we can streamline other regulations, especially on small banks that have been severely burdened with regulation but do not pose a systemic risk to society." evan.ramstad@startribune.com 612-673-4241 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon during a September interview in Washington. (Molly Riley/AFP/Getty Images) By Allan Sloan By Allan Sloan Columnist April 7 at 5:54 PM In his provocative shareholder letter, JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon writes that long-term thinking is vital. “Making important investments, in good times and not so good times,” has been key to Chase’s success, he writes. “These investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow and prosper for decades.” That letter prompted me to look at one of my musty old files, containing the history of how a tiny investment I made in a Detroit bank stock for journalistic reasons more than 40 years ago has morphed into JPMorgan shares. I suddenly realized that acting Dimonesque by reinvesting dividends rather than taking them in cash has helped produce a return of more than 100 to 1 on my ancient investment. That’s right. More than 100 to 1. The saga started Jan. 4, 1974, when I plunked down $40.50 to buy one share of National Detroit, which 30 years and three mergers later became part of Chase. National Detroit was one of the firms I covered during my days as a Detroit Free Press banking reporter. I bought my share — with my editor’s permission — so I could get shareholder documents (which were sometimes difficult to come by back then) and to make sure I could get into the bank’s annual shareholder meeting. When I left the Free Press in 1979, a combination of inertia and nostalgia led me to keep my National Detroit stock and my shares in three other Detroit banks. Neglect and sloth occasionally pay off. Over 43 years, several stock splits and three takeovers, my single National Detroit share has morphed into almost 45 shares of Chase that had a market value of about $3,860 when I did the math for this column. When you add the 25 years of cash dividends that I got from National Detroit and its successor, First National NBD of Chicago, it’s clear that the cash I’ve gotten plus the value of my Chase shares total over 100 times my investment. Part of the reason I’ve made such a large return is that the stock market and Detroit’s economy were depressed when I made my initial purchase in 1974. But a major reason for my high return is that for 18 years, I’ve gone the Dimon route and reinvested. That started in 1999, when Bank One bought First National NBD and offered me the option of reinvesting dividends rather than continuing to get four smallish checks a year that I had to remember to take to the bank. Reinvesting those dividends increased my Bank One stake from an initial 31 shares in 1999 to 34-plus shares by the time Chase bought Bank One in 2004. Reinvesting Chase dividends has increased my stake from an initial 32 shares to my current 44-plus. By my estimate, I’ve got 65 percent more Chase stock than I’d have if I’d taken my Bank One and Chase dividends in cash. It helps — a lot — that the stock market was very strong between 1974 and the time I became a Bank One shareholder 25 years later. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose by 1,208 percent in that period, which is a really nice gain. My National Detroit-First Chicago investment, though, had an even nicer gain. It rose about 2,700 percent, as best I can tell. I’ve also been fortunate since embarking on the dividend-reinvestment route 18 years ago. During that period, the value of my Bank One-then-Chase shares has risen 236 percent, compared with 156 percent for the S&P 500 and 184 percent for investor-class shares of Vanguard’s Total Stock Market fund. The S&P and Vanguard numbers include price increases and reinvested dividends, just as my Chase calculations do. The bottom line: Most CEO shareholder letters are so boring I can use them as a sleep aid. But Dimon’s made me think and even generated a column idea. Yet another bonus return on my investment all those years ago. business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

First of all, earnings season starts with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all reporting Thursday. Strategists have been praying that a super strong earnings season will make investors switch focus from Washington to corporate and economic fundamentals. There's also Fed speak, with an appearance by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Monday afternoon. Important economic data, such as consumer inflation, is also expected, with most of it landing on Good Friday when the stock market is closed. That will be especially important after March's surprisingly weak jobs report raised questions about the economy's pace of growth. Congress may be taking spring break, but Washington could still be the source of plenty of market-moving headlines. There are a bunch of things that will be important, including the aftermath of the U.S. attack on Syria and what really went on at President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Also, if there's a shakeup of the White House staff, as reported Friday, would that be a good or a bad thing? Best sales growth since 2011 First-quarter earnings growth is now expected at 10.1 percent, the best since 2014, but sales growth, a laggard in the financial recovery, is expected to jump by 7.5 percent, the best since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters. "Earnings will thankfully become the driver of stock prices in the next couple of weeks. I think that should be a positive for stocks," said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Several of the biggest U.S. banks kick off the earnings season Thursday, and S&P financial sector profits are expected to be up 15.3 percent with revenues, up 7.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. "That in the short term should be and will be the next big thing that helps boost stock prices," Arone said. "I think the good news is we'll be heading toward earnings season, which hopefully will dampen some of the geopolitical noise, and get us back to the fundamentals that drive stocks." Yellen as 'second semester senior' Fed Chair Yellen, just days after the Fed minutes rocked stocks, appears in a laid-back college setting Monday afternoon at the University of Michigan. Yellen will take questions and she could be asked about the Fed's plan to start paring back its balance sheet, which grew to $4.5 trillion due to the financial crisis. The Fed's comment on that, and also the fact some officials see stock prices as too high, rippled through markets Wednesday afternoon. At the 4:10 p.m. ET address, she could be asked to elaborate. The Fed was fuzzy on how it would reduce the holdings of Treasurys and mortgages but said it would like to start this year. "I think if there's some directed questions regarding policy, she might be a little more open. I think she's been more forthcoming in these open forums," said Joe Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "It seems like she's a second semester senior in some ways. There's a light at the end of the tunnel. She's being a little more charismatic, a little more open," he said. Song said if Yellen is asked about the balance sheet, she will likely respond with the type of comments already made by New York Fed President William Dudley. Dudley said the Fed may raise rates a couple more times and then pause as it takes action with the balance sheet. He said the markets could move on her comments but she is unlikely to say anything very substantially different. As for the economic data, the most important reports — retail sales and the consumer price index — are released Friday morning, when the stock market is closed but bond and other futures markets are open. Retail sales will be particularly important because of the sudden surprise slowdown in car sales in March. Excluding autos, sales are expected to be up 0.2 percent, but the headline number is expected to be down 0.1 percent. Consumer price index inflation is expected to be flat, but core is expected to rise 0.2 percent. Washington drama Congress is away for spring break, and the White House plans for the annual Easter egg roll on the day after Easter, but expect a lot of activity behind the scenes. Traders are hoping to hear more about what was discussed by Trump and Xi. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters Friday that Trump and Xi agreed to a 100-day plan to discuss trade. There also was some intrigue in Friday afternoon headlines about a possible shakeup among West Wing advisors. But the White House pushed back on reports that the president's advisor Steve Bannon and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus were being reassigned. The aftermath of the president's first significant military foray, the bombing of a Syrian air strip, will also be watched. Markets will also continue to be laser focused on any comments made from any quarter on the state of health care or tax reform, even if there is only minor movement. "All eyes will be on the big broad bucket that is Washington," said Arone.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Apr 7, 2017 at 10:44AM The history of JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) dates back almost to the founding of our nation. And, over more than two centuries, the institutions that would later combine to form the current banking giant have played prominent roles in the growth of the U.S. economy. Yet what's most important to current investors is the fact that JPMorgan Chase has managed to recover fully from the financial crisis in 2008 and jump to new all-time record heights. With prospects for a more favorable regulatory environment for banks, some believe JPMorgan Chase could climb even higher. A look at JPMorgan's stock history can shed some light on how the bank has handled similar opportunities in the past and what investors should look for going forward. Looking at JPMorgan Chase's stock history Over the past 50 years or so, JPMorgan Chase has gone through some major transformations, but the stock has moved generally in line with the health of the U.S. economy. Strong performance in the 1980s gave way to a brief disruption following the 1987 stock market crash. Then, the bank generally participated in the huge run-up in the economy during the 1990s, topping out at the turn of the millennium and then pulling back at the end of the tech boom and the resulting recession in 2000 through 2002. The most obvious formative event for JPMorgan Chase came in 2000, when J.P. Morgan & Co. merged with Chase Manhattan Bank. Yet that was only one of the many corporate combinations that have occurred during the bank's history. In 2004, JPMorgan Chase acquired Bank One in another key move that broadened the company's scope to include more exposure to the Midwest and Southern U.S. market. JPM data by YCharts. How JPMorgan dealt with the financial crisis JPMorgan's role in the financial crisis proved to be critical. The company acquired Bear Stearns in early 2008, in what proved to be just the opening salvo of problems that would lead to the near-collapse of the global financial system. Of potentially more importance was JPMorgan's move to acquire Washington Mutual later that year. Washington Mutual brought with it considerable exposure to the mortgage market, and many argue that without that acquisition, JPMorgan could have dramatically reduced the amount it eventually paid in legal settlements related to mortgage activities. Indeed, moves from CEO Jamie Dimon to reduce the bank's exposure to subprime and derivative risk were instrumental in ensuring that JPMorgan wouldn't get hit nearly to the same extent as many of its peers in the banking industry. CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. How JPMorgan boomed after the crisis In large part because of its positioning, JPMorgan quickly recovered from the financial crisis and saw its stock jump to new highs. Assets that the bank purchased at rock-bottom prices during the recession in 2008 and following eventually regained their value, and that put JPMorgan on a trajectory to regain all of its lost ground just a few years later. Since then, all-time highs followed, and shares now trade at about four times their 2009 levels. One reason why investors can be optimistic about JPMorgan's prospects is that its leadership has its interests closely aligned with those of the company. Dimon currently owns about $600 million in JPMorgan stock, and he also has options that give him the right to acquire more shares in the future. Given the amount of leverage that JPMorgan uses in its business model, Dimon's holdings are a vote of confidence in the bank's ability to weather any future cyclical pressure and still emerge stronger than ever. Moreover, given the fact that JPMorgan shares pay a substantial dividend, shareholders have benefited not only from share-price appreciation but also from healthy streams of income as well. JPMorgan Chase has used smart business practices and its good reputation to drive its business growth. With conditions appearing likely to become more favorable for the banking industry in the future, investors can expect JPMorgan Chase stock to live up to its impressive history and provide more long-term gains for shareholders.

The analyst cited how internet stocks under his coverage are up 10 percent this year versus the S&P 500's 5 percent return through Wednesday. "We believe underlying trends in online advertising and eCommerce remain strong … Our favorite names remain FB and NFLX among large-caps and YELP and MTCH among smid-caps. As we think about the 1Q earnings setups, we are a bit more cautious on AMZN into print given the strong 14% rebound off mixed 4Q earnings & 1Q guide," he wrote. "AMZN will continue to gain meaningful share of overall eComm & retail—but we still think there is some near-term risk given significant share appreciation and many large-scale, concurrent investments across key areas," the note said.

But while most sectors are flying high, the retail sector may be unraveling. The U.S. economy added another 98,000 jobs on the month, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.5 percent. But while the professional business services sector added 56,000 jobs, factories increased payrolls by 11,000 and construction payrolls increased by 6,000, the retail sector shed 30,000 jobs on the month. In February, the retail sector cut 31,000 jobs. The two-month drop of 61,000 total retail jobs represents the worst two-month stretch for retailers since 2009. A number of observers took to Twitter to put the weak retail numbers into perspective. Bloomberg Intelligence economist Michael McDonough tweeted the graph below of the transition in the retail space from brick-and-mortar stores to online retail.

Source: Ullstein Bild via Getty Images No CEO is showering money on Wall Street like Jeffrey Immelt. And no Wall Street CEO is catching more of it than Jamie Dimon.  The century-old connection between General Electric Co. and what is now JPMorgan Chase & Co., which dates back to the days of Thomas Edison, has become one of the most lucrative relationships in corporate America. Over the past five years, Immelt’s GE has paid Dimon’s JPMorgan $167 million in merger and acquisition fees, as GE jettisoned lending units to revive the parent company following the financial crisis.  The question now is whether the good times are ending as GE’s restructuring is nearly complete and its pool of capital available for deals is shrinking. “The major pieces have been taken care of at this point,” said Jeff Windau, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. “That was kind of an extraordinary period of time for them.” If Wall Street is happy with all the dealmaking, investors are less so. While GE’s shares jumped 23 percent in 2015, they stalled last year, gaining just 1.4 percent to trail the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and were down 5.3 percent this year through Thursday. The lackluster performance has triggered increasing pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management to cut costs to boost the stock. JPMorgan’s leading deal role shows once again the value of relationships on Wall Street -- in this case, really old relationships. In 1892, John Pierpont Morgan’s Drexel Morgan & Co., a predecessor to today’s bank, helped form GE by arranging the merger of Edison’s company and a rival business. In the modern era, JPMorgan’s GE business was taken up by the bank’s legendary deal adviser Jimmy Lee, who advised on transactions ranging from the company’s sale of NBC in 2009 to its sweeping exit from finance. Lee died unexpectedly in 2015 at the age of 62. JPMorgan’s fees since 2012 were twice as much as runner-up Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s $83 million, according to an analysis for Bloomberg by consultant Freeman & Co. But Goldman Sachs’s fortunes may be turning. It’s got the most potential fees from GE in the pipeline, at about $40 million, Freeman said. $1.6 Billion on Fees As a longtime serial dealmaker and bond issuer, GE has been a good friend to all of Wall Street, of course. Over the past five years, it’s spent $1.6 billion on fees for deals, bond sales and capital-markets advice, according to Freeman. And last year, on M&A advisory services alone, the manufacturing giant was the top corporate spender, shelling out $166 million to investment banks, exceeding Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable. “Everybody wants to do business with GE,” said Jeffrey Nassof, a director with Freeman’s consulting business. Amid rising deal-related costs, investment banks are increasingly focusing “on the big fee-paying clients rather than smaller firms. GE is obviously the biggest of the big, so everybody wants to focus on firms like that.” GE said in an emailed statement that “selectively engaging investment banking advisers has been critical” in recent years as GE tilted its operations toward industrial manufacturing. A JPMorgan representative declined to comment. GE’s dealmaking ramped up to an unprecedented pace in 2015 with Chief Executive Officer Immelt’s strategy to sell consumer businesses and the portions of GE Capital that didn’t directly support its industrial divisions. The narrowed focus would be on making gas turbines, oil-drilling equipment, ultrasound machines and jet engines. Over that period, GE also closed its largest-ever acquisition, in a $10 billion deal for Alstom SA’s energy operations, and agreed to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc. GE Capital Effort JPMorgan was tasked with overseeing the GE Capital effort, which included dozens of separate deals covering about $200 billion of assets. Among the larger transactions, GE sold a private-equity lending unit to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $12 billion and a health-care finance business to Capital One Financial Corp. for about $9 billion. The GE Capital plan reached its unofficial conclusion last week when the company wrapped up the sale of its French consumer business, GE Money Bank, which included about $4.4 billion of assets.  The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up GE has showered some of its fees on smaller investment banking firms, especially Centerview Partners, a so-called boutique firm started in 2006 by veteran bankers Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan. Centerview worked with JPMorgan on the GE Capital sales and snagged a lead role on GE’s tie-up with Baker Hughes, which will create one of the industry’s largest oilfield equipment and servicing companies. Centerview Revenue Centerview has earned about $30 million in GE fee revenue since 2012, not counting the Baker Hughes deal, according to Freeman. Centerview didn’t respond to a request for comment. The good times for dealmaking may be ending, or at least slowing down, as GE’s new portfolio takes shape. Its bond sales -- and the fees those bring -- are also tapering off. The company paid only $96 million in debt-related fees last year, the lowest amount in 15 years, according to Freeman. Wall Street needn’t fret too much, though. A few more disposals are still possible, including Edison’s old light-bulb operation and an industrial-solutions unit. GE still has about $10 billion of unallocated capital for use on deals, share buybacks and the like, down from about $30 billion, including leverage, early last year. “They’re always going to be finding new areas that they think are important,” said David Ravenscraft, a University of North Carolina business professor who has taught M&A-focused executive education courses for GE. “There are some signs that there’s a slowdown, but they’re in it for the long haul.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Fink said growth was slowing in the US, largely due to concerns over whether US President Donald Trump can pass many of his reforms through Congress, according to Bloomberg. He also told CNBC that businesses and consumers are waiting to see whether Trump can deliver on deregulation and tax reform, after failure to repeal Obama's Affordable Care Act.

Fink said: "There is a greater worry that these proposed changes are going to be harder and harder to execute. You are seeing a slowing down of our economy." He added that without Trump's proposed reforms the US will suffer setbacks, especially as it was potentially one of the slowest-growing economies in Q1 among the G-7 nations, with Japan and Europe expanding faster than predicted six months ago.  Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, Dimon (pictured) used his 450-page annual letter to investors to highlight a number of problems with the US. These included the dumping of trillions of dollars in wars, piling large debts onto students and forcing a number of foreigners to leave after getting advanced degrees. William Blair's Singer: Market too euphoric about Trump's infrastructure policy Both Fink and Dimon, who are part of a group of business leaders that advises Trump, called for infrastructure investment and corporate tax reductions. Fink claimed the most crowded trade at the moment was the prediction of higher interest rates. However, he said there was a 51% chance that 10-year treasuries drop below 2%, according to Bloomberg.

Even JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is sounding the alarm. But it’s reasonable to ask whether, despite all its difficulties, the US is still the proverbial best house in a bad neighborhood.  Many other rich, industrialized nations are facing their own long-term dysfunction. Europe is politically paralyzed, and much of that region still suffers from high unemployment. If no one else has figured out how to beat sclerosis, maybe it’s inevitable? Maybe not. There is one large, developed country that has managed to mostly pull itself out of a long period of paralysis. That country is Japan. Much ink has been spilled about Japan’s seemingly endless dysfunction following the bursting of its real estate and stock-market bubbles in about 1990. Books such as “The Sun Also Sets” and “Dogs and Demons,” and economics papers like Takeo Hoshi and Anil Kashyap’s “Why Did Japan Stop Growing?” recount the story of how the dynamo of the 1980s turned into the sick man of Asia during the 1990s.  But although many outside the country seem to think that it’s mired in an eternal “lost decade,” this perception is now out of date. Yes, Japan’s economy has a number of long-term structural problems, most significantly its aging, shrinking population. But in most areas, Japan has overcome its bout of sclerosis, and in many ways is looking healthier than any other major economy. In terms of gross domestic product, Japan is doing fine. Many people focus on the total GDP figure, or fail to account for inflation, both of which understate Japan’s performance. But the country’s real output per working-age population has outpaced the US’ since 2000, despite the fact that Japan’s working-age population has aged much more. But in Japan, practically everyone who wants a job has a job. But this understates the difference. A lot more of Japan’s population is in the labor force in the first place. Surprisingly, this is true for women as well as for men. Though women in Japan still haven’t won economic equality in the workplace, they now have jobs at higher rates than their American counterparts. One might think that Japanese companies are simply employing too many people, reducing profitability in the name of maintaining employment levels. There’s always a bit of this happening, but even so, Japanese companies have managed to improve profitability a lot. Despite a strong currency that tends to hurt export earnings, Japan’s corporations are seeing their earnings grow. Margins are higher than they’ve been since the Great Recession. These are the economic stats, but Japan has improved on many social indicators as well. Fertility, once among the lowest in developed countries, and though still well below the replacement rate of 2.1, has begun to inch up. Japan’s violent crime rate is still legendarily low. And while the country is famed for having a high suicide rate, that has also come down substantially, falling by almost a third during the past decade. So Japan looks like a society that is healthy not just economically, but culturally and socially as well. How did it accomplish this feat, when it was mired in stagnation for so long? And why has it done better than most of the other rich countries? One factor is good leadership. After years of trying to deny problems like unproductive workplaces and pervasive sexism, Japan elected leaders who were willing to confront these issues head-on. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, though a conservative, has pushed to support working women, with both rhetoric and real policy. He has also opened up the country a bit to immigration, especially of the high-skilled variety. Meanwhile, the bureaucracy has started pushing Japanese companies to be more profitable and improve their corporate governance. But companies themselves have also made these efforts with little prompting. Waves of consolidation have helped raise profitability in industries from autos to banking to electronics. Accounting scandals may be making the front pages, but these are probably a sign that greater transparency is coming to Japan Inc. In the end, Japan is shaking off its sclerosis simply because the country’s leaders recognized the need to do so. Instead of wasting energy on partisan political battles over health care or culture wars, as Americans have done, Japanese people targeted the real problems that were plaguing the economy and society. It took more than a decade for Japan to collectively realize that the old growth and social models weren’t working, but once the country’s businesses, politicians and households accepted that they were in a hole, they could start to dig themselves out. Just as Japan’s stagnation offered a warning decades ago, the Japanese revival now offers the hope that the US can do the same in the years to come. -- By Noah Smith Noah Smith is a Bloomberg View columnist. -- Ed.

And JPMorgan Jamie Dimon wrote in his annual investor letter “it is clear that something is wrong” with the nation. Fink and Dimon belong to a coterie of business leaders advising President Trump. Appearing on CNBC, Fink suggested consumers and businesses are waiting on tax reform and deregulation after the healthcare-reform debacle. “There’s a greater worry that these proposed changes are going to be harder and harder to execute,” Fink said. He added that the country may trail the other G-7 nations in first-quarter growth. Tax reform and deregulation are needed to protect the markets, he said. Dimon, meanwhile, pointed in his letter to how the U.S. “has dumped trillions of dollars into wars, piled huge debt onto students and forced legions of foreigners to leave after getting advanced degrees,” according to Bloomberg. The CEO argued for more infrastructure spending and for corporate tax cuts as ways to spur the economy.

Marquez sued a father and son from Hacienda Heights in March 2017, claiming they stole $2.3 million in tax refunds from him. (Photo by Gene Blevins/LA DailyNews) By Stephanie K. Baer, The Whittier Daily News Posted: 04/06/17, 5:00 PM PDT | Updated: 7 mins ago # Comments Professional Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez has sued a major U.S. bank and a father and son duo convicted of tax fraud, alleging they stole $2.3 million in tax refunds through fake bank accounts opened at one of the bank’s branches in Whittier, according to court documents. In the civil complaint filed March 24 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Marquez alleges agents at the Chase Bank, 13103 E. Philadelphia St., conspired with his former tax preparers to open fraudulent bank accounts they used to launder tax returns withheld from Marquez’s winnings from fights in the U.S. The complaint claims Adel Cotton and his son Heber Cotton, both of Hacienda Heights, forged a power of attorney from Marquez to open the accounts in which they deposited Marquez’s tax refund checks totaling $2,308,439. The Cottons filed returns for Marquez in 2013, claiming refunds of $898,057 for 2008 and $1,410,382 for 2012, according to the complaint. JP Morgan Chase & Co., Adel and Heber Cotton, and licensed notary Brian Lallement are listed as defendants in the case. “You can’t open an account in the United States unless you have positive proof of identity of a person,” said Alan J. Romero, Marquez’s attorney. “That didn’t happen here.” The complaint alleges the bank failed to comply with “mandatory statutory minimum requirements set forth by applicable California and federal law and/or regulations to prevent the use of (its) banking operations for the laundering of stolen tax refund monies.” The complaint also states that Marquez believes one or more Chase employees may have accepted bribes and violated other federal laws. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan declined to comment Friday. Marquez is a four-weight world champion boxer who has held seven world titles over the past 20 years. He is considered to be one of the greatest Mexican boxers of all time. According to the complaint, Marquez found out about the scheme in 2015 when his new accountant obtained his tax return records from the Internal Revenue Service. “We received a letter from the IRS indicating that they had paid the checks out,” said Noriel Zuazo, an accountant hired by Marquez in 2015. “(The checks) were deposited into an account that Mr. Marquez never authorized to open.” Both Cottons are currently serving sentences in federal prison for obtaining fraudulent tax refunds in a separate scheme that netted more than $2.6 million in bogus tax returns using stolen identities. They pleaded guilty in 2015 to one count each of conspiracy to defraud the federal government by filing at least 275 fraudulent income tax returns. Advertisement As in that case, the Cottons directed the IRS to mail Marquez’s refunds to addresses they controlled, according to the complaint. “Why the feds have not done anything, that’s certainly the $64,000 question,” Romero said. “It was really blatant.” A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment on the case. Marquez is seeking millions in damages on 17 causes of action, including misrepresentation, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and civil remedy for stolen property.

');//--> } Home Wealth Management Speaking Book Contact New Glass Steagall: Repeal & Replace for Dodd-Frank ? April 7, 2017 12:30pm by Barry Ritholtz One of the great misunderstandings about the financial crisis is the role that repealing the Glass-Steagall Act played. This is newly relevant, as there has been interest from White House economic adviser Gary Cohn in restoring the Depression-era legislation. President Donald Trump is said to want to keep his campaign promise to restore Glass-Steagall as well. As someone who (literally) wrote a book on the subject, it’s a good time to revisit the actual impact of the repeal, and what its resurrection might mean to banks, investors, Wall Street and taxpayers. We begin by recounting why we had Glass-Steagall in the first place: the 1933 legislation divided banking into Main Street and Wall Street. Perhaps the best illustration of this is J.P. Morgan & Co. When the house of Morgan was split in two, one part became JP Morgan, a commercial bank (today it’s known as JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Morgan Stanley, a brokerage firm. The Main Street half of banking handled lower-risk activity, accepting deposits held in savings and checking accounts, while making personal and commercial loans and mortgages. The deposits in these institutions are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which ultimately is guaranteed by taxpayers. This backstop effectively ended the tendency of banks to collapse amid panicked deposit runs spurred by bad news, either real of fake. Wall Street is the more speculative side of banking — it uses capital for trading, underwriting, mergers and acquisitions, investing, syndication, asset management and initial public offerings. These pools of capital (aka other people’s money) take on more risk, and in exchange potentially earn higher returns. As we saw in 1929 and again in 2008-09, there is the possibility of catastrophic loss, wiping out entire companies. Hence, Glass-Steagall was designed to act as a firebreak between Wall Street and its appetite for risk and Main Street and its demand for safety. The 1987 stock-market crash, before Glass-Steagall was gutted, is a perfect example of how a crisis on Wall Street was isolated from Main Street.

"I've got to tell you, I have been watching this stock like a hawk," the "Mad Money" host said. "I am telling you it's bottomed. You've got a new CEO. KO is a buy, buy, buy. And I know that I am alone on that and I don't care." With the market unexpectedly maintaining its strength in light of U.S. airstrikes in Syria, President Donald Trump's tense meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and a weak jobs report, Cramer nodded to the economic and corporate news he is keeping an eye on next week. On Monday, the bulls will be itching to see oil break out of its $47 to $52 range into the $53 to $54 area, and would also do well to see the 10-year Treasury's rates rise from 2.3 percent up to 2.4 or 2.5 percent. Cramer also expects some takeover action in the biotechnology, consumer packaged goods, and oils sectors. Tuesday's Purchasing Managers' indices from China and the United Kingdom concern Cramer, because if China's is weak, leaders there could insist on stimulus via U.S. business involvement, and post-Brexit inflation in the United Kingdom could push the country's central bank to raise rates. Wednesday brings mortgage application data, which Cramer thinks "is going to be the most important number about what's going on right now in the economy." Airline Delta also reports earnings ahead of Wednesday's market open, and Cramer is worried about the effects of a slowdown in travel, though he does not expect any major bombshells. An analyst meeting at fertilizer company Mosaic could bring a strong story and some upgrades for the lagging agriculture play. "I would actually like to own the stock ahead of that meeting," Cramer said. A flurry of earnings reports on Thursday includes JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, and Cramer is paying attention to net interest margins, or the "free money" banks make from deposits, loan growth, which he hopes has not slowed from the first quarter, and expenses in the midst of regulatory rollbacks. Cramer is also watching smaller banks PNC and First Horizon, as the companies' Thursday earnings reports could reveal whether commercial construction has slowed due to recent impasses in Washington. If chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor's Thursday earnings report shows that $171 billion company is spending, Cramer says investors should pick up shares of Lam Research or Applied Materials, as they will be the direct beneficiaries of Taiwan Semiconductor's capital outflows. Getty Images Cramer compared two food-handling equipment companies to see if Welbilt, which has gained 40 percent since it was spun off by Manitowoc a year ago, held up against its competition. Its biggest competitor is John Bean Technologies Corporation, or JBT Corp, a massive player that not only deals in food technology but also airport equipment. While Welbilt's revenue has declined in recent years and its net margins have withered, JBT's revenue growth is accelerating year-to-year, despite slightly slacking margins. "Could JBT's strength be because its food equipment is better, is more the kind of stuff used by farmers and food processors, while Welbilt's focused on restaurants? Yeah, that's it," Cramer said. Restaurant chains are struggling, and Cramer said Welbilt is feeling the pressure as shuttering locations do not need new kitchen equipment. JBT, on the other hand, is tied to agriculture, which has seen a spending boost of late, and its other products like frozen food are consistently in demand. "I think it deserves a bigger premium and I'd be a buyer of JBT right here," Cramer said. Nick Carey | Reuters Bob Wyatt, who has driven more than 4 million miles over four decades for truck firm Schneider National, is pictured outside the company's headquarters in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Schneider National's Thursday IPO caught Cramer's eye as a cyclical trucking play poised to become a good gauge of the U.S. economy and this administration. Schneider is a large-scale transporter and that ships items all over North America via truck and rail. The company, which raised $550 million in its IPO, has benefited from e-commerce and its logistics business, which includes freight brokerage, supply chain, and import-export services. The company is growing its revenue and net income despite concerns about the effect of a order tax on imports on its business and heavy regulation at both the federal and state levels. "That's why Schneider National could end up being a major Trump stock," Cramer said. Cramer also interviewed Mike Tuchen, the CEO of software integration company Talend, to hear how the company is achieving its massive 100 percent growth. "Well, right now, the entire industry is moving to cloud and big data, so that part of our business is just exploding. Those two product lines are just like a freight train right now. And it's true for us, but it's really true industry-wide," Tuchen told Cramer on Friday. When asked how competition like Microsoft and Oracle is unable to tackle Talend, Tuchen acknowledged that it was in part because the smaller operator offers its customers better deals. "But if it were just that, then the competitors would just go and cut their price and be able to compete on a deal-for-deal basis. But it's the combination of simply being better technically at these new scenarios as well as, of course, being a better deal. That's why we're growing at 100 percent there and that's why our customers are coming to us," Tuchen said. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). A trifecta of bad news hit the market today, and one group of stocks — the semiconductor plays — rallied anyway, so Cramer tracked a signature pattern that boosts stocks even in troubled times. Despite negative reports of Syrian airstrikes, allegedly tense U.S.-China talks, and weaker-than-expected employment numbers, chipmakers' stocks, especially of those serving Apple devices, roared to new highs. "We call it 'the bid underneath,'" the "Mad Money" host said. "It's a key part of the amazing sector resilience that explains this market's ability to hang in there even on days like today with a lot of bad news. And frankly, I find the bid underneath in this market astonishing." In Cramer's lightning round, he sped through his take on a few caller favorite stocks: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.: "No, no. Please don't buy. I mean, on any lift I want you to sell because that's just a call option. You've got to look at the debt side. The debt side's really hideous. Even though they don't have a lot of debt coming to you right now, I am concerned." Toro Co.: "The weather better be good or Toro's going to be bad. That's why I prefer to stick with Home Depot, then I don't have to worry so much about the weather." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Baer, The Whittier Daily News Posted: 04/06/17, 5:00 PM PDT | Updated: 7 mins ago # Comments Professional Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez has sued a major U.S. bank and a father and son duo convicted of tax fraud, alleging they stole $2.3 million in tax refunds through fake bank accounts opened at one of the bank’s branches in Whittier, according to court documents. In the civil complaint filed March 24 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Marquez alleges agents at the Chase Bank, 13103 E. Philadelphia St., conspired with his former tax preparers to open fraudulent bank accounts they used to launder tax returns withheld from Marquez’s winnings from fights in the U.S. The complaint claims Adel Cotton and his son Heber Cotton, both of Hacienda Heights, forged a power of attorney from Marquez to open the accounts in which they deposited Marquez’s tax refund checks totaling $2,308,439. The Cottons filed returns for Marquez in 2013, claiming refunds of $898,057 for 2008 and $1,410,382 for 2012, according to the complaint. JP Morgan Chase & Co., Adel and Heber Cotton, and licensed notary Brian Lallement are listed as defendants in the case. “You can’t open an account in the United States unless you have positive proof of identity of a person,” said Alan J. Romero, Marquez’s attorney. “That didn’t happen here.” The complaint alleges the bank failed to comply with “mandatory statutory minimum requirements set forth by applicable California and federal law and/or regulations to prevent the use of (its) banking operations for the laundering of stolen tax refund monies.” The complaint also states that Marquez believes one or more Chase employees may have accepted bribes and violated other federal laws. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan declined to comment Friday. Marquez is a four-weight world champion boxer who has held seven world titles over the past 20 years. He is considered to be one of the greatest Mexican boxers of all time. According to the complaint, Marquez found out about the scheme in 2015 when his new accountant obtained his tax return records from the Internal Revenue Service. “We received a letter from the IRS indicating that they had paid the checks out,” said Noriel Zuazo, an accountant hired by Marquez in 2015. “(The checks) were deposited into an account that Mr. Marquez never authorized to open.” Both Cottons are currently serving sentences in federal prison for obtaining fraudulent tax refunds in a separate scheme that netted more than $2.6 million in bogus tax returns using stolen identities. They pleaded guilty in 2015 to one count each of conspiracy to defraud the federal government by filing at least 275 fraudulent income tax returns. Advertisement As in that case, the Cottons directed the IRS to mail Marquez’s refunds to addresses they controlled, according to the complaint. “Why the feds have not done anything, that’s certainly the $64,000 question,” Romero said. “It was really blatant.” A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment on the case. Marquez is seeking millions in damages on 17 causes of action, including misrepresentation, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and civil remedy for stolen property.

By Linda Burns Published in Commercial Real Estate April 4, 2017 3:44 pm In my corporate site location work, I continue to see evidence of labor shortages and strong competition for workers within several industries where Texas has historically excelled.  Specifically in healthcare, information technology, finance, aerospace manufacturing, electronics and components manufacturing. The gap for high demand middle-skill workers in these industries was substantiated in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s 2015 skills gap report, New Skills at Work, on global workforce readiness of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro. According to an analysis by the Manufacturing Institute, a non-profit advocacy group affiliated with the National Association of Manufacturers and Deloitte, 2 million U.S. manufacturing jobs will remain unfilled over the next decade due to a shortage of trained workers. The millennial generation, born between the late 1970’s and early 1990’s, is now the largest generation in the workplace and will represent nearly 75 percent by 2030, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Yet even with this level of representation, the unemployment rate for those ages 18 to 29 was 12.8 percent per the U.S. Department of Labor’s 2016 September report. The BLS said two-thirds of the high school graduates who enrolled in higher education in 2015, opted for four-year degrees versus community college or vocational tech schools. Four-year university degrees are still seen as the more viable path to higher paying jobs. The 12.8 percent unemployment rate was adjusted for those young people who have given up looking for work and moved back home with their parents due to unemployment or under-employment. As mentioned in a Forbes article, older generations remaining in the workplace longer due to economic needs, has meant younger workers are less likely to be promoted into roles held by incumbent workers. Millennials do not see a viable path to employment with one company as earlier generations have experienced. Baby boomers had limited experience, too, due to the economic downturns.  Having raised two millennials, I agree that we are responsible for the attitudes and mindsets from this generation growing up in a more abundant lifestyle with all those trophies and iconic gummy bears candy received for their just showing up at sport or talent competitions. Per another Forbes write-up, “They don’t need trophies but they want reinforcement.” In “All about Bob(bie): Strategies for Winning With your Employees”, and a follow up article, I gained some more insight into this younger generation.  Employers need to set clear expectations of opportunities for millennials to move up and make more money.  They work well in teams, a trend used in their undergraduate education, want real time feedback on their performance, and prefer a “coach” to a “boss.”  Because they grew up playing video and computer games and that’s how they also learned in school, “gamification” is an effective approach when it comes to training millennials.  Gamification involves any tool or software platform used for applying game mechanics to non-game contexts in order to boost engagement, motivate employees, and facilitate learning/training for successful end-results. While working a multi-state search for an international high-tech manufacturer to locate a plant this past year, I had the opportunity to learn more about another iconic German tradition, their globally recognized apprenticeship system model—now also being used in the United States.  Apprenticeships are a form of paid worker training that can lead to a nationally recognized credential for employment. In Germany, about half of the high school graduates opt for apprenticeships rather than college degrees because of the potential of almost certain employment at the respective company when completed.  Siemens was one of the first companies to utilize an apprenticeship program in the U.S. in a Charlotte factory, modeled after the German system. The company partnered with a local community college to offer vocational courses in combination with on-the-job training.  As a response to Kansas City employers needing access to an adequately trained workforce, the Midwest Center for Robotics and Automation Apprenticeship Program was established.  This program is a hybrid of the original German system, offering both online and in-the-lab training. Apprentices can learn skills required in advanced manufacturing and graduate with an associate’s degree combining disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and math.  The U.S. Department of Labor estimated that 87 percent of apprentices in the U.S. are employed after completing their training programs, earning an average of $50,000 annually or higher.   In many apprenticeship programs, apprentices can earn college credit for their coursework and on-the-job training. This credit can lead to an associate’s degree and, depending on the industry, may also contribute to a bachelor’s or master’s degree Although most of the apprenticeships in the U.S. are in skilled trades, like the construction or automobile industries, the concept is applicable to other occupations.  Medical doctors essentially participate in an apprenticeship structure through their internships and residencies for on-the-job training, combined with classroom learning. Expanding apprenticeships to other industries and marketing these opportunities to both unemployed and under-employed millennials could make a real difference in reducing unemployment.  Recruitment should be more reflective of the practice in Germany where a student decides on an apprenticeship in high school.   More apprenticeship initiatives are needed in Texas—both at the community college level and among employers.  An apprenticeship provides a young worker with an immediate job during training and an opening to sustainable long-term employment. A four-year degree is not the answer for everyone, as evidenced by the high unemployment rate. The German apprenticeship concept fits with how Millennials learn in terms of preference for a coach or mentorship type relationship, real time feedback, hands-on learning, opportunity for challenging work, experience with the internet, and clearly stated goals and due dates for earning certifications and degrees.  Employers should also factor in their desire for work-life balance by basing their performance evaluation on output rather than amount of time spent on a project to improve employee retention.  The average millennial changes jobs about every two years. Now back to those iconic German gummy bears—the gelatin-based candy.  There seems to still be some comfort derived from their consumption by millennials as evidenced by the German manufacturer Haribo’s TV commercial, where millennial executives are enjoying the candy in a boardroom.  (You can catch it on YouTube, too.)  For a daily fix, vitamin companies like Nature Made have adult gummy vitamins now, too. So, in closing, could training programs like Germany’s apprenticeship model help to reduce millennial unemployment and fill the high-demand skills gap? Based on my experience, first as an educator and science museum director while in graduate school at SMU, later as an economic development marketer and recruiter, and now as a corporate site location consultant, I strongly believe they play a critical role in skills training.  And, since no “participation trophies” are needed, perhaps gummy bears in the vending machines for rewards should be considered.

Chad Borton will become USAA Bank president May 15. Photo: Courtesy /courtesy USAA Bank taps Fifth Third Bancorp exec for president 1 / 1 Back to Gallery San Antonio’s USAA Bank has tapped Chad Borton, an executive at Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati, as president, the company announced Friday. Borton, who starts May 15, ran Fifth Third’s retail and business banking, digital banking, auto lending, consumer credit, collection, process improvement and business controls. “Chad has the right vision and expertise to lead USAA through one of the most exciting periods in banking,” said USAA CEO Stuart Parker in a press release. “He brings invaluable insights into changing consumer demands and emerging trends, having directed consumer banking in some of the nation’s largest financial institutions.” The move comes as USAA pairs back its branch network as its members increasingly bank online or through their mobile app. Borton, a former Army officer, previously worked for JPMorgan Chase & Co. where he was the head of branch administration, the chief financial officer of the consumer bank and head of its retail distribution network. He’ll report to USAA Chief Operating Officer Carl Liebert and will become a member of the USAA executive council, which manages the day-to-day operations of USAA’s companies. Borton replaces Jamie Warder, who left USAA Bank as president in November after 22 months in the position. A former U.S. Army officer, Borton said he has been a USAA member for 25 years. “USAA’s focus on innovation and its impeccable reputation position it for an exciting future,” he said in the release. He holds a bachelor’s degree in business economics and public policy from Indiana University and a master’s degree in business administration from Harvard Business School. The insurance and financial services giant last month reported a 27 percent drop in earnings to $1.8 billion last year, its smallest profit since the Great Recession. The company’s members filed a record number of claims following last year’s hail storms. The company serves current and former members of the military and their families. dhendricks@express-news.net Weekend Guide 17 things to see and do this weekend in S.A.

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  +  seven  =  12 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Gary Cohn at the World Economic Forum in Davos, January 2015 In a private meeting with lawmakers yesterday (April 5), Trump's economic advisor Gary Cohn said he supported a policy that could radically reshape Wall Street. You see, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) exec now supports a re-imposition of the Glass-Steagall Act – an idea that the U.S.' two main political parties support — but that the country's top banks loathe. This is a change of heart for Cohn. In February, the investment banker voiced his disdain for bank regulation measures when he said it was time to "attack the red tape of Dodd-Frank" in a FOX Business interview. Dodd-Frank is a less onerous regulation than Glass-Steagall. Bank stocks soared as investors considered the prospect of billions of dollars flowing back into their pockets. In fact, Goldman Sachs saw a jump of 1.29%. However, now the White House National Economic Council director is calling for more bank regulation… What Is Glass-Steagall? The Glass-Steagall Act is the Depression-era law that kept brick-and-mortar lending separate from investment banking for more than six decades. In other words, regular banks – the ones most Americans use to store their money – had to be separate from the banks that performed investing duties like security underwriting and trading. In theory, this kept big banks from gambling with your money. "Glass-Steagall became the law of the land on the heels of 5,000 banks failing between 1929 and 1933," said Money Morning Capital Wave Strategist – and Wall Street expert — Shah Gilani to Members in December. "Those failures hit depositors with more than $400 million in losses." Don't Miss: This investing strategy has delivered 217 double- and triple-digit peak-gain winners since 2011. And you can get access for just pennies a day. Learn more… However, the law was repealed in 1999 under former president Bill Clinton. Banks such as Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C), Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) gobbled up rivals and expanded into new businesses, becoming "one-stop-shopping financial behemoths," wrote Bloomberg on April 6. Now, Trump and members of his team – including Cohn – are aiming to bring the act back… Some Banks Will Fail, Others Will Flourish Dismantling the nation's banking giants isn't a partisan issue, which is one reason why Wall Street fears the idea could gain traction. You see, prior to Glass-Steagall, banks were "totally free" to traffic in securities, said Shah. However, Shah pointed out that Wall Street had a "culture of recklessness, cronyism, and fraud in the use of depositor funds and in the promotion of securities for sale to the public" before the act. Regardless, both political parties — and many voters — still resent that taxpayers had to rescue the industry with a $700 billion bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, according to Bloomberg. You see, advocates for bringing the law back claim that smaller banks could be allowed to fail without threatening the overall U.S. economy or needing expensive bailouts. However, Wall Street execs who are against Glass-Steagall counter that it would make U.S. lending less competitive with overseas mega-banks. Indeed, bringing the law back would have consequences for banks, both large and small… "A separation of investment and commercial banking would have a potentially bigger impact on global firms that have a big consumer banking unit," Brian Gardner, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods said in a research note on April 6. In fact, Goldman Sachs – Cohn's former employer of over 20 years – is an example of a firm that doesn't do much consumer lending while its peers, such as JPMorgan Chase, would be forced to make more dramatic changes. "What Trump said on the campaign trail versus what he's saying now – and what his cabinet picks are likely telling him – will have a huge impact on how this goal is achieved, and what – if any – upside there is for investors," said Shah to members in December. In fact, Shah outlined his own five-step plan – one that included reintroducing Glass-Steagall – for Money Morning Members. Here's how Trump can deregulate the banks without crashing the economy and shocking Wall Street… Follow Money Morning on Twitter @moneymorning, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Join the conversation.

America will never be great again with the federal tax based on production (income, savings and investment). America's Big Solution is the FAIRtax bill HR 25 / S 18. The FAIRtax moves the tax base from production to consumption with one simple progressive sales/consumption tax system with only one tax break, called the Prebate, that helps most the impoverished and lower income. With companion legislation the FAIRtax will renew our lost Freedom, Liberty and Civil Rights with the repeal of the 16th Amendment that enables direct taxation. Learn more and join the real/true tax reform cause at bigsolution.org and #FAIRtax Reply Myron Martin | April 7, 2017 Curbing big banks ability to gamble with their depositors money is certainly a small step in the right direction, but the bigger challenge is repealing the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that allows a private banking cartel to create counterfeit money as DEBT and collect interest in perpetuity. It is high time the bankers deceptive propaganda that they make their money on the "SPREAD" between interest on deposits, (almost nothing to-day) and what they charge on loans was exposed. This MYTH is still widely believed by the general public, i.e. that bankers maintain a 10% "RESERVE" and loan out the other 90% at the higher rate. That is a complete FICTION! Canada's original Central Banker Graham Towers in sworn testimony before a Parliamentry Banking Committee in 1939 stated that "every bank loan is a new creation of money, and when it is paid back it ceases to exist" in other words banks do not loan out depositors money, they are simply the "RESERVES" against which they are allowed to "CREATE" 10 X the currency they have on deposit with simple key strokes on a computer or ledger entry, so this counterfeit money simple exists as a digital illusion not backed by REAL money which is gold and silver, hence fiat currency that has no intrinsic value since 1971 when Nixon took us off the gold standard. This Ponzi scheme of "fractional reserve" banking would collapse instantly if everyone walked into their bank to-morrow morning to withdraw the funds they have on deposit because there is not enough actual bills available for payment, it exists largely as DIGITAL numbers or ledger entries, the actual CASH is only a small fraction of the total currency in the system based on the theory that not everyone will want to withdraw their funds at once, hence "fractional reserve" so for further enlightenment I suggest you watch Mike Maloney's You Tube series on "The Hidden Secrets of Money" that will clarify for you the distinct difference between currency and money. Don't let yourself be brainwashed by baanker propagands, GET THE FACTS! Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply. Your email address will not be published.

One person ... more Photo: Elise Amendola /Associated Press As millennials ‘Venmo’ each other money, banks fight back with their own mobile apps 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Odds are, you’ve at least heard of Venmo, but there’s also a good chance you haven’t used the mobile app or anything else like it to send money to family or friends. But that’s likely to change over the next few years, as banks, payment companies and even the likes of Google and Facebook push so-called peer-to-peer, or p2p, payment systems — a medium of exchange with revolutionary potential. The apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other, and they even could make inroads at the cash register and with businesses that send refunds and other payments to their customers. These systems will get a boost later this year when a coalition of the nation’s biggest banks roll out Zelle, a mobile and online money-transfer network that will let any customer of nearly every U.S. bank send money to customers of any other bank using only a phone number or email address. Analysts say the bank-led system — and the related marketing push — should bring online and mobile peer-to-peer payments to a larger audience. Even competitors, notably the popular money transfer app Venmo, say the Zelle rollout could boost their fortunes by making digital-money transfers more mainstream. “We don’t see it as a winner-take-all scenario,” said Josh Criscoe, a spokesman for Venmo owner PayPal. “We welcome any effort to move folks to more digital payments and move toward the smartphone as the central point of financial life. The common enemy is cash.” Online and mobile peer-to-peer payment systems have grown rapidly over the last few years, and analysts expect that to continue. In a report published in March, finance industry research firm Aite Group estimated that Americans made about $147 billion in digital p2p transfers last year, up from $100 billion the year before. Those are big numbers, to be sure, but last year’s sum still only accounted for about 12 percent of the more than $1.2 trillion that Americans paid each other that year, mostly in cash. That means there’s still plenty of growth ahead, said Talie Baker, an analyst at Aite Group. In her report, she estimated that the volume of digital p2p payments will more than double by 2020, topping $316 billion. “Not that many consumers are using mobile payments yet,” Baker said, noting that though these payments are more common among young consumers in big coastal cities, they’re not so ubiquitous elsewhere. “I’m a Gen-X person and I live in Denver — I hadn’t heard of Venmo until 2015.” There are plenty of players in the p2p game. Square Inc., the payments company behind the tiny white credit card reader that plugs into a smartphone, has a p2p service of its own, Square Cash, which launched in 2013. Following the geometric theme, there’s also Circle, a Boston firm that started the same year and specializes in cross-border p2p transfers in dollars, euros and British pounds. Facebook and Google, too, allow users to send money to friends. Google has Google Wallet, which started as a mobile wallet app but became a p2p payment tool in 2015, and Facebook users have been able to send money through Facebook Messenger since 2015. Square, Google and Facebook don’t report the volume of payments made through their p2p systems, but Facebook in regulatory filings has said that only “a relatively small percentage” of its users have used the payments feature. Venmo is arguably the biggest name in peer-to-peer transfers. It even has the coveted status, like Google, Uber and a few others, of becoming a verb — as in “Venmo me.” Founded in 2009, the company was acquired in 2012 by payment services provider Braintree, which was acquired the following year by online payments giant PayPal — which offers p2p payments under its own name too. But the biggest players in the market are still the banks. Last year, Venmo users transferred $17.6 billion. That’s more than double the volume from 2015, but it’s also much less than the $28 billion transferred in 2016 through QuickPay, JPMorgan Chase’s peer-to-peer payment system. And that’s just one bank. Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other major financial institutions have had their own p2p transfer programs for years, though it can sometimes be clunky for bank customers to send money to people with accounts at other financial institutions. Aite Group estimates that of all the digital p2p transfers Americans made last year, non-bank systems such as Venmo accounted for only about 17 percent of that. Banks accounted for the rest, though much of that likely was made through banks’ websites, not mobile apps, and much of it was money transferred between customers of the same bank. In part, that’s a statement about who uses different systems, and what they are used for. Venmo and other non-bank systems are accessed about twice as often as bank systems, but for much smaller transactions, according to Aite Group. The average money transfer on a non-bank system is $135; the average for bank systems is $1,359, according to the report. That might suggest that parents sending money to a student for college tuition, for instance, might be more likely to transfer money through a bank, while students are much more likely to split a restaurant bill or bar tab using Venmo. The payment app is also a social network in its own right, with users sending messages to friends when they transfer money — a feature Venmo pioneered. Those messages shed light on what’s behind each transaction and indicate that Venmo is most often used among friends over food and drink, said Criscoe, the Venmo spokesman. “Pizza is the No. 1 emoji on Venmo; beer is a close follow,” he said, adding that other messages suggest users are splitting bigger-ticket items too, such as rent. Though Venmo and other non-bank payment systems are still a small part of the p2p market, banks want to make sure they keep their place in the financial order and keep their customers. This summer, Early Warning, a company owned by some of the nation’s largest banks, will release Zelle, a payment system built to compete with Venmo and others — and, banks hope, to make digital p2p payments more mainstream. Along with the release, Early Warning will kick off a marketing campaign showing not only how Zelle works but how it might be used. Lou Anne Alexander, president of Early Warning’s payments group, said the focus will be on appealing to older consumers who might not have tried p2p payments. “We’re trying to take (p2p) from millennials to the mainstream—customers might use a product like this,” Alexander said. “That might be managing contributions to the high school marching band or it might be renting a home on the beach with friends or family.” Zelle traces it roots back to 2011, when Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase set out to build a system — initially called ClearXchange — that would allow their customers to send money to each other using only phone numbers and email addresses. Before, customers could only transfer money to friends and family by entering account and routing numbers — information customers often didn’t know and might be concerned about sharing. Zelle is essentially a souped-up, rebranded version of ClearXchange. It will be available to anyone with a U.S. bank account, and it aims to overcome some of the limitations and confusion around the ClearXchange system. Sarah Grotta of research and consulting firm Mercator Advisory Group said banks didn’t do a great job of explaining that ClearXchange would allow customers to send money to customers of other banks. Part of the problem, she said, was that every bank has its own name for its ClearXchange-powered p2p system, including Chase QuickPay, Wells Fargo SurePay and Capital One P2P Payments. “It wasn’t well-marketed that someone at Chase could pay someone at Bank of America because they had different marketing and different branding,” Grotta said. “You could pay someone at any financial institution, but people never realized that.” To address that problem, banks over the next few months will begin rebranding their p2p transfer systems to include Zelle in the name. Chase, for instance, will start calling its system “QuickPay with Zelle.” Customers of more than a dozen big banks — representing most U.S. account holders — will be able to transfer money through the banks’ mobile apps. For other banks and credit unions, customers will be able to do so through the Zelle mobile app, set to be released this summer. Once the system is running and the marketing campaign kicks off, Grotta expects Zelle to be a hit. “This is going to be a much better user experience than the banks had before,” she said. “I think it will start to catch on once people see that they can in fact send money to another person at another financial institution.” For banks, the stakes are high. Though Venmo and other money transfer apps are tiny by comparison, Baker said banks are rightfully worried about what might happen if their customers interact more often with outside payment companies. If a customer opens an outside p2p payment app once a day and their mobile banking app just once a week, the payment company has more opportunities to sell that customer on products and services the bank would otherwise provide, she said. “Once Venmo builds up a strong enough customer base, then it can say, ‘Hey, come get a credit card from us,’ or ‘Come get a home loan from us,’” Baker said. “That’s the approach some providers are hoping to take.” Banks see other advantages too. Mary Harman, an executive in Bank of America’s consumer payments division, said it’s expensive for banks to process checks and move cash around, so an increase in digital p2p payments could cut costs. She said banks also want to give customers the services and options they want. Some customers, she said, might prefer using Venmo; others might prefer the implied security of managing financial transactions exclusively through their bank. “We serve 65-million households in the U.S., and not everyone will act the same way,” Harman said. We have to recognize that and have different products available in different places.” Weekend Guide 17 things to see and do this weekend in S.A.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Apr 7, 2017 at 4:34PM The stock market closed on Friday narrowly mixed, with major market benchmarks barely budging in either direction as investors tried to navigate through conflicting news items. On one hand, rising geopolitical risk globally became much more apparent after the U.S. military launched a barrage of missiles at a Syrian air base overnight in response to chemical weapons attacks on Syrian civilians earlier in the week. One the other, some view the event as one that could finally push the Trump administration out of its malaise, and give it more political muscle to advance its domestic economic agenda. Despite a lack of conviction in the market at large, some stocks posted sharp gains on Friday, and Diana Shipping (NYSE:DSX), Akorn (NASDAQ:AKRX), and Granite Construction (NYSE:GVA) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well. Diana gets an upgrade Diana Shipping climbed about 12% after getting positive comments from analysts at JPMorgan. The financial giant boosted its rating on the shipping stock from neutral to overweight, citing more favorable conditions in the dry bulk shipping industry that could bring it greater stability and better growth prospects. Diana and its peers have been quite volatile recently, with many investors hoping for a bounce even as global economic conditions have remained somewhat uncertain. But if JPMorgan is right, then a greater level of confidence in the shipping industry could lead to further gains not just for Diana Shipping, but for the entire cohort of shipping stocks. Image source: Diana Shipping. Akorn climbs on takeover speculation Akorn jumped 18% in the wake of reports that the generic drugmaker might become a takeover target. Speculation swirled that it might get a bid from German health care giant Fresenius (NYSE:FMS), which has recently sought to expand its global network through acquisitions. Already, Fresenius has made some strategic purchases within Europe, but a bid for Akorn would signal a more ambitious effort to expand across the Atlantic. Some of Akorn's operations would fit well with existing Fresenius business units, but at least for now, even the reports suggesting the merger as a possibility were cautious. It's entirely possible that nothing will ever come from the talks, other than a brief pop in the stock. Granite gets a win Finally, Granite Construction rose 8.7%. The construction company got a couple of pieces of good news today, with an upgrade from analysts at Goldman Sachs from neutral to buy setting a positive tone for the stock. Meanwhile, the more important news fundamentally was that an infrastructure spending bill in California passed its legislature, opening the door to more than $50 billion in spending over the next decade. Granite is in a position to take advantage of that money, especially given that the company already gets almost a tenth of its revenue from the California Department of Transportation. With prospects for further gains if the federal government passes an nationwide infrastructure initiative, investors are excited about Granite's prospects.

Related News/Archive Trigaux: Can Florida go from good to great? Look beyond economy, says U.S. News' review of states 1 Month Ago Trigaux: The decline in homeownership in the Tampa Bay area needs to end quickly 7 Months Ago Trigaux: A peek at the plentiful paychecks of 25 Tampa Bay executives 2 Weeks Ago The stock market's rapid rise in recent months has stunned and delighted investors. Corporate profits are setting recent records, as are the stock prices of more than a few Tampa Bay area companies. Friday's March job report, less than stellar after boffo hiring numbers in January and February, may turn out to be a pause rather than a trend. Even so, the nation's unemployment rate still dropped to 4.5 percent, the lowest it has been in nearly ten years. Small business and consumer confidence? Both are knocking their charts out of the park. It's hardly a reach to say the economy is humming on almost all cylinders. Still, no economic era is perfect and this one certainly has some pernicious problems. It isn't every day that the CEO of the nation's biggest banking company, JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, states "The United States of America is truly an exceptional country" only to then warn: "it is clear that something is wrong." Dimon's comments appear in, yes, a 45-page letter to shareholders of the $2.5 trillion-asset bank, so he obviously has a lot to get off his chest. Here's just a piece of it: "Since the turn of the century, the U.S. has dumped trillions of dollars into wars, piled huge debt onto students, forced legions of foreigners to leave after getting advanced degrees, driven millions of Americans out of the workplace with felonies for sometimes minor offenses and hobbled the housing market with hastily crafted layers of rules." With a nod to Charles Dickens, it seems the country's enjoying the best and worst of times. So let's cut to the chase. Is this bullish economy just a warm-up to lasting growth and spreading prosperity? Or is this really more of a wishful economy, jumping ahead of reality in the hope President Donald Trump can indeed deliver on his promises of sharply lower taxes, smaller government, less regulation, better trade deals and a promised $1 trillion infrastructure investment? It's complicated, I know. So let's break down at least some of the major drivers of the current economy. Let's see what's making so many of us so confident. And, of course, what could go wrong? *** A hiccup in job gains but lowest jobless rate since 2007 Given its timeliness, it's easy to fixate on Friday's weaker jobs reports. For the month of March, only 98,000 jobs were added in the country. But job growth averaged 178,000 per month in the first quarter, testimony to a strong national labor market despite last month's stumble. Florida's jobless rate in February, the latest month that numbers are available, was flat at 5 percent. Uncharacteristically, the state lost 5,000 jobs that month, though it added 248,000 in the past year — second in size only to California's 315,800. Florida also lead the nation in construction jobs in the past year, adding 30,000. In Tampa Bay, February unemployment was 4.5 percent with 36,100 jobs added in the past year, making this metro area the third largest jobs machine over the past 12 months behind the Miami and Orlando metros. What could go wrong? With unemployment rates low, it will be harder to create new jobs and find the skilled people to fill those positions. That should put more pressure on wages since, to fill a new job, it will require luring more workers already employed to leave their current employment — presumably for better pay. One job sector that feels especially vulnerable to more cuts? Retail. Major chains are downsizing and many more — witness Payless ShoeSource this past week — are seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. At the same time, online shopping giant Amazon announced it will add more than 30,000 part-time jobs over the next year, including thousands of work-from-home jobs. It's not just retail that's ailing. In Tampa Bay, one veteran headhunter in the tech industry, says he's seeing a "steady stream" of layoffs and reorganizations among larger enterprises. Tech hiring at smaller firms and startups remains solid, says Fritz Eichelberger, CEO at the search firm Hotspaces.net. What's hurting tech? Eichelberger sees companies who are stalling on hires because of the current instability over health care coverage, because companies are thinning tech management ranks, because more IT jobs are being outsourced overseas, and because the recent rise of mergers and acquisitions has increased the likelihood of two tech departments becoming one. *** Against the odds, stocks and public confidence soar The three major U.S. indexes posted quarterly gains in the first quarter of at least 4.6 percent. The Nasdaq also recorded its best quarterly performance since 2013 as tech stocks rose more than 12 percent in the period. The S&P 500 is up about 11 percent since Nov. 8, Election Day. Small wonder that confidence is soaring. In Florida, consumer sentiment rose in March to the highest level in 15 years, according to the latest University of Florida consumer survey. "In general, the economic outlook is very positive, and the positive sentiment will aid the economy to expand even further," says Hector H. Sandoval, director of UF's Economic Analysis Program, Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner, a veteran observer of Florida's business scene, recently pointed to the very upbeat feedback his bank got in its first quarter small business survey. "The improvement in small business confidence furthers a string of gains in various confidence surveys since the presidential election, including corporate CEOs, manufacturers, service providers and homebuilders," says Vitner. The latest Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index, conducted in February, has risen 32 points since the presidential election and is now at its highest level since July 2007. What's driving such euphoria? For small business, it is the prospect that burdensome government regulations will be eased in the coming years of a Trump administration with a Republican-controlled Congress. What could go wrong? What consumers and small businesses wish for simply may not happen. The Federal Reserve is worried the market is overheated and could raise interest rates more quickly than expected to temper investing expectations and make the cost of borrowing money more expensive. The CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest investor with $5.1 trillion, also sounded an alarm over the US stock market. Commenting on CNBC, Larry Fink said the high stock prices did not match up with conditions in the economy and market. "If we don't see a true deregulation, I think the markets would have some setbacks there," he said. Fink also said the U.S. economy was slowing down and would probably grow by less than 1.5 percent, making it the slowest economy among the G-7 countries. One other warning flag: Cars. The were selling like hotcakes in 2016. Now they are getting tough to move, even with incentives. How bad is it? The number of unsold autos would last 3.16 months at the February sales rate. That's the highest inventory during any economic expansion in 28 years. *** Corporate profits are booming With the first quarter wrapped up in March, U.S. companies are poised to report their strongest quarterly earnings in years. That's good news on the job front and a better indicator that stock-market rally still has legs. Citing data from FactSet, analysts expect earnings for S&P 500 companies to grow by 9.1 percent overall in the first quarter from a year earlier That would mark the highest growth since the fourth quarter of 2011, according to the Wall Street Journal. The gung-ho outlook assumes Trump and Congress will deliver tax and regulation cuts. In the Tampa Bay area, such companies as Tech Data, Jabil, WellCare Health Plans, Publix, Raymond James Financial and BlueGrace Logistics are among the fast growing firms enjoying strong quarters and high stock prices. What could go wrong? A Trump administration failure to deliver pro-business changes. Stocks tied to infrastructure and tax reform already are stalling as the president struggles to press his agenda in Washington. Both North Korea and Syria could become serious problems, distracting the country from economic matters. Contact Robert Trigaux at rtrigaux@tampabay.com. Follow @venturetampabay.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 07, 2017 1:38pm   Comments Share: For years, interest rates and the Federal Reserve’s actions were a major focus in the financial sector. After the Fed’s March hike, its third one since the financial crisis, and recent comments from Fed governors hinting at two to three more increases this year, investors might have gained a little more clarity regarding the future of interest rates. With some of the uncertainty around interest rates out of the way, investors seemed to have shifted focus to potential policy changes like economic growth, bank deregulation, and tax reform. Q1 earnings expectations for the financial sector are high. According to FactSet Research, earnings are expected to grow at 14.8% year-over-year in the first quarter, the highest earnings growth projection across all eleven sectors. At the industry level, diversified financial services, capital markets, insurance, and banks are expected to report the highest earnings growth. In the next two weeks, several major financial institutions report earnings. Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) report before market open on April 13. According to consensus third-party analyst estimates, WFC is expected to report $0.96 earnings per share, or EPS, on revenue of $22.16 billion, JPM is expected to report $1.51 EPS on revenue of $24.57 billion, and C is expected to report $1.27 EPS on revenue of $17.97 billion. One area of focus when banks report is the impact of rising interest rates on these company’s net interest income—the difference between revenues generated by a bank’s assets and the expenses associated with paying its liabilities.     Later in the month Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is expected to report after market close on April 17 while Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) will report before market open on April 18. According to consensus analyst estimates, MS is expected to report $0.90 EPS on revenue of $9.10 billion, BAC is expected to report $0.35 EPS on revenue of $21.58 billion, and GS is expected to report $5.13 EPS on revenue of $8.37 billion. Many of these financial companies surged after the November elections, but they’ve started 2017 on a softer note (figure 1). Expected Rise in Interest Income After the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve and other central banks kept interest rates close to, and sometimes below, zero to help spur economic growth. Banks tend to benefit from a steeper yield curve since they generally borrow in the short-term at lower interest rates, and lend for the long-term at higher interest rates. Low interest rates have pressured profit margins at banks for many years, but interest rates have been slowly rising. Q1 financial sector earnings might show a better picture of how rising rates are hitting the bottom-line since the Fed’s last rate hike was at the end of Q4 2016. M&A, Investment Banking and Economic Growth The US economy has been growing faster than expected based on recent Commerce Department revisions to gross domestic product, a measure of the goods and services produced in an economy. Economic growth is generally considered a positive for financial companies since they provide services companies use like raising capital through debt and equity offerings, advisory services, and mergers and acquisitions. These activities tend to pick up when the economy is growing at a faster pace. The IPO market has slowed over the past several years, but underwriters could earn big fees if activity picks up.   Potential Impacts of Bank Deregulation President Trump has made several comments that he intends to lighten the regulatory burden on financial companies. Many analysts see the repeal of Dodd-Frank, the financial reform legislation passed in 2010 in response to the financial crisis of 2008, as an unlikely event—especially after efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act fell short. While an outright repeal might not be possible, there are still some areas analysts think could be tweaked: lowering capital requirements for banks, adjusting the way banks’ total leverage is calculated, or adjusting rules that limit proprietary trading at depository institutions. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods and Goldman Sachs analyzed some of these scenarios and estimated they could boost 2018 EPS estimates by an average of 1.8% to as high as 13.5% at some of the largest banks. Keep in mind these are hypothetical situations and there’s no way of knowing how regulations could change.  With financials close to recent highs, it might be a good idea to tread cautiously. If you’re bullish on financials, you can always wait for earnings to play out before looking for companies to invest in. Remember, you don’t have to be all in and you don’t have to be all out. Stick with a level of risk you’re comfortable with.  Posted-In: JJ Kinahan The Ticker TapeAnalyst Color Earnings Previews Federal Reserve Markets © 2017 Benzinga.com.

By Donna Borak WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- The Federal Reserve tapped Jerome Powell to be the new point man overseeing how Wall Street banks are regulated. Powell, who has been a governor on the board since 2012, was assigned to head the bank oversight committee, according to role changes posted on the Fed's website Friday. The announcement comes days after Daniel Tarullo, the central bank's regulatory czar stepped down after being in the position for the past eight years. Powell's appointment is unlikely to create a directional shift in the Fed's supervision of the largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. The former undersecretary of the Treasury for President George H. W. Bush, who was responsible for financial institution policy, among other areas, has largely shared Tarullo's views on financial regulation. One area of shared agreement is the so-called Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from proprietary trading, tucked in the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law. Powell has urged Congress to rewrite the rule, arguing that the litmus test of regulators asking, "Is it proprietary trading or something else?" only winds up adding "tremendous expense and burden," according to remarks he made in Chicago in January. Tarullo has also endorsed rethinking the rule, which he said was "too complicated," as part of a broader review of the 2010 law. President Trump has asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to conduct a review of current regulations to determine if certain policies can be changed or thrown out. As part of that, the administration is likely to scrutinize the merits of the Volcker Rule, along with others. Earlier this week, the president reiterated his campaign promise to dismantle the reform law. "We're going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank," said Trump at a town hall with CEOs, including Citigroup boss Michael Corbat. "We want strong restrictions. We want strong regulation, but not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs," Trump continued. It's unclear, however, how long Powell will have purview over the banking committee. With Tarullo's departure, Trump now has the chance to fill three vacancies on the board, including a vice chair of bank supervision, giving him the chance to appoint officials who will offer a lighter touch when it comes to supervising banks.

S. cruise missiles rained down on a Syrian airbase, following a policy shift by U. S. President Donald Trump. Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. 1/ TAKEN BY SURPRISE Investors piled into safe-haven assets after U.S. cruise missiles rained down on a Syrian airbase, following a policy shift by U.S. President Donald Trump. Analysts were quick to interpret the strike, in response to a chemical weapons attack blamed on Syria, as a signal to Russia and to other countries such as China, North Korea and Iran. Markets largely reversed course after U.S. officials said the airstrike was a "one-off". Friday's events have put investors on notice that geopolitics is likely to remain a major theme for markets this year. But they will also remain wary of assuming they know what Trump is thinking. * U.S. fires missiles at Assad airbase; Russia denounces aggression * China's Xi urges trade cooperation in first meeting with Trump 2/ BITTER DIVISION Turkey holds a referendum on April 17 on replacing the country's parliamentary system with an executive U.S.-style presidency for Tayyip Erdogan. The result still looks like a coin toss but is guaranteed to trigger major moves in the lira and Turkey's stock and bond markets whichever way it goes. The referendum has bitterly divided the country. Opponents fear increasing authoritarianism from Erdogan, a leader they see as bent on eroding modern Turkey's democracy and secular foundations, while his campaign, in which he and government ministers have dominated the airwaves with multiple speeches daily, has strongly played the nationalist card to woo voters at home and abroad. The lira has lost almost a quarter of its value over the last year and analysts are predicting another dive if Erdogan wins and a jump if he doesn't. * TAKE-A-LOOK-Turkey's referendum on boosting Erdogan's powers * Kurds 're-energise' independence plan for post-jihadist Iraq 3/ GOLDILOCKS IN EUROPE? JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will on Thursday kick-start a busy few weeks of corporate results and optimism is high. A synchronised uptick in profit forecasts as well as in GDP across every major market in the world is under way for the first time since 2010. Stock market valuations, running above historical averages, are already reflecting some of the upbeat sentiment so the bar for disappointments, particularly in the United States, is low. In Europe, the mood is even perkier thanks to relatively cheaper valuations, a definitive improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop and a still-accommodative central bank. * Earnings growth across major markets:http://tmsnrt.rs/2ogGqDz * Global growth forecasts:http://tmsnrt.rs/2nLr2ey * European ETF inflows jump in March, equities in demand: Blackrock iShares * Robotics ETF, anyone? Forms float trendy trackers in Europe 4/ HOT CROSS BUNDS What better place to keep money safe from potential geopolitical shocks than German debt? Germany sells its benchmark 10-year bonds, one of the world's most liquid financial instruments, in the coming week. But, after failed auctions of both two- and five-year debt in recent weeks, the auspices are not the best. Germany's 10-year borrowing costs have halved since mid-March as yields dropped from a 0.509 percent peak to 0.22 percent. While this would suggest buying interest, this is actually much more an adjustment in monetary policy expectations. Last month, all the talk was about how the European Central Bank was planning to "normalise" its monetary policy stance, aided and abetted by some fighting talk from Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann. But those expectations have cooled after recent signals from European policymakers and doubts over the "Trumpflation" trade. If the auction attracts fewer bids than the 3 billion euros on offer (and the small amount would tend to make this less likely) it would be the first failed auction of German 10-year bonds since September. * ECB's Draghi sees no need to deviate from stated policy path * Euro zone bond yields near lows as investors read monetary policy runes. * Euro zone government debt auction calendar 5/ CHINA RISING Whatever presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping had to say about trade at their first summit, growth in Chinese imports is expected to have remained strong in March.

Analysts were quick to interpret the strike, in response to a chemical weapons attack blamed on Syria, as a signal to Russia and to other countries such as China, North Korea and Iran. Markets largely reversed course after U.S. officials said the airstrike was a "one-off". Friday's events have put investors on notice that geopolitics is likely to remain a major theme for markets this year. But they will also remain wary of assuming they know what Trump is thinking. * U.S. fires missiles at Assad airbase; Russia denounces aggression * China's Xi urges trade cooperation in first meeting with Trump 2/ BITTER DIVISION Turkey holds a referendum on April 17 on replacing the country´s parliamentary system with an executive U.S.-style presidency for Tayyip Erdogan. The result still looks like a coin toss but is guaranteed to trigger major moves in the lira and Turkey´s stock and bond markets whichever way it goes. The referendum has bitterly divided the country. Opponents fear increasing authoritarianism from Erdogan, a leader they see as bent on eroding modern Turkey's democracy and secular foundations, while his campaign, in which he and government ministers have dominated the airwaves with multiple speeches daily, has strongly played the nationalist card to woo voters at home and abroad. The lira has lost almost a quarter of its value over the last year and analysts are predicting another dive if Erdogan wins and a jump if he doesn´t. * TAKE-A-LOOK-Turkey's referendum on boosting Erdogan's powers * Kurds 're-energise' independence plan for post-jihadist Iraq 3/ GOLDILOCKS IN EUROPE? JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will on Thursday kick-start a busy few weeks of corporate results and optimism is high. A synchronised uptick in profit forecasts as well as in GDP across every major market in the world is under way for the first time since 2010. Stock market valuations, running above historical averages, are already reflecting some of the upbeat sentiment so the bar for disappointments, particularly in the United States, is low. In Europe, the mood is even perkier thanks to relatively cheaper valuations, a definitive improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop and a still-accommodative central bank. * Earnings growth across major markets:http://tmsnrt.rs/2ogGqDz * Global growth forecasts:http://tmsnrt.rs/2nLr2ey * European ETF inflows jump in March, equities in demand: Blackrock iShares * Robotics ETF, anyone? Forms float trendy trackers in Europe 4/ HOT CROSS BUNDS What better place to keep money safe from potential geopolitical shocks than German debt? Germany sells its benchmark 10-year bonds, one of the world's most liquid financial instruments, in the coming week. But, after failed auctions of both two- and five-year debt in recent weeks, the auspices are not the best. Germany´s 10-year borrowing costs have halved since mid-March as yields dropped from a 0.509 percent peak to 0.22 percent. While this would suggest buying interest, this is actually much more an adjustment in monetary policy expectations. Last month, all the talk was about how the European Central Bank was planning to "normalise" its monetary policy stance, aided and abetted by some fighting talk from Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann. But those expectations have cooled after recent signals from European policymakers and doubts over the "Trumpflation" trade. If the auction attracts fewer bids than the 3 billion euros on offer (and the small amount would tend to make this less likely) it would be the first failed auction of German 10-year bonds since September. * ECB's Draghi sees no need to deviate from stated policy path * Euro zone bond yields near lows as investors read monetary policy runes. * Euro zone government debt auction calendar 5/ CHINA RISING Whatever presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping had to say about trade at their first summit, growth in Chinese imports is expected to have remained strong in March. Trade and inflation data are due in the coming week as part of a suite of indicators expected to show solid growth in the world's second largest economy. Inflation is expected to remain mild, with consumer prices up 1.0 percent year-on-year after slowing to 0.8 percent in the previous month. * China March data seen showing solid growth * China FX reserves stay above $3 trillion after small March rise * China data calendar (Reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan, Marc Jones, Vikram Subhedar and Nigel Stephenson; editing by John Stonestreet) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Powell, who has been a governor on the board since 2012, was assigned to head the bank oversight committee, according to role changes posted on the Fed’s website Friday. The announcement comes days after Daniel Tarullo, the central bank’s regulatory czar stepped down after being in the position for the past eight years. Powell’s appointment is unlikely to create a directional shift in the Fed’s supervision of the largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. The former undersecretary of the Treasury for President George H. W. Bush, who was responsible for financial institution policy, among other areas, has largely shared Tarullo’s views on financial regulation. One area of shared agreement is the so-called Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from proprietary trading, tucked in the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law. Powell has urged Congress to rewrite the rule, arguing that the litmus test of regulators asking, “Is it proprietary trading or something else?” only winds up adding “tremendous expense and burden,” according to remarks he made in Chicago in January. Tarullo has also endorsed rethinking the rule, which he said was “too complicated,” as part of a broader review of the 2010 law. President Trump has asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to conduct a review of current regulations to determine if certain policies can be changed or thrown out. As part of that, the administration is likely to scrutinize the merits of the Volcker Rule, along with others. Earlier this week, the president reiterated his campaign promise to dismantle the reform law. “We’re going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank,” said Trump at a town hall with CEOs, including Citigroup boss Michael Corbat. “We want strong restrictions. We want strong regulation, but not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs,” Trump continued. It’s unclear, however, how long Powell will have purview over the banking committee. With Tarullo’s departure, Trump now has the chance to fill three vacancies on the board, including a vice chair of bank supervision, giving him the chance to appoint officials who will offer a lighter touch when it comes to supervising banks. On Friday, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn told Bloomberg Television the president may be closing in on naming his Fed nominees. “I think you’re going to see some appointments come out in the Fed governorships in the near future,” said Cohn. “We’re very excited about those appointments. That will help us with a lot of the deregulation of the banks.” Ian Katz, a policy analyst with Capital Alpha Partners, told clients he still expects the president to name his own pick for Tarullo’s replacement, but if White House officials “can’t agree on someone for that spot, the president could eventually ask Powell to do it.” Despite Powell being nominated by former President Barack Obama, that wouldn’t be an unrealistic expectation given he was a Republican appointee in the Bush White House and a former partner at private equity firm Carlyle Group, wrote Katz.

WATCH: Double blow for SA debt as Fitch adds to S&P’s junk knock Rand steady as Syria strike shields currency from Fitch downgrade Fitch downgrade is no surprise - analysts BREAKING: Fitch downgrades SA to junk status S&P downgrades SA banks to junk status   Cape Town - The rand and dollar bonds fell after Fitch Ratings became the second company to cut the country’s credit assessment to junk, triggering sales by some investors tracking investment-grade debt indexes. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it would remove South Africa from gauges tracked by $59bn of funds. President Jacob Zuma plunged South Africa into a political crisis when he fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in a cabinet purge just after midnight on March 31, prompting a drop in the rand and triggering a downgrade to junk from S&P Global Ratings. The move by Fitch means the country’s foreign-currency debt will now be considered sub-investment grade, and brought the local-currency assessment to the cusp of junk. “Another downgrade in just one week is a major blow,” said Piotr Matys, an emerging-market strategist at Rabobank in London. “It means that even those foreign investors that are still relatively optimistic about the long-term outlook for South Africa may have to trim their exposure. In the coming weeks, we will probably witness a wave of capital outflows.” Fitch reduced the foreign-currency and local-currency ratings to BB+, the highest non-investment grade, from BBB-. The outlook is stable. That means another local-currency debt downgrade by S&P would plunge rand bonds into junk territory and see them removed from indexes including Citigroup’s World Government Bond Index. Debt indexes JPMorgan will cut South Africa from its investment-grade-only EMBIG indexes, which are tracked by $49bn of funds, on April 28, associate Nelson Chikusa said in an emailed note. It will also exclude the nation’s debt from its GBI-EM GD and ELMI+ investment-grade-only indexes tracked by $10bn of funds on 31 May, he said. Yields on the government’s benchmark dollar bonds due October 2028 rose eight basis points to 5.17%, widening the premium over US Treasuries by 16 basis points to 296 points. The rand declined as much as 0.6% before paring losses to trade down 0.2% to 13.7886 per dollar by 16:11 in Johannesburg, near its weakest since early January. The downgrade, especially of South Africa’s local-currency debt, is “substantially negative” for the rand, Razia Khan, head of Africa macro research at Standard Chartered Plc, said in an email. “For markets, this is meaningful, especially since S&P assigned a negative outlook to its own local-currency rating for South Africa, which is currently rated at the lowest rung of investment grade.” Rabobank’s Matys sees the rand dropping to 14.5 per dollar by the end of the quarter. “Looking from the mid- and long-term perspective, previous periods of weaker values proved an opportunity to increase exposure to South African assets,” he said. “But I think it’s way too early for that. The sell-off is not over.” Assets of state-owned companies also declined. The yield on Transnet SOC Ltd.’s $1bn of notes due 2022 rose 19 basis points to 5.28%, the highest since December 6. The rate on Eskom’s 2021 dollar debt increased 35 basis points to 5.84%. South Africa’s benchmark stock index dropped 0.5%.Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

The median surprise medical bill is $1,143. Kelli B. Grant | @kelligrant 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Even if you don't owe Uncle Sam, tax season might be unhealthy for your finances. "Extraordinary" medical payments are most common in March and April, according to a recent analysis from JPMorgan Chase Institute. The bank assessed anonymized account data from 25,000 Chase checking account customers between January 2013 and December 2015. (See charts below for some of the common bills, and consumers most likely to encounter them.) Medical payments were more common in months where families' income was higher. Researchers called out tax refunds as a key contributor: 16 percent of families with a large medical payment had received a tax refund within the three months prior. "Families may have delayed either medical treatment or payment of their medical bill until they were able to pay," the report said. There are other reasons you might face a big medical bill early in the year. Researchers pointed out that high bills during that time period could reflect policyholders paying off their plan deductible before coverage kicks in. But using tax refunds to cover medical bills or debts didn't necessarily improve families' bottom line. A year after an emergency medical payment, almost half of families still had depleted savings and a third still had elevated credit card debt. "Even with more money in their pocket from tax refunds, the strain of major and unexpected medical costs are hitting families hard and making it difficult for them to recover," Diana Farrell, president and chief executive officer of the JPMorgan Chase Institute, said in the press release. show chapters Boost your emergency savings    Wednesday, 5 Apr 2017 | 10:53 AM ET | 01:01 Wrangling emergency expenses Here are some resources from CNBC's personal finance team on precautions that can help you limit the impact of an emergency bill: 4 great ways to head off a financial shock Where to stash your emergency fund in a low-yield world Time to start an emergency fund How much should you actually save for emergencies?

Higher capital requirements would be on "the biggest banks, only the biggest banks" to guard against the "contagion risk" of a cascading collapse in the financial system, he said on "Squawk Box." He said he's talking about banks with "$250 billion in assets and up. That's about a dozen banks in America." "Those are the 'too big to fail' banks as we see it," he said. In a blog post Thursday, Kashkari argued that JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon recently made "demonstrably false" statements about the banking industry. Dimon, in his annual letter to shareholders this week, wrote "too big to fail" fears have been eradicated. He contended banks are well-capitalized enough to sustain shocks similar to what happened during the financial crisis. Kashkari disputed Dimon's comments, saying on CNBC: "This is nothing personal. ... Banks don't have nearly enough capital." "The biggest banks need about twice as much equity capital as they have today," he continued. "We could more or less address 'too big to fail.' We haven't done it yet." Addressing critics who argue that higher capital requirements would keep banks for lending and hurt the economy, Kashkari said, "This is about analyzing costs and benefits. "The benefits of higher capital are we avoid these disastrous financial crises," he said. "Safety isn't free." Kashkari said he'd be willing to accept a little less lending from the big banks because "the benefits outweigh the costs." At the same time, Kashkari would like to see smaller banks get a break. "We would want to relax regulations on small banks [and] on community banks because they're not systemically risky for the economy." In his 16 months at the Fed, Kashkari has consistently railed against the size of big Wall Street institutions. He was also the lone dissenter against a Fed interest rate hike in March. Kashkari, who unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for governor of California in 2014, served as the administrator of TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, at the Treasury Department during the financial crisis. After leaving Washington, he joined Pimco as a managing director and head of global equities. Before his time at Treasury, he was a vice president at Goldman Sachs.

In the past month, only 83 have published profit guidance of any variety, the least at this time of the year since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1999. The stretch of quietness comes as banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are set to release results next week. The silence adds to the air of mystery in U.S. equities, where valuations are high and volatility nonexistent as prices again lock themselves into a range after the four-month Trump bump. While tight lips contrast with the voluble optimism expressed in fourth-quarter conference calls, it may also betoken confidence. “The general rule of thumb is bad news gets announced early rather than good,” said Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer of Marketfield Asset Management. “The most obvious thing to assume is that nothing has significantly changed and the trend is improving earnings.” At the same time, the scarcity reflects a decade-long trend away from guidance that may reflect criticism about a short-term focus among executives. Still, the latest decline is the fastest on record. The number of firms speaking is down 35 percent from a year ago and trails an average of 150 at this time in the past five years. Coinciding with the quiet has been a stretch of market indecision. After reaching an all-time high on March 1, the S&P 500 Index has been confined to a 55-point band, alternating between gains and losses every week. The benchmark just posted the lowest realized volatility to start a year since 1965, data from Deutsche Bank AG showed. Bloomberg data shows firms forecasting that earnings will beat analyst estimates outpaced those predicting results that will fall short by a ratio of 2.1-to-1, the lowest reading in six years heading into any first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are sticking to their bullish calls, forecasting 9.7 growth in S&P 500 earnings for the March quarter and 12 percent for the full year. That’s a departure from the last two years, when growth estimates shriveled to zero as reporting season drew near. “Investors have been digging deeply into their hope chests in search of the catalyst that will propel stocks to new highs,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA in New York. “Not surprisingly, better-than-expected EPS guidance could offer some near-term optimism,” he said. “Maintaining a double-digit growth for 2017 should go a long way in bolstering confidence.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Kashkari disputes JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon's contention that "too big to fail" fears have been eradicated. Kashkari says he'd accept a little less lending from the big banks because "benefits outweigh the costs." Matthew J. Belvedere | @Matt_Belvedere 18 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Neel Kashkari: 'Nothing personal' but banks don't have nearly enough capital    19 Hours Ago | 01:03 Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told CNBC on Friday banks need "about twice as much" rainy-day capital to effectively address "too big to fail," which put U.S. taxpayers on the hook to bail out Wall Street firms during the 2008 financial crisis. Higher capital requirements would be on "the biggest banks, only the biggest banks" to guard against the "contagion risk" of a cascading collapse in the financial system, he said on "Squawk Box." He said he's talking about banks with "$250 billion in assets and up. That's about a dozen banks in America." "Those are the 'too big to fail' banks as we see it," he said. In a blog post Thursday, Kashkari argued that JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon recently made "demonstrably false" statements about the banking industry. Dimon, in his annual letter to shareholders this week, wrote "too big to fail" fears have been eradicated. He contended banks are well-capitalized enough to sustain shocks similar to what happened during the financial crisis. Kashkari disputed Dimon's comments, saying on CNBC: "This is nothing personal. ... Banks don't have nearly enough capital." "The biggest banks need about twice as much equity capital as they have today," he continued. "We could more or less address 'too big to fail.' We haven't done it yet." Addressing critics who argue that higher capital requirements would keep banks for lending and hurt the economy, Kashkari said, "This is about analyzing costs and benefits. "The benefits of higher capital are we avoid these disastrous financial crises," he said. "Safety isn't free." Kashkari said he'd be willing to accept a little less lending from the big banks because "the benefits outweigh the costs." show chapters Neel Kashkari: Need to relax regulations on small banks    19 Hours Ago | 01:03 At the same time, Kashkari would like to see smaller banks get a break. "We would want to relax regulations on small banks [and] on community banks because they're not systemically risky for the economy." In his 16 months at the Fed, Kashkari has consistently railed against the size of big Wall Street institutions. He was also the lone dissenter against a Fed interest rate hike in March. Kashkari, who unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for governor of California in 2014, served as the administrator of TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, at the Treasury Department during the financial crisis. After leaving Washington, he joined Pimco as a managing director and head of global equities. Before his time at Treasury, he was a vice president at Goldman Sachs.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now One of North Texas’ largest job imports this year, health-care giant McKesson, will formally open the doors to its new Irving campus Thursday with plans to bring nearly 1,000 jobs to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. San Francisco-based McKesson delivers pharmaceuticals, business services and medical supplies to hospitals, health-care systems and retail pharmacies across the country and around the world. It has more than 70,000 employees. One-third of pharmaceuticals used each day in North America are delivered by McKesson. A break room inside the new offices of McKesson in Irving. Ben Torres/Special Contributor The U.S. pharmaceutical distributor is one of the largest announced corporate moves to North Texas, along with other giants like State Farm with 8,000 workers, JP Morgan Chase with 6,000 workers and Toyota with 5,000 workers. McKesson’s new campus has capacity for about 2,400 people.   The nine biggest corporate moves in the works in North Texas McKesson already had approximately 900 employees at several different offices in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. With its new corporate office in Irving, McKesson pledged to add 975 new jobs and spend $157 million in capital investments. It’s been awarded a grant of $9.75 million in economic incentives from the Texas Enterprise Fund -- one of the largest grants awarded by the state since Toyota. The city of Irving is also providing more than $2 million in incentives to McKesson. The major corporate office will become the new home of the company’s U.S. Pharmaceuticals Group, which will move from San Francisco to Irving. It is the company’s largest business unit and biggest revenue driver. McKesson’s four major offices will now be in San Francisco, Dallas, Scottsdale and Atlanta. Chief executive officer John Hammergren said McKesson looked to Dallas-Fort Worth for expansion because of its large existing employee base, its reasonable cost of living and Texas’ business-friendly climate. He said its central location and time zone are a great fit for a pharmaceutical supply chain company.  He called the U.S. Pharmaceutical Group, which will be based in Irving, “the core of our business.” Hammergren said McKesson’s mission of boosting efficiency is especially relevant as healthcare companies look to cut costs and serve an aging U.S. population that demands more pharmaceuticals and medical care. McKesson bought the former NEC Corporation of America office on State Highway 114 in Las Colinas. The campus is made up of a five-story building and nine-story building, which are connected to one another. Its amenities include a large cafeteria, fitness center and a tech bar that’s modeled after the Apple store’s Genius Bar. The campus also has a museum-like display with models of a doctor’s office, pharmacy counter and hospital room to demonstrate how McKesson helps keep pharmaceuticals and supplies in stock. McKesson employees and construction workers prepare the company's Vision Center for the grand opening of the new McKesson offices in Irving,. The museum-like display is used to  educate clients and employees about company operations. Ben Torres/Special Contributor It is also home to a large conference center that will host training seminars and conferences of McKesson employees who fly in from around the country. On Wednesday, workers put the finishing touches on the new McKesson campus by mulching flowerbeds, rearranging furniture and hanging artwork on the walls. McKesson will host a grand opening Thursday that will be attended by company executives, Gov. Abbott, Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne and chamber of commerce members. The new campus has an open layout of cubicles and flexible meeting rooms of different sizes.  Ben Torres/Special Contributor The pharmaceutical distributor ranked fifth on the Fortune 500 list last year, but unlike its large corporate peers Walmart, Exxon Mobil and Apple, its name is lesser known. “There’s a famous saying, ‘McKesson is the largest company you’ve never heard,” said Mike Huaco, McKesson’s senior vice president of corporate real estate. McKesson bills itself as the oldest and largest healthcare company in the U.S. It was started in 1833 by John McKesson and Charles Olcott, who opened a drug import and wholesale business in Manhattan.

Zale Corp., a division of Signet Jewelers Ltd., is relocating its longtime Irving office to a new building in the Cypress Waters development north of LBJ Freeway. JPMorgan Chase is consolidating offices from throughout North Texas to a new campus in West Plano starting late this year. Lenders who hold the debt on the buildings that Chase and Zale are leaving behind are worried about potential mortgage defaults if the buildings sit empty. Chase plans to vacate two office buildings in the Vista Ridge area of Lewisville, leaving behind more than 480,000 square feet of space. Chase is the lone occupant in two buildings in the Lago Vista complex near Interstate 35E and State Highway 121. Its leases expire in November. Public debt servicers who hold $58.3 million in loans on the Lewisville buildings are keeping an eye on the property, say Wall Street analysts at Trepp LLC. The loans on the buildings are due in July, and it would be harder to obtain new financing if the property faces a vacancy. The loan servicer says the building owner is in talks with a mortgage company to rent the empty space when Chase leaves. Zale is moving its offices later this year from the 358,885-square-foot building at 901 W. Walnut Hill Lane in Irving. The jewelry retailer will relocate to a new 256,000-square-foot corporate campus near Belt Line Road and north of LBJ in Cypress Waters. The $38.5 million in public real estate debt on Zale's Irving headquarters has been sent to a special servicer. Real estate brokers with Dallas' E Smith Realty have been marketing the building for a new tenant. Zale's lease on the building runs through December 2018, according to Trepp. With major businesses building a handful of office campuses in Dallas-Fort Worth, they will leave behind millions of square feet of empty buildings when they move to new locations this year and in 2018. Investors who own the former headquarters will be hustling to find new tenants.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now With only two months to go before the grand opening, construction workers are in a race to finish the Legacy West Urban Village in Plano. "The Boeing sign is going to go right there," said Fehmi Karahan, developer of the $400 million mixed-use project, which just scored a new high-profile office tenant, Boeing's global services division. What Boeing taught D-FW 16 years ago helped land the jet giant this time The new division of the aerospace giant will move into the third floor of the building at Legacy Drive and the Dallas North Tollway later this year. While only a few dozen Boeing professionals will be housed in the offices, which are on top of a street of restaurants and storefronts, attracting a Fortune top 50 firm like Boeing just adds to the success of Legacy West. "The prestige of getting Boeing is just incredible," said Karahan, walking through the top floor office suite the company is renting. One side of the new office looks down the length of Legacy West's retail street. And a glass-fronted rotunda on the other side of the Boeing space has views of the tollway and Legacy business park. The $400 million Legacy West Urban Village opens in June. (Steve Brown/Staff) The first retailers are open in Legacy West. (Steve Brown/Staff) "When Boeing's executives were touring, I personally showed them around," said Karahan, whose hands-on involvement is as much responsible for the success of Legacy West as the project's location and design. "I told them all the great reasons to be here," Karahan said.  "What I hear over and over from all these companies is attracting talent is very important," he said. "But more important is retaining the talent. This gives you the best environment to do that with all these amenities." Karahan knows what he is talking about. Since announcing Legacy West in early 2014, he's signed up a platinum roster of businesses, including Toyota, FedEx, Liberty Mutual Insurance, JPMorgan Chase and now Boeing for the 250-acre project. Partnering with developers KDC and Columbus Realty, Karahan has built what is arguably one of the most successful real estate projects in North America. "It all happened so fast. And we are very close to getting it done," he said. The first smattering of retailers has already opened at Legacy West. And the grand opening of the urban village on the north side of Legacy Drive is scheduled for the first week in June. "We have already leased almost half of the apartments," Karahan said, before the buildings were even finished. Fidelity Investments, Marriott International and Toyota Connected — a high-tech division of the giant automaker — have moved into their office spaces in the same building Boeing will occupy. "Toyota Connected is already expanding their space by 15,000 square feet," Karahan said. By the end of this year, more than 15,000 people will work in the $3 billion Legacy West development where two years ago wildflowers filled a vacant field just south of State Highway 121. The 300-room, 15-story Renaissance Hotel will open this summer. But the construction will keep going. Just weeks from now, work will start on an apartment tower that will go up across the street from Liberty Mutual Insurance's new twin towers. A condo tower will open later this year. "The groundbreaking for the 29-story apartment tower is at the end of the month," Karahan said. "How many people would have the good fortune to do something like this? "It's great when you can do something you love." Boeing's new global services division will locate in the same building as Fidelity Investments at Legacy West.

By: Reuters | London | Published:April 7, 2017 3:38 pm Russian assets led emerging stocks and currencies lower on Friday as a U.S. missile strike in Syria spooked investors wary about risks of a clash with Russia, while emerging equities fell to three-week lows but still look to end the week in the black. MSCI’s benchmark emerging equities index was down 0.2 per cent, mirroring a broad sell-off in riskier assets after the United States fired 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base from which it said a deadly chemical weapons attack was carried out earlier this week. Russia said the missile strike broke international law and had seriously damaged U.S.-Russian relations. The rouble was down around one per cent against the dollar and Russian dollar-denominated stocks fell 2.4 per cent. The currency was also undermined by comments from the Russian economy minister suggesting the rouble could weaken in coming months. “The current price action makes sense,” said ING chief EMEA FX and rates strategist Petr Krpata. “The geopolitics in the region is not positive for the currency so what we see is a knee-jerk reaction. But unless these things are followed up and there is a further escalation, they do not usually last.” The average yield spread of Russian sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified widened out by 7 basis points (bps) to 167 bps. Russian 10-year bond yields also rose 10 basis points to 7.95 percent, bouncing off three-year lows. Russian five-year credit default swaps also rose 5 bps from Thursday’s close to 167 bps. Other emerging assets to feel the heat included the Turkish lira, which weakened 0.3 per cent, and Turkish stocks , which fell 0.2 per cent. Turkey lent its support to the U.S. missile strike. South African assets also remained under pressure following a ratings downgrade to junk amidst ongoing political turmoil. Thousands were expected to protest against President Jacob Zuma in major South African cities on Friday demanding that he resign. Zuma’s sacking of respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan outraged allies and opponents alike. Stocks fell 0.8 per cent and the rand was set to end the week down 2.3 per cent, although it steadied on Friday. Moody’s has pushed back a ratings review that was expected to happen later on Friday. Investors were also wary ahead of U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later today, as a strong number could bolster expectations of as many as three more Fed rate hikes this year. “We are not far from two hikes, but we need to get some really good data or some big moves from Trump on tax cuts for example for the market to start pricing in more Fed hikes again,” said Krpata. China’s yuan was a touch weaker against the dollar as U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping began their summit, at which trade and security issues are likely to feature heavily. China’s foreign exchange reserves rose slightly in March and remained above $3 trillion, as capital control measures and a pause in the dollar’s rally helped contain capital outflows. Trump is thought unlikely to formally declare China a currency manipulator next week. The Czech crown was steady at 26.62 per euro after jumping 1.7 percent on Thursday when the central bank removed the currency cap. Investors had bet heavily on the exit, prompting the central bank to buy an estimated 70 billion euros since 2013 to defend the cap, with more than half of that coming in the past three months. The 2020 and 2021 dollar-denominated bonds of Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA were trading up over 1 cent in the dollar after it started bank transfers to make its first April bond payments. Venezuela’s sovereign 2026 and 2038 issues were also up 1-1.7 cents.

Consumer Confidential With David Lazarus BUSINESS Consumer Confidential Column GOP lawmaker, pockets stuffed with bank cash, leads assault on consumer bureau Jeb Hensarling Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call,Inc. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is a top recipient of contributions from banks and financial firms. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is a top recipient of contributions from banks and financial firms. (Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call,Inc.) David LazarusContact Reporter Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, was trying to be funny. It’s the only explanation. Otherwise, we’re left to assume that Hensarling was being the world’s biggest corporate shill and hypocrite when he accused the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of “abusing his authority.” In a contentious hearing this week that bordered on outright abuse, Hensarling told CFPB Director Richard Cordray that “the president is clearly justified in dismissing you and I call upon the president – yet again – to do just that, and to do it immediately.” “American consumers need competitive markets and a cop on the beat to protect them from fraud and deception,” he snarled. “They don’t need Washington elites trampling on their freedom of choice and picking their financial products for them.” Make no mistake: Hensarling doesn’t give a damn about American consumers and he sure as hell isn’t pushing for a “cop on the beat” to keep banks in line. What he wants is to liberate his deep-pocketed corporate patrons from regulatory oversight that’s resulted in billions of dollars being reimbursed to customers. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Hensarling, 59, has been raking in cash from the financial sector since he was first elected to Congress in 2003. The top single donor to his campaign efforts over the years is JPMorgan Chase, which has contributed $106,686. The second-biggest donor is Bank of America, which has ponied up $86,250. Hensarling’s third-biggest donor is the rest of the banking industry in the form of the American Bankers Assn., which has given him $85,300. On an industry basis, he’s received $1.3 million from commercial banks, $1.4 million from securities and investment firms, $1.4 million from insurers and $703,304 from finance and credit companies. And this is a guy with consumers’ best financial interests at heart? “Jeb Hensarling has a long, long list of contributions from banks and Wall Street firms,” Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League, told me. “He and his committee have set their sights on the CFPB because the CFPB has been so successful at protecting consumers from being ripped off.” Since it opened for business in 2011, the bureau says it has recovered about $12 billion fleeced from consumers via illegal and questionable financial practices. It has overseen a revamping of mortgage rules, proposed new regulations for payday lenders and held dozens of firms accountable for fiscal misdeeds. I contacted the Financial Services Committee and said that a consumer advocate had suggested Hensarling might be influenced by his industry ties. I asked if they’d like to respond. Sarah Rozier, a committee spokeswoman, first wanted me to name the consumer advocate, although why that should matter was a mystery. All she had to do was say, no, Hensarling isn’t influenced by the millions of dollars he’s received from financial firms. So I passed along Greenberg’s name and, an hour later, Rozier sent an email dismissing Greenberg’s organization as “a liberal group backed by labor unions.” Instead of explicitly denying that Hensarling is influenced by the money he gets from financial firms, Rozier said that “Chairman Hensarling led the fight against the Wall Street bailout in Congress.” She also said that legislation proposed by Hensarling would impose “the toughest penalties in history for those who commit fraud and insider trading.” Um, OK. Hensarling and his Republican colleagues, in their first face-to-face encounter with Cordray since the November election, spent nearly five hours on Wednesday treating the CFPB chief like a pinata. The tone for the beat down was set early when Hensarling said he was surprised that Cordray had shown up, even though the CFPB director is required to do so twice a year when the House Financial Services Committee requests his presence, which it did. In his next breath, Hensarling told Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general, that he’d half-expected him to be in his home state running for governor, which he isn’t. “Perhaps the rumors of your political aspirations are greatly exaggerated,” Hensarling remarked. Republicans feel that Cordray has too much power and acts with impunity. They’re emboldened by a recent court ruling that declared the CFPB’s leadership structure unconstitutional. However, that decision will be revisited by the U.S. Court of Appeals. “This tyranny must end,” Hensarling declared at Wednesday’s hearing, reaching deep into his muddy bucket of hyperbole. He and other Republicans want to replace the bureau’s single director with a more easily influenced committee and want to control the CFPB’s budget, which of course would make it vulnerable to industry lobbying. After the Republicans had taken turns getting in their licks, frequently denying Cordray a chance to respond, Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) commented, "Boy, they really hate you, don't they?" Cordray replied that “it's part of the game." It’s not a game. If the CFPB were derelict in its mission of consumer protection, lawmakers would have every right to demand changes. But the bureau’s track record is one of unqualified success — much to the consternation of big-money banks and financial firms. “Chairman Hensarling is furious at the CFPB because it’s working, protecting consumers and holding banks and lenders accountable for their actions,” said Christine Hines, legislative director for the National Assn. of Consumer Advocates. “He’s made it clear that his leadership on the Financial Services Committee is strictly for the industry’s benefit,” she said. Of all House members running for reelection last year, Hensarling was the second-largest recipient of contributions from commercial banks ($274,900), topped only by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan ($344,399), the Center for Responsive Politics found. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) seemed to put his finger on things when he told Cordray that this week’s hearing was little more than political theater. “It's not really about any of this stuff,” he said. “It's about the CFPB diverting money to the pockets of working Americans and not financial interests.” You can take that to the bank.   Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The U.S. issued an airstrike in Syria, LACMA gets a $600-million makeover, Don Rickles dies at 90, and Coachella speculation begins.

Photos Videos Topics Live SL 131/10 (18) - BAN 176/9 (20) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kishori Amonkar Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Yogi Adityanath Arvind Kejriwal Home Money EMERGING MARKETS-Russian assets lead sell off, EM stocks at 3-week lows Shares1 Fri, 7 Apr 2017-03:04pm , Reuters Russian assets led emerging stocks and currencies lower on Friday as a U.S. missile strike in Syria spooked investors wary about risks of a clash with Russia, while emerging equities fell to three-week lows but still look to end the week in the black. MSCI's benchmark emerging equities index was down 0.2 percent, mirroring a broad sell-off in riskier assets after the United States fired 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base from which it said a deadly chemical weapons attack was carried out earlier this week. Russia said the missile strike broke international law and had seriously damaged U.S.-Russian relations. The rouble was down around one percent against the dollar and Russian dollar-denominated stocks fell 2.4 percent. The currency was also undermined by comments from the Russian economy minister suggesting the rouble could weaken in coming months. "The current price action makes sense," said ING chief EMEA FX and rates strategist Petr Krpata. "The geopolitics in the region is not positive for the currency so what we see is a knee-jerk reaction. But unless these things are followed up and there is a further escalation, they do not usually last." The average yield spread of Russian sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified widened out by 7 basis points (bps) to 167 bps. Russian 10-year bond yields also rose 10 basis points to 7.95 percent, bouncing off three-year lows. Russian five-year credit default swaps also rose 5 bps from Thursday's close to 167 bps. Other emerging assets to feel the heat included the Turkish lira, which weakened 0.3 percent, and Turkish stocks , which fell 0.2 percent. Turkey lent its support to the U.S. missile strike. South African assets also remained under pressure following a ratings downgrade to junk amidst ongoing political turmoil. Thousands were expected to protest against President Jacob Zuma in major South African cities on Friday demanding that he resign. Zuma's sacking of respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan outraged allies and opponents alike. Stocks fell 0.8 percent and the rand was set to end the week down 2.3 percent, although it steadied on Friday. Moody's has pushed back a ratings review that was expected to happen later on Friday. Investors were also wary ahead of U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later today, as a strong number could bolster expectations of as many as three more Fed rate hikes this year. "We are not far from two hikes, but we need to get some really good data or some big moves from Trump on tax cuts for example for the market to start pricing in more Fed hikes again," said Krpata. China's yuan was a touch weaker against the dollar as U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping began their summit, at which trade and security issues are likely to feature heavily. China's foreign exchange reserves rose slightly in March and remained above $3 trillion, as capital control measures and a pause in the dollar's rally helped contain capital outflows. Trump is thought unlikely to formally declare China a currency manipulator next week. The Czech crown was steady at 26.62 per euro after jumping 1.7 percent on Thursday when the central bank removed the currency cap. Investors had bet heavily on the exit, prompting the central bank to buy an estimated 70 billion euros since 2013 to defend the cap, with more than half of that coming in the past three months. The 2020 and 2021 dollar-denominated bonds of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA were trading up over 1 cent in the dollar after it started bank transfers to make its first April bond payments. Venezuela's sovereign 2026 and 2038 issues were also up 1-1.7 cents.

That at least is the opinion of City heavyweight JP Morgan Cazenove, which downgraded its rating for the stock on Friday. It went to ‘neutral’ from ‘overweight’ on the broadcaster following discussions with media buyers.  It values the shares, currently trading down 1% at 214p, at 233p each. JPMorgan acknowledged that the shift towards content (now 33% of group revenues) has lessened ITV’s reliance of advertising. Nevertheless, it is still a major share price driver, it adds. “Our latest discussions with media buyers indicate that UK advertising trends appear to have slightly worsened versus previous estimates – in particular in tetail advertising (with a 20% share ITV’s largest category),” the Anglo-US brokerage said. Worsening trends ... It expects ITV's net advertising revenue to decline 4.5% in the current year, compared with a 3% fall it had pencilled in before carrying out its market research, which means a knock-on 3% cut to earnings forecasts. “At this stage, we no longer see risk-reward as compelling anymore and hence downgrade,” JPMorgan said. It pointed out that following the recent bid supported rise in the share price, ITV is valued on a fairly full 13.6 times forward earnings. Of the 18 analysts logged by the Brokerforecasts site as following ITV, eight have ‘buy’ recommendations while the there’s only one ‘seller’. The remainder agree with JPMorgan that ITV shares are fully valued. The consensus share price target, which was 240p six months ago, has been pegged back 223p, reflecting the City’s caution over the maker of Doc Martin, Broadchurch and Prime Suspect’s fortunes.

MSCI's benchmark emerging equities index was down 0.2 percent, mirroring a broad sell-off in riskier assets after the United States fired 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base from which it said a deadly chemical weapons attack was carried out earlier this week. Russia said the missile strike broke international law and had seriously damaged U.S.-Russian relations. The rouble was down around one percent against the dollar and Russian dollar-denominated stocks fell 2.4 percent. The currency was also undermined by comments from the Russian economy minister suggesting the rouble could weaken in coming months. "The current price action makes sense," said ING chief EMEA FX and rates strategist Petr Krpata. "The geopolitics in the region is not positive for the currency so what we see is a knee-jerk reaction. But unless these things are followed up and there is a further escalation, they do not usually last." The average yield spread of Russian sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified widened out by 7 basis points (bps) to 167 bps. Russian 10-year bond yields also rose 10 basis points to 7.95 percent, bouncing off three-year lows. Russian five-year credit default swaps also rose 5 bps from Thursday's close to 167 bps. Other emerging assets to feel the heat included the Turkish lira, which weakened 0.3 percent, and Turkish stocks , which fell 0.2 percent. Turkey lent its support to the U.S. missile strike. South African assets also remained under pressure following a ratings downgrade to junk amidst ongoing political turmoil. Thousands were expected to protest against President Jacob Zuma in major South African cities on Friday demanding that he resign. Zuma's sacking of respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan outraged allies and opponents alike. Stocks fell 0.8 percent and the rand was set to end the week down 2.3 percent, although it steadied on Friday. Moody's has pushed back a ratings review that was expected to happen later on Friday. Investors were also wary ahead of U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later today, as a strong number could bolster expectations of as many as three more Fed rate hikes this year. "We are not far from two hikes, but we need to get some really good data or some big moves from Trump on tax cuts for example for the market to start pricing in more Fed hikes again," said Krpata. China's yuan was a touch weaker against the dollar as U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping began their summit, at which trade and security issues are likely to feature heavily. China's foreign exchange reserves rose slightly in March and remained above $3 trillion, as capital control measures and a pause in the dollar's rally helped contain capital outflows. Trump is thought unlikely to formally declare China a currency manipulator next week. The Czech crown was steady at 26.62 per euro after jumping 1.7 percent on Thursday when the central bank removed the currency cap. Investors had bet heavily on the exit, prompting the central bank to buy an estimated 70 billion euros since 2013 to defend the cap, with more than half of that coming in the past three months. The 2020 and 2021 dollar-denominated bonds of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA were trading up over 1 cent in the dollar after it started bank transfers to make its first April bond payments. Venezuela's sovereign 2026 and 2038 issues were also up 1-1.7 cents.

The banks have also questioned whether the country’s Competition Commission can penalise banks which do not have subsidiaries or branches in South Africa, the sources said. The commission is seeking to impose fines on more than a dozen local and foreign banks that it alleges colluded to co-ordinate trading in the rand and the US dollar. Share this story JPMorgan is among the banks named in the probe.   Photo: Reuters The agency launched the investigation in April 2015, joining a global clampdown that has led to big banks being fined around $10 billion (R136.8 billion) in total for rigging interest rate and forex benchmarks. It referred the case to the Competition Tribunal, which holds hearings on anti-trust matters before making a ruling. It recommended that the tribunal impose fines amounting to 10 percent of the banks’ South African revenues, the maximum allowed. At a closed preliminary hearing last month, some of the banks raised objections about the lack of specific detail in the case to allow their lawyers to present a defence, one of the sources said. The tribunal will meet again in July to consider the banks’ objections if the commission has done enough to fine-tune its case, the sources said. The commission was not immediately available for comment. Under South African regulations, the commission is required to investigate anti-competitive cases within South Africa, or those that have an impact in the country. “If there was anti-competitive conduct, as the commission alleges, the question then is: Did it have an effect in South Africa? "That’s one jurisdictional issue the banks have raised,” another source said. Another issue raised was how banks with no subsidiaries or branches in South Africa would be affected. “Some of the banks want jurisdictional issues to be cleared up because some of those named have no branches in South Africa,” one source said. Read also: Collusion news hits all bank shares “How do you calculate a fine for banks with no branches in South Africa?” Australia’s ANZ Banking Group has no branches in South Africa. Nomura launched a branch in South Africa only in April last year, almost a year into the commission’s investigation. Among the banks, Barclays Africa Group, a regional unit of Barclays, has been granted conditional immunity from prosecution in return for its co-operation in the investigation. In February, the local arm of Citigroup was fined $5million for its role in the affair. The commission said it had set the fine for Citibank South Africa at less than 10percent of its annual turnover after the bank undertook to co-operate with the commission. Other banks named in the investigation were Standard Bank , Investec, JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group, Commerzbank, Macquarie Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC and Standard Chartered. Standard Bank, South Africa’s second biggest bank by market value, said its own internal investigation had found no evidence of any wrongdoing. “Nonetheless, Standard Bank is treating these allegations very seriously and will engage fully with the Competition Commission and the Competition Tribunal to better understand the basis for the complaints,” spokesperson Erik Larsen said. StanChart would continue to co-operate with the tribunal process, spokesperson Geraldine Matchaba said. JP Morgan, Commerzbank, Bank of America and Nomura declined to comment. Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas, HSBC, ANZ and Macquarie did not respond to requests for comment.  Reuters Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 More massive marches on the cards next week 2 Dear black people, forgive us as we march for white privilege 3 PICS: Chaos erupts in Joburg during #AntiZumaMarches 4 Dad charged with killing infant son 38 years ago 5 PICS: #AntiZumaMarches a costly affair for some Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

Comment (1) aAFont Size In a private meeting with lawmakers, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said he supports a policy that could radically reshape Wall Street's biggest firms by separating their consumer-lending businesses from their investment banks, said people with direct knowledge of the matter. Cohn, the ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive who is now advising President Donald Trump, said he generally favors banking going back to how it was when firms like Goldman focused on trading and underwriting securities, and companies such as Citigroup Inc. primarily issued loans, according to the people, who heard his comments. The remarks surprised some senators and congressional aides who attended the Wednesday meeting, as they didn't expect a former top Wall Street executive to speak favorably of proposals that would force banks to dramatically rethink how they do business. Yet Cohn's comments echo what Trump and Republican lawmakers have previously said about wanting to bring back some version of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that kept bank lending separate from investment banking for more than six decades. [PRESIDENT TRUMP: Timeline, appointments, executive orders + guide to actions in first 100 days] Cohn was reiterating the Trump administration's view that the banking system should be simplified with a focus on helping business grow and create jobs, a White House official said. In the years after Glass-Steagall's 1999 repeal, banks such as Citigroup, Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. gobbled up rivals and pushed into all sorts of new businesses, becoming one-stop-shopping financial behemoths. Many banking executives believed that the inclusion of former finance executives like Cohn in Trump's White House would temper major changes such as a Glass-Steagall return. But his Wednesday remarks suggest he could be a wild card should Congress get serious about reinstating the law. A split of investment and commercial banking would have a disparate impact on Wall Street, as firms with substantial consumer-lending operations would probably be hit the hardest by any changes, Brian Gardner, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, said in a research note. Goldman has a limited footprint in consumer lending, while it's a big part of JPMorgan's business. Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen, said separating banks' business lines now makes little sense, because regulation has increased substantially since the 2008 financial crisis on everything from mortgage lending to derivatives. "We need a healthy banking system," Doll said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. "That's yes, of course, good for Wall Street, but it's also really good for Main Street." White House officials haven't said what an updated version of Glass-Steagall might look like. Getting Congress to pass any significant financial regulation legislation would be difficult, as lawmakers are currently bogged down by other issues including health care and taxes. "We fully expect Glass-Steagall headlines to persist, but we see neither the political will nor the legislative capacity necessary for passage of legislation reshaping the nation's banking framework," said Isaac Boltansky, a financial regulation analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading. Cohn's remarks were prompted by a question about his views on Glass-Steagall from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the finance industry's most relentless critics, said the people who asked not to be named because Cohn's meeting with Senate Banking Committee members was private. After Cohn answered, Sen. Robert Corker, a Tennessee Republican, pressed him to clarify his views. Spokesmen for Warren and Corker didn't respond to requests for comment. Dismantling the nation's banking giants isn't a partisan issue, which is one reason why Wall Street fears the idea could gain traction. Both political parties -- and many voters -- still resent that taxpayers had to rescue the industry with a $700 billion bailout during the financial crisis. Republicans included a return of Glass-Steagall in the party platform they approved in July during their national convention. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has proposed legislation with Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona called the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act. Advocates for bringing the law back say smaller banks could be allowed to fail without threatening the economy or needing bailouts. They also argue that a less powerful finance industry wouldn't have as much influence over Washington policy. Wall Street executives counter that it would be impossible for broken-up lenders to compete with overseas megabanks and that the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act has made the industry much safer. "There is broad agreement, including among all our bank regulatory agencies, that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the crisis or the housing market collapse," Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, said in an emailed statement. "America's economy depends on banks of all sizes to meet the needs of a large and diverse group of clients, customers and communities." Wednesday's Capitol Hill meeting with Cohn was arranged by Republican Mike Crapo of Idaho, the Senate Banking Committee Chairman, and included lawmakers from both political parties and their staffs. The discussion covered a wide range of topics, including financial regulations and overhauling the tax code, the people said. A Crapo spokesman declined to comment.

The ECB proposal to European Union states, seen by Reuters, says that a draft piece of legislation on foreign bank regulation already under discussion among the 28 EU members should be toughened further. The draft rules, proposed by the EU executive commission in November, require foreign lenders with a major presence in the EU to combine their businesses in the region into a separately capitalised holding company. The proposal is aimed at ensuring that foreign banks classed as globally systemic lenders or those with at least 30 billion euros of assets in the EU are able to sustain significant losses without support from their headquarters. It has already been met with strong opposition from non-EU banks who say it would significantly raise the cost and bureaucracy of operating in the EU. But now the ECB is proposing the law goes further and requires branches of foreign banks to be included in the EU holding company, a move that would likely raise foreign lenders' capital requirements. The draft law had exempted branches. The ECB said it was making the proposal more comprehensive as it was concerned that the draft law could lead to "regulatory arbitrage" where banks booked important transactions in branches in order to reduce the level of assets that would be subject to the holding company's capital requirements. The changes it proposes would also bring the draft EU law in line with similar rules faced by large foreign banks in the U.S, it said. Currently, big lenders such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America or the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, carry out significant operations through branches in the EU rather than subsidiaries, the paper said, meaning the capital reserves they keep inside the bloc are lower, posing a higher risk to financial stability. The ECB is also proposing that the holding companies be regulated by whoever supervises the largest individual entity within the group, which in practice would most often be the ECB. This would mark a broadening of the central bank's supervisory reach, partly at the expense of national securities watchdogs inside the EU. The proposal, that was drafted together with the EU's banking liquidation body, the Single Resolution Board, is also aimed at facilitating the SRB task of preparing resolution plans for banks operating in the EU, so that in case they fail, their creditors' funds can be used to prop them up, instead of taxpayers' money. EU envoys last week had a first exchange of views on the paper, dated March 28. The issue may be discussed at a regular meeting of the bloc's finance ministers in Malta on Friday and Saturday although it is not formally on the agenda. The ECB move was welcomed by France, whose large banks have been lately hit by U.S. competitors, and also pleased smaller EU countries where branches of foreign banks operate, because it would reduce lenders' risks by stepping up controls and the transparency of their operations, officials briefed on the envoys' meeting said. But the legislative change would hit EU's larger financial centres making them likely less attractive to foreign banks as headquarters for their continent-wide operations. Britain "strongly disagreed" with the ECB proposal, the source said. Britain and Luxembourg, which host Europe's biggest financial hubs, have already protested against the original proposals made by the European Commission. In a joint paper, sent to EU countries and seen by Reuters, they said the requirement to set up a holding company in the EU would increase costs for foreign banks, "risking significant disruption" to economic functions provided by these companies to EU businesses and households. They cited in particular risks posed to asset management activities of U.S. banks in the EU. British banks are also likely to see the costs of their EU activities soaring after Brexit as they would be treated as foreign lenders.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 April 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM As millennials ‘Venmo’ each other money, banks fight back with their own mobile apps by james rufus koren Apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other. — Dreamstime/TNS Odds are, you've at least heard of Venmo, but there's also a good chance you haven't used the mobile app or anything else like it to send money to family or friends.  But that's likely to change over the next few years, as banks, payment companies and even the likes of Google and Facebook push so-called peer-to-peer, or p2p, payment systems – a medium of exchange with revolutionary potential.  The apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other, and they even could make inroads at the cash register and with businesses that send refunds and other payments to their customers.  These systems will get a boost later this year when a coalition of the nation's biggest banks roll out Zelle, a mobile and online money-transfer network that will let any customer of nearly every US bank send money to customers of any other bank using only a phone number or e-mail address.  Analysts say the bank-led system – and the related marketing push – should bring online and mobile peer-to-peer payments to a larger audience. Even competitors, notably the popular money transfer app Venmo, say the Zelle rollout could boost their fortunes by making digital-money transfers more mainstream.  "We don't see it as a winner-take-all scenario," said Josh Criscoe, a spokesman for Venmo owner PayPal. "We welcome any effort to move folks to more digital payments and move toward the smartphone as the central point of financial life. The common enemy is cash."  Online and mobile peer-to-peer payment systems have grown rapidly over the last few years, and analysts expect that to continue. In a report published in March, finance industry research firm Aite Group estimated that Americans made about US$147bil (RM652.16bil) in digital p2p transfers last year, up from US$100bil (RM443.65bil) the year before.  Those are big numbers, to be sure, but last year's sum still only accounted for about 12% of the more than US$1.2tril (RM5.32tril) that Americans paid each other that year, mostly in cash.  That means there's still plenty of growth ahead, said Talie Baker, an analyst at Aite Group. In her report, she estimated that the volume of digital p2p payments will more than double by 2020, topping US$316bil (RM1.40tril).  "Not that many consumers are using mobile payments yet," Baker said, noting that though these payments are more common among young consumers in big coastal cities, they're not so ubiquitous elsewhere. "I'm a Gen-X person and I live in Denver – I hadn't heard of Venmo until 2015."  There are plenty of players in the p2p game.  Square Inc, the payments company behind the tiny white credit card reader that plugs into a smartphone, has a p2p service of its own, Square Cash, which launched in 2013.  Following the geometric theme, there's also Circle, a Boston firm that started the same year and specialises in cross-border p2p transfers in dollars, euros and British pounds.  Facebook and Google, too, allow users to send money to friends. Google has Google Wallet, which started as a mobile wallet app but became a p2p payment tool in 2015, and Facebook users have been able to send money through Facebook Messenger since 2015.  Square, Google and Facebook don't report the volume of payments made through their p2p systems, but Facebook in regulatory filings has said that only "a relatively small percentage" of its users have used the payments feature.  Venmo is arguably the biggest name in peer-to-peer transfers. It even has the coveted status, like Google, Uber and a few others, of becoming a verb – as in "Venmo me."  Founded in 2009, the company was acquired in 2012 by payment services provider Braintree, which was acquired the following year by online payments giant PayPal – which offers p2p payments under its own name too.  But the biggest players in the market are still the banks.  Last year, Venmo users transferred US$17.6bil (RM78.08bil). That's more than double the volume from 2015, but it's also much less than the $28 billion transferred in 2016 through QuickPay, JPMorgan Chase's peer-to-peer payment system. And that's just one bank.  Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other major financial institutions have had their own p2p transfer programs for years, though it can sometimes be clunky for bank customers to send money to people with accounts at other financial institutions.  Aite Group estimates that of all the digital p2p transfers Americans made last year, non-bank systems such as Venmo accounted for only about 17% of that. Banks accounted for the rest, though much of that likely was made through banks' websites, not mobile apps, and much of it was money transferred between customers of the same bank.  In part, that's a statement about who uses different systems, and what they are used for. Venmo and other non-bank systems are accessed about twice as often as bank systems, but for much smaller transactions, according to Aite Group. The average money transfer on a non-bank system is US$135 (RM599); the average for bank systems is US$1,359 (RM6,029), according to the report.  That might suggest that parents sending money to a student for college tuition, for instance, might be more likely to transfer money through a bank, while students are much more likely to split a restaurant bill or bar tab using Venmo.  The payment app is also a social network in its own right, with users sending messages to friends when they transfer money – a feature Venmo pioneered. Those messages shed light on what's behind each transaction and indicate that Venmo is most often used among friends over food and drink, said Criscoe, the Venmo spokesman.  "Pizza is the No. 1 emoji on Venmo; beer is a close follow," he said, adding that other messages suggest users are splitting bigger-ticket items too, such as rent.  Though Venmo and other non-bank payment systems are still a small part of the p2p market, banks want to make sure they keep their place in the financial order and keep their customers.  This summer, Early Warning, a company owned by some of the nation's largest banks, will release Zelle, a payment system built to compete with Venmo and others – and, banks hope, to make digital p2p payments more mainstream.  Along with the release, Early Warning will kick off a marketing campaign showing not only how Zelle works but how it might be used. Lou Anne Alexander, president of Early Warning's payments group, said the focus will be on appealing to older consumers who might not have tried p2p payments.  "We're trying to take (p2p) from millennials to the mainstream_customers might use a product like this," Alexander said. "That might be managing contributions to the high school marching band or it might be renting a home on the beach with friends or family."  Zelle traces it roots back to 2011, when Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase set out to build a system – initially called ClearXchange – that would allow their customers to send money to each other using only phone numbers and email addresses. Before, customers could only transfer money to friends and family by entering account and routing numbers – information customers often didn't know and might be concerned about sharing.  Zelle is essentially a souped-up, rebranded version of ClearXchange. It will be available to anyone with a US bank account, and it aims to overcome some of the limitations and confusion around the ClearXchange system.  Sarah Grotta of research and consulting firm Mercator Advisory Group said banks didn't do a great job of explaining that ClearXchange would allow customers to send money to customers of other banks.  Part of the problem, she said, was that every bank has its own name for its ClearXchange-powered p2p system, including Chase QuickPay, Wells Fargo SurePay and Capital One P2P Payments.  "It wasn't well-marketed that someone at Chase could pay someone at Bank of America because they had different marketing and different branding," Grotta said. "You could pay someone at any financial institution, but people never realized that."  To address that problem, banks over the next few months will begin rebranding their p2p transfer systems to include Zelle in the name. Chase, for instance, will start calling its system "QuickPay with Zelle." Customers of more than a dozen big banks – representing most US account holders – will be able to transfer money through the banks' mobile apps. For other banks and credit unions, customers will be able to do so through the Zelle mobile app, set to be released this summer.  Once the system is running and the marketing campaign kicks off, Grotta expects Zelle to be a hit.  "This is going to be a much better user experience than the banks had before," she said. "I think it will start to catch on once people see that they can in fact send money to another person at another financial institution."  For banks, the stakes are high. Though Venmo and other money transfer apps are tiny by comparison, Baker said banks are rightfully worried about what might happen if their customers interact more often with outside payment companies.  If a customer opens an outside p2p payment app once a day and their mobile banking app just once a week, the payment company has more opportunities to sell that customer on products and services the bank would otherwise provide, she said.  "Once Venmo builds up a strong enough customer base, then it can say, 'Hey, come get a credit card from us,' or 'Come get a home loan from us,'" Baker said. "That's the approach some providers are hoping to take."  Banks see other advantages too. Mary Harman, an executive in Bank of America's consumer payments division, said it's expensive for banks to process checks and move cash around, so an increase in digital p2p payments could cut costs.  She said banks also want to give customers the services and options they want. Some customers, she said, might prefer using Venmo; others might prefer the implied security of managing financial transactions exclusively through their bank.  "We serve 65-million households in the US, and not everyone will act the same way," Harman said. We have to recognise that and have different products available in different places." — Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Foreign residents to pay higher fees Upside seen in property market Chong Wei-Lin Dan final on the cards Hang up if 'banks' call for personal data, says ABM Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read MDDB sponsorship drive this Saturday No Pokeballs needed to catch this bowl of fish Surviving the age of emails advertisement Latest News Car owners tap into sharing economy to help offset costs Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results Restaurants fatten up with food delivery apps Anthony Bourdain launches new digital travel guide for fans EU to end mobile roaming charges in June Most Viewed in Tech Restaurants fatten up with food delivery apps Car owners tap into sharing economy to help offset costs Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results Anthony Bourdain launches new digital travel guide for fans EU to end mobile roaming charges in June Intel CEO pay rises to US$19.1mil as security costs climb Amazon takes voice battle with Apple TV outside US Facebook starts to educate users on how to spot fake news Canon launches three new entry level cameras – EOS 800D, EOS77D and EOSM6 Trump sued by Twitter over bid to unmask @Alt-Agency handle Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Marquez sued a father and son from Hacienda Heights in March 2017, claiming they stole $2.3 million in tax refunds from him. (Photo by Gene Blevins/LA DailyNews) By Stephanie K. Baer, The Whittier Daily News Posted: 04/06/17, 5:00 PM PDT | Updated: 7 mins ago # Comments Professional Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez has sued a major U.S. bank and a father and son duo convicted of tax fraud, alleging they stole $2.3 million in tax refunds through fake bank accounts opened at one of the bank’s branches in Whittier, according to court documents. In the civil complaint filed March 24 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Marquez alleges agents at the Chase Bank, 13103 E. Philadelphia St., conspired with his former tax preparers to open fraudulent bank accounts they used to launder tax returns withheld from Marquez’s winnings from fights in the U.S. The complaint claims Adel Cotton and his son Heber Cotton, both of Hacienda Heights, forged a power of attorney from Marquez to open the accounts in which they deposited Marquez’s tax refund checks totaling $2,308,439. The Cottons filed returns for Marquez in 2013, claiming refunds of $898,057 for 2008 and $1,410,382 for 2012, according to the complaint. JP Morgan Chase & Co., Adel and Heber Cotton, and licensed notary Brian Lallement are listed as defendants in the case. “You can’t open an account in the United States unless you have positive proof of identity of a person,” said Alan J. Romero, Marquez’s attorney. “That didn’t happen here.” The complaint alleges the bank failed to comply with “mandatory statutory minimum requirements set forth by applicable California and federal law and/or regulations to prevent the use of (its) banking operations for the laundering of stolen tax refund monies.” The complaint also states that Marquez believes one or more Chase employees may have accepted bribes and violated other federal laws. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan declined to comment Friday. Marquez is a four-weight world champion boxer who has held seven world titles over the past 20 years. He is considered to be one of the greatest Mexican boxers of all time. According to the complaint, Marquez found out about the scheme in 2015 when his new accountant obtained his tax return records from the Internal Revenue Service. “We received a letter from the IRS indicating that they had paid the checks out,” said Noriel Zuazo, an accountant hired by Marquez in 2015. “(The checks) were deposited into an account that Mr. Marquez never authorized to open.” Both Cottons are currently serving sentences in federal prison for obtaining fraudulent tax refunds in a separate scheme that netted more than $2.6 million in bogus tax returns using stolen identities. They pleaded guilty in 2015 to one count each of conspiracy to defraud the federal government by filing at least 275 fraudulent income tax returns. Advertisement As in that case, the Cottons directed the IRS to mail Marquez’s refunds to addresses they controlled, according to the complaint. “Why the feds have not done anything, that’s certainly the $64,000 question,” Romero said. “It was really blatant.” A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment on the case. Marquez is seeking millions in damages on 17 causes of action, including misrepresentation, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and civil remedy for stolen property.

Motley Fool Staff Apr 6, 2017 at 7:33PM The past decade has been anything but smooth sailing for the banking industry. Hundreds of banks failed during and after the financial crisis. And many of the banks that didn't fail were bruised and battered in the downturn so much that they've spent the last eight years retreating and retrenching as opposed to forging ahead. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is one of the rare exceptions to this. Listen to the following segment of Industry Focus: Financials as The Motley Fool's Gaby Lapera and John Maxfield discuss how the Minneapolis-based bank not only survived the financial crisis but actually thrived as a result of it. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 27, 2017. Gaby Lapera: Talking about other people who have had big accomplishments, you did an interview with the U.S. [Bancorp] CEO, Richard Davis. Davis is actually stepping down from his position soon, but it's a really well thought-out, long-planned move, much like everything Davis has done before. But this is a really good time to talk to him, and talk to him about how he saw his role at one of America's best banks. John Maxfield: Yeah, and if you think about it, to put Richard Davis in perspective, U.S. Bank is the fifth-largest commercial bank in the United States. Why would you dedicate a whole podcast to U.S. Bancorp? If you're in banking, you would know. But if you're not in banking, the big question is, "Why would you do that?" And the answer is twofold. First, Davis, if you just think about the greatest bankers of our generation, you have Robert Wilmers at M&T Bank, you have Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase, you have a guy named William Demchak at PNC Financial, and you have Richard Davis. Richard Davis is literally one of the greatest bankers of the current generation. So, what can we learn from him? We are all investors. What can investors learn about being able to identify not only really good bankers, but also really good banks to invest in? Lapera: Yeah. A little background on Richard Davis, Davis started at U.S. Bancorp in 2006, 10 years ago, when everything was rosy and great for the banking industry, and it turned around pretty quickly, as I think most listeners know. U.S. Bancorp sailed through the financial crisis without much of a problem. In fact, they managed to take their solidity through the financial crisis and grow and outperform a bunch of other banks, which is a very impressive thing to do, when everyone else around you is failing, for you to be like, "I'm fine, and not only am I fine, but I'm going to do great." Maxfield: One clarification, in December of 2006 was when he was promoted to CEO. Davis has actually been with U.S. Bancorp for a little bit longer, because he was part of that original group -- there was a transformative merger in 2000 between Firststar and U.S. Bancorp that then created the U.S. Bancorp that we know today. And Richard Davis was kind of the No. 2 guy in that deal, and he finished his ascent through the ranks, and in December 2006 is when he took over. To your point, when he took over, U.S. Bancorp was already one of the most profitable banks in the country, and everything looked absolutely fantastic to them. But it was not too long after that that all dominos started tumbling in the financial crisis. Most banks, over 500 banks, failed during and after the financial crisis. And the banks that didn't fail, a lot of them got picked up for pennies on the dollar by better-positioned banks. And the banks that either didn't fail or didn't get acquired by better-positioned banks really struggled in the financial crisis, and lost a lot of money, like Bank of America and Citigroup. U.S. Bancorp was one of those few banks that didn't fail, wasn't picked up for pennies on the dollar by a competitor, didn't suffer enormous losses, and actually, to your point, emerged from the financial crisis in a stronger competitive position relative to its peers than it entered it.

A strong earnings season would help justify pricey stock valuations, with the S&P 500 rallying this month to its most expensive since 2004 on a forward price-to-earnings basis. While the U.S. economy has gotten a lot of attention since the Nov. 8 election and President Donald Trump's vows to boost the domestic economy, data during the quarter has suggested the global economy is strengthening. That is welcome news for S&P components, since nearly half of their sales come from overseas. Shares of the biggest U.S. companies, which tend to have the most overseas exposure, have been among the strongest performers over the past several weeks. For instance, the S&P 500 has outperformed its average stock this year since mid-February, after performing mostly in line at the beginning of the year. [http://www.bit.ly/2oQPVXF] "The fact that we're seeing stabilization in the global community will bode well for multinational companies and help earnings for the first quarter," said Terry Sandven, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "You've also seen the dollar not appreciate as much as many had forecast a quarter ago, so multinational companies may get some relief on the (foreign exchange) line," he said. A weaker dollar boosts offshore revenues when they are translated into the U.S. currency. The U.S. dollar index was down 1.8 percent in the first quarter, but it was still cheaper during last year's first quarter. STRONGER DATA AS EARNINGS LOOM A survey this week showed euro zone business activity at a six-year high. Forecasts from the International Monetary Fund show a pickup in the global economy in 2017 and 2018, especially in developing economies. However, some investors worry multinationals may have already priced in big gains in earnings. "As long as nothing changes, these firms are going to be fine," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, speaking of the strength of the largest American companies. He warned, however, that stock prices may have taken in any good news. "The market has certainly fully discounted all that." The U.S. earnings season gets under way next week, with results from banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among others. The financial sector is projected to post a 15.4 percent profit gain, second only to energy among S&P sectors. Energy companies, which carried most of the losses that extended an S&P 500 earnings recession until the second quarter of last year, are expected to do most of the heavy lifting this earnings season with a whopping 600 percent increase. For the entire S&P 500, analysts are projecting earnings up 10.1 percent compared with a year ago, which would be the first double-digit increase since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1 percent. Revenue is expected to have jumped 7 percent, the most since 2011, which should help compensate for higher wage and other costs facing companies, strategists said. "We're seeing revenues contribute materially more to that bottom-line growth," said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Big profit gains are expected in technology and materials as well, the data showed. "It comes down to a synchronized global economic acceleration ...; a rebound and stabilization in commodity prices and a higher interest rate environment," Palfrey said.

[www.bit.ly/2oQPVXF] "The fact that we're seeing stabilization in the global community will bode well for multinational companies and help earnings for the first quarter," said Terry Sandven, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "You've also seen the dollar not appreciate as much as many had forecast a quarter ago, so multinational companies may get some relief on the (foreign exchange) line," he said. A weaker dollar boosts offshore revenues when they are translated into the U.S. currency. The U.S. dollar index was down 1.8 percent in the first quarter, but it was still cheaper during last year's first quarter. STRONGER DATA AS EARNINGS LOOM A survey this week showed euro zone business activity at a six-year high. Forecasts from the International Monetary Fund show a pickup in the global economy in 2017 and 2018, especially in developing economies. However, some investors worry multinationals may have already priced in big gains in earnings. "As long as nothing changes, these firms are going to be fine," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, speaking of the strength of the largest American companies. He warned, however, that stock prices may have taken in any good news. "The market has certainly fully discounted all that." The U.S. earnings season gets under way next week, with results from banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among others. The financial sector is projected to post a 15.4 percent profit gain, second only to energy among S&P sectors. Energy companies, which carried most of the losses that extended an S&P 500 earnings recession until the second quarter of last year, are expected to do most of the heavy lifting this earnings season with a whopping 600 percent increase. For the entire S&P 500, analysts are projecting earnings up 10.1 percent compared with a year ago, which would be the first double-digit increase since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1 percent. Revenue is expected to have jumped 7 percent, the most since 2011, which should help compensate for higher wage and other costs facing companies, strategists said. "We're seeing revenues contribute materially more to that bottom-line growth," said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Big profit gains are expected in technology and materials as well, the data showed. "It comes down to a synchronized global economic acceleration ...; a rebound and stabilization in commodity prices and a higher interest rate environment," Palfrey said.

MENG ZHONGDE/FOR CHINA DAILY For the second month in running, China's foreign exchange reserves rose slightly in March to steady above trillion. Analysts said the stockpile will remain stable at least in the short term as the economy stabilizes. The reserves increased by .96 billion during March to reach .009 trillion, according to data of the People's Bank of China, the central bank. It marked the first time that the reserves had increased for two consecutive months since April 2016. In January, the reserves fell below the trillion mark, triggering concerns that they may continue to drop. But, in February, the reserves rose above that level. Capital outflows are an important factor influencing China's scale of foreign exchange reserves, said Zhang Yansheng, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. “The US' economic prospects remain blurred and the Chinese economy has been widely seen as having largely stabilized, contributing to easing capital outflows,” Zhang said. But if the US continued to raise interest rates as frequently as expected and launched a trade war with China, the situation would change for the worse and China may face heavier capital outflow pressure, he said. Zhu Haibin, chief China economist with JPMorgan Chase & Co, also said capital outflows are expected to slow this year. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said that the country's foreign exchange reserves “may become more stable” given the resilient economic fundamentals. “China's economy has sound fundamentals, great potential and a high level of resilience, and will continue to grow at a stable and relatively fast pace,” it said. Cross-border capital flows will also become more balanced and the reform to marketize the exchange rate formation of the renminbi has progressed steadily, contributing to the easing capital outflow pressure it faces, the statement said. China's economic growth remained stable in the first two months, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. Analysts said the trend is expected to continue in March and April. “The trend of stable and improving growth will continue in April,” said Hu Yuexiao, chief analyst of Shanghai Securities Co. Investment growth has picked up and corporate profits are also improving, he said. In the first quarter of this year, foreign exchange reserves fell by .4 billion and the fall was significantly smaller than in the previous two quarters, the administration said. China's gold reserves' value fell to .74 billion at the end of March from .376 billion at the end of February, the central bank said.

The ECB proposal to European Union states, seen by Reuters, says that a draft piece of legislation on foreign bank regulation already under discussion among the 28 EU members should be toughened further. The draft rules, proposed by the EU executive commission in November, require foreign lenders with a major presence in the EU to combine their businesses in the region into a separately capitalised holding company. The proposal is aimed at ensuring that foreign banks classed as globally systemic lenders or those with at least 30 billion euros of assets in the EU are able to sustain significant losses without support from their headquarters. It has already been met with strong opposition from non-EU banks who say it would significantly raise the cost and bureaucracy of operating in the EU. But now the ECB is proposing the law goes further and requires branches of foreign banks to be included in the EU holding company, a move that would likely raise foreign lenders’ capital requirements. The draft law had exempted branches. The ECB said it was making the proposal more comprehensive as it was concerned that the draft law could lead to “regulatory arbitrage” where banks booked important transactions in branches in order to reduce the level of assets that would be subject to the holding company’s capital requirements. The changes it proposes would also bring the draft EU law in line with similar rules faced by large foreign banks in the US, it said. Currently, big lenders such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America or the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, carry out significant operations through branches in the EU rather than subsidiaries, the paper said, meaning the capital reserves they keep inside the bloc are lower, posing a higher risk to financial stability. The ECB is also proposing that the holding companies be regulated by whoever supervises the largest individual entity within the group, which in practice would most often be the ECB. This would mark a broadening of the central bank’s supervisory reach, partly at the expense of national securities watchdogs inside the EU. The proposal, that was drafted together with the EU’s banking liquidation body, the Single Resolution Board, is also aimed at facilitating the SRB task of preparing resolution plans for banks operating in the EU, so that in case they fail, their creditors’ funds can be used to prop them up, instead of taxpayers’ money. EU envoys last week had a first exchange of views on the paper, dated March 28. The issue may be discussed at a regular meeting of the bloc’s finance ministers in Malta on Friday and Saturday although it is not formally on the agenda. The ECB move was welcomed by France, whose large banks have been lately hit by US competitors, and also pleased smaller EU countries where branches of foreign banks operate, because it would reduce lenders’ risks by stepping up controls and the transparency of their operations, officials briefed on the envoys’ meeting said. But the legislative change would hit EU’s larger financial centres making them likely less attractive to foreign banks as headquarters for their continent-wide operations. Britain “strongly disagreed” with the ECB proposal, the source said. Britain and Luxembourg, which host Europe’s biggest financial hubs, have already protested against the original proposals made by the European Commission. British banks are also likely to see the costs of their EU activities soaring after Brexit as they would be treated as foreign lenders. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← China FX reserves rise in March, stay above $3tn Asian energy firms rally with oil after US strikes Syria → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent US missiles strike Syria, oil hits one-month high This magic rock can cut warming In divided Syria, US strike both welcomed and condemned America’s allies show support for strikes Read More ...

First, the "Mad Money" host noted that the market prefers decisiveness to uncertainty, hence the positive response to Trump denouncing the use of chemical weapons and taking action. Cramer attributed the soft response to the Labor Department's employment report to bad weather marring construction hiring and a newfound understanding that lost retail jobs are not because of slowing consumer spending, but Amazon's growing influence. Finally, oil prices spiked on inflamed tensions in the Middle East. "I know it's counter intuitive to like higher rates and higher oil prices but these are signs, at least to some market participants, that the economy is still strong even as last month's hiring seems disappointing," Cramer said. With the market's resilience in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar next week: Monday: Oil, rates, takeovers The bulls are itching to see oil break out of its $47 to $52 range into the $53 to $54 area, and would also do well to see the 10-year Treasury's rates rise from 2.3 percent up to 2.4 or 2.5 percent. Cramer also expects some takeover action in the biotechnology, consumer packaged goods, and oils sectors. "I believe there are several European drug companies desperate to expand their pipelines and I expect them to start making deals in the near future. We know Kraft-Heinz is ready to pull the trigger on a deal, [but] we don't know who it's going to be," he said. "And the amount of call option buying in the major independent oils with Permian exposure this week, it was extraordinary." Tuesday: PMIs Purchasing Managers' indices from China and the United Kingdom concern Cramer, because if China's is weak, leaders there could insist on stimulus via U.S. business involvement. "That would be a sign that the Trump meetings with the Chinese president this week went very well," he said. But post-Brexit inflation in the United Kingdom could push the country's central bank to raise rates, an effect that could spark worries going forward. Wednesday: Mortgage applications, Delta, Mosaic Mortgage applications: "We need to see some proof that April's started off better than March finished," Cramer said, and the first good indicator will come from mortgage application data. "Have these new lows that we've seen in rates ... spurred any buying? Is the spring selling season, so important for housing, starting strongly? I think this number, actually, strangely, is going to be the most important number about what's going on right now in the economy," the "Mad Money" host said. Delta: The airliner reports earnings ahead of market open, and Cramer is worried about the effects of a slowdown in travel, though he does not expect any major bombshells. "Either way, I want you to keep in mind that Warren Buffett owns 8% of this airline's stock, and I generally like buying a Buffett stock if I can get it on weakness," Cramer said. Mosaic: An analyst meeting at the fertilizer company, and Cramer expects a strong story and says some upgrades for the lagging agriculture play are possible. "I would actually like to own the stock ahead of that meeting," Cramer said. Thursday: Big banks, small banks, Taiwan Semiconductor JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo will report earnings in the morning, and Cramer is paying attention to net interest margins, or the "free money" banks make from deposits, loan growth, which he hopes has not slowed from the first quarter, and expenses in the midst of regulatory rollbacks. In the case of Wells Fargo, Cramer hopes to gauge whether the bank has evaded the cross-selling scandal for good. Cramer is also watching smaller banks PNC and First Horizon, as the companies' earnings could reveal whether commercial construction has slowed due to recent impasses in Washington. Taiwan Semiconductor: If the chipmaker's earnings report shows that $171 billion company is spending, Cramer says investors should pick up shares of Lam Research or Applied Materials, as they will be the direct beneficiaries of Taiwan Semiconductor's capital outflows. Markets are closed on Good Friday, so Cramer suggests taking a breath before earnings season really kicks into gear the following week. "[The] bottom line is that the average just keep staying resilient, and if you stick around, I'll explain the itchy fingers that may very well be behind this market's seeming inability to crater even when you expect it to just plain get obliterated," Cramer said.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 4  −  two  =  Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Saudi Aramco is reportedly worth over $2 trillion, twice the market cap of Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL). Aramco controls 20% of the world's proven oil reserves, or 267 billion barrels of oil, and that has investors eager to buy Saudi Aramco stock. They'll get their chance soon. The world's biggest oil company is planning an initial public offering soon, and it's going to break records. But investors need to approach the Aramco IPO with caution. The big numbers gloss over some serious issues with the company… The Saudi Aramco IPO is projected to be the largest IPO of all time. The company is expected to offer 5% of the company for public sale, and with a total valuation of $2 trillion, the IPO will be worth a record-smashing $100 billion. That's four times bigger than the current record holder, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA), which debuted at a whopping $25 billion. In fact, Saudi Aramco's market cap is very likely to be larger than Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (NYSE ADR: RDS.A), BP Plc. (NYSE:BP), and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), combined. Trending: The Best Stocks to Buy (and When to Sell) for Mega-Profits in 2017 But, at one point, a Saudi Aramco stock offering was supposed to happen already. The Saudi Arabian IPO date has been pushed back by more than a year since it was first announced in January 2016. That's because the Aramco IPO is much more complicated than a typical IPO, and it means potential investors need to pay careful attention to what's going on… When Can I Buy Saudi Aramco Stock? The Saudi Aramco IPO is expected to be the biggest of all time, but its massive size is also making the IPO process difficult. It also means there's no concrete date for the IPO. The company has had to hire firms to manage the IPO, from advisors to underwriters. This is a standard part of a company going public, but the size of Aramco has made the competition fierce. The Aramco IPO could produce over $1 billion in fees for participating banks. Plus, winning a spot in the IPO process could mean future business with the oil giant. "Every bank in the world is going to want to have a role in this," reported the Financial Times in January. That's why it was a shock when Aramco chose a small boutique investment bank to advise on the IPO. Moelis & Co. (NYSE: MC) beat out investment banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) to sign the coveted agreement. But Aramco went with a more expected approach when it chose its underwriters. Saudi Aramco chose JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and HSBC to underwrite its IPO. That means these Wall Street titans will be promoting the stock and committing to buy shares of it if the public doesn't. But the next step in the process for Aramco will be deciding which stock exchange to list the company on, and that's a much bigger hurdle to leap. Must Read: Five Double-Digit Dividend Plays to Secure Your "Second Salary" Aramco will list some shares on the Saudi Arabian stock exchange, but it's also looking to list shares on a major stock exchange with global reach. The company has short-listed exchanges in New York, London, or Hong Kong. But major exchanges like these have public reporting requirements that could open the company up to the public in a way it has never done. If the Saudi Aramco IPO occurred on a stock exchange in the United States, the firm would need to follow U.S. fiduciary laws regarding transparency and public auditing. It would also have to form a board of directors that could take some power away from the Saudi royal family. Money Morning Global Energy Strategist Dr. Kent Moors notes that Saudi Arabia was never keen to sell Saudi Aramco because it could mean having to reveal information about the oil fields it would rather keep to itself. It also means the company will have to disentangle itself from the government. Just last week the Saudi government took a step toward that by announcing it was slashing the tax rate on Aramco from 85% to 50%. That makes Aramco stock more attractive to investors, but shows how deeply reliant the government was on the oil company. The government is expected to make up the difference through dividend payments once the company goes public. But the biggest hurdle to the IPO might be convincing investors it's a good stock to own in the first place… Saudi Aramco Stock Might Be Riskier Than You Think Join the conversation.

By: Reuters | Washington | Published: April 8, 2017 4:32 AM Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unseasonably warm temperatures earlier in the year.(Reuters) U.S. job growth slowed sharply in March amid continued layoffs in the embattled retail sector, but a drop in the unemployment rate to a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent suggested labor market strength remained intact. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last May, the Labor Department said on Friday. Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unseasonably warm temperatures earlier in the year. In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast and Midwest. Economists said bad weather accounted for the stepdown in hiring. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007. You may also like to watch: “The disappointing gain in nonfarm payrolls in March is a bit of a head fake that doesn’t reflect the underlying strength and momentum in the labor market,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month, the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472,000. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population and some Federal Reserve officials view the labor market as being at full employment. Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent. The dollar rose a three-week high against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose. LABOR MARKET SLACK SHRINKING Job growth averaged 178,000 per month in the first quarter, underscoring the labor market’s strength, despite last month’s stumble. The solid employment gains suggest that an apparent slowdown in gross domestic product growth to around a 1.0 percent annualized pace in the first quarter is probably temporary. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0.2 percent in March after rising 0.3 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year gain in wages to 2.7 percent. But with inflation rising and the unemployment rate below the most recent Fed median forecast for full employment, economists expect another interest rate increase in June. The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more increases this year. Minutes from the Fed’s mid-March meeting showed most policymakers expected to start reducing the Fed’s $4.5 trillion bond portfolio later this year. New York Fed President William Dudley said on Friday that would prompt only a “little pause” in the central bank’s rate hike plans. “If today’s decline in the unemployment rate doesn’t reverse itself they may be compelled not only to hike but also to signal a faster pace of future tightening,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Other measures also showed labor market slack shrinking. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at an 11-month high of 63 percent in March. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 8.9 percent, the lowest level since December 2007. The employment-to-population ratio increased one-tenth of a percentage point to a fresh eight-year high of 60.1 percent. Last month, construction jobs rose 6,000, the weakest gain since August, after robust increases in January and February. Manufacturing employment advanced by 11,000 jobs, slowing from the 26,000 positions created in February. Retail payrolls fell 29,700, declining for a second straight month. Employment at clothing retailers decreased by 5,800 jobs last month and general merchandise stores shed 34,700 positions. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy’s Inc have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations. Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased 9,000, a third of February’s job gains, as employment at amusement parks fell 6,900. Government payrolls increased 9,000 as state and local government hiring offset a 1,000 drop in federal jobs. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci) No Comments.

Carlos Barria/Reuters | Caption Loading... Mark Trumbull Staff writer | @MarkTCSM April 7, 2017 Washington—One of the greatest risks in President Trump’s policy agenda is that he’ll start a trade war, tanking the global economy as he lashes out against allegedly unfair practices of other nations including China. That’s been a common refrain for months, including this week as he met for the first time with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. A “global depression” will occur if Mr. Trump follows through on his threatened 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, rival candidate Jeb Bush warned during the presidential campaign last year. No one wins in a trade war, said President Xi himself in a speech two months ago. The grain of truth here is that, yes, an all-out trade clash between the two largest economies would have immediate and negative consequences for workers and consumers around the world. But all of this may, at the same time, miss a key point: The global trade system has deep flaws that are related to China, not Trump. Trump's biggest executive actions, explained For years, China has been welcomed by the world into trade linkages, on the expectation that over time it will play the game of commerce the way others generally do. Trade experts say that hasn’t happened. Even many of the same CEOs and economists who warn against a trade war say China has been violating both the letter and spirit of global trade rules. Trump’s election win stemmed partly from the resonance of his critique of trade policies as harming US workers. While outside experts may not paint the issue with the president’s broad brush, some say a tougher stance toward China is needed, that a damaging trade war isn’t the most likely outcome, and that the “just be patient” strategy carries its own deep risks. “His diagnosis is correct. It's very frustrating, I find, listening to the Washington trade establishment” view about not risking a trade war with China, says Robert Atkinson, an economist who studies the ties between global trade and national economic performance. “The war has been going on for 15 years, and in earnest for the last eight. The notion that if you respond you're a protectionist, or you're starting a trade war, ... that's incorrect.” Damage to nations  Mr. Atkinson, who heads the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank in Washington, doesn’t endorse all of Trump’s espoused trade views. But he argues China is a unique challenge because of its sheer size, coupled with its determination to parlay that market power into acquiring a leadership role in advanced industries from aerospace to computing. That means that when Beijing doesn’t play by accepted rules, the damage to other nations including the US is considerable. Under President Barack Obama, the office of the US Trade Representative ramped up its engagement on alleged violations by China. The USTR’s annual report covering 2016, for example, lists an array of settlements reached with China last year – over subsidies, taxes, or other policies in industries including aircraft, autos, financial information, wind power, and green technologies. That’s a sign that progress can come when pressure is applied. The problem, say critics of China’s trade policies, is that much more needs to change. Among the biggest sore spots is the way foreign companies doing business in China are pressured to transfer knowledge to Chinese partner firms in industries such as aerospace. The World Trade Organization prohibits countries from making such demands, yet the Chinese arrangements are, in practice, hard to prosecute. “It’s not just a manufacturing [jobs] issue,” says Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. “There are very legitimate questions about what can be done to make China a fairer partner not just for the United States but for the world.” Jamie Dimon, CEO of the banking firm JPMorgan Chase, included some policy commentary in his annual letter to shareholders, and singled out China for “serious trade issues ... which have grown over the years – from cybersecurity and the protection of intellectual property to tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and non-fulfillment of World Trade Organization obligations.” Few signals from summit As Trump and Xi met at the Trump-branded Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, there were few early signs of either progress or breakdown. A White House statement said the US president "noted the challenges caused by Chinese government intervention in its economy and raised serious concerns about the impact of China's industrial, agricultural, technology, and cyber policies on United States jobs and exports."  But both leaders talked in largely positive terms about their meetings. And US officials announced that the two sides planned a 100-day push to discuss trade issues. [Editor's note: The article has been updated by adding the previous two paragraphs.] Before a side-by-side dinner Thursday, Trump offered that “we’ve had a long discussion already, and so far I have gotten nothing, absolutely nothing. But we have developed a friendship – I can see that – and I think long term we are going to have a very, very great relationship and I look very much forward to it.” Is the friendly comment a sign that Trump will go just as soft on China as critics say some of his predecessors have been? That’s actually just one of many unanswered questions about Trump and trade policy. For all the concern in some quarters that he’ll go too far, resulting in tit-for-tat sanctions that cause a recession, leading Democrats in Congress are urging him to get tough. Mr. Alden says it’s still too early to gauge the tenor of Trump’s policies. His trade team is far from complete and some of his appointees differ in tone. One crucial decision will be how much to seek a broader international coalition to press China. Trump has voiced a penchant for bilateral dealing and dealmaking. But Alden echoes many experts when he says “you're always better off working with allies than working alone.” Atkinson says the goal isn’t to block China’s development but to insist on a rule-of-law system under which all parties can benefit.

Comments from the Fed Bank of New York president bolstered speculation it bank won't slow the pace of rate hikes as it trims its balance sheet. A pause "at the time you make the decision on the balance sheet" would be to make sure it "doesn't turn out to be a bigger decision than you thought you were making. So, I would emphasise the words 'little pause"', Dudley said after giving a speech in New York on financial regulatory reform. The 10-year Treasury yield topped 2.35 per cent after falling as low as 2.28 per cent amid a weak March US jobs report and the first military strike undertaken by President Donald Trump's administration. Financial markets showed resilience in the face of weaker-than-forecast hiring in the world's largest economy and a ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions, with demand for haven assets abating. Volatility across equity markets came down from highs reached overnight. Dudley's comments come two days after Fed meeting minutes signalled officials discussed the timing for shrinking the central bank's balance sheet as it tightens monetary policy. Advertisement "I would think we'd be seeing more risk off with everything that could happen into the weekend with Syria, to the continued lengthening of the tax plan timeline, as well as Dudley's comments," Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income for National Alliance Capital Markets, said by phone. "But there's a short base out there and people are under-invested in equities and very negative, which always keeps a bid into the market." Trump's pragmatic pivot on China, Syria: The US President has set aside nationalism for pragmatism on China and Syria, but his real test looms. What investors will be looking out in the coming days: US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will on Sunday attend the Group of Seven gathering in Italy and next week meet with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile and South Korea are among countries setting interest rates next week. US banks will start reporting first-quarter earnings, led by Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Wells Fargo & Co.

The ECB proposal, seen by Reuters, says a draft piece of legislation on foreign bank regulation already under discussion among the 28 EU members should be toughened further. The draft rules, proposed by the EU executive commission in November, require foreign lenders with a major presence in the EU to combine their businesses in the region into a separately capitalised holding company. The proposal is aimed at ensuring that foreign banks classed as globally systemic lenders or those with at least €30 billion (S$44.8 billion) of assets in the EU are able to sustain significant losses without support from their headquarters. It has already met strong opposition from non-EU banks, which say it would significantly raise the cost and bureaucracy of operating in the EU. But now the ECB is proposing the law goes further and requires branches of foreign banks to be included in the EU holding company, a move that would likely raise foreign lenders'capital requirements. The draft law had exempted branches. The ECB said it was making the proposal more comprehensive as it was concerned that the draft law could lead to "regulatory arbitrage" where banks booked important transactions in branches in order to reduce the level of assets that would be subject to the holding company's capital requirements. The proposed changes would also bring the draft EU law in line with similar rules faced by large foreign banks in the United States, it said. Currently, big lenders, like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, carry out significant operations through branches in the EU rather than subsidiaries, the paper said, meaning the capital reserves they keep inside the bloc are lower, posing a higher risk to financial stability. The ECB is also proposing that the holding companies be regulated by whoever supervises the largest individual entity within the group, which in practice would most often be the ECB. This would mark a broadening of the central bank's supervisory reach, partly at the expense of national securities watchdogs inside the EU. Meanwhile, Bank of England governor Mark Carney yesterday called for Britain and the EU to agree to recognise each other's bank rules after Brexit, to avoid a damaging hit to financial services across Europe.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Adam Rowe Most entrepreneurial dreams start with a biopic of Steve Jobs or a glance at the revenue from their high school lawn mowing career. Daniel Black, CEO and founder of Glass-Media, started his company after taking a close look to the poor state of the digital signage industry. “Upon jumping into the world of digital signage, I came to two realizations,” he explained in an interview with Tech.co. “First, the digital signage industry is largely fragmented and second, display technology suffers from inadequate brightness to complete with direct sunlight.” Black’s response was to create Glass-Media, a company with the tech to turn any storefront, street-facing glass or indoor surface into a vivid and interactive display capable of running the latest digital ad campaign in real time. In other words, it creates a dynamic new version of a storefront. I learned a lot in my interview with Daniel, including Black’s biggest challenges and advice for any entrepreneurs interested in the hardware/software space. The Industry Has Few Disrupting Forces When further explaining the inspiration that led him to build a tech company centered on interactive displays, Black explained what any tech entrepreneur should know: in order to disrupt an industry, you must pick one that has far less innovation than it needs. “The storefront has been neglected,” Black says. “There has been little innovation and technological disruption at the storefront, brands remain limited to paper posters, neon signs, vinyl wraps or stickers and window paint among other antiquated marketing solutions with little to no measurable return on investment.” Black grew passionate about disruption at the storefront based on what was lacking in the marketplace. The next step? Founding a company to do something about it. Scaling Up Takes Patience Black offered two points of advice in regard to the lessons he learned while scaling up in the digital sign business: the importance of operational efficiency, and the need to “lean on strategic partners, alliances, vendors and suppliers.” You’ll also need patience to thrive as an entrepreneur as things don’t always happen on your time frame. “Designing, developing and delivering a truly scalable solution took much longer than I had initially anticipated,” Black said. JPMorgan Chase David Black Learn How to Balance Fundraising “As the founder, I’ve learned that the responsibility to raise capital falls largely on my shoulders and that it not only takes considerable time and energy, but every hour I spend fundraising is an hour less time I’m able to focus on building a successful business.” Black had to strike a balance. More often than not, the founder is the one who has to balance the daily grind of building a business and raising growth capital. Glass-Media has raised over two million dollars in seed capital. Their funding channels have been strictly angel investors. Rely on Your Networks While building a business, remember to lean on your network to help you solve the challenges of today and what’s to come. Black offered a few words of advice for startups in his industry. “Surround yourself with knowledgeable advisers, mentors and industry experts across the various aspects of your business,” he said. “Carefully identify the integrations you’ll focus on first, and don’t spread yourself too thin: Time and budget is limited.” Keep an eye out for potential niche industries that have long been overlooked: Maybe you’ll find the next industry ripe for disruption, and you can put Black’s advice to good use.

Photos Videos Topics Live SL 131/10 (18) - BAN 176/9 (20) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kishori Amonkar Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Yogi Adityanath Arvind Kejriwal Home Money Wall St Weekahead-Investors look to global growth for earnings power Shares1 Sat, 8 Apr 2017-12:47am , Reuters America First may be a main policy of the White House and fuel to the stock market rally but U.S. investors are looking overseas for stronger earnings as S&P 500 companies are set to report their first quarter of double-digit profit gains since 2014. A strong earnings season would help justify pricey stock valuations, with the S&P 500 rallying this month to its most expensive since 2004 on a forward price-to-earnings basis. While the U.S. economy has gotten a lot of attention since the Nov. 8 election and President Donald Trump's vows to boost the domestic economy, data during the quarter has suggested the global economy is strengthening. That is welcome news for S&P components, since nearly half of their sales come from overseas. Shares of the biggest U.S. companies, which tend to have the most overseas exposure, have been among the strongest performers over the past several weeks. For instance, the S&P 500 has outperformed its average stock this year since mid-February, after performing mostly in line at the beginning of the year. [http://www.bit.ly/2oQPVXF ] "The fact that we're seeing stabilization in the global community will bode well for multinational companies and help earnings for the first quarter," said Terry Sandven, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "You've also seen the dollar not appreciate as much as many had forecast a quarter ago, so multinational companies may get some relief on the (foreign exchange) line," he said. A weaker dollar boosts offshore revenues when they are translated into the U.S. currency. The U.S. dollar index was down 1.8 percent in the first quarter, but it was still cheaper during last year's first quarter. STRONGER DATA AS EARNINGS LOOM A survey this week showed euro zone business activity at a six-year high. Forecasts from the International Monetary Fund show a pickup in the global economy in 2017 and 2018, especially in developing economies. However, some investors worry multinationals may have already priced in big gains in earnings. "As long as nothing changes, these firms are going to be fine," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, speaking of the strength of the largest American companies. He warned, however, that stock prices may have taken in any good news. "The market has certainly fully discounted all that." The U.S. earnings season gets under way next week, with results from banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among others. The financial sector is projected to post a 15.4 percent profit gain, second only to energy among S&P sectors. Energy companies, which carried most of the losses that extended an S&P 500 earnings recession until the second quarter of last year, are expected to do most of the heavy lifting this earnings season with a whopping 600 percent increase. For the entire S&P 500, analysts are projecting earnings up 10.1 percent compared with a year ago, which would be the first double-digit increase since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1 percent. Revenue is expected to have jumped 7 percent, the most since 2011, which should help compensate for higher wage and other costs facing companies, strategists said. "We're seeing revenues contribute materially more to that bottom-line growth," said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Big profit gains are expected in technology and materials as well, the data showed. "It comes down to a synchronized global economic acceleration ...; a rebound and stabilization in commodity prices and a higher interest rate environment," Palfrey said.

Photos Videos Topics Live SL 131/10 (18) - BAN 176/9 (20) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kishori Amonkar Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Yogi Adityanath Arvind Kejriwal Home Money WRAPUP 6-Weather dampens U.S. job growth; unemployment rate drops to 4.5 pct Shares1 Sat, 8 Apr 2017-12:31am , Reuters U.S. job growth slowed sharply in March amid continued layoffs in the embattled retail sector, but a drop in the unemployment rate to a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent suggested labor market strength remained intact. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last May, the Labor Department said on Friday. Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unseasonably warm temperatures earlier in the year. In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast and Midwest. Economists said bad weather accounted for the stepdown in hiring. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007. "The disappointing gain in nonfarm payrolls in March is a bit of a head fake that doesn't reflect the underlying strength and momentum in the labor market," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month, the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472,000. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population and some Federal Reserve officials view the labor market as being at full employment. Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent. The dollar rose a three-week high against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose. LABOR MARKET SLACK SHRINKING Job growth averaged 178,000 per month in the first quarter, underscoring the labor market's strength, despite last month's stumble. The solid employment gains suggest that an apparent slowdown in gross domestic product growth to around a 1.0 percent annualized pace in the first quarter is probably temporary. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0.2 percent in March after rising 0.3 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year gain in wages to 2.7 percent. But with inflation rising and the unemployment rate below the most recent Fed median forecast for full employment, economists expect another interest rate increase in June. The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more increases this year. Minutes from the Fed's mid-March meeting showed most policymakers expected to start reducing the Fed's $4.5 trillion bond portfolio later this year. New York Fed President William Dudley said on Friday that would prompt only a "little pause" in the central bank's rate hike plans. "If today's decline in the unemployment rate doesn't reverse itself they may be compelled not only to hike but also to signal a faster pace of future tightening," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Other measures also showed labor market slack shrinking. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at an 11-month high of 63 percent in March. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 8.9 percent, the lowest level since December 2007. The employment-to-population ratio increased one-tenth of a percentage point to a fresh eight-year high of 60.1 percent. Last month, construction jobs rose 6,000, the weakest gain since August, after robust increases in January and February. Manufacturing employment advanced by 11,000 jobs, slowing from the 26,000 positions created in February. Retail payrolls fell 29,700, declining for a second straight month. Employment at clothing retailers decreased by 5,800 jobs last month and general merchandise stores shed 34,700 positions. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy's Inc have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations. Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased 9,000, a third of February's job gains, as employment at amusement parks fell 6,900. Government payrolls increased 9,000 as state and local government hiring offset a 1,000 drop in federal jobs.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Syndication. Updated April 7, 2017 9:25AM SHARE ALSO SEE YouTube Fake News Alphabet Online Advertising YouTube announced Thursday it is cracking down on fake news channels by no longer placing advertising on them until they've reached 10,000 overall views. YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., also the parent company of Google, announced changes after several big companies pulled their advertising from the company because their ads were appearing with objectionable content. The online video service said the changes are designed to make sure channels are legitimate and not stealing content. "We will no longer serve ads on YPP videos until the channel reaches 10K lifetime views," Ariel Bardin, vice president of product management, said in a statement. "This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10K views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10K views up until today will not be impacted." YouTube is also adding a review process for creators to join the YouTube Partner Program, which began in 2007. "After a creator hits 10K lifetime views on their channel, we'll review their activity against our policies," Bardin said. "If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules." The company, in an effort to help creators reach 10,000, will offer tips on "making great original content and growing your audience." "We want creators of all sizes to find opportunity on YouTube, and we believe this new application process will help ensure creator revenue continues to grow and end up in the right hands," Bardin said. In the past, the open-ended policy allowed amateur video creators to earn money and some work became viral and earned a considerable amount. Several advertisers, including Walmart, General Motors, JPMorgan Chase, Pepsico, Starbucks and Johnson & Johnson, pulled out of YouTube after their ads appeared in extremist hate-speech videos. On March 24, the head of the Association of National Advertisers, which represents 1,000 companies that spend more than $250 billion in marketing and advertising each year, urged Google to change its policy. "ANA strongly believes that brand safety is of paramount importance to our members," Bob Liodice said in statement. "The current crisis is representative of the issues that ANA -- and others -- have raised with respect to fraud and risk, reduced transparency, sub-optimum measurement and nebulous productivity." YouTube didn't say how many accounts would be affected by the change. Advertisers pay roughly $7 to $12 for 1,000 views and creators split the money with YouTube, The Wall Street Journal reported. "What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match," Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said last month in an interview with Fox Business Network. YouTube has more than a billion users and as of last July, it had paid out $2 billion to rightsholders, the company said on its website. © 2017 UPI Top Stories syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Updated April 06, 2017. Facebook is launching a resource to help you spot false news and misleading information that spreads on its service. The resource, similar to previous efforts around privacy and security, is basically a notification that pops up for a few days. Clicking on it takes you to tips and other information on how to spot false news and what to do about it. Tips to spot false news include looking closely at website addresses to see if they are trying to spoof real news sites, and checking websites' "about" sections for more information. Some sites might look like real news at first glance, but their "about" sections inform the visitor that they are in fact satire. Adam Mosseri, vice president of News Feed at Facebook, said he hopes people will become "more discerning consumers" of news. The new feature is part of a broader plan by Facebook to clamp down false news stories, which gained outsized attention in the months leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. False news, of course, was around long before the election. But supermarket tabloids peddling stories about aliens and celebrity miracles are less insidious than, say, "Pizzagate," a false internet rumor that led a gunman to fire an assault weapon inside a Washington pizzeria in December. Facebook has been "working very hard to figure out how to get their arms wrapped around this," said Lucy Dalglish, journalism dean at the University of Maryland. "Facebook was always very interested technology but not the social and civic implications of technology. It's like they have become citizens." She praised the company for seeking help from outside experts, including academics, researchers and nonprofit journalism organizations. The company, for instance, is working with outside fact-checking and media organizations to identify false news as such. And once they are identified, Facebook is trying to dry up the "economic incentives" of false news sites by making it difficult for them to buy ads on Facebook. Mosseri said most of the false news content on Facebook is from spammers trying to seek a profit and not, for example, political propaganda. This is apparent as the sites often flip-flop around opposing political candidates, for example. The new feature will be available in 14 countries, including the U.S., Germany, France, Italy, the U.K., Philippines, Taiwan and Brazil. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

"We will no longer serve ads on YPP videos until the channel reaches 10K lifetime views," Ariel Bardin, vice president of product management, said in a statement. "This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10K views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10K views up until today will not be impacted." YouTube is also adding a review process for creators to join the YouTube Partner Program, which began in 2007. "After a creator hits 10K lifetime views on their channel, we'll review their activity against our policies," Bardin said. "If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules." The company, in an effort to help creators reach 10,000, will offer tips on "making great original content and growing your audience." "We want creators of all sizes to find opportunity on YouTube, and we believe this new application process will help ensure creator revenue continues to grow and end up in the right hands," Bardin said. In the past, the open-ended policy allowed amateur video creators to earn money and some work became viral and earned a considerable amount. Several advertisers, including Walmart, General Motors, JPMorgan Chase, Pepsico, Starbucks and Johnson & Johnson, pulled out of YouTube after their ads appeared in extremist hate-speech videos. On March 24, the head of the Association of National Advertisers, which represents 1,000 companies that spend more than $250 billion in marketing and advertising each year, urged Google to change its policy. "ANA strongly believes that brand safety is of paramount importance to our members," Bob Liodice said in statement. "The current crisis is representative of the issues that ANA -- and others -- have raised with respect to fraud and risk, reduced transparency, sub-optimum measurement and nebulous productivity." YouTube didn't say how many accounts would be affected by the change. Advertisers pay roughly $7 to $12 for 1,000 views and creators split the money with YouTube, The Wall Street Journal reported. "What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match," Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said last month in an interview with Fox Business Network. YouTube has more than a billion users and as of last July, it had paid out $2 billion to rightsholders, the company said on its website. © 2017 UPI Top Stories under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Yahoo and AOL To Become 'Oath' Next Article > Facebook Launches Resource To Help Spot Misleading News By Barbara Ortutay PUBLISHED: APRIL 06 2017 Facebook is launching a resource to help you spot false news and misleading information that spreads on its service. The resource, similar to previous efforts around privacy and security, is basically a notification that pops up for a few days. Clicking on it takes you to tips and other information on how to spot false news and what to do about it. Tips to spot false news include looking closely at website addresses to see if they are trying to spoof real news sites, and checking websites' "about" sections for more information. Some sites might look like real news at first glance, but their "about" sections inform the visitor that they are in fact satire. Adam Mosseri, vice president of News Feed at Facebook, said he hopes people will become "more discerning consumers" of news. The new feature is part of a broader plan by Facebook to clamp down false news stories, which gained outsized attention in the months leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. False news, of course, was around long before the election. But supermarket tabloids peddling stories about aliens and celebrity miracles are less insidious than, say, "Pizzagate," a false internet rumor that led a gunman to fire an assault weapon inside a Washington pizzeria in December. Facebook has been "working very hard to figure out how to get their arms wrapped around this," said Lucy Dalglish, journalism dean at the University of Maryland. "Facebook was always very interested technology but not the social and civic implications of technology. It's like they have become citizens." She praised the company for seeking help from outside experts, including academics, researchers and nonprofit journalism organizations. The company, for instance, is working with outside fact-checking and media organizations to identify false news as such. And once they are identified, Facebook is trying to dry up the "economic incentives" of false news sites by making it difficult for them to buy ads on Facebook. Mosseri said most of the false news content on Facebook is from spammers trying to seek a profit and not, for example, political propaganda. This is apparent as the sites often flip-flop around opposing political candidates, for example. The new feature will be available in 14 countries, including the U.S., Germany, France, Italy, the U.K., Philippines, Taiwan and Brazil. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Photos Videos Topics Live SL 131/10 (18) - BAN 176/9 (20) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kishori Amonkar Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Yogi Adityanath Arvind Kejriwal Home Money WRAPUP 5-Weather dampens U.S. job growth; unemployment rate dives to 4.5 percent Shares1 Fri, 7 Apr 2017-10:54pm , Reuters U.S. job growth slowed sharply in March amid continued layoffs in the embattled retail sector, but a drop in the unemployment rate to a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent suggested labor market strength remained intact. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last May, the Labor Department said on Friday. Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unseasonably warm temperatures earlier in the year. In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast and Midwest. Economists said bad weather accounted for the stepdown in hiring. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007. "The disappointing gain in nonfarm payrolls in March is a bit of a head fake that doesn't reflect the underlying strength and momentum in the labor market," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month, the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472,000. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population and some Federal Reserve officials view the labor market as being at full employment. Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt increased marginally, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed. LABOR MARKET SLACK SHRINKING Job growth averaged 178,000 per month in the first quarter, underscoring the labor market's strength, despite last month's stumble. The solid employment gains suggest that an apparent slowdown in gross domestic product growth to around a 1.0 percent annualized pace in the first quarter is probably temporary. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0.2 percent in March after rising 0.3 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year gain in wages to 2.7 percent. But with inflation rising and the unemployment rate below the most recent Fed median forecast for full employment, economists expect another interest rate increase in June. The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more hikes this year. Policymakers have said they would look at how to reduce the Fed's portfolio of bond holdings later this year. "If today's decline in the unemployment rate doesn't reverse itself they may be compelled not only to hike but also to signal a faster pace of future tightening," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Other measures also showed labor market slack shrinking. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at an 11-month high of 63 percent in March. A broad measure of unemployment, that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 8.9 percent, the lowest level since December 2007. The employment-to-population ratio increased one-tenth of a percentage point to a fresh eight-year high of 60.1 percent. Last month, construction jobs rose 6,000, the weakest gain since August, after robust increases in January and February. Manufacturing employment advanced by 11,000 jobs, slowing from the 26,000 positions created in February. Retail payrolls fell 29,700, declining for a second straight month. Employment at clothing retailers declined by 5,800 jobs last month and general merchandise stores shed 34,700 positions. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy's Inc have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations. Temporary-help jobs, a harbinger for future hiring, increased 10,500. Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased 9,000, a third of February's job gains, as employment at amusement parks fell 6,900. Government payrolls increased 9,000 as state and local government hiring offset a 1,000 drop in federal jobs.

The survey focuses on Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa. Nearly 1 in 5 respondents would be prepared to act unethically if it would benefit them and 2 in 5 believe their colleagues would also do so. The report states that the current world events line up with the feeling of discontent that comes from the results of the survey this year. "Businesses are operating in an increasingly uncertain world driven by a period of rapid political, regulatory, and economic change. This environment has created new risks for companies as they seek to meet ambitious revenue targets." There has been an effort to crack down on fraud and unethical business behavior in recent months. In March the UK Supreme Court ruled [JURIST report] on Wednesday that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) did not misidentify former JPMorgan official Achilles Macris in its penalty notice in connection with the "London Whale" Scandal.

Since the U.S. elections, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) rose as much as 25%. The underlying bullish thesis has been built on the hopes of fewer regulations and higher rates. The steep rally suggests that there was a situation of gross sector mispricing that needed correcting. Source: Tim Evans Via Unsplash The ongoing debate on Wall Street is whether we priced in too much bank “hopium.” There are strong opinions on both sides of the argument, but I bet that somewhere in the middle lies the truth. That will be the basis of my trades today: I want to sell risk against both extremes of the bull and bear cases in U.S. financial equities for the next few months. I usually stick to trading the cream of the crop. So I will share setups in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS). I will also write blanket spreads in the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF). 3 Stocks That Aren’t Sweating a Syria Conflict The main idea here is to create income from a range in prices. The fundamental cases for both JPM and GS are beyond doubt. The same can be said about the XLF since most other U.S. banks have been fortified well for the next financial debacle.

Among those other are factors is the first-quarter earnings, which kicks off in earnest for the financial sector next week. Some analysts and traders argue that investors should be careful in making bullish bets on the financial services space, the S&P 500’s second-largest sector allocation, leading up to earnings season. In fact, analysts currently are not all that enthusiastic regarding bank stocks. “One standout sentiment analysis factor for bank stocks has been the steep decline in the number of “buy” ratings among analysts,” according to Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “For example, the percentage of “buy” recommendations for stocks that fall under our “Banks” umbrella currently sits at just 36% — tied for the lowest among all of the 36 sectors we track. This is a sharp decline from 54% “buy” ratings at this time last year.” Some bank stocks are more beloved than others as highlighted by some recent analyst chatter. KBW has mixed views on first-quarter results for some of XLF’s biggest holdings. The research firm is “raising first-quarter earnings estimates for Bank of New York Mellon (BK), State Street (STT), and Wells Fargo (WFC). He is lowering estimates for Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS),” according to part of a KBW note posted by Crystal Kim of Barron’s. However, some traders and investors are expressing concerns that the Trump trade is overbought, which makes the equities market vulnerable to quick turns. Some are worried that House Republicans may not garner the necessary votes to replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, further fueling concerns over Trump’s ability to pass his planned tax cuts and deregulation initiatives, which have been supporting the recent bounce in the financial sector. “If analyst sentiment on bank stocks, as measured by “buy” ratings, is once again in the process of moving higher from this extreme low, it stands to reason that future upgrades could be a positive catalyst for the group,” according to Schaeffer’s. Some strategists also argue that the financial sector may be a good area to look at this time around, given the potential for growth in a rising rate environment, along with potential tax and regulatory changes under the Donald Trump administration.

Posted 07 Apr 2017 19:50 Updated 08 Apr 2017 05:30 Traders work inside a post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 30, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street's three major indexes edged lower on Friday in a choppy session as investors grappled with a weaker-than-expected job report, the U.S. airstrike in Syria and a top Federal Reserve official's comments on trimming the U.S. central bank's balance sheet. Investors were trying to work out how the developments would affect U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to proceed with his pro-business agenda. The market rallied sharply after Trump's Nov. 8 election on his promises for tax cuts, spending and lighter regulation, but investors increasingly have been questioning whether the proposals would ever materialize. "You had so many confusing things happening today. The employment number was certainly surprising. The U.S. airstrike was surprising. People were trying to figure out what that meant," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.85 points, or 0.03 percent, at 20,656.1, the S&P 500 lost 1.95 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,355.54 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.14 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,877.81. All three indexes ended slightly lower for the week. Six of the S&P's 11 major sectors ended down on the day. U.S. employers added about 98,000 jobs in March, the fewest since last May and well below economists' expectation of 180,000, as bad weather hit construction hiring. However, wage growth edged up and unemployment fell. New York Fed President William Dudley on Friday shed more light on the U.S. central bank's developing plan for when to stop replacing bonds that expire in its portfolio, how to execute it, and how far it would ultimately shrink its balance sheet. U.S. Treasury yields rose after Dudley's remarks, which helped push equities lower, according to Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions, at Voya Investment Management in New York. LibertyView's Meckler said Dudley's remarks were not earth-shattering but "small statements are having a magnified affect because investors are worried." The United States, in a pre-dawn strike, fired missiles at an airfield from which it said a deadly poison gas attack was launched this week. In the coming days it "will be interesting to watch to see if (Syria) does grab more attention from the White House and delay some of these other issues and programs they are trying to get passed through here," said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Omaha, Nebraska said. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and two new lows. The Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 46 new lows. About 5.97 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Friday compared with the 6.75 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

About 98,000 jobs were added in the U.S. public and private sector in March, a Labor Department report showed, far lower than a revised 219,000 added in February and economists' expectation of 180,000. The unemployment rate for March fell to 4.5 percent, while average earnings were flat at 0.2 percent. Dow e-minis were down 48 points, or 0.23 percent, with 55,812 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were down 6.25 points, or 0.27 percent, with 322,509 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 11.5 points, or 0.21 percent, on volume of 60,792 contracts. Shares of U.S. banks, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan were down more than 1 percent each premarket. Stock index futures were already under pressure after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a targeted military strike against an airfield in Syria from which a deadly chemical attack was launched this week. However, futures had pared back after U.S. officials described the attack as a one-off that would not lead to wider escalation. Among defense stocks, Raytheon, which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles used in the strike, was up 3.1 percent. Lockheed Martin was up 1.4 percent.

KANSAS CITY, MO - April 7, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ -- Leading authority in acquisitions development and U.S. real estate, Chris Kamberis is the Founder of CTK Group, who took a firm stance in founding the Ladybird Style Lab in the Crossroads District community of Kansas City, Missouri - an establishment designed to work for the benefit of thousands of people in the area. Founded in 2010 by Molly Bingaman, Ladybird Styling offers wardrobe consulting and clothing amenities to men and women. With the addition of new Director of Operations, Rachel Doescher, Ladybird will launch the Style Lab's storefront on Southwest Boulevard, in the Crossroads District in late May.

Bingaman is honored by the help from CTK Group and Kamberis, who helped her obtain a property that maximizes exposure for her talents. "We wanted to be in the Crossroads because it's the center of creativity and innovation in Kansas City, and we aimed to resonate with--and amplify--that signal." She described Kamberis as going "above and beyond to support us throughout the lengthy process of lease finalizations and built-out." He acquired the ideal location on a corner that is surrounded by more energy every day. Today, Kansas City locals can visit the Style Lab for a fresh and new start on their appearance, with professionals who cater to the personal needs of its clientele. They offer specific, curated, inventory in a full range of sizes, with a hair and makeup salon that makes The Ladybird Style Lab a unique service intended to determine what best works on an individual.

The announcement came as the company also reported a meager 1% rise in net income for the fiscal year ending Feb. 28 of 73.55 billion yen ($665 million). In certain states in the U.S., 24-hour private convenience super-store, gas station businesses - that resemble tiny grocery stores - are taking over. In an effort to compete, 7-Eleven has said it is trying to grow its number of locations in the U.S. and Canada to 10,000 by February 2020 from 8,700 currently - a lot more than the mere hundreds that its competitors boast - and boost its average daily merchandise sales to $5,000 per store. 7-Eleven's move comes at a time when millennials are choosing to shop for groceries at convenience stores where milk, fresh produce and meals are sold, rather than actual food stores, JPMorgan Chase said in a recent report called "Why gas stations may be the new grocery stores." "Millennials turn to convenience stores to refuel more than their car," Chase said. If 7-Eleven continues to expand its footprint and transform into a grocery destination like its rivals, several private companies could start to lose their dominating power in the U.S. After all, 7-Eleven operates 15,600 stores in 18 countries and just tacked on an additional 1,108 gas stations and shops with its Sunoco purchase.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Ten years ago last week, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testified before the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress.  While that particular day is remembered for his prepared remarks about subprime being contained, it was other facets of his testimony that deserve our remembrance and scrutiny.  Subprime wasn’t ever contained, nor would it ever have been, but that was truly just a very small part of how the last lost decade has unfolded.  You would think that it would have been the Federal Reserve’s job to understand the housing bubble, but that’s not how it works.  Any central bank views itself as an agent under monetary neutrality, which simply means the central bank sets monetary policy and the market, so-called, does whatever it does from there.  Using inflation, unemployment, and other economic factors as a guide, monetary policy shifts when those economic arrangements fall out of whatever bounds it sets for itself.  From this perspective, the housing bubble was a market event not a monetary one. If that sounds surprisingly irrational that is because we have been conditioned since Paul Volcker’s Fed to believe that monetary officials are the wisest of stewards.  By its own rules, there was nothing particularly disturbing about the middle 2000’s.  The Fed knew that the housing market was well outside of historical bounds, but, again, that was from their view a market choice; consumer inflation as well as unemployment all remained within their boundaries for good conduct. FOMC members had already raised the possibility in June 2003 that there was “something” missing from their set of rules and assumptions.  Drawing largely from experience during the 1990’s, it had come to be believed that simplicity was operative, and fruitfully so.  The Fed would adjust merely the federal funds target rate in order to steer the economy into its inflation/unemployment zones.  From 1992 until Bernanke’s testimony at the end of March 2007, the US economy had experienced only one extremely mild recession and all within a period of unusually low consumer price inflation. Calling it the Great “Moderation”, Bernanke in particular therefore showed no capacity for anything beyond this convention, even after the experience of the dot-com bubble and bust.  In 2015, he told an audience at LPL’s conference that he left Princeton’s Economics Department where he was Chair and where he expected to be an “academic lifer” because of 9-11.  He wanted to get into public service “to help people live better lives.”  Even contemporary, however, the term “moderation” struck a contradictory chord particularly with the public.  The very nature of housing as tech stocks advertised more than the academic settings. Bernanke’s tenure at the Fed was no different than his university career, thus keeping with his expectation to be one throughout.  If his motivation was to help people, he never showed the slightest inclination that perhaps he might not know how.  His testimony at the end of the first quarter in 2007 was a perfect example of this rigidity, one which his disposition fit perfectly within the institutional bubble of the Federal Reserve as a whole. What was most interesting and truly relevant about his appearance back then was how it relayed the Fed’s dilemma at that time as policymakers saw it.  Clearly there were growing uncertainties centered on housing; earlier in February 2007 several financial institutions, especially HSBC, had rocked the Street with forecasts and projections that raised the possibility subprime wasn’t contained at all.  Then on February 27, stocks dropped sharply, the Dow down 416 points that single day.  Suddenly everyone was talking about shadows, the first suggestions that there actually was an undiscovered wilderness out there somewhere way beyond the borders of acceptable Economics. But to the rules of monetary policy in effect, there was as much if not more to worry about on the upside as the downside.  As Bernanke said, “We are looking for a bit more flexibility, given the uncertainties that we are facing and the risks that are occurring on both sides of our outlook.” In the orthodox textbook, there is only supposed to be one or the other, a binary view where inflation and unemployment are to some great extent mutually exclusive.  This Phillips Curve basis had been updated after the economic experience of the 1970’s proved it invalid, but here again was the Fed expecting that very same tradeoff.  Largely due to that view, it was the baseline expectation for monetary policy that what would happen from that point forward was something like normalization.  Bernanke, in his prepared remarks, claimed, “Economic growth in the United States has slowed in recent quarters, reflecting in part the economy’s transition from the rapid rate of expansion experienced over the preceding years to a more sustainable pace of growth.” If you view inflation as a tradeoff for unemployment or vice versa, then his would have seemed the most idyllic if not downright ideal scenario.  Rising inflation pressures would offset some of the negative financial forces from subprime or the reduced activity in housing. Conversely, a slower overall economic pace even with downside risks (which the Fed believed easily handled if needed) and uncertainties could be counted on to balance out those inflation pressures before they got too far.  It is therefore established that Ben Bernanke got everything wrong over the last decade.  All of it.  He admits today that he was way off on only subprime, telling the same LPL conference, “Not my best call.”  But that was just the beginning, not the end.  Starting with those inflation pressures, the Federal Reserve’s view of them were simply inappropriate in every way that should have been recognized as a fatal error.  The CPI or PCE Deflator was not moving upward based on economic strength but through continuing monetary debasement – a continuation of the “weak dollar” paradigm that was in reality offshore monetary expansion.  During the housing bubble period, going all the way back to the mid-1990’s, the eurodollar system expanded in two directions (well, more than two, but for sake of simplicity we can generalize two) simultaneously – the first in the form of consumer debt, subprime mortgages and beyond flowing to the developed world; the second in the form of emerging market debt, focused on overseas economic “miracles” particularly China. The role of the eurodollar system was to create and sustain the flow of monetary (like) resources so that these two channels would be maintained in perpetuity.  It seemed like a perfectly stable system ready to do just that, eurodollar to debt to economy, but only if you viewed it as Bernanke did by traditional, overly narrow parameters.  Calling them the shadows was and is misleading, because by the end (of the growth phase) the shadows were an order of magnitude and possibly two larger than the visible monetary or even banking system. Because these were a collection of often very different pieces, for a time it sustained itself by compartmentalizing.  The mortgage finance piece was becoming a drag, but onward flowed the EM part without any interruption.  In many ways, the latter actually intensified the more it was revealed just how wrong Bernanke had been; it had always been believed though never actually established or even tested that should the offshore system start to fail the Federal Reserve would be able to stand behind it. Thus, the more the Fed started to do, the more the “weak dollar” acted as if the Fed would overdo.  Oil prices, in particular, skyrocketed as the only real impetus for consumer prices during that time. It would only last until July 2008, however, as even the “weak dollar” could not sustain itself due to the immense damage being done way beyond subprime.  The internals of the system, bank balance sheet capacity, had been so reduced as to be unable to provide sufficient monetary resources to anything.  That meant that though the CPI registered 5.6% in July 2008, it was nothing like the positive offset Bernanke had only a year before been counting on for ideal balance.  In fact, it would take just five months for the CPI to go from that seemingly overheating level to zero, and just three months more to fall below it.  The reason monetary policy defines price stability as 2% inflation, for the PCE Deflator rather than the CPI, is actually for this very situation.  It had been modeled, regressed and math-ed to death that 2% was enough margin for any central bank to get in gear and respond to any monetary threat before it could become so devastating - as in late 2008 and early 2009.  Another monetary principle had been shattered and obliterated.  The US economy experienced sharply accelerating inflation and rising unemployment, and then deflation and sharply accelerating unemployment – all the while, the FOMC transcripts reveal, policymakers stood surprisingly aghast and befuddled. And yet, all attention and focus afterward would be placed on the Fed’s version of “jobs saved.”  In other words, though the economy was by late 2008 left to suffer its fate quite directly against everything orthodox economics believed was ever possible, Bernanke would fashion himself with the aid of politics and the media the hero – the Great “Recession” wasn’t a second Great Depression.  But was that actually the case?  There is no comparing the down leg or contraction phase this time to then, for the level of economic and monetary destruction in the early 1930’s might never be equaled again let alone surpassed.  But a depression is not merely that one part.  What made the Great Depression was its interminable duration; no matter what the Fed or federal government did to push the economy back to life it was never enough.  The US economy had stopped contracting, as did the global economy, but the restoration of plus signs to economic accounts and even price changes did more to obscure the full extent of the damage than to signify recovery.  The one imbalance that would define that period was idle labor.  In 1929, the total US labor force measured just over 48 million people. Of those, 46.2 million were employed in one way or another.  By 1932, the labor force had expanded to 50.3 million, but by then only 38 million had jobs. From 1934 to 1937, in just four years, 8 million jobs were added back, but 8 million wasn’t nearly enough. Three million more Americans had come of age and entered the labor force during that time.  It was the events of 1937, however, that really made the Great Depression stick.  All of that forward momentum was lost, even though it had been too “shallow” up to that point already.  The Federal Reserve badly misconstrued financial liquidity preferences as latent inflation pressures building during what it thought was a full and honest recovery.  Banks through the experience of the crash and seeing that monetary authorities were unreliable began holding a large proportion of excess reserves.  Thinking those reserves might be put to use, the FOMC voted in December 1935 to by the end of 1936 raise the level of required reserves in order to circumvent their use; and instead created an enormous monetary backlash as banks rebuilt their excess reserves anyway and in doing so created the economic setback that ended the recovery direction until WWII. By the end of 1939, there were slightly less Americans working than in 1929, but the labor force had grown by 7.5 million people during that decade.  In 21st century terms, the US economy had a participation problem. The only difference between now and then on these terms is that by today’s standards the Bureau of Labor Statistics would have excluded the vast majority of those 7.5 million from the official labor force due to bureaucratic rules about who is defined as officially part of the labor force.  As of the latest BLS estimates, there are as many as 15 million Americans who are “missing” in just that way, omitted from the labor force count because the economy has not recovered and in all likelihood never will (at least until all those who think and act like Bernanke are ousted from positions of influence).  We have even suffered our own “1937” just recently to further establish the depression template, so to speak.  The “rising dollar” from June 2014 to February 2016 was in many ways the same kind of resulting downtrend due to liquidity preferences as in 1937 and 1938. Banks all over the world retrenched, some dramatically.  I have little doubt it was the combination of fragility with volatility, the worst possible condition for susceptible balance sheets.  Some refuse to consider it was anything other than regulations.  Even if I was to stipulate that was the case, on this point it would make no difference anyway for it was regulation in 1937 that accomplished the same result.  Whatever ultimately the cause, the “rising dollar” killed the recovery in the same was as 1937 terminated all hopes for a direct line out of the Great Depression. You need not take my word for it alone, as this is the position of Federal Reserve as well as monetary officials from around the world.  They refuse to clarify it publicly, of course, preferring instead to quietly refer to the “skills mismatch” or the related low and even possibly negative R*.  All of which adds up to something like secular stagnation, which in truth is nothing more than depression without official explanation of its origin and pathology.  In October 2014, JP Morgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon confidently declared, “I’m a real long-term bull on the US economy.”  That wasn’t an unusual or especially brave position, for it was the default forecast of practically every economist and policymaker around the world at that time.  Like Bernanke in 2007, Janet Yellen around then talked more about the risks of overheating than lingering “headwinds”, though they remained.  Even into early 2015, our true 1937, Fed officials like Yellen were still rationalizing crashing oil prices as if some kind of enormous consumer benefit that would offset growing (and painfully obvious) global weakness, almost a mirror image of the early stages of the Great “Recession.” Just this week, however, Mr. Dimon declares he is no longer so bullish.  The events of these past few years have apparently been enough to, like policymakers, disabuse all notions of recovery.  In his 45-page annual letter to JPM shareholders, the bank’s CEO now says, “there is something wrong with the US economy.”  Outside of Economics, banking, and politics, his summation was met with a resounding “you just figured that out?” What’s perhaps most important about his sudden reckoning is that he looks everywhere else for its cause.  This is much the same problem as with Federal Reserve and indeed all global central bank authorities who do the very same, a tradition that started in Congress on March 28, 2007.  The last place any of them will look for answers is within.  For JP Morgan, there are any number of balance sheet figures that show the bank’s part in all of this, from 2007 to the “rising dollar.”  For one, there are its liquidity preferences as defined in the most traditional way – “cash due” and “deposits with others”, a category that includes JPM’s reserve account at the Fed.  In 2007, only 3% of the bank’s assets were in cash, down just slightly from an average of 4.1% over the prior six years.  It jumped to 7.6% in 2008, which only makes sense, but then fell back to 2.3% in 2010 despite QE1 – or actually because of it. In other words, it seems very likely JPM was confident enough in the effects of QE toward establishing recovery and a return to pre-crisis conditions so as to hold so little cash so close to panic.  That was maintained only to 2011 and resumption of the same monetary problems that have never been resolved.  The proportion of cash hit 6.4% in 2011, then 7.4% in 2012, nearly the same relative balance as during the worst of the crisis.  Rather than remove this idle liquidity in response to the third and fourth QE’s, JPM’s balance sheet at the end of 2014 would be 19.9% cash (only some due to regulatory changes).  The proportion has declined somewhat due to efforts in early 2015 to restrict institutions holding their cash balances at the bank. As of the end of last year, JPM still shows 15.6% of its assets as cash. In the more esoteric and relevant monetary facets, JP Morgan’s behavior is exactly the same relating to liquidity preferences.  As with any wholesale or shadow bank, both sides of its balance sheet include basic wholesale formats like repo and federal funds.  Because of its place at the center of the triparty repo system, JPM had historically drawn in more funds from these channels than it sent back out (greater repo and federal funds liabilities than assets).  At one extreme, in 2002, the bank at year’s end took in $169 billion in funding, 22% of its total asset base, while forwarding just $65.8 billion back into the monetary system. It’s a bold position expressing confidence in being able to maintain funding in this way. At the end of 2006, the balance sheet was more balanced, with a net intake of $21 billion.  Over the next two years of panic, that position reversed with JPM lending out funds in greater quantity than it took in.  In 2009 and 2010, that reversed again so that JPM was net taking $66 billion and $54 billion, respectively, in those years.  Not only that, the volume had grown considerably especially in 2009 and 2010.  Where the bank showed $154 billion repo and federal funds liabilities at the end of 2007, it reported $276 billion at the end of 2010 – in keeping with its very low cash proportion, and thus minimal liquidity preferences. As with cash allocations, all that changed (again) in 2011.  The bank has funded less and less through wholesale liabilities, starting with 2011 where its balance fell sharply to $213 billion due to the renewed shadow crisis.  As of Q4 2016, JPM reports just $165 billion and a net outflow of $64 billion into wholesale money markets.  The bank’s total balance sheet has grown by just 14.5% over the eight years since the end of 2008, and just 5.6% since the end of 2012 and the last of the QE’s.  In the eight years up to Q4 2008, JPM’s balance sheet expanded by 204% including mergers.  Of all the major global banks, JP Morgan is actually rare for its experience with even that level of reduced growth.  By and large, its peers have tended toward outright reduction.  In terms of risk capacity, however, JP Morgan has been no different than the others.  At the end of 2008, JPM reported $88 trillion in total notional derivatives, a level slightly more than the $84.9 trillion it showed at the end of 2007 but actually considerably less when figuring the $14.2 trillion added in Q1 2008 when Bear Stearns was absorbed.  As of the latest quarter at the end of 2016, the bank reports just $47.5 trillion, about half its Q1 2008 combined notional exposure.  Between 2001 and 2008, JPM’s derivative book quadrupled. In the 1930’s, liquidity preferences among banks meant an enormous loss of deposit capacity, the money multiplier of the traditional system.  It was not even for its time unduly low, it was but a paradigm shift in difference from how banks and money had behaved in the 1910’s and especially 1920’s.  In the 2010’s, liquidity preferences among banks mean an enormous loss of wholesale capacity in all forms, the monetary capacity regime of the shadow system.  It may not even for today be unduly low, but it is a paradigm shift in difference from how banks and money had behaved in the 1990’s and especially 2000’s.  Such an enormous break in monetary capacity has at both times provided the force for dislocation rather than recession.  The economy shrinks in its contraction phase and then never goes back.  On both occasions, growth of some residue does resume after the downturn, but it is both insufficient as well as, owing to liquidity preferences, highly unstable.  In the end, what makes both depressions is that the economy at both times nets out going nowhere for those monetary differences and especially where labor utilization is concerned. The difference to the 1930’s is degree, not type.  Therefore what Ben Bernanke failed to see and appreciate a decade ago is what Jamie Dimon now finally does.  That it took Mr. Dimon so long to finally get there demonstrates what neither he nor Bernanke are able to grasp; that the chronic “headwinds” of this lost decade originate right within their own sphere.  Ten years ago the pre-eminent economic and monetary official declared that the fallout from subprime was limited because he wasn’t actually either of those things.  It wasn’t contained and still today has yet to be even though we have been through this before.  Jeffrey Snider is the Chief Investment Strategist of Alhambra Investment Partners, a registered investment advisor.  Related Topics: Ben Bernanke, Jamie Dimon, Jeffrey Snider Comment Show commentsHide Comments RCE Log In | Register Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 April 2017 Saudi Aramco to raise US$3bil in debut sukuk sale DUBAI: Saudi Aramco is planning to raise 11.25 billion riyals (US$3bil) from its debut Islamic bond, according to a person with knowledge of the offering, boosting the size of the sale because of investor demand. Aramco, as the world’s largest oil producer is known, is selling the debt with a seven-year tenure in a private placement at 25 basis points over the Saudi interbank offered rate, the person said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The company increased the size of the bond - known as sukuk - after demand exceeded supply, the person said. Aramco was initially seeking to raise about US$2bil under a 37.5 billion-riyal (US$10bil) program, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company had kept the order books open for an additional day, delaying the close to April 4. The oil giant is selling debt ahead of an initial public offering in 2018 as the country’s finance ministry plans to cut taxation on the company, potentially raising its valuation to more than US$1 trillion, according to estimates by Sanford C Bernstein & Co. The cut will boost Aramco’s net income by 300 percent, putting per-barrel income in a range similar to that of international oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp, Bernstein analysts said. Alinma Investment Co, GIB Capital, HSBC Holdings Plc, NCB Capital, Riyad Capital, Samba Capital and Saudi Fransi Capital are arranging the hybrid riyal Islamic bond. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has hired Citigroup Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co as joint lead arrangers to help arrange investor meetings starting next week for a potential dollar sukuk offering. Aramco is also considering setting up a dollar-bond program, people said last year. The closest Saudi Aramco has come in the past to selling debt is a 3.75 billion-riyal sukuk issued by Saudi Aramco Total Refining & Petrochemical Co, a joint venture with France’s Total SA known as Satorp. In 2013, another Saudi Aramco joint venture, Sadara Chemical Co with Dow Chemical Co, raised 7.5 billion riyals through a sukuk to finance a chemicals complex. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: aramco Related Stories Related Stories Behind Saudi Aramco's US$2 trillion valuation Saudi Aramco’s US$7bil investment proves Malaysia not on verge of bankruptcy, says Najib Saudi king’s Asia tour trumpets Aramco’s moves downstream Long deadline for Saudi Aramco deal with Petronas What’s the deal in Rapid?

Once again, the market was unable to hang on to more substantial gains from earlier in the day. Strong reports from companies including L Brands and Bed Bath & Beyond helped retailers. Energy companies rose with the prices of oil and natural gas, and banks recovered some of the sharp losses they took a day ago. The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 98 points early in the afternoon. However high-dividend stocks like utilities skidded and technology companies also fell. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index added 4.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,357.49. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.80 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,662.95. The Nasdaq composite gained 14.47 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,878.95. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks performed far better. It climbed 12.28 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,364.43. About three-fourths of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose Thursday, but stocks are mostly down this week. The Russell 2000 has fallen 1.6 percent. Investors will get an updated picture of the economy in the coming weeks, including the government’s March report on employment Friday. Next week, the Commerce Department will give a report on retailer sales and companies including JPMorgan Chase, Delta Air Lines and Netflix will report their earnings. L Brands jumped $4.75, or 11 percent, to $47.85 after it reported strong March sales. Bed Bath & Beyond surpassed analysts’ earnings estimates and climbed $1.28, or 3.4 percent, to $39.08. Department stores and mall-based retailers like Kohl’s, Nordstrom and Gap traded higher. Discount retailers Fred’s and Five Below made hefty gains after Fred’s announced its own quarterly results. Bond prices recovered from an early decline. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at 2.34 percent. Companies that pay big dividends, like phone companies and utilities, traded lower. Investors often sell those stocks when bond yields rise, as they did earlier in the day. U.S. crude oil added 55 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $51.70 a barrel in New York while Brent crude, the international standard, rose 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.89 a barrel in London. Sunoco climbed after it agreed to sell most of its convenience stores to 7-Eleven. Sunoco will get $3.3 billion and 7-Eleven will acquire 1,100 stores, mostly in the East Coast and Texas. Sunoco also struck a fuel supply deal with a 7-Eleven subsidiary and it plans to sell 200 more convenience stores in a separate deal. Shares of Sunoco jumped $4.83, or 20.2 percent, to $28.69. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.73 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.61 per gallon. Natural gas jumped 7 cents, or 2 percent, to $3.33 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $4.80 to $1,253.30 an ounce. Silver added 6 cents to $18.25 an ounce.

YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., also the parent company of Google, announced changes after several big companies pulled their advertising from the company because their ads were appearing with objectionable content. The online video service said the changes are designed to make sure channels are legitimate and not stealing content. "We will no longer serve ads on YPP videos until the channel reaches 10K lifetime views," Ariel Bardin, vice president of product management, said in a statement. "This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10K views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10K views up until today will not be impacted." YouTube is also adding a review process for creators to join the YouTube Partner Program, which began in 2007. "After a creator hits 10K lifetime views on their channel, we'll review their activity against our policies," Bardin said. "If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules." The company, in an effort to help creators reach 10,000, will offer tips on "making great original content and growing your audience." "We want creators of all sizes to find opportunity on YouTube, and we believe this new application process will help ensure creator revenue continues to grow and end up in the right hands," Bardin said. In the past, the open-ended policy allowed amateur video creators to earn money and some work became viral and earned a considerable amount. Several advertisers, including Walmart, General Motors, JPMorgan Chase, Pepsico, Starbucks and Johnson & Johnson, pulled out of YouTube after their ads appeared in extremist hate-speech videos. On March 24, the head of the Association of National Advertisers, which represents 1,000 companies that spend more than $250 billion in marketing and advertising each year, urged Google to change its policy. "ANA strongly believes that brand safety is of paramount importance to our members," Bob Liodice said in statement. "The current crisis is representative of the issues that ANA — and others — have raised with respect to fraud and risk, reduced transparency, sub-optimum measurement and nebulous productivity." YouTube didn't say how many accounts would be affected by the change. Advertisers pay roughly $7 to $12 for 1,000 views and creators split the money with YouTube, The Wall Street Journal reported. "What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match," Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said last month in an interview with Fox Business Network. YouTube has more than a billion users and as of last July, it had paid out $2 billion to rightsholders, the company said on its website.

As representatives of one of the world’s top oil exporters, “the men from Hacienda” can make smarter bets than hedge funds and Wall Street traders, Bloomberg’s Javier Blas reports. Their excellent U.S. connections in banking and politics help them predict the market. The trade’s notional value over the last decade has added up to $163 billion. “It’s the deal that all banks wait for each year,” says Richard Fullarton, founder of commodity fund Matilda Capital Management. “It’s so large that it can make or break their year.” There’s a New World’s Best Restaurant The dining room at Eleven Madison Park. Photographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg New Yorkers have one more reason to brag. The World’s 50 Best — a popular list that’s become something of the Oscars of the food world — named Eleven Madison Park the No. 1 restaurant in the world. It’s the first time in over a decade that a U.S. restaurant topped the list, which is based on the votes of more than 1,000 chefs, food writers and other experts. European restaurants usually dominate. Richard Vines, Bloomberg’s chief restaurant critic, says Eleven Madison Park’s food is “highly inventive with exciting flavor combinations” and “fun and very visual.” The restaurant’s $295 tasting menu features 11 courses, with dishes such as sea urchin custard with baby squid, bay scallop and apple; and pear poached with honey and acorn. Two Warnings for America Two of Wall Street’s biggest names are sounding the alarm on the U.S. economy. “It is clear that something is wrong,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. Trillions spent on wars, a hobbled housing market, mounting student debt, failing schools, onerous corporate taxes and regulation — all lead to an understandable anger at institutional leaders, he said. “Something has gone awry in the public’s understanding of business and free enterprise,” he said. “We need trust and confidence in our institutions.” On Thursday, BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink said growth is slowing because businesses and consumers are concerned about whether the Trump administration can deliver on promises.

Sign Up Young People Are Killing Marriage We knew that kids these days have been delaying the big things in life, like getting married and buying a home. But a new study of U.S. Census data reveals exactly how much things have changed. Millennials in the U.S. are more than twice as likely today to never have been married as Baby Boomers at the same age in 1980, Bloomberg’s Ben Steverman reports. That year, two-thirds of Americans between ages 25 and 34 had already been married at least once.  Not Everything Donald Trump Touches Turns to Gold A red Ferrari once owned by Trump went up for auction—but almost didn’t sell. A private buyer picked up the 2007 F430 F1 Coupe for $270,000 after it failed to meet the reserve in an auction that was expected to bring in as much as $350,000. The commander-in-chief bought the Ferrari new in 2007 and put 2,400 miles on the car before selling it in 2011 to the second owner, who put it on the block last weekend.

Once again, the market was unable to hang on to more substantial gains from earlier in the day. Strong reports from companies including L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, and Bed Bath & Beyond helped retailers. Energy companies rose with the prices of oil and natural gas, and banks recovered some of the sharp losses they took a day ago. The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 98 points early in the afternoon. However high-dividend stocks like phone companies and utilities skidded and technology companies also fell. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said investors are feeling uncertain, and that may hold true for at least a few weeks. After a weak auto sales report on Monday, he said investors are wondering how fast the economy is growing and what that will mean for company earnings. "We expect volatility to be higher than what we experienced in the first quarter," he said. It was the second day in a row that stocks slumped during afternoon trading, although the slip Thursday was far less dramatic than the one the day before. That slide started after the Federal Reserve said it may stop buying new bonds later this year and said its policymakers were grappling with whether it would be safe to let inflation rise faster. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 4.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,357.49. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.80 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,662.95. The Nasdaq composite gained 14.47 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,878.95. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks performed far better. It climbed 12.28 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,364.43. About three-fourths of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose, but stocks are mostly down this week. The Russell 2000 has fallen 1.6 percent. Investors will get an updated picture of the economy in the coming weeks, including the government's March report on employment Friday. Next week the Commerce Department will give a report on retailer sales and companies including JPMorgan Chase, Delta Air Lines and Netflix will report their earnings. L Brands jumped $4.75, or 11 percent, to $47.85 after it reported strong March sales. Bed Bath & Beyond surpassed analysts' earnings estimates and climbed $1.28, or 3.4 percent, to $39.08. Department stores and mall-based retailers like Kohl's, Nordstrom and Gap traded higher. Discount retailers Fred's and Five Below made hefty gains after Fred's announced its own quarterly results. Retail stocks have been hit hard for months as shoppers spend more money online and less at stores, especially ones based in malls. Bond prices recovered from an early decline. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at 2.34 percent. Companies that pay big dividends, like phone companies and utilities, traded lower. Investors often sell those stocks when bond yields rise, as they did earlier in the day.

By: Reuters | Published: April 8, 2017 6:09 AM Morgan Stanley, like many other Wall Street firms, allows employees to receive stock that otherwise would have been locked up for years if they depart the bank for Washington.(Reuters) Morgan Stanley shareholders will again vote on an investor proposal from the AFL-CIO union that would prohibit stock awards from vesting for bank executives who resign for government service. The board said in a proxy it was against the measure. Morgan Stanley and the board defeated the proposal at the annual meeting last year. It received 16 percent of votes cast. Morgan Stanley, like many other Wall Street firms, allows employees to receive stock that otherwise would have been locked up for years if they depart the bank for Washington. You may also like to watch: The practice has received scrutiny in recent months from investors and lawmakers after it was disclosed that former Goldman Sachs Group Inc president Gary Cohn would receive at least $100 million upon taking a job with the Trump administration. Other banks, including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co, have also voted on similar proposals over the last several years. Morgan Stanley will hold its annual meeting on May 22 at its wealth management headquarters in Purchase, New York. No Comments. Trending Now Are we running the country?

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Adam Rowe About 200,000 people transition out of military service annually, and according to the Institute for Veterans and Military Families, close to half find that their main challenge is adapting to civilian culture. U.S. veterans seeking to get into business for themselves have a support network from both veteran groups and the entrepreneurial community. There are even entire nonprofits for pairing the two worlds, like Bunker Labs or Patriot Boot Camp. In the military and when you own a business, being accountable for one’s work and actions can help the team understand their role and outcome goals. Why do veterans and entrepreneurial ventures go together so naturally? Because plenty of skills apply in both worlds. I interviewed Bart Lomont, cofounder of lawn care service Robin, in order to learn more about the connections between the two. Here’s a quick look at the skill set a veteran can rely on for entrepreneurial success: You Have No Playbook When you are self-employed, there isn’t necessarily a guide to help you along the way, and on a daily basis, you’ll need to make time-sensitive decisions that can impact your company. “Similar to my experience in the military, there is no playbook or road map to life in a startup,” Bart explains. “Each day, I encounter problems that nobody has ever faced before and it’s my job to figure them out. We don’t have time to wait on others to figure out the issues. We train our team to think on their feet and make decisions to the best of their ability, based on the information they have.” Communication Is Essential In the military, communication is the most critical components to a successful mission and the ability to communicate effectively to your team can also help while building your business. “Clear, concise communication is a critical attribute in our organization,” Bart says. “Whether you are communicating with a customer, a lawn crew, or even a fellow Robin employee, you should be able to get your point across in under three sentences. Anything more than that is a waste of both parties’ time and needs work.” You Stay Accountable In the military and when you own a business, being accountable for one’s work and actions can help the team understand their role and outcome goals. As Bart tells it: “We also place a focus on accountability — no matter what the operation, it is very clear who is in charge and they know from the beginning what is expected of them.” You Know How to Adapt There are many twists and turns to building a business and the ability to adapt to the unexpected things that come your way and maintain a steady head is a valuable transitional skill for veterans.  If Bart could go back in time to the start of his career, he’d tell himself to stop worrying about the ‘what-ifs.’ “When you set out to disrupt an industry as large as the $40 billion landscaping market, you are going to run into a lot of unknowns,” he says. “You can never answer all of the questions until you are faced with them, so getting some real-world experience (in our case this was getting robotic mowers out into the field with real customers for their first ever tests on US soil) is invaluable. A startup’s greatest advantage is its adaptability. We don’t have to run decisions through committees and receive approval from different departments. We can make decisions in the field that make an immediate impact and gain us considerable advantages over the competition.” Robin proves that Bart and his co-founder Justin Crandall know how to adapt: The company recently launched the nation’s first robotic lawn care service. Teamwork Matters One of the biggest core values of the military is teamwork and it’s the most important component to help a unit complete a mission. For Bart and his cofounder Justin, they knew that teamwork includes individuals who have the experience and willing to help others succeed in their company mission. Robin had a connection to a local Bunker Labs, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports early phase veteran-owned startups, and the cofounders reached out for help. “Bunker Labs has been a great teammate and true partner in much of our success to date,” Bart says. “Between introductions to potential investors, many new networking opportunities, and evening opening up new doors to marketing opportunities — they have stayed true to their mission and play a valuable role in helping to advance veteran entrepreneurship.” Bunker Labs is heading in the second year of a two-year, $1.5 million commitment from JPMorgan Chase to launch a 10-month tour to hold events and open new chapters across the U.S. Any veteran entrepreneurs hoping to start a business already has the experience and skills to succeed and need to remember to leverage available networks. A great place to start building a network is at Startup Week where you can meet other entrepreneurs or advisors who can help you achieve your company mission.
