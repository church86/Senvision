 Here's the memo Jamie Dimon just sent to JPMorgan staff about the US election Matt Turner Nov. 9, 2016, 12:12 PM 75,592 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Dylan Martinez Jamie Dimon just sent a memo to staff at JPMorgan reacting to the election of Donald Trump as the next US president. "We are going through a period of profound political and economic change around the world," the note said. Dimon added that the voices of those who have expressed frustration with the lack of economic opportunity available to them should be listened to. "We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside," he said. "But that makes it more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together Americans from all walks of life." He added that he remained optimistic about America's future. Here's the full note: Message from Jamie Dimon Dear colleagues, We are going through a period of profound political and economic change around the world, and American citizens showed that deep desire for change in voting to elect Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. We have heard through democratic processes in both Europe and the United States the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face. We need to listen to those voices. We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside. But that makes it more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together Americans from all walks of life. Recognizing that our diversity is a core strength of our nation, we must all come together as fellow patriots to solve our most serious challenges. Leaders from across the public, private and nonprofit sectors need to collaborate to find meaningful solutions that create economic growth and greater opportunity for all. America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done. No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy. JPMorgan Chase has a proud history of supporting our communities and our countries. Through your outstanding efforts, we have built a great company that will continue to thrive — as we continue to focus on helping to serve our clients and communities. We will also continue to help address the important public policy issues of the day and the underlying economic challenges throughout the world. I'm optimistic about America's future and the role our company will continue to play as we help the nation address our challenges and move forward together.

Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2005-LDP4. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect Fitch's expected losses, as well as the pool concentration and adverse selection of the remaining pool. Fitch's expected losses totalled 27.9% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 9.3%, including $224.2 million (8.4% of the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced 96% to $91.7 million from $2.7 billion at issuance. There are currently no defeased loans. Interest shortfalls are affecting class D, and L through NR. Concentrated Pool with Adverse Selection: Although the transaction has experienced significant paydowns, the remaining pool is highly concentrated with only 13 of the original 184 loans remaining and the largest loan accounting for 30.5% of the pool balance. Current risk exposure of the remaining loans includes properties with high vacancies, low debt service coverage ratios (DSCRs), single-tenant properties, secondary market exposure, and loans previously modified debt including a Hope note. High Percentage of Fitch Loans of Concern (FLOC) and Specially Serviced Loans: Six loans (46% of the pool) have been identified as FLOC, including two (26%) currently in special servicing. Both of the specially serviced assets are REO, both of which have high vacancies and are located in secondary markets. Severe losses are expected given the most recent servicer appraisal valuations. The largest non-specially serviced FLOC is secured by a 484-unit student housing property in Kalamazoo, MI (13.3% of the pool), located across the street from the Western Michigan University campus. The loan had previously transferred to special servicing in August 2013 due to payment default, and a foreclosure sale was held in May 2015 where the noteholder was the successful bidder. During the six-month REO redemption period the loan was assumed by a new borrower and modified, whereby the loan was bifurcated into a senior ($10 million) and junior ($2.1 million) component. The loan assumption required a $100,000 paydown of the senior note to $9.9 million. The loan remains current under the modified terms, and transferred back to the master servicer in May 2016. Property performance remains low with occupancy at 64% and DSCR at 0.54x as of June 2016. According to the servicer, the new borrower is focused on an aggressive capital improvements program and marketing campaign to drive occupancy to market levels. Although losses are not expected imminently, any recovery to the subject B-note is contingent upon full recovery to the A-note proceeds at the loan's maturity in December 2018. Unless collateral performance improves, recovery to the B-note component is unlikely. The largest loan in the pool is secured by a 350,000 square foot (sf) suburban office building located in Holmdel, NJ 100% occupied by Vonage (30.5% of the pool). The loan had previously transferred to special servicing in July 2015 due to a downsizing request by the tenant after its August 2017 lease expiration, plus significant funds required for tenant improvements (TIs). The borrower was successful in negotiating a lease extension to October 2023 for the full space. The lease was modified to include placing the property under a hard lock box, establishing tax and insurance escrows, and a waterfall provision for all excess cash flow to fund a rollover reserve to be used for future TIs. The loan, which has remained current since issuance, transferred back to the master servicer in May 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Rating Outlook on class B remains Stable due to sufficient credit enhancement. Although the credit enhancement will increase with scheduled amortization, Fitch is concerned with increasing pool concentration and high potential for performance volatility of the remaining collateral; therefore, a rating cap of 'BBsf' was considered appropriate on class B. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative rating migration unless there is material economic change to the remaining loans. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 17G-10 No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this transaction. Fitch has affirmed the following classes: --$34.8 million class B at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable; --$23.4 million class C at 'CCCsf'; RE 100%; --$33.5 million class D at 'Dsf'; RE 20%; --$0 class E at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; --$0 class F at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; --$0 class G at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; --$0 class H at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; --$0 class J at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; --$0 class K at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; --$0 class L at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; --$0 class M at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; --$0 class N at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; --$0 class P at 'Dsf'; RE 0%. The class A-1, A-1A, A-2, A-2FL, A-3A1, A-3A2, A-4, A-SB, A-M, and A-J certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class NR certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the ratings on the interest-only class X-1 and X-2 certificates. Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

Dimon on Trump Victory: Shows Voters' Economic 'Frustration' By Kristin Broughton November 9, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Dimon, Bank CEOs: We Need to Pause New Regs Dimon: U.S. 'Shooting Ourselves in the Foot' with Partisan Divisions Brexit 'Extraordinarily Dangerous' for U.S. Banks Brexit Upshot: U.S. Banks Have Become Pros at Planning for the Worst What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking In a message to employees Wednesday morning, JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the election of Donald Trump as president reflects a "deep desire for change." Drawing a comparison to the populist waves that have recently swept Europe, Dimon said that the results send a clear message about the economic challenges — and lack of opportunities — facing voters across the country. "We have heard through democratic processes in both Europe and the United States the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face," Dimon said. "We need to listen to those voices." Trump's victory — which shocked the political establishment — had undertones of the surprise vote by U.K. voters in June to leave the European Union. Dimon, notably, warned U.K. voters in the lead-up to the referendum that leaving the EU bloc could create years of economic uncertainty In the memo, Dimon did not specifically address what the results of the election mean for JPMorgan — or for the industry as a whole. He did, however, say that the company will continue to support its communities and focus on public policy issues "underlying the economic challenges throughout the world." Dimon — who has previously backed Democrats but this year did not endorse Hillary Clinton, though he had hinted he thought she would win — also struck an optimistic tone, saying that the country must now put aside its differences and recognize that diversity is the "core strength" of the nation. He also called on civic leaders to address the problems stemming from the recent period of sluggish economic growth. "Leaders from across the public, private and nonprofit sectors need to collaborate to find meaningful solutions that create economic growth and greater opportunity for all," he said.

He says leaders in the public and private sector need to work together to find solutions for more people. Read the full memo below: We are going through a period of profound political and economic change around the world, and American citizens showed that deep desire for change in voting to elect Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. We have heard through democratic processes in both Europe and the United States the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face. We need to listen to those voices. We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside. But that makes it more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together Americans from all walks of life. Recognizing that our diversity is a core strength of our nation, we must all come together as fellow patriots to solve our most serious challenges. Leaders from across the public, private and nonprofit sectors need to collaborate to find meaningful solutions that create economic growth and greater opportunity for all. America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done. No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy. JPMorgan Chase has a proud history of supporting our communities and our countries. Through your outstanding efforts, we have built a great company that will continue to thrive — as we continue to focus on helping to serve our clients and communities. We will also continue to help address the important public policy issues of the day and the underlying economic challenges throughout the world. I'm optimistic about America's future and the role our company will continue to play as we help the nation address our challenges and move forward together. —Jamie Jay YarowExecutive Editor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change JPM --- SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

Monday, November 21, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Banks, brokers gird for Brexit-style tumult following US election November 9, 2016, Wednesday NEW YORK: Big global banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets after the US election. As the outcome of the most bitterly fought US presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will the first to trade on the results. As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 per cent the day after the poll. In the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor’s position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. Traders expect US stock prices to swing by about 2 per cent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 per cent to 5 per cent sell-off for the S&P 500. US stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump’s stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The “market pretty much told you who was going to win today,” said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said Monday’s 2.2 per cent rally in US stocks had lowered Wall Street’s collective angst over the election from ‘DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2,’ referring to the US Defense Department’s levels of alert. Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest ‘known unknown’ markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 per cent drop in Asian equities. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

As the outcome of the most bitterly fought U.S. presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will the first to trade on the results. As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan's Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent the day after the poll. In the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov. 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. U.S. brokerage TD Ameritrade is adjusting staff rotas to make as many people as possible available to talk to investors who may be unnerved by any election-related volatility. "When the markets move, it can be difficult to put emotion at bay and stick to your plan," said Kim Hillyer, spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade. TWO PERCENT SWING Traders expect U.S. stock prices to swing by about 2 percent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent sell-off for the S&P 500. U.S. stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton's prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The "market pretty much told you who was going to win today," said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said Monday's 2.2 percent rally in U.S. stocks had lowered Wall Street's collective angst over the election to DEFCON 4 from DEFCON 2, referring to the U.S. Defense Department's levels of alert. ASIA IMPACT Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest "known unknown" markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 percent drop in Asian equities. The election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it's a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale's Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services. It plans to increase front office, back office, and technology staff, "ensuring we have a clear escalation system for handling decision-making", and possibly raising risk limits." Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said his firm had raised margins on U.S. indices and some dollar trades to 1 percent from 0.5 percent, but doesn't expect to see "a massive collapse or spike". HSBC will bolster staff on trading floors in major hubs including London and Hong Kong to deal with client requests, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. "Around any high profile, potentially market-moving event, it is not unusual for some trading desks to increase staffing levels," said a spokesman for Europe's biggest bank. No U.S. stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said.

While pre-election polls overwhelmingly give Hillary Clinton the advantage ahead of tonight’s result, with Reuters reporting “Clinton has 90 percent chance of winning: Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation“, many banks and brokers – still hurting from the Brexit calamity – aren’t taking chances. Some of the more prominent industry names, such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets after Tuesday’s U.S. election should Trump win. As the outcome of the most bitterly fought U.S. presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will be the first to trade on the results. Reuters writes that as a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. In the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. MS also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research. Most banks have already scheduled early Wednesday morning calls to institutional clients to guide them on what next steps will be in either outcome. Meanwhile, traders expect the S&P to swing by about 2% in either direction on Wednesday based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent sell-off for the S&P 500. That said, the reaction may be more muted should Hillary be the winner as the vast majority of market participants expect: the “market pretty much told you who was going to win today,” one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures told Reuters. Another official at a rival bank said Monday’s 2.2 percent rally in U.S. stocks had lowered Wall Street’s collective angst over the election from “DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2,” referring to the U.S. Defense Department’s levels of alert. Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest “known unknown” markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6% drop in Asian equities. The election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it’s a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale’s Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services. Ironically, both of these are urgently needed by banks to prop up flagging equity trading revenues, as such for many trading desks a Trump victory would be quite welcome. Nomura plans to increase front office, back office, and technology staff, “ensuring we have a clear escalation system for handling decision-making”, and possibly raising risk limits.” Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said his firm had raised margins on U.S. indices and some dollar trades to 1 percent from 0.5 percent, but doesn’t expect to see “a massive collapse or spike”. In Asia and Europe, HSBC will bolster staff on trading floors in major hubs including London and Hong Kong to deal with client requests, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. “Around any high profile, potentially market-moving event, it is not unusual for some trading desks to increase staffing levels,” said a spokesman for Europe’s biggest bank. No U.S. stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday. This may change if early voting reflects that a Hillary victory is not a foregone conclusion. * * * Central banks are also prepared for any contingency. The Swiss National Bank stands ready to intervene in the currency markets if the outcome of the U.S. election triggers a rush into the safe haven currency, a member of the central bank’s governing board said on Monday. Andrea Maechler declined to comment on the outcome of the election or how it would affect the Swiss franc or financial markets but said that “the uncertainties are large,” she said in an interview with Swiss TV to be broadcast on Monday evening. “What I can say is just like with the Brexit vote, we are ready. My team is prepared and the Swiss National Bank will be there, if necessary, to intervene to stabilize the currency markets.” We are confident all other central banks are making similar arrangements. * * * Still, while banks are taking measures, few are overly worried that a Brexit outcome will repeat itself. And yet, according to Nomura FX strategists, the USD/JPY is showing an “eerie” parallel with the lead up to the June 23 Brexit vote, after which it plunged to 99.02 on the unexpected result. “Markets appear to price in 90% chance of a Clinton win, so a Trump victory would have a huge market impact that could exceed that of Brexit” says Yunosuke Ikeda, head of FX strategy for Japan at Nomura “The current USD/JPY levels and market situations are coming to resemble those seen before the June U.K. referendum.” * * * But what is the signal that banks will be most focused on to determine if consensus will be wrong – again – and Brexit-like chaos is set for a repeat appearance? According to counterparties, Deutsche Bank – which likewise has a base case that Clinton will win – has advised its sales and trading team to immediately report to their trading desks should Trump wins Pennsylvania and Michigan. This means shortly after the polls in these two states close at 8pm, trading will be either promptly die down or will just be getting started. So should Trump be seen as leading and/or winning in those two key battleground states, expect all volatility hell to break loose. This article is brought to you courtesy of ZeroHedge.

X Banks and brokers prepare for tumult after US election Financial markets likely to react strongly once US election results announced Tue, Nov 8, 2016, 12:11 US stocks rose as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the FBI said it would not press criminal charges. Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty         Big global banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets after Tuesday’s US election. As the outcome of the most bitterly fought US presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will the first to trade on the results. As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 per cent the day after the poll. In the US, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor’s position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a November 7th memo.

Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out.

As the outcome of the most bitterly fought US presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will be the first to trade on the results. As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan's Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 per cent the day after the poll. In the US, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a pre-set level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a November 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. 2 per cent swing Traders expect US stock prices to swing by about 2 per cent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 per cent to 5 per cent sell-off for the S&P 500. US stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton's prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private e-mail server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The “market pretty much told you who was going to win today,” said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said Monday's 2.2 per cent rally in US stocks had lowered Wall Street's collective angst over the election from “DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2,” referring to the US Defense Department's levels of alert. Asia impact Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest “known unknown” markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 per cent drop in Asian equities. The election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it's a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale's Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services. It plans to increase front office, back office, and technology staff, “ensuring we have a clear escalation system for handling decision-making", and possibly raising risk limits.” Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said his firm had raised margins on US indices and some dollar trades to 1 per cent from 0.5 per cent, but doesn't expect to see “a massive collapse or spike". HSBC will bolster staff on trading floors in major hubs including London and Hong Kong to deal with client requests, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. “Around any high profile, potentially market-moving event, it is not unusual for some trading desks to increase staffing levels,” said a spokesman for Europe's biggest bank. No US stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said.

Wells Fargo is eligible for up to $1.5 billion in bailout funds over the next seven years. JPMorgan and Bank of America could receive $1.1 billion and $964 million respectively. The continuous flow of funds is a remnant of the $700 billion bailout effort, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, put in place during the financial crisis. Some of that money, about $28 million, was carved out to help distressed homeowners by paying banks to lower their interest rates and monthly payments. The program, the Home Affordable Modification Program, has undergone several revamps over the last few years and fallen short of helping the 3 million to 4 million homeowners the Obama administration initially hoped. But it continues to operate — HAMP will accept its last homeowner application at the end of this year — and big banks continue to be paid for helping. The stream of cash for the big banks is worrisome to the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP, the chief watchdog of the financial crisis-era bailouts. Many of the banks have repeatedly broken the rules of the program, including kicking homeowners out unfairly or making it too difficult to apply for the help. “Why are we paying for nonperformance? … At what point is somebody is going to say enough is enough?” said Christy Goldsmith Romero, special inspector general with the Troubled Asset Relief Program, who investigates crime at companies that received taxpayer bailout funds. “If a homeowner doesn’t follow the rules in HAMP, they get knocked out of the program. If a bank doesn’t follow, they still get paid by Treasury.” The banks and the Treasury Department, which oversees HAMP, defend the program. The “error rates” have fallen significantly, Mark McArdle, deputy assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement. The SIGTARP report is “inaccurate,” Wells Fargo said in a statement. “We respond quickly to correct any errors we identify or that are brought to our attention.” Bank of America said it has helped more than 2.1 million customers avoid foreclosure through HAMP and other programs. “These initiatives continue to help those who face financial difficulty today, even as the economy has recovered overall,” the bank said in a statement. JPMorgan, which has more than $2 trillion in assets, says most of the money it receives through the program is passed on to investors and homeowners who receive incentives for paying their mortgages on time. The biggest beneficiary of the housing program, by far, is little-known financial company Ocwen. The Atlanta company services millions of mortgages for investors, including collecting payments from homeowners. It has already received $2.9 billion from the HAMP program and over the next seven years, it could receive $2.6 billion more. “We are extremely proud of our performance and our success in helping struggling borrowers remain in their homes,” Ocwen said in a statement.

In a turnaround from last night, investors poured money into the market. U.S. stocks rose sharply on Wednesday in a dramatic turnaround from deep overnight losses as Wall Street digested the upset presidential election victory of Republican Donald Trump. After warning for months that a Trump White House would create uncertainty and damage sentiment, investors poured money into sectors that may benefit from the former reality show star’s victory. That was a steep reversal from the night before, when financial markets reacted violently as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s path to victory narrowed and S&P futures dropped 5 percent before a trading limit kicked in. “The stock market is acting like a teenager. It makes a lot of demands but it doesn’t know what it wants,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Read More: These Stocks Are Spiking in the Wake of Donald Trump’s Win Gains of 3 percent each in the heavily weighted healthcare and financials sectors pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average up over 1 percent. The real estate sector fell 2.48 percent and utilities lost 3.52 percent. Both sectors are proxies for bonds, which also fell. “When you look at Trump’s plans, they are actually pro-market,” said Nadia Lovell, U.S. Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. “Increased fiscal spending, that’s great for infrastructure and defense names, less regulations that help banks, less involvement in healthcare – things that worried the market before.” A curb on drug pricing was a key campaign theme for Clinton, while Trump has called for repealing the Affordable Care Act and loosening restrictions on banks enacted after the financial crisis. At 3:05 pm ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.54 percent to 18,614.99 points and the S&P 500 had gained 1.24 percent to 2,166.09. The Nasdaq Composite had added 1 percent to 5,245.54. Republicans maintained their majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress, potentially enabling the party to reshape Washington with two years of “unified” government. “Regardless of the fact you had a Republican sweep, there are still checks and balances in place,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “So you are going to have some of your more fiscally conservative Republicans that will certainly slow (Trump) down from doing anything crazy in terms of policy changes.” Wall Street is typically seen as preferring gridlock, or shared control of the White House and Congress, than a sweep of both chambers of Congress and the presidency. The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of investor anxiety, fell 20 percent and was on track for its biggest daily drop since late June. Big pharmaceutical shares gained, with Pfizer jumping 8.3 percent, the biggest driver of the S&P 500’s gains. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF surged 8.7 percent and was on track for its biggest daily percentage gain in eight years. Among financials, JPMorgan Chase surged 5.7 percent, on pace for its best day in nine months, while Wells Fargo rose 6.06 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 179 new highs and 94 new lows.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 10 November 2016 Thailand holds interest rate amid market turmoil A bank employee arranges commemorative 100 baht banknotes featuring the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Foreign investors pulled out of Thailand stocks at the fastest pace this year in October, while a year-long mourning period threatens to curb growth on entertainment and other social spending. — Reuters BANGKOK: Thailand held its key interest rate for a 12th meeting, the longest streak on record, opting to preserve its firepower as growth risks mount following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and market turmoil heightened in the aftermath of the US elections. The Bank of Thailand kept its one-day bond repurchase rate at 1.5%, with monetary policy committee members voting unanimously in favor, it said in Bangkok. All but one of the 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the decision, with JPMorgan Chase & Co forecasting a cut. Policy makers face rising market volatility following the death of the king, who has served as a pillar of stability in a country that’s had 10 coups during his seven-decade rule. Foreign investors pulled out of Thailand stocks at the fastest pace this year in October, while a year-long mourning period threatens to curb growth on entertainment and other social spending. “There are growth risks associated in the aftermath of the king’s passing,” Gundy Cahyadi, an economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, said before the decision. “But given the current fiscal space, the government can easily offset this drag. Unless there is evidence of a drastic slowdown in the economy, the BoT is unlikely to do anything on rates for now.” The bank also stuck to its unchanged stance as markets were roiled by results from the US presidential election indicating a likely victory for Donald Trump. Thailand’s SET Index was down 1.3% yesterday before the rate decision. Exports rose for a second consecutive month in September. Consumer prices rose 0.34% in October from a year earlier, the seventh straight month of gains. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Thailand Related Stories Red Bull fuels extreme wealth with 11 billionaires in Thailand Government removes anti-dumping duty on PET from Thailand Thai bonds suffer record outflows as king’s death sparks concern Thai king’s health weighs on baht as stocks tumble with bonds Thailand mulls tougher tax rules You May Be Interested ECB chief Draghi hints at more stimulus to come Daibochi bullish on Myanmar venture Mah Sing group MD wins property award The gig economy only a stopgap measure to our woes KTC sees good year ahead Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Larsson and son attacked by fans as Helsingborg relegated Lavishing patrons with ‘arty’ delights The floor’s his forte Property Related advertisement Latest News A ‘Yan’ to be the best Inevitable, essential failure Reflections on Budget 2017 Briefs Too premature to make final decision on TPP, says Mustapa Most Viewed in Business Governor: Bank Negara won’t tolerate ringgit transactions in NDF market PNB unit trust funds hit 210.63 billion units as of October Too premature to make final decision on TPP, says Mustapa advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States on Tuesday, and it looks like a big win for Wall Street. “It’s a grand slam home run for the banks,” bank analyst Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital Markets told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, Trump led the Republicans in a sweep of Congress, putting the party in control of both the House and the Senate. As Trump’s victory unfolded, global markets went haywire, with S&P futures dropping 5%. Gold, considered a safe haven asset, soared. Meanwhile, financial stocks, including Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C), were trading higher on Wednesday morning. KBW analyst Brian Gardner also characterized Trump’s win as a positive for the banks and other financials despite the market’s initial broad sell-off reaction. “Big winners are insurers, brokers, and asset managers since this increases the chances that the DOL’s fiduciary rule is delayed, rewritten or even scrapped. Smaller banks should still do better in Washington than big banks,” Gardner wrote. The Financial CHOICE Act For Rafferty Capital’s Bove, the real victory for the banks comes down to the The Financial CHOICE Act, a bill introduced by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-TX). According to Bove, the bill is “extremely positive for the banking industry.” Hensarling’s bill aims to repeal sections and titles of Dodd-Frank, including the Volcker Rule. The bill would basically ease regulations on banking dramatically based upon the amount of capital-to-assets. That capital-to-asset ratio would determine how strong regulators should treat a bank. The bill also gets rid of the “living will” rule and the Durbin amendment. With Republicans maintaining control of congress, that bill is seen as more likely to pass. What’s more is with the Republican congress, the rhetoric from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) “goes right down to the toilet,” Bove said. “No one is going to let anything they think pass,” he said, adding this is also “a huge success for the banks.” The Fiduciary Rule Another change the industry might see is to Obama Administration’s new fiduciary rule, which was finalized by the Department of Labor in April. According to KBW’s Gardner, it’s possible that Trump’s administration may delay, alter, or scrap the new fiduciary rule. This would be positive for brokers and asset managers, the note said. The DOL’s new rule has many in the investment community up in arms. The rule impacts retirement accounts by requiring brokers to uphold a fiduciary duty and put clients’ interest ahead of the firm by going with the most cost-effective means of providing a product or solution. While its intentions sound good, some are concerned about government over-reaching and unintended consequences such as pushing investors into passive indexes and passive investments. Ahead of the election, SkyBridge Capital’s founder Anthony Scaramucci, an economic adviser to the Trump campaign, told Yahoo Finance he expects they’ll “be working very, very hard to repeal this silly ruling.” — Julia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Health-care shares and lenders surged as investors unwound bets that a win by Hillary Clinton would bring stronger regulatory scrutiny. The SPDR S&P Biotech exchange-traded fund rose the most since 2008, while Pfizer Inc. and Merck & Co. jumped at least 6 per cent. JPMorgan Chase & Co. rose 4.6 per cent to a record, and Goldman Sachs had its best one-day gain in 4 1/2 years. The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 2,163.11 at 4 p.m. in New York, extending its advance after rising above its average prices during the past 50 and 100 days. The Dow rallied 1.4 per cent, to a two-month high. “Our base case is we’re more likely to see a more moderate president than we saw as a candidate and the market’s agreeing with that,” said Lowell Yura, head of multi-asset solutions for BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago, which oversees US$238 billion. “We don’t see a huge impact to short-term earnings and short-term economic growth.” A knee-jerk selloff in global stocks and a rally in haven assets reversed on wagers that Trump would increase fiscal spending to spur economic growth, and as he struck a more conciliatory tone in his first speech as president-elect. A Trump victory had been portrayed by analysts as having the potential to unhinge markets banking on a continuation of policies that coincided with the second-longest bull market in S&P 500 history. While Republican control of both houses of Congress may enable the party to enact sweeping legislation that would be considered pro-business, concern persists over the impact from Trump’s pledges to clamp down on immigration to the US and renegotiate free-trade agreements with countries including Mexico. “People focus on the fact that his acceptance speech kind of changed the direction of the market,” said Krishna Memani, New York-based chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds Inc., which oversees $223 billion. “It was far more conciliatory and far more fiscal-focused than these acceptances typically are -- that made a world of difference.” Election over, Donald Trump must now change his tune A basket of stocks identified by Morgan Stanley that are most likely to benefit from a Trump win surged 6.4 per cent. The group includes 53 companies ranging from drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals to construction-materials producer Martin Marietta Materials Inc. Among other shares boosted by the Republican’s win, prison operators soared on speculation the new administration will rescind a government contract phase-out. Corrections Corp. and Geo Group Inc. jumped more than 21 per cent. Companies gaining on Trump’s plans to boost infrastructure spending included equipment provider United Rentals Inc., capped its steepest advance in almost eight years, while Caterpillar Inc. added 7.7 per cent, the most since 2011. Vulcan Materials Co. climbed to an all-time high. Along with the potential for a lighter regulatory burden, banks were also boosted by soaring bond yields as investors’ inflation expectations climbed on speculation a Trump administration and Republican Congress will ramp up spending to lift growth. Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp. gained more than 5 per cent, with Wells Fargo jumping the most since 2012. As the initial turbulence eased, odds for a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike in December climbed back to levels seen before Trump’s victory, after plunging below 50 per cent as the outcome unfolded. The market-implied chance of a move next month is 86 per cent, the same as the probability on Tuesday afternoon. “The US that Trump inherits is doing pretty well economically,” said Nandini Ramakrishnan, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in London. “From an investment perspective, this is not something that we would say is entirely negative as the market may see just this morning. There may be potential opportunities with some of these selloffs.” In the 22 elections going back to 1928, the S&P 500 has fallen 15 times the day after polls close, for an average loss of 1.8 per cent. Stocks reversed course and moved higher over the next 12 months in nine of those instances, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Indonesia’s got a drinking problem – Muslim hardliners who want to ban alcohol 2 Hong Kong developers offer incentives to boost luxury home sales as market cools 3 Apple will fix ‘touch disease’ in iPhone 6 Plus devices: for a price 4 Put off by Trump?

Was consensus that far off the mark? PHOTO: REUTERS Risk off Nov 10, 2016 5:50 AM Singapore THE selling began timorously on Wednesday morning. Was consensus that far off the mark? But as count after count began to reveal Republican party nominee Donald Trump as the unexpected frontrunner for the US presidency, the drip became a crashing wave. Shocked investors dumped risky assets and poured into safe havens when it became clear that the New York property baron would be the next leader of the world's largest superpower - and with a Republican sweep of Congress to boot. The initial knee-jerk reaction - triggered by his anti-establishment rhetoric, his fierce opposition to free trade with China and Mexico and his casual attitude towards not paying back US government debt in full - eventually gave way to a cautious recovery after he delivered a victory speech that calmed nerves. Analysts reckon that a Trump presidency may abandon some of the campaign's more extremist positions, and that his plans for aggressive infrastructure spending might even boost the economy in the near term. Equities Asian markets opened on Wednesday, reflecting expectations that Mr Trump's chief rival, Hillary Clinton, would win the election. IG market strategist Pan Jingyi said: "Ahead of the release of the results, the market was anticipating a Clinton win, with the clear lead she was holding in polls. "However, a feeling of déjà vu likely hit the markets as the swing states swung gradually towards the Republicans." The Singapore Straits Times Index fell as much as 2.1 per cent at one point, and then clawed back earlier losses to close the day at 2,760.97, down 1.08 per cent or 30.36 points. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong shed 2.16 per cent to 22,415.1; Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.36 per cent to 16,251.54. US stock futures plunged 5 per cent, hitting circuit-breaker limits that barred a further fall until the US stock markets opened. Wall Street opened only slightly down but recovered in early trade. What comes next hinges on expectations of what Mr Trump's policies might be, and on this front, the consensus is that there is a significant amount of uncertainty. DBS chief investment officer Lim Say Boon wrote in a note: "Beyond the immediate reaction, markets will watch for what we had earlier described as 'where Presidential hopeful Donald Trump's rhetoric stops and where President Donald Trump's policies start'." Mr Trump's campaign promise to raise infrastructure spending could improve earnings momentum globally, said Credit Suisse Asia-Pacific chief investment officer John Woods. His firm is now neutral on equities after being underweight on them heading into the election. In emerging Asia, the key risk lies in Mr Trump's numerous threats to target trade with China, which could set off a trade war between the economic giants. But while most analysts urged caution on equities, some of them are hoping that Mr Trump might retreat from his most extreme positions, or that even if he does pursue them, the impact may be muted. Australian bank Westpac said: "Fears about the direct impact on China of these trade policies in the US should not be overstated. China has been moving towards a service-driven economy, and has ample policy flexibility to boost domestic demand to partially compensate for any direct shock to exports to the US." JP Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Jasslyn Yeo advocated looking for companies that can deliver quality earnings growth. Healthcare, especially pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, will probably benefit from the fact that Mr Trump's defeated rival, Hillary Clinton, will no longer be able to carry out her promise of imposing price caps on drugs, Ms Yeo said. Currencies The US dollar weakened against safe-haven currencies like the yen, but strengthened sharply against the Mexican peso. Against the yen, the greenback retreated about 2 per cent for an exchange rate of 103.112 yen for every US$1. The US dollar strengthened slightly against the Singapore dollar, up about 0.38 per cent to S$1.39 for every US$1. The peso took the worst hit, losing 8.5 per cent of its value against the US dollar to 19.88 pesos per US dollar, on fears that Mr Trump would go after trade with America's southern neighbour. Bank of Singapore investment strategist James Cheo said: "If Trump pursues his anti-trade policies, it is negative for Mexico, Canada and most of Asia. Therefore, US trade-dependent currencies of the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and Asian currencies would underperform under such a scenario." Fixed income Interest rates are expected to continue on an upward path, although confidence of a US Federal Reserve rate hike in December have come off slightly, with the futures-implied probability of a December rise dropping to 50 per cent on Wednesday, from about 75 per cent previously. OCBC senior investment strategist Vasu Menon said: "Given that no one really knows what Mr Trump's economic policies would look like, the Fed may err on the side of caution and put policy tightening on hold until there is some clarity." JP Morgan Asset Management's Ms Yeo said that the US economy is set to shift from a reliance on monetary policy to one dependent on fiscal spending: "A shift toward fiscal policy would be a net negative for developed-market government bonds, including US Treasuries, because moves by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan would reduce demand for bonds. Meanwhile, bond supply would rise to finance additional fiscal spending. "We increase our caution on developed-market government bonds as these assets trade at very expensive valuations and relatively high duration risks, as bond yields move higher." Gold When fears are at their worst, gold shines the brightest. The price of an ounce of the precious metal for December delivery rose 2.6 per cent to US$1,307.35 on Wednesday. Ms Yeo sees support for gold ahead, with a number of challenges to the European Union on the calendar ahead. "Gold always benefits when there's more uncertainty and volatility." Nomura head of international research Kevin Gaynor warned of more unrest in Europe, and that populist sentiment there could be under-reported in the same way that polls missed on support for Mr Trump and for Britain's exit from European Union. "Holland, France and Germany will all be now shifting 4 per cent toward the second- or third-place party," he said.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Noel Randewich Nov 9th 2016 4:28PM NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose sharply on Wednesday in a dramatic turnaround from deep overnight losses as Wall Street digested the upset presidential election victory of Republican Donald Trump. After warning for months that a Trump White House would create uncertainty and damage sentiment, investors poured money into sectors that may benefit from the former reality show star's victory. That was a steep reversal from the night before, when financial markets reacted violently as Democrat Hillary Clinton's path to victory narrowed and S&P futures dropped 5 percent before a trading limit kicked in. "The stock market is acting like a teenager. It makes a lot of demands but it doesn't know what it wants," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Gains of 3 percent each in the heavily weighted healthcare and financials sectors pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average up over 1 percent. The real estate sector fell 2.48 percent and utilities lost 3.52 percent. Both sectors are proxies for bonds, which also fell. 17 PHOTOS Newspapers around the world react to Trump's win See Gallery Newspapers around the world react to Trump's win A businessman walks past copies of the London Evening Standard newspaper, featuring a picture of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on its front page, waiting to be picked up in the square mile financial district of the City of London, U.K., on Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016.

Morgan Private Bank in New York. "Increased fiscal spending, that's great for infrastructure and defense names, less regulations that help banks, less involvement in healthcare - things that worried the market before." A curb on drug pricing was a key campaign theme for Clinton, while Trump has called for repealing the Affordable Care Act and loosening restrictions on banks enacted after the financial crisis. At 3:05 pm ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.54 percent to 18,614.99 points and the S&P 500 had gained 1.24 percent to 2,166.09. The Nasdaq Composite had added 1 percent to 5,245.54. Republicans maintained their majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress, potentially enabling the party to reshape Washington with two years of "unified" government. "Regardless of the fact you had a Republican sweep, there are still checks and balances in place," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. "So you are going to have some of your more fiscally conservative Republicans that will certainly slow (Trump) down from doing anything crazy in terms of policy changes." Wall Street is typically seen as preferring gridlock, or shared control of the White House and Congress, than a sweep of both chambers of Congress and the presidency. The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of investor anxiety, fell 20 percent and was on track for its biggest daily drop since late June. Big pharmaceutical shares gained, with Pfizer jumping 8.3 percent, the biggest driver of the S&P 500's gains. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF surged 8.7 percent and was on track for its biggest daily percentage gain in eight years. Among financials, JPMorgan Chase surged 5.7 percent, on pace for its best day in nine months, while Wells Fargo rose 6.06 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 179 new highs and 94 new lows.

Written by Tabassum Barnagarwala | Mumbai | Published:November 10, 2016 3:10 am “Given the current state of Indo-Pak relations, I suspect converting Indian currency here will be difficult,” said Malik-ul-Ashtar, a resident of Karachi. (Reuters) For many Indians living abroad, and holding Indian currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, the confusion and chaos is as much as it is back home.  On Tuesday, soon after the government announced that existing notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would no longer be legal tender from midnight, several expatriate Indians rushed to money exchange traders and banks to convert their currency. For Amey Pophale, 26, a student at the University of Illinois in Chicago, it was a futile attempt. He had Rs 10,000 in cash in Rs 500 denomination. “I went to three banks, Bank of America, J P Morgan and Agricultural Bank of China, and all of them refused to exchange money,” he said. Amey intends to send the old currency notes through his friend who is planning to visit India next month. “There is confusion here. Nobody is willing to take old currency,” he said. Like him, Radhika Dhawan attempted to exchange money at the St Paul International Airport in Minneapolis, USA. She even enquired with Walmart for transferring money. Her request was declined with officials saying that the option to exchange Indian currency was temporarily unavailable. According to the Reserve Bank of India, Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) have the option of depositing the Indian notes in their non-resident ordinary rupee account (NRO) while Indian tourists can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to Rs 5,000 at airport exchange counters within 72 hours of the notification. However, several foreign exchange centres have declined to exchange the old denomination notes in USA, Pakistan and New Zealand. Chaitra Acharya, who lives in Volda in Norway, has to travel 71 km to Alesund where the closest exchange office is located. “Travelling here is expensive and I have no option but to travel to Alesund to exchange it. It is my hard-earned money and I don’t want to devalue it,” said Acharya, adding, “While black money holders are buying gold, land, luxurious cars and other stuff, it is the common man who is suffering. People who are not living in India have more problems in exchanging currency.” England 103/5 At Stumps On Day 2, Trailing India By 352 Runs Bigg Boss 10 November 17 Review: Swami Om Apologized From Mona Lisa Parliament Adjourned Amid Debate Over Demonetisation Issue Demonetisation: Select Petrol Pumps To Dispense Cash Up To Rs 2,000 Demonetisation: Here’s How It Affects Kerala Estate WorkersDemonetisation: Here’s How It Affects Kerala Estate Workers Miscreants Break Into SBI ATM In Odisha’s Nabarangpur District: Here’s What Happened Audience Reaction : John Abraham and Sonakshi Sinha Starrer Force 2 Gets A Thumbs Up Here’s What Supreme Court Said On Government’s Demonetisation Move Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Rules Out Roll Back Of Demonetisation Move West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal Protest Against Demonetisation Government Issues Fresh Guidelines On Withdrawal Norms: All You Need To Know Mamata Banerjee Demand Roll-back Of Demonetisation Within Three Days If Mulayam Singh’s Trust Is With Ram Gopal, I Am Also With Him: Amar Singh SYL Row: Amrinder Singh Seeks President’s Rule In Punjab Uproar In Parliament Over Demonetisation Debate: Here’s What Happened In Pakistan, the confusion is more intense. “Given the current state of Indo-Pak relations, I suspect converting Indian currency here will be difficult,” said Malik-ul-Ashtar, a resident of Karachi. His mother returned from India with Rs 5,000 in August. The family planned to use it in their next visit. However, money exchange traders in Karachi have now refused to accept the old currency. “I went to a few individual exchange traders. They asked me to wait for a few days. Even though the amount I have is small, it doubles in Pakistani currency. It may go waste,” said Shireen Morbiwala, also a resident of Karachi. Several Indians The Indian Express spoke to said they will wait for the new notes to be unveiled abroad before trying to exchange currency again.

Markets oscillated between gains and losses in choppy morning trade. Heading into the latter stages of trading, each of the three major stock indexes were solidly in positive territory in the wake of Trump`s win. Gains of 3 percent each in the heavily weighted healthcare and financials sectors pushed indexes higher. Bond proxy sectors such as real estate, down 2.2 percent, and utilities, each off more than 2 percent, were the worst performers. "When you look at Trump`s plans, they are actually pro-market," said Nadia Lovell, U.S. Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. "Increased fiscal spending, that`s great for infrastructure and defence names, less regulations that help banks, less involvement in healthcare - things that worried the market before." Trump`s plans are reflationary policies, intended to increase economic output by lowering taxes and boosting spending. A curb on drug pricing was a key campaign theme for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, while Trump has called for repealing the Affordable Care Act and loosening restrictions on banks enacted after the financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 182.57 points, or 1 percent, to 18,515.31, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 16.79 points, or 0.78 percent, to 2,156.35 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 28.93 points, or 0.56 percent, to 5,222.42. Through the night, financial markets reacted violently to the election results as Clinton`s path to victory narrowed. The S&P futures slid 5 percent and hit a limit down, meaning the contract could not trade lower, only sideways or up. Dow Industrials futures briefly fell 800 points. Republicans maintained their majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress, potentially enabling the party to reshape Washington with two years of "unified" government. "Regardless of the fact you had a Republican sweep, there are still checks and balances in place," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. "So you are going to have some of your more fiscally conservative Republicans that will certainly slow (Trump) down from doing anything crazy in terms of policy changes." Wall Street is typically seen as preferring gridlock, or shared control of the White House and Congress, than a sweep of both chambers of Congress and the presidency. CBOE Volatility index futures shot nearly 40 percent higher at one point, reflecting investors` reservations about a Trump presidency, but sharply retraced the advance after Trump`s acceptance speech. During the session the CBOE Volatility index <.VIX> was down 16.9 percent, on track for its biggest daily drop since late June. Big pharmaceutical shares gained, with Pfizer jumping 8.1 percent to $32.42 as the biggest boost to the S&P 500. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF surged 8 percent and was on track for its biggest daily percentage gain in eight years. Among financials, JPMorgan Chase shot up 5.2 percent to $73.70, on pace for its best day in nine months, while Wells Fargo rose 6.3 percent to $48.40.   Reuters First Published: Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 00:36 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus MOST READ TOP NEWS MOST VIEWED Demonetisation: I-T department issues notices to those depositing huge cash Top bankers had no clue of government's demonetisation plan; were left with few hours to act RBI proposes 'Islamic window' in conventional banks for gradually introducing Sharia banking Maharashtra 'safai' worker writes to SBI seeking loan waiver like Vijay Mallya 7th Pay Commission: Weekly work report to decide annual increment of Central government employees SBI issued new cash deposit form for it's customers MOBILE $ GADGETS | Review of Asus Swift 7 Laptop GST council meeting took place on Dual control zignition | Hyundai Tuscon re-launched in India MOBILE $ GADGETS | Review of Asus Swift 7 Laptop | Part 2 Beware!

Prior to the result, the Fed seemed poised to lift rates next month for the first time since December 2015. In the election’s aftermath, market volatility could stay their hand if it persists and financial conditions tighten. Uncertainty about how Trump will approach domestic and international policy could further obscure the economic outlook, and how that plays out has potential to delay or accelerate Fed policy tightening. Other investors echoed BlackRock’s view regarding the Fed’s plans. “The uncertainty and volatility following the U.S. election will, for now, reduce the probability of a Federal Reserve rate hike in December,” wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, in a note titled “A Populist Victory.” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said in a note: “A Trump victory and concomitant market volatility would likely force the Federal Reserve to re-evaluate their monetary policy strategy.” Among BlackRock’s other projections: Financial stocks may outperform in the medium term because of higher inflation and steeper yield curves, while U.S. regional banks could benefit from a lighter regulatory burden. U.S. Treasuries could initially benefit, but long-term bonds could come under pressure if markets perceive Trump’s policies to widen budget deficit. Emerging market assets could selloff in short run. T. Rowe Price Group Inc., an asset management firm based in Baltimore, said Trump’s campaign promises on tax cuts and trade, if enacted, could be a negative for the U.S. economy. Trump’s “plans could drive up annual U.S. budget deficits and its long-term debt and significantly diminish international trade, with negative economic effects here and abroad,’ the firm’s economists and money managers wrote. Janus Capital Group Inc. was more optimistic. The Denver-based asset manager said in a note that Trump’s win, coupled with Republican control of the Congress, could lead to more spending on infrastructure and tax cuts. “Over the long term, the stimulative initiatives of a Trump administration, along with growth that may be delivered from other policies, may lead to economic expansion conducive to equities,” Janus said. Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, where he oversees $250 billion, said stocks should perform well leading up to the inauguration. “The Trump revolution is likely to be good for risk assets,” he wrote in an email. Minerd cautioned that long-term interest rates will remain under pressure on the expectation of Trump tax cuts. Treasuries tumbled Wednesday, with 30-year bond yields climbing the most in a year, amid speculation the Republican will ramp up spending to boost the economy.

After warning for months that a Trump White House would create uncertainty and damage sentiment, investors poured money into sectors that may benefit from the former reality show star's victory. That was a steep reversal from the night before, when financial markets reacted violently as Democrat Hillary Clinton's path to victory narrowed and S&P futures dropped 5 percent before a trading limit kicked in. "The stock market is acting like a teenager. It makes a lot of demands but it doesn't know what it wants," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Gains of 3 percent each in the heavily weighted healthcare and financials sectors pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average up over 1 percent. The real estate sector fell 2.48 percent and utilities lost 3.52 percent. Both sectors are proxies for bonds, which also fell. "When you look at Trump's plans, they are actually pro-market," said Nadia Lovell, U.S. Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. "Increased fiscal spending, that's great for infrastructure and defense names, less regulations that help banks, less involvement in healthcare - things that worried the market before." A curb on drug pricing was a key campaign theme for Clinton, while Trump has called for repealing the Affordable Care Act and loosening restrictions on banks enacted after the financial crisis. At 3:05 pm ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.54 percent to 18,614.99 points and the S&P 500 had gained 1.24 percent to 2,166.09. The Nasdaq Composite had added 1 percent to 5,245.54. Republicans maintained their majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress, potentially enabling the party to reshape Washington with two years of "unified" government. "Regardless of the fact you had a Republican sweep, there are still checks and balances in place," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. "So you are going to have some of your more fiscally conservative Republicans that will certainly slow (Trump) down from doing anything crazy in terms of policy changes." Wall Street is typically seen as preferring gridlock, or shared control of the White House and Congress, than a sweep of both chambers of Congress and the presidency. The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of investor anxiety, fell 20 percent and was on track for its biggest daily drop since late June. Big pharmaceutical shares gained, with Pfizer jumping 8.3 percent, the biggest driver of the S&P 500's gains. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF surged 8.7 percent and was on track for its biggest daily percentage gain in eight years. Among financials, JPMorgan Chase surged 5.7 percent, on pace for its best day in nine months, while Wells Fargo rose 6.06 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 179 new highs and 94 new lows.

Donald Trump’s victory is heaven-sent for the 1%, especially Wall Street and the big banks. Trump campaigned on rolling back onerous regulations, and financial stocks soared Wednesday in expectation he will dismantle many of the Obama administration’s efforts to rein in banks after the financial crisis. "Banking is a clear winner based on the fact that Trump has indicated he wants to roll back regulation,” said Heidi Learner, chief economist at the real estate brokerage firm Savills Studley. "For years banks in the city have been shrinking. Now we could see them growing their footprint again." Here are six things Trump will likely do that will help Wall Street. 1. Appoint industry-friendly regulators. Under Obama, regulators at the Federal Reserve have forced banks like JPMorgan Chase to hold more loss-absorbing capital, which constrains profits. Expect the Fed to rethink that policy, especially considering Trump gets to appoint two governors to its board. Meanwhile, Fed Chairman Janet Yellen’s term expires in 2018 and Trump has criticized her for keeping interest rates low for so long, which he said was a political decision—the implication being it was intended to help Hillary Clinton. There will also soon be sweeping changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission—and neither will be headed by Elizabeth Warren, who might have gotten the call in a Hillary Clinton administration. 2. Defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This agency has been unpopular with Republicans since it was created in 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank reform law. The CFPB has been a tough regulator, most notably when it broke the recent case showing Wells Fargo created millions of sham customer accounts. Expect this agency to be heard from in a Trump administration exactly never. 3. Scrap the rule requiring financial advisers to always act in their clients’ best interests. This Labor Department rule has been bitterly opposed by the financial industry. Hedge-fund bundler Anthony Scaramucci, one of Trump’s most vocal Wall Street backers and a prominent campaign advisor, has pledged that a Trump administration is “going to repeal” the rule, calling it the “dumbest decision” the U.S. Government has made in more than half a century. 4. Cut income taxes on the wealthy and increase infrastructure spending. Those public works projects are going to require a lot of loans. It’s also possible the Trump administration will allow companies to transfer cash parked overseas back to the U.S. without paying taxes. 5. Prominent New Yorkers will join the administration. Trump’s backers include John Paulson, a hedge fund billionaire; Howard Lorber, chairman of real estate brokerage Douglas Elliman and hot-dog purveyor Nathan’s Famous; and Wilbur Ross, a prominent private equity executive. His 14-member economic-advisory team likely includes a future Treasury secretary or at least a trade representative to renegotiate all the trade agreements Trump has pledged to revamp. 6. Abandon his campaign promise to close the “carried interest” loophole. This decades-old dodge is beloved on Wall Street because it ensures that earnings for hedge fund and private equity managers are taxed at the advantageous capital gains rate, rather than as ordinary income. Trump has spoken out against it, but it has endured for so long because lawmakers simply don’t want to upset their Wall Street donors. The issue is sure to rise again, especially if Congress tackles corporate and personal-income tax reform, but don’t be surprised if Trump’s position changes.

Prior to the result, the Fed seemed poised to lift rates next month for the first time since December 2015. In the election’s aftermath, market volatility could stay their hand if it persists and financial conditions tighten. Uncertainty about how Trump will approach domestic and international policy could further obscure the economic outlook, and how that plays out has potential to delay or accelerate Fed policy tightening. Other investors echoed BlackRock’s view regarding the Fed’s plans. “The uncertainty and volatility following the US election will, for now, reduce the probability of a Federal Reserve rate hike in December,” wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, in a note titled “A Populist Victory.” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said in a note: “A Trump victory and concomitant market volatility would likely force the Federal Reserve to re-evaluate their monetary policy strategy.” Trump reaches out for unity after stunning upset US presidential win Financial stocks may outperform in the medium term because of higher inflation and steeper yield curves, while US regional banks could benefit from a lighter regulatory burden. US Treasuries could initially benefit, but long-term bonds could come under pressure if markets perceive Trump’s policies to widen the budget deficit. Emerging market assets could sell-off in the short run. T. Rowe Price Group Inc., an asset management firm based in Baltimore, said Trump’s campaign promises on tax cuts and trade, if enacted, could be a negative for the US economy. Trump’s “plans could drive up annual US budget deficits and its long-term debt and significantly diminish international trade, with negative economic effects here and abroad,’the firm’s economists and money managers wrote. Janus Capital Group Inc. was more optimistic. The Denver-based asset manager said in a note that Trump’s win, coupled with Republican control of the Congress, could lead to more spending on infrastructure and tax cuts. “Over the long term, the stimulative initiatives of a Trump administration, along with growth that may be delivered from other policies, may lead to economic expansion conducive to equities,” Janus said. Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, where he oversees $250 billion, said stocks should perform well leading up to the inauguration. “The Trump revolution is likely to be good for risk assets,” he wrote in an e-mail. Minerd cautioned that long-term interest rates will remain under pressure on the expectation of Trump tax cuts. Treasuries tumbled Wednesday, with 30-year bond yields climbing the most in a year, amid speculation the Republican will ramp up spending to boost the economy.   Most Popular Viewed 1 JPMorgan settles bribery case for US$264 million after probe into Chinese hires 2 Hong Kong stocks shrug off Shenzhen stock connect delay to close morning higher 3 APEC must address issues at home as new wave of protectionism threatens progress 4 Fed chief Yellen: Trump’s spending plan to stoke inflation, jack up US debt 5 Chinese home price growth slows as cooling measures take effect Shared 1 JPMorgan settles bribery case for US$264 million after probe into Chinese hires 2 Trump means business (in every sense) 3 Hong Kong stocks shrug off Shenzhen stock connect delay to close morning higher 4 Fed chief Yellen: Trump’s spending plan to stoke inflation, jack up US debt 5 APEC must address issues at home as new wave of protectionism threatens progress Commented 1 Duterte’s war on drugs creating generation of orphans 2 Where to find Hong Kong’s best croissants?

Markets oscillated between gains and losses in choppy morning trade. Heading into the latter stages of trading, each of the three major stock indexes were solidly in positive territory in the wake of Trump's win. Gains of 3 percent each in the heavily weighted healthcare and financials sectors pushed indexes higher. Bond proxy sectors such as real estate, down 2.2 percent, and utilities, each off more than 2 percent, were the worst performers. "When you look at Trump's plans, they are actually pro-market," said Nadia Lovell, U.S. Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. "Increased fiscal spending, that's great for infrastructure and defense names, less regulations that help banks, less involvement in healthcare - things that worried the market before." Trump's plans are reflationary policies, intended to increase economic output by lowering taxes and boosting spending. A curb on drug pricing was a key campaign theme for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, while Trump has called for repealing the Affordable Care Act and loosening restrictions on banks enacted after the financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 182.57 points, or 1 percent, to 18,515.31, the S&P 500 gained 16.79 points, or 0.78 percent, to 2,156.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 28.93 points, or 0.56 percent, to 5,222.42. Through the night, financial markets reacted violently to the election results as Clinton's path to victory narrowed. The S&P futures slid 5 percent and hit a limit down, meaning the contract could not trade lower, only sideways or up. Dow Industrials futures briefly fell 800 points. Republicans maintained their majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress, potentially enabling the party to reshape Washington with two years of "unified" government. "Regardless of the fact you had a Republican sweep, there are still checks and balances in place," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. "So you are going to have some of your more fiscally conservative Republicans that will certainly slow (Trump) down from doing anything crazy in terms of policy changes." Wall Street is typically seen as preferring gridlock, or shared control of the White House and Congress, than a sweep of both chambers of Congress and the presidency. CBOE Volatility index futures shot nearly 40 percent higher at one point, reflecting investors' reservations about a Trump presidency, but sharply retraced the advance after Trump's acceptance speech. During the session the CBOE Volatility index was down 16.9 percent, on track for its biggest daily drop since late June. Big pharmaceutical shares gained, with Pfizer jumping 8.1 percent to $32.42 as the biggest boost to the S&P 500. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF surged 8 percent and was on track for its biggest daily percentage gain in eight years. Among financials, JPMorgan Chase shot up 5.2 percent to $73.70, on pace for its best day in nine months, while Wells Fargo rose 6.3 percent to $48.40.

ALSO READ U.S. election fever keeps global stocks, dollar subdued Global stocks, dollar down on U.S. election worries; oil tumbles Global stocks, dollar rattled by tightening U.S. election race Global stocks, dollar roiled by tightening U.S. election race Global Markets - European stocks rebound as euro slips, U.S. curve flattens By Marc Jones LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar, Mexican peso and world stocks fell on Wednesday as Donald Trump swept to victory in the U.S. presidential election, but fears of a Brexit-style shock that wiped trillions off global markets has failed to materialise so far. As the Wall Street open neared, European shares were down less than 1 percent and traders were returning to other markets that had been sent into a tailspin as it became clear Trump was set for a dramatic victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. [.EU] Investors fear his victory could cause global economic and trade turmoil and years of policy unpredictability, which among other things could discourage the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in December as long expected. "I love this country," Trump said in a victory speech in New York. "America will no longer settle for anything less than the best ... We have a great economic plan, we will double our growth and have the strongest economy in the world." Pledges by Trump that he would also forge strong relations with other big nations helped ease concerns of heavy tariffs being slapped on selling to the United States and a starkly more aggressive geopolitical attitude. Safe-haven sovereign bonds, the Japanese yen and gold were all giving back ground fast having surged in Asian trading as the election results had come in and, as in the case of the Brexit vote in June, proved polls and betting markets woefully wrong. Overnight in Asia, Sean Callow, a forex strategist at Westpac, had said the market reaction had been "as though the four horsemen of the apocalypse just rode out of Trump Tower". But the mood in European trade was far more measured. "The equity markets has rebounded quite a long way so my view is that we have a couple of forces in play," said JP Morgan Asset Management's head of multi asset strategy, John Bilton. "One is that markets are trying to figure out what this might mean and another force which is, if we do get this type of infrastructure spending and tax cuts that have been mooted, maybe that gives the economy a bit of a boost." The 0.6 percent dip in European stocks was nowhere near as bad as the 4 percent plunge futures markets had indicated and the near 9 percent slump they initially suffered after the UK Brexit vote. Mexico's peso also bounced 4 percent, off a record low it had hit overnight - though it was still down an eye-watering 8.5 percent as emerging markets bore the brunt of the impact. [EMRG/FRX] Trump's threats to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and tax money sent home by migrants to pay for building a wall on the southern U.S. border have made the peso particularly reactive to events in the race for the White House. "A lot of Trump's negative geopolitical rhetoric was concentrated around Mexico and trade with Mexico and tearing up the NAFTA agreement, so the peso just become this natural barometer of the election," said Deutsche Bank strategist Gautam Kalani. "What happens now though is all up in the air." TOP TRUMP A wealthy real-estate developer and former reality TV host, Trump rode a wave of anger toward Washington insiders to win the White House race against Clinton, the Democratic candidate whose gold-plated establishment resume included stints as a first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state. Markets had favoured Clinton as a status quo candidate who would be considered a safe pair of hands at home on the world stage. Analysts had no such certainty about Trump whose powers will be bolstered by the Republican's control of the Senate. U.S. stock futures were pointing to a drop of just under 2 percent for Wall Street when it reopens later, less than half the 5 percent they had been suggesting in Asian trade. [.N] The 46-country MSCI 'All World' index was down just 0.8 percent and, although Wall Street's expected drop will add to the fall, so far at least there have been over 25 worse days for the index this year. As FX markets reeled in the initial Asian fright, South Korean authorities were thought to have intervened to steady their currency, and dealers wondered if central banks globally would step in to calm nerves. Japan's top currency diplomat signalled Tokyo's readiness to intervene if necessary as the surging yen threatened to snuff out its fragile economic recovery. The scale of the scare was clearest in the Mexican peso, which plunged more than 13 percent against the dollar at one point in the biggest daily move in two decades. The risk of a global trade war likewise knocked other currencies across Asia, with the Australian dollar leading the rout. The story had been very different against the safe-haven yen, with the U.S. dollar shedding as much as 3.3 percent to 101.85 yen and around 2 percent on the euro before the market changed direction. That U-turn left both were well of their highs by 1307 GMT, at 104.18 yen and $1.1009 for the euro.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan ended down 2.3 percent and the Nikkei in Tokyo closing down 5.4 percent. It lost almost 9 percent after the UK Brexit vote. Sovereign bonds whipsawed, with yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes initially flying down as much as 12 basis points to 1.75 percent - again the largest drop since the Brexit vote - only to climb back up to 1.96 percent in Europe. Fed fund futures had toyed with the idea of a cut in rates next year at one point though they were back again to pricing at least a 50 percent chance of a December hike. It was still seen as a possibility that the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank might be forced to ease policy further. "We are definitely prepared to intervene in an emergency," one of the ECB's longest-standing members, Ewald Nowotny, told reporters in Vienna. "What that will really look like, we must wait and see." In commodity markets, safe-haven gold saw big swings as well, climbing 3.5 percent to $1,320 an ounce as the dollar slid, but then backsliding to around $1,300. There was a screeching U-turn from oil too. U.S. crude bounced over $2 to $45.12 a barrel, while Brent jumped back to $45.50 barrel having been as low as $44.40. [O/R] Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was ready to fully restore ties with the United States following Trump's victory.

Pledges by Trump that he would also forge strong relations with other big nations helped ease concerns of heavy tariffs being slapped on selling to the United States and a starkly more aggressive geopolitical attitude. Safe-haven sovereign bonds, the Japanese yen and gold were all giving back ground fast having surged in Asian trading as the election results had come in and, as in the case of the Brexit vote in June, proved polls and betting markets woefully wrong. Overnight in Asia, Sean Callow, a forex strategist at Westpac, had said the market reaction had been "as though the four horsemen of the apocalypse just rode out of Trump Tower". But the mood in European trade was far more measured. "The equity markets has rebounded quite a long way so my view is that we have a couple of forces in play," said JP Morgan Asset Management's head of multi asset strategy, John Bilton. "One is that markets are trying to figure out what this might mean and another force which is, if we do get this type of infrastructure spending and tax cuts that have been mooted, maybe that gives the economy a bit of a boost." The 0.6 percent dip in European stocks was nowhere near as bad as the 4 percent plunge futures markets had indicated and the near 9 percent slump they initially suffered after the UK Brexit vote. Mexico's peso also bounced 4 percent, off a record low it had hit overnight - though it was still down an eye-watering 8.5 percent as emerging markets bore the brunt of the impact. [EMRG/FRX] Trump's threats to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and tax money sent home by migrants to pay for building a wall on the southern U.S. border have made the peso particularly reactive to events in the race for the White House. "A lot of Trump's negative geopolitical rhetoric was concentrated around Mexico and trade with Mexico and tearing up the NAFTA agreement, so the peso just become this natural barometer of the election," said Deutsche Bank strategist Gautam Kalani. "What happens now though is all up in the air." TOP TRUMP A wealthy real-estate developer and former reality TV host, Trump rode a wave of anger toward Washington insiders to win the White House race against Clinton, the Democratic candidate whose gold-plated establishment resume included stints as a first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state. Markets had favoured Clinton as a status quo candidate who would be considered a safe pair of hands at home on the world stage. Analysts had no such certainty about Trump whose powers will be bolstered by the Republican's control of the Senate. U.S. stock futures were pointing to a drop of just under 2 percent for Wall Street when it reopens later, less than half the 5 percent they had been suggesting in Asian trade. [.N] The 46-country MSCI 'All World' index was down just 0.8 percent and, although Wall Street's expected drop will add to the fall, so far at least there have been over 25 worse days for the index this year. As FX markets reeled in the initial Asian fright, South Korean authorities were thought to have intervened to steady their currency, and dealers wondered if central banks globally would step in to calm nerves. Japan's top currency diplomat signalled Tokyo's readiness to intervene if necessary as the surging yen threatened to snuff out its fragile economic recovery. The scale of the scare was clearest in the Mexican peso, which plunged more than 13 percent against the dollar at one point in the biggest daily move in two decades. The risk of a global trade war likewise knocked other currencies across Asia, with the Australian dollar leading the rout. The story had been very different against the safe-haven yen, with the U.S. dollar shedding as much as 3.3 percent to 101.85 yen and around 2 percent on the euro before the market changed direction. That U-turn left both were well of their highs by 1307 GMT, at 104.18 yen and $1.1009 for the euro. [/FRX] Graphic of live election results: http://tmsnrt.rs/2fxyZV0 Graphic of live market reaction: http://tmsnrt.rs/2fXfo0L Live Coverage: http://live.reuters.com/event/election_2016 UNCERTAINTY Asian stocks, which had closed before Trump's victory speech spoke of the need to strengthen the United States and keep global relations, showed the day's biggest dents. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan ended down 2.3 percent and the Nikkei in Tokyo closing down 5.4 percent. It lost almost 9 percent after the UK Brexit vote. Sovereign bonds whipsawed, with yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes initially flying down as much as 12 basis points to 1.75 percent - again the largest drop since the Brexit vote - only to climb back up to 1.96 percent in Europe. Fed fund futures had toyed with the idea of a cut in rates next year at one point though they were back again to pricing at least a 50 percent chance of a December hike. It was still seen as a possibility that the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank might be forced to ease policy further. "We are definitely prepared to intervene in an emergency," one of the ECB's longest-standing members, Ewald Nowotny, told reporters in Vienna. "What that will really look like, we must wait and see." In commodity markets, safe-haven gold saw big swings as well, climbing 3.5 percent to $1,320 an ounce as the dollar slid, but then backsliding to around $1,300. There was a screeching U-turn from oil too. U.S. crude bounced over $2 to $45.12 a barrel, while Brent jumped back to $45.50 barrel having been as low as $44.40. [O/R] Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was ready to fully restore ties with the United States following Trump's victory.

After steep losses that left stock futures limit down overnight, the Dow and S&P 500 were sharply higher on unusually high volume, after minor opening losses. The Dow jumped more than 250 points and was racing toward a new all-time high, a radical turnaround from its 800-point loss in the futures market. The Nasdaq was higher and small caps gained, with the Russell 2000 up 2.5 percent in afternoon trading. Treasury yields shot higher, and stocks that would benefit from infrastructure programs surged. The Dow was helped by a 7 percent jump in Caterpillar, and gains in financials — Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Stocks focused on the positives of Donald Trump's policies but ignored its fears that he could ignite a global trade war. The dollar jumped, and the Mexican peso continued under pressure, losing another 8 percent to record lows. "For the first time, we have the possibility of fiscal policy being implemented in such a way that it has the possibility of changing the deflation we've had for quite a while," said Krishna Memani, CIO of OppenheimerFunds. He said near-term impacts on the economy from any potential market turbulence will likely be mitigated by a more accommodative Fed. Trump has also proposed a lower corporate tax rate and a one-time tax holiday that would mean U.S. companies could bring back the billions they have stashed overseas. Why banks are moving higher Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump is seen speaking on a television on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016. Banks benefit from higher inflation — and higher interest rates – and the bond market Wednesday was in a steep sell-off, which sent yields higher. The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2 percent, its highest level since January.The short end — the 2-year yield — was also higher at 0.90 percent, and that is the most sensitive to Fed interest rate hikes. The stock market had been set up for a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton and was expected to sell off sharply in the event of a Trump upset, because of his unpredictability and some of his policies, such as trade and immigration. But in his victory speech in the early hours of Wednesday, he emphasized spending on rebuilding American infrastructure. That type of big spending means more debt, and has the potential to fuel inflation. The bond market was reflecting that Wednesday. "Frankly, you don't know what he's going to do. He's an unpredictable character, and politicians say a lot of things in elections that never come to fruition. The tone of his campaign initially was very negative with his focus on immigration and trade, and became more positive with the focus on infrastructure and tax cuts," said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. "Trump is coming in defining his legacy. He literally wants to build it." Trump also wants to boost defense spending, and stocks like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics all surged more than 4 percent. "When you look at Trump's fiscal package — he's Reagan plus infrastructure spending. He's basically faster growth, bigger budget deficits and this probably will give us inflation," said McCarthy. President Ronald Reagan boosted U.S. military spending dramatically before the end of the Cold War. "Because of inflation expectations getting higher, it's really more about buying cyclicals, buying commodities-oriented things, buying short-duration assets, value rather than growth, U.S. rather than emerging markets, small cap versus large cap, and loans versus high yield bonds." -Krishna Memani, CIO of OppenheimerFunds Memani said Trump could still be very negative for globalization and trade, but the infrastructure program changes the outlook for the U.S. economy and could break it out of a slow growth environment with no inflation. "What it does is emerging markets, which were hot and getting all those flows, have to stop. This is anti-globalizaton and there's no way to put lipstick on that pig," he said. Mexican stocks were down 2 percent Wednesday, and other Latin American markets were also lower. German and French shares rallied and ended sharply higher, while Asian stocks ended lower, with the Nikkei down 5.4 percent. Trump's plan for a big spending package is critical, even with the debt, he said. "We need to do that because if we don't add to the debt there's no shot of reducing the debt over the long term," he said. He said that makes for new opportunities in stocks. "Because of inflation expectations getting higher, it's really more about buying cyclicals, buying commodities-oriented things, buying short-duration assets, value rather than growth, U.S. rather than emerging markets, small cap versus large cap, and loans versus high-yield bonds," said Memani. The "Trump trade" also extended to biotechs, with the IBB ETF jumping 6 percent. Clinton had vowed to go after drug pricing and was a negative for the sector. A proposition in California to regulate drug pricing also failed in Tuesday's election. "Trump will not be as combative now that he has won. The jury is out on whether he can bring back those lost jobs from overseas and restart those closed American factories. His victory is not quite like Reagan's "Morning in America, Prouder, Stronger, Better," but maybe the votes for change will eventually be seen in a more positive light. Right now though the East Coast and West Coast of the country is in shock." -Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank Analysts have debated whether a Trump sell-off would be followed by a sustainable bounce back that could carry markets higher into year-end. Some believe that it will, but Morgan Stanley strategists said in a note Wednesday that they would not buy the dip and they are more bearish than before the election because of the uncertainty. However, they offered some stock picks that they see doing well in the new administration and would add to industrial holdings. "We think there will be some excitement in the coming weeks about some additional infrastructure spending, an area where there appears to be some political common ground. Many of the key end markets have stopped deteriorating and are now showing second-derivative, if not first-derivative improvement, including the oil market, metals and mining, and select infrastructure," they wrote. "We are positive on more housing structures and household formations." They also like defense and airlines. Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said he still sees a rate hike in December, and he agreed with others on the sectors that will benefit from a Trump presidency. "Health care and financial company stocks will lead the way," Rupkey wrote. "Trump will not be as combative now that he has won. The jury is out on whether he can bring back those lost jobs from overseas and restart those closed American factories. His victory is not quite like Reagan's "Morning in America, Prouder, Stronger, Better," but maybe the votes for change will eventually be seen in a more positive light. Right now though the East Coast and West Coast of the country is in shock."

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Thu, Nov 10, 2016 - Page 11　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Thailand holds rate amid market chaos, growth risks Bloomberg The Bank of Thailand yesterday held its key interest rate steady for a 12th consecutive meeting, preserving its firepower as growth risks mount following the death of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej and heightened market turmoil in the aftermath of the US elections. The central bank kept its one-day bond repurchase rate at 1.5 percent, with monetary policy committee members voting unanimously in favor, the bank said in Bangkok. All but one of the 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the decision, with JPMorgan Chase & Co forecasting a cut. “The committee saw the need to preserve policy space given that the Thai economy would still be facing greater uncertainties going forward,” including on the global recovery and the direction of economic policy in advanced nations, the central bank said in a statement. Policymakers face rising risks following the death of the king, who has served as a pillar of stability in a country that has had 10 coups during his seven-decade rule. They also have to contend with an emerging-market sell-off after US president-elect Donald Trump’s shock win in the US presidential election, which sent Thailand’s benchmark SET Index down as much as 1.6 percent yesterday. The SET Index was 0.5 percent lower as of 3:35pm in Bangkok, while the baht rose 0.1 percent to 34.902 per US dollar. “It is too soon to assess the impact from the US election as it will take some time for whoever wins the election to elaborate on policies,” Bank of Thailand Assistant Governor Jaturong Jantarangs told reporters in Bangkok. “Looking ahead, volatility will rise, so we want the private sector to be prepared to cope with volatility in capital movement and foreign exchange.” Exports rose for a second consecutive month in September. Consumer prices last month rose 0.34 percent from a year earlier, the seventh straight month of gains. This story has been viewed 1172 times. Comments will be moderated.

Morgan Chase stock surges to record high, Bank of America shares rally to 15-month high Getty Images By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor Financial stocks rocketed in active trade Wednesday, in the aftermath of Donald Trump being elected president, as expectations of a tamer regulatory environment and rising interest rates overshadowed any concerns over market uncertainty. The SPDR Financial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLF, +0.00%  soared 4.3% to the highest close in 8 1/2 years, with 60 of its 64 equity components posting gains. With volume of 262.2 million shares, which was nearly five times the full-day average, the financial ETF (XLF) was the second-most active stock traded on the major U.S. exchanges. See Market Snapshot. Read: Here’s how to potentially profit from a Donald Trump victory Analyst Keith Horowitz at Citigroup wrote in a recent note to clients that a Trump victory could weigh on banks, “given the uncertainty around policy implications.” However, a Republican-controlled Senate would help soothe fears of increased regulation. Among some of the financial ETF’s most heavily weighted components, Bank of America Corp.’s stock BAC, -0.40%  ran up 5.7% to the highest close since Aug. 10, 2015. It was the most actively traded stock, with volume of 316 million shares. Shares of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.40%  powered up 4.6% to a record close, despite a downgrade at RW Baird. Analyst David George cut his rating to neutral from outperform, citing concerns over valuation, as investors are underestimating the risks that longer-term interest rates will remain low. George also said political risks should remain elevated, but he is “optimistic/hopeful the anti-Wall Street rhetoric will fade.” Standard & Poor’s said the uncertainty is centered around Trump’s mixed message toward the sector, as he has supported bringing back the “bank-breaking” Glass-Steagall bill, despite wanting to reduce regulatory rules. Read: Trump’s victory is just the beginning of the shocks for stocks Shares of Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +0.63%  shot up 5.4% and Citigroup Inc. C, +0.02%  jumped 3.4% to their highest close of the year. Meanwhile, shares of insurers were mixed. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Class B shares BRK.B, -0.40%  erased earlier losses to rally 2.4% to the highest close since Jan. 8, 2015, while Travelers Companies Inc.’s stock TRV, +0.58%  dropped 1%, but had tumbled as much as 4.2% to a nine-month low in intraday trade. Trump’s presidential win ushers in shock(1:37) Donald Trump's unpredicted victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election has launched the nation’s capital into a zone of uncertainty. What will happen next? Also helping banks outperform, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00%  climbed 0.21 percentage points to 10-month high of 2.072%, amid expectations that Trump will boost fiscal spending. Higher long-term yields can help boost bank profits, as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. Among the brokers, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s stock GS, +0.34%  gained 5.9% to a one-year high and Morgan Stanley shares MS, +1.15%  advanced 7.1% to a 15-month high.

Home Mail News Sport Finance Celebrity Style Weather Answers Flickr Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us UK Yahoo Originals World Finance Sport Motoring Science & Tech Celebrity TV Movies Style Weather News Video Viral U.S. stocks, bond yields jump after Trump shock, Mexican peso falls By Sinead Carew9 November 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share By Sinead Carew NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rallied on Wednesday after a dramatic overnight sell-off, while bond yields jumped on inflation expectations and the Mexican peso was battered as investors reacted to Donald Trump's surprise win in the U.S. presidential election. While equity investors' election night panic turned to daytime jubilation, bond investors worried Trump's protectionist policies would ultimately weaken the dollar and hike inflation. U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yields gained almost 25 basis points in their sharpest rise in more than five years. Benchmark U.S. 10-year note yields also advanced, climbing 21 basis points to their highest since January in their biggest increase in more than three years. The U.S. dollar rose across the board and hit its highest against the Japanese yen in nearly four months. It gained support from the equity turnaround and the yield spreads, said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. The Mexican peso recouped some losses after falling to a record low. The currency has been vulnerable to Trump's threats to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and to tax money sent home by migrants to pay for building a border wall. The three major U.S. stock indexes rose as investors piled into financial and healthcare stocks on hopes of weaker regulation than was expected from a Hillary Clinton presidency. "The fact the Republicans control all three branches of government made a lot of people think that some of Trump's ideas that were pro-business - lower taxes and lower regulation - could actually be passed," Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. Goldman Sachs chief investment officer Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani advised private wealth clients to "stay the course" on expectations for a large stimulus that would boost investments. Investors also recalled that global stocks' dramatic decline after Britain voted in June to leave the European Union was short-lived and was ultimately seen as a buying opportunity. The MSCI world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> plunged as much 7.2 percent in the two trading sessions after the June 23 Brexit vote before rising 8.8 percent in the following 12 days. The index, which was flat on Wednesday, was 8.6 percent higher than the post Brexit low. But many money managers said they expect volatility in the coming weeks as the world awaits January's inauguration for more concrete clues of what a Trump presidency means. "Trump doesn't have a history in government that people can look back at," said Meckler. "Whatever he has to say in the coming weeks will have an oversized effect on the market." The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 256.95 points, or 1.4 percent, to 18,589.69, the S&P 500 <.SPX> had gained 23.7 points, or 1.11 percent, to 2,163.26 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 57.58 points, or 1.11 percent, to 5,251.07. UNCERTAINTY Trump's victory speech pledge that he would forge strong relations with other big nations helped ease some concerns about heavy tariffs being slapped on imports to the United States and a starkly more aggressive geopolitical attitude. But emerging markets bore the brunt of the Republican nominee's victory, with Mexico's peso still down 8.2 percent after falling more than 13 percent to hit a record low overnight. [EMRG/FRX] LibertyView's Meckler said he would be surprised if Asian stocks don't bounce back Thursday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> ended down 2.3 percent Wednesday while Tokyo's Nikkei <.N225> fell 5.4 percent. In commodity markets, safe-haven gold sharply pulled back initial gains and were essentially flat at $1,275 an ounce after climbing as much as 4.9 percent to $1,337.40 . Oil prices recovered along with U.S. equities, with Brent crude up 0.96 percent at $46.47 a barrel and U.S. crude rising 0.6 percent to $45.27.

The Bank of Thailand kept its one-day bond repurchase rate at 1.5 percent, with monetary policy committee members voting unanimously in favor, it said in Bangkok on Wednesday. All but one of the 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the decision, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. forecasting a cut. “The Committee saw the need to preserve policy space given that the Thai economy would still be facing greater uncertainties going forward,” including on the global recovery and the direction of economic policy in advanced nations, the central bank said in a statement. Policy makers face rising risks following the death of the king, who has served as a pillar of stability in a country that’s had 10 coups during his seven-decade rule. They also have to contend with an emerging-market sell-off after Donald Trump’s shock win in the U.S. presidential election, which sent Thailand’s benchmark SET Index down as much as 1.6 percent on Wednesday. “Interest rates will probably stay unchanged until next year,” said Santitarn Sathirathai, head of Southeast Asia and India economics and strategy at Credit Suisse Group AG in Singapore. “There’s a lot of room and willingness by the government to use fiscal policy to cap risks to growth. They’ve already started infrastructure projects as well as announced short-term pro-consumption measures.” Click here to read Veerathai’s comments on slower spending during mourning. The SET index was 0.5 percent lower as of 3:35 p.m. in Bangkok, while the baht rose 0.1 percent to 34.902 per dollar. “It’s too soon to assess the impact from the U.S. election as it will take some time for whoever wins the election to elaborate on policies,” Assistant Governor Jaturong Jantarangs told reporters in Bangkok. “Looking ahead, volatility will rise, so we want the private sector to be prepared to cope with volatility in capital movement and foreign exchange.” Exports rose for a second consecutive month in September. Consumer prices rose 0.34 percent in October from a year earlier, the seventh straight month of gains. The inflation rate will probably rise slowly and may return to the 1 percent to 4 percent target “later than previously projected,” depending on price movements for fresh food and oil, the central bank said in the statement.
