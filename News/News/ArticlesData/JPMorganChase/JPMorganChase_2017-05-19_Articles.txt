Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States JPMorgan’s Favorite Biotechs to Buy With Massive Upside Potential By Lee Jackson May 19, 2017 8:25 am EDT Print Email Tweet After a couple of down years in which the shrill political rhetoric over drug prices kept a pall over the industry, the biotechs are showing some signs of life. In fact, the Nasdaq Biotech Index (NASDAQ: NBI) is up 9%, compared with less than 5% for the S&P 500. The keyword for investors, especially in the small to mid-cap arena, is selectivity, according to the team at JPMorgan. In a new research report, they combed through the first-quarter results as they do each quarter, looking for the best values and risk-reward for investors. The analysts presented ideas for investors from five categories: Long Term, Relative Underperformer, Clinical/Binary Event, Pullback and Underfollowed/Undervalued. Here we focus on higher profile companies from these groups that were rated Overweight at JPMorgan. Array BioPharma This stock has pulled back 41% from highs printed earlier this year. Array BioPharma Inc. (NASDAQ: ARRY) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule drugs to treat patients afflicted with cancer. Its programs include these three cancer drugs: binimetinib, encorafenib and selumetinib (partnered with AstraZeneca, PLC). The analysts noted in the report: In early May, we upgraded the shares, on the back of shares having pulled back and upcoming catalysts for the company. Indeed, one of these catalysts played out with positive COLUMBUS Part 2 results of binimetinib+ encorafenib in BRAF melanoma, which significantly de-risks the regulatory path forward, in our view (filing expected in the June/July timeframe). Additionally, recently, the company announced a non-exclusive binimetinib I/O collaboration with Merck. The JPMorgan price target for the stock is $10, and the Wall Street consensus target is $12.11. The shares closed Thursday at $8.14. Jazz Pharmaceuticals While not under the pressure some of the companies have been, the stock is still down big from highs printed this time last year. Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC (NASDAQ: JAZZ) is a biopharmaceutical company that identifies, develops and commercializes pharmaceutical products for various medical needs in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Its portfolio of products and product candidates has a focus in the areas of sleep and hematology/oncology. The company markets Xyrem, an oral solution for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy; Erwinaze to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia; Defitelio for the treatment and prevention of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a potentially life-threatening complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; and Prialt, an intrathecally administered infusion of ziconotide for the management of severe chronic pain. The report noted: Jazz remains one of the stocks where we see the most compelling risk/reward and we continue see potential for substantial further stock appreciation in 2017 on the back of a consistent string of catalysts. Looking further a head, in the second half of 2017 we will watch for the approval and launch of Vyxeos as well as progress advancing next-gen Xyrem products JZP-507 (filing by first quarter 2018) and ‘258. JPMorgan has a $190 price target, and the consensus target is $183.24. The stock closed Thursday at $149.14. Ironwood Pharmaceutical This stock saw a big spike up recently and could be poised for a much bigger move. Ironwood Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of gastrointestinal therapies. Along with a various partners it markets linaclotide (Linzess/Constella) for the treatment of constipation dominant irritable bowel syndrome and chronic idiopathic constipation. First-quarter Linzess U.S. sales of $147.6 million were below consensus estimate, due to inventory destocking and Medicare “donut hole.” The near-term focus is on IW-3718 Phase 2b results expected in mid-2017, along with a management decision on Phase 3 studies. The pipeline continues on track with Phase 2a results of IW-1973 and IW-1701, which are expected in the second half of this year, and Duzallo approval in late 2017. The $20 JPMorgan price target compares with the consensus target of $17.58. Shares closed Thursday at $18.16. Radius Health This stock also has pulled back sharply and offers an outstanding entry point. Radius Health Inc. (NASDAQ: RDUS) is a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis and other endocrine-mediated diseases. Its first product, abaloparatide, should reach the market in 2017 and is for the treatment of osteoporosis. The FDA approved the company’s abaloparatide-SC for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. Label includes a “black box” warning for risk of osteosarcoma, as expected, given a similar warning seen with Eli Lilly’s Forteo. Favorable nonvertebral response compared to Forteo is not in label, but published literature can be used to promote drug use. The analyst’s report said: Following the approval and announced pricing for Tymlos (abaloparatide), we see the product positioned for a successful launch (particularly as Part D coverage comes into place in 2018) and view the company’s assets as undervalued at the current stock price. In the near term, we see potential for updated data for RAD1901 (SERD, breast cancer) at ASCO to drive upside in valuation with minimal credit in the stock for it today. The JPMorgan price target is a huge $74. The consensus price objective is $57.13, and shares closed Thursday at $35.00.

Photo: Elizabeth Conley, Houston Chronicle 609 Main: A different skyscraper 1 / 13 Back to Gallery From John Mooz's office, you can look out at the skyscrapers most people I know cite as favorites in the downtown skyline. There are the twin trapezoids of Pennzoil Place, the postmodern spikiness of Bank of America Center – both Philip Johnson buildings. You have to crane your neck, but you can even see the top of I.M. Pei's 75-story JPMorgan Chase Tower, the tallest in Texas. All those buildings (and more than a few others you can see from here) were developed by Hines, where Mooz is a senior managing director. But they come from a different time – the '70s and early '80s, when Houston was booming, oil-rich and risk-proud, and everyone said it was the city of the future. These buildings stood out through the audacity of their architecture. They were stranger, taller, spikier. Ada Louise Huxtable, the New York Times critic, went so far as to call Pennzoil Place "a work of art" that possessed "a synthesis [of elements] passionately to be desired and rarely achieved." Those buildings still look the same. But Houston has changed around them. After Enron, "risk" no longer seems heroic. People do still sometimes say Houston is the city of the future, but now they mean our diversity, not our architecture. (With a few exceptions.) Photo: Elizabeth Conley, Houston Chronicle 609 Main, marked by an angular crown, takes it place in the downtown skyline, as seen from Buffalo Bayou Park. 609 Main, marked by an angular crown, takes it place in the... And maybe the most appropriate place to contemplate these changes is here in Mooz's office, near the top of Hines' newest contribution to Houston's skyline: 609 Main at Texas. It's one of the more ambitious skyscrapers developed downtown in years – developed during a bust, no less – and it says a lot about Houston now.   EVEN PENNZOIL Place, Huxtable wrote, is "best seen ... from the freeway." And from the freeway, which is how most of us see our skyscrapers, 609 Main appears a handsome, shiny, elegant guy. Maybe my favorite view of it happens when I'm heading south from the Heights on I-45, as the building emerges almost shyly between the new Market Square Tower and JPMorgan Chase. The 48-story office tower, to be anchored by United Airlines, was designed by New Haven, Connecticut-based architecture firm Pickard Chilton,which has been busy in Houston recently. It did the master planning and design for the enormous ExxonMobil campus near The Woodlands, as well as for a number of new skyscrapers in Uptown – Amegy Bank Headquarters and BHP Billiton Tower among them. Photo: Gary Fountain, Gary Fountain/For The Chronicle Daylight pours into the the 44th-floor offices of Hines at 609 Main Street. Daylight pours into the the 44th-floor offices of Hines at 609 Main... The last building Hines and Pickard Chilton worked on together downtown was BG Group Place, which opened in 2011, just two blocks away. Hines bought the two properties at the same time, largely because they were both on the Main Street light rail line. At first glance, from the outside, BG Group Place and 609 Main look startlingly similar, like siblings. Highly reflective glass curtain walls, colored variably as the weather changes, cling like expensively tailored suits. The main differences seem to amount to details: On BG Group Place, there are vertical louvers that act as sun shades; on 609 Main, ornamental steel piping. Both towers cozy up to boxy parking garages. Both are handsome, respectable, stylish – as Jon Pickard, the architect, says, "We wanted to make a building that's beautiful and contributes to the dignity of the city." Philip Johnson might have said something similar in the '70s. But, at that time, Houston's dignity didn't include access to public transit or engagement with the street. Streets were treated with dim embarrassment, like urinals. Buildings had to have them, but they weren't something a developer would tout. The opposite, in fact: A '70s-era promotional book about Pennzoil Place brags about the parking garage's direct access from the freeways. Workers never had to interact with the street at all. And it's from the street that you start to see some of the gestures that set these buildings apart from their flashier predecessors. On the Main Street side, 609 Main puts on a show best seen from the sidewalk. A soaring triangular void with mirrored inlays – Mooz calls it the "crystalline atrium" – creates a dizzying experience for a pedestrian. You see yourself coming and going. Eventually, there will be a restaurant here, which should make the reflections that much more chaotic, that much more interesting. The Capitol Street side offers pedestrians no such thrills. But neither will they walk along a dead, blank wall: Besides the views into the lobby and the liveliness of being along another light rail line, David Buehrer, who developed Greenway Coffee and Tea, Blacksmith and Morningstar, will operate Prelude on the corner, what Mooz calls "more than a coffee shop. It's a coffee experience." These buildings, Mooz says, can make you feel you're in a real city. Photo: Elizabeth Conley, Houston Chronicle Like siblings: BG Group Place, at left, and 609 Main, at right, both developed by Hines and designed by Pickard Chilton. Like siblings: BG Group Place, at left, and 609 Main, at right,...   IF BG Group Place and 609 Main are like siblings, the younger one benefited from experience. Mooz is adamant that both Hines and Pickard Chilton learned a lot from BG Group Place. What's new, he says, is an enhanced efficiency in the way 609 Main works and a – could it be the right word? – loving attention to the people who work there. The emphasis isn't on what you see from the freeway; it's on what's inside. Photo: Gary Fountain, Gary Fountain/For The Chronicle The fountain in the main lobby of the new skyscraper at 609 Main Street. The fountain in the main lobby of the new skyscraper at 609 Main... There are grand gestures, like the lobby's seriously elegant finishes. Philip Croker, who works with Mooz for Hines, traveled to a mountain in Italy to choose the marble of what he calls the "stone paintings" that hang between the elevator banks. And a single charcoal-black rectangular fountain, a ringer for the ones outside Rice's Brochstein Pavilion, bubbles peacefully inside the lobby. But, mainly, 609 Main concerns itself with the less glamorous details on the upper floors. It's a building, Pickard says, that "can encourage people to live a full, happy and productive life." Productive is the operative word: The building's beauty is all about tenants' bottom lines, about getting more and better work out of their employees. "As we've completed these corporate headquarters," Pickard says, "we've found that delivering daylight, views of nature, luminous spaces and fresh air dramatically improves productivity. People have a tendency to sign up for fitness facilities, and morale goes up." Since BG Group Place, Hines and Pickard Chilton have learned tenants don't necessarily need a conference room every day, so they put in a shared conference center that can be used as needed. They learned that workers don't necessarily want pedestrians to be able to gawk at the sweating and crunching going on inside the fitness center, so that's moved up to the second floor, where it'll have a view of the street, but not be the view from the street. "We focused on the things that touch you – light and air," Mooz says. They learned that one of workers' most frequent complaints is about being too hot or too cold. So 609 Main is the first building in the city that will use an advanced underfloor air system: Air isn't pumped down from exposed ducts, leaving half the office huddling in cardigans and the other rolling up their sleeves. Instead, it's circulated down below, between the concrete slab and raised floor plates. Mooz said that this technology requires additional investment up front, but it is repaid over the life of the building through energy efficiency and resale value. (This building is rated LEED Platinum, the highest level of environmental performance.) He's convinced that underfloor air systems are the next big thing for high-end office buildings like this one.   THE PHRASE "advanced underfloor air system" might not excite you, and it probably won't compel a visit from architecture critics in New York. But it means that 609 Main is a different kind of skyscraper. It means we're living in a different kind of city, that people want a different kind of city. "Tenants vote with their occupancy," Mooz says, and the building is filling up quickly – it's already 60 percent leased. "People used to build these things almost as ego statements," Pickard says. "That's gone. It's about the workplace, now, and it's about the ability to make a difference in productivity." Lending practices, as Gerald Hines has said, have changed, too. In the '70s, it wasn't just Houston's oilmen taking big risks. "Buildings used to be financed with much higher levels of leverage and debt," Mooz says. 609 Main was developed during a downturn, with more of the developer's skin in the game. The goal wasn't to wow New Yorkers. It was, as Mooz says, to develop a "best-of-class building that's commercially viable." It's not that Hines is less ambitious now. It's just that that ambition has matured to "getting the inside right," as Mooz says.

These are connected to United Airlines' floors. Lush rooftop gardens, designed by the Office of James Burnett, in... From the freeway, 609 Main might lack the immediate intrigue of Pennzoil Place or Bank of America Center or JPMorgan Chase Tower. But it does possess a quietude that grows on you. Maybe it's a building that reads nonfiction and runs 5Ks. It doesn't stay out all night at dive bars. It's more reserved than that, more earnest, more good.

Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data shown. For performance current to the most recent month-end please call 1-844-4JPM-ETF. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.  JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF (JPST) RISK SUMMARY Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF shares are bought and sold throughout the day on an exchange at market price (not NAV) through a brokerage account, and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by Authorized Participants, in very large creation/redemption units. For all products, brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities may decline in value, face valuation difficulties, become more volatile and/or become illiquid. They are also subject to prepayment risk, which occurs when mortgage holders refinance or otherwise repay their loans sooner than expected, creating an early return of principal to holders of the loans. Because the Fund may invest a significant portion of its assets in securities of companies in the banking industry, developments affecting the banking industry may have a disproportionate impact on the Fund. International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and decreased trading volume. Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the Fund’s original investment. The Fund is actively managed and there is no guarantee the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Actively managed funds typically charge more than index-linked products. Diversification may not protect against market loss. JPHF – JPMorgan Diversified Alternatives ETF RISK SUMMARY Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF shares are bought and sold throughout the day on an exchange at market price (not NAV) through a brokerage account, and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by Authorized Participants, in very large creation/redemption units. For all products, brokerage commissions will reduce returns. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and financial industry regulatory authorities in other countries may impose prohibitions, restrictions or other regulatory requirements on short sales, which could inhibit the ability of the adviser to enter into short sale transactions on behalf of the Fund. The Fund’s investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. The Fund may also invest in securities including junk bonds, loans and instruments that are issued by companies that are highly leveraged, less creditworthy or financially distressed. These investments are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater risk of loss, greater sensitivity to interest rate and economic changes, valuation difficulties and potential illiquidity. Loans are subject to additional risks including subordination to other creditors, no collateral or limited rights in collateral, lack of a regular trading market, extended settlement periods, liquidity risks and lack of publicly available information. International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and decreased trading volume. Investing in alternative assets involves higher risks than traditional investments and is suitable only for sophisticated investors. Alternative investments involve greater risks than traditional investments and should not be deemed a complete investment program. They are not tax efficient and an investor should consult with his/her tax advisor prior to investing. Alternative investments have higher fees than traditional investments and they may also be highly leveraged and engage in speculative investment techniques, which can magnify the potential for investment loss or gain. The value of the investment may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than they invested. Alternative investment strategies use a variety of complicated investment techniques and involve complex securities transactions that include risks in addition to those risks with direct investments in securities described in the prospectus. The Fund may invest in futures contracts, options, swaps, forwards and other derivatives. Many derivatives create leverage thereby causing the Fund to be more volatile than it would be if it had not used derivatives. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in economic and market conditions and could result in losses that significantly exceed the Fund’s original investment. The Fund may use derivatives in connection with its investment strategies. Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the Fund’s original investment. Many derivatives will give rise to a form of leverage. Derivatives are also subject to the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in losses to the Fund, and the cost of such strategies may reduce the Fund’s returns. Derivatives also expose the Fund to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. In addition, the Fund may use derivatives for non-hedging purposes which increases the Fund’s potential for loss. The Fund could experience a loss and its liquidity may be negatively impacted when selling securities to meet redemption requests by shareholders. The risk of loss increases if the redemption requests are unusually large or frequent or occur in times of overall market turmoil or declining prices. Similarly, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain a larger cash position than it ordinarily would. There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investment’s exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investments in a portfolio involved in long and short selling may have higher portfolio turnover rates. This will likely result in additional tax consequences. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions. There is no guarantee the Fund will meet its investment objective. Diversification may not protect against market loss. J.P.

We are beginning to sense a trend with THE WHITE HOUSE: they oftentimes act as if politicians are completely consistent in their views. For example, the president seemed convinced dismissing James Comey would be popular with both parties, just because Democrats criticized him during the campaign. And now, they seem to think, just because Joe Lieberman was a Senate Democrat (at one point), the entire caucus would vote to confirm him as FBI director. (Don’t feel bad, guys. We kind of thought so too.) Lieberman is the leading contender, according to the White House. See Burgess Everett and Seung Min Kim’s story http://politi.co/2qDrHSl -- SENIOR DEMOCRATIC AIDE: STAY WHERE YOU ARE, JOE: “Anyone who thinks Senate Democrats are going to welcome a Lieberman nomination with open arms doesn’t understand Senate Democrats. This is the worst possible time to hand the FBI over to a politician of any stripe, let alone one whose judgment led him to praise the hiring of General Flynn for National Security Adviser. If the White House is spoiling for a fight on this, they’ll get one.” **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh IF YOU READ ONE THING -- GARRETT GRAFF, author of “The Threat Matrix: The FBI at War,” in POLITICO Magazine, “What Donald Trump Needs to Know About Bob Mueller and Jim Comey: The two men who could bring down the president have been preparing their entire lives for this moment”: “What unfolds ahead will be territory all too familiar to both Comey and Mueller—the field of play where they have made their careers and risen to the highest levels of government—yet the way that a Washington scandal takes on a life of its own amid independent investigations and looming prosecutions is deeply unfamiliar to Trump and many associates around him. … It is as if, after having an unrelated disagreement over movie trivia in a bar, Trump has challenged Usain Bolt to a 100-yard dash or John Cena to a cage match to the death.” http://politi.co/2qZ1rVy NYT, A1 -- MIKE SCHMIDT STRIKES AGAIN -- “Comey, Unsettled by Trump, Is Said to Have Wanted Him Kept at a Distance”: “President Trump called the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, weeks after he took office and asked him when federal authorities were going to put out word that Mr. Trump was not personally under investigation, according to two people briefed on the call. “Mr. Comey told the president that if he wanted to know details about the bureau’s investigations, he should not contact him directly but instead follow the proper procedures and have the White House counsel send any inquiries to the Justice Department, according to those people. After explaining to Mr. Trump how communications with the F.B.I. should work, Mr. Comey believed he had effectively drawn the line after a series of encounters he had with the president and other White House officials that he felt jeopardized the F.B.I.’s independence. At the time, Mr. Comey was overseeing the investigation into links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia. ... “The day after the Flynn conversation, Reince Priebus … asked Mr. Comey to help push back on reports in the news media that Mr. Trump’s associates had been in contact with Russian intelligence officials during the campaign.” http://nyti.ms/2q332o5 -- WAPO: “Comey prepared extensively for his conversations with Trump,” by Devlin Barrett, Ellen Nakashima and Adam Entous: “FBI Director James B. Comey prepared extensively for his discussions with President Trump, out of concern that the president was unlikely to respect the legal and ethical boundaries governing their respective roles, according to associates of the now-fired FBI chief.” http://wapo.st/2qDtab4 REMEMBER MIKE PENCE? The vice president is nowhere to be found these days. The separation Pence’s team is putting between the VP and the president in this CNN piece is stunning. -- CNN’S ELIZABETH LANDERS: “After a fast and furious news cycle at the White House this week, the last few days may have worn on Vice President Mike Pence. Though Pence will continue to be a ‘loyal soldier’ because he is a ‘relentlessly positive guy,’ he ‘looks tired,’ a senior administration adviser observed on Thursday, outlining the vice president’s schedule and trying to explain his relative absence from the public eye. “While an aide to the vice president says he spent the last few days in speech preparation, it conveniently kept him out of the firing line, missing a regular Senate lunch on Capitol Hill on Tuesday while he worked behind closed doors with President Donald Trump at a bilateral meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “The Pence team knew what they were getting themselves into when they joined the Trump ticket and team almost a year ago. ‘We certainly knew we needed to be prepared for the unconventional,’ but, the source adds, ‘not to this extent.’” http://cnn.it/2qy9uqT … AP story with a similar tone http://apne.ws/2ryeVUX ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: JPMorgan Chase believes in the power of data to expand economic opportunity. That’s why it helped arm Detroit’s leaders with extensive data and expertise to help inform their work and improve efforts underway all across the city. See how they’re using this information to make targeted, effective decisions for Detroit: http://politi.co/2r9j94F ****** THE FIRST FOREIGN TRIP … THE CHARTER with most reporters traveling with Trump left Andrews Air Force Base last night. -- PETER BAKER, who is traveling with the president to Saudi Arabia and Israel: “Tips for Leaders Meeting Trump: Keep It Short and Give Him a Win”: “For foreign leaders trying to figure out the best way to approach an American president unlike any they have known, it is a time of experimentation. Embassies in Washington trade tips and ambassadors send cables to presidents and ministers back home suggesting how to handle a mercurial, strong-willed leader with no real experience on the world stage, a preference for personal diplomacy and a taste for glitz. “After four months of interactions between Mr. Trump and his counterparts, foreign officials and their Washington consultants say certain rules have emerged: Keep it short -- no 30-minute monologue for a 30-second attention span. Do not assume he knows the history of the country or its major points of contention. Compliment him on his Electoral College victory. Contrast him favorably with President Barack Obama. Do not get hung up on whatever was said during the campaign. Stay in regular touch. Do not go in with a shopping list but bring some sort of deal he can call a victory.” http://nyti.ms/2pZWmrF -- AP’S JULIE PACE: “Worldwide effort set to keep Trump happy on 1st trip abroad”: “When President Donald Trump sits down for dinner in Saudi Arabia, caterers have ensured that his favorite meal -- steak with a side of ketchup -- will be offered alongside the traditional local cuisine. At NATO and the Group of 7 summits, foreign delegations have gotten word that the new U.S. president prefers short presentations and lots of visual aids. And at all of Trump’s five stops on his first overseas trip, his team has spent weeks trying to build daily downtime into his otherwise jam-packed schedule.” http://apne.ws/2q01FaG -- “5 things to watch on Trump’s foreign trip,” by Michael Crowley: “1. Will he say ‘radical Islamic terrorism’? … 2. Will he play Middle East peacemaker? … 3. Does he really support NATO? … 4. Can he stick to a script? … 5. Can he change the subject?” http://politi.co/2qA9zuE -- ANNIE KARNI: “Ivanka and Jared get a rabbinical pass to fly Air Force One": “Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner will be flying aboard Air Force One to Saudi Arabia with President Donald Trump on Friday, after receiving a rabbinical dispensation to travel on the Jewish Sabbath, according to a White House official. The two practicing Orthodox Jews typically observe the weekly Shabbat holiday, unplugging from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. But they have made exceptions, on a few occasions, for their jobs. On Inauguration Day, they received the same kind of rabbinical pass to travel by car, an activity that is typically prohibited for observant Jews on the Sabbath. The rules can be broken in life-threatening situations, or if there is a safety concern, according to Jewish law. It was not clear on what grounds the exception was made for Trump's first foreign trip.” http://politi.co/2ry7RYA -- “Stephen Miller Is Writing Trump’s NATO Speech, Too,” by BuzzFeed’s John Hudson: “President Donald Trump has tapped Stephen Miller, a senior adviser at the White House and an outspoken NATO critic, to draft his speech before the military alliance in Brussels next week, people familiar with the plans tell BuzzFeed News. The prospect of a speech penned by the 31-year-old anti-globalist adds a new layer of anxiety for NATO allies uncertain about which version of Donald Trump will show up in Belgium’s capital: The one that believes NATO is ‘no longer obsolete’ or the one that thinks the 28-member military alliance is a relic of the past.” http://bzfd.it/2ryooe7 -- "European leaders fear Trump’s political chaos is undermining U.S. power," by WaPo's Michael Birnbaum in Brussels: "After nearly four months of the Trump administration, many fear that mounting domestic scandals could sap Washington’s ability to respond to challenges ranging from Russia to terrorism to North Korea. "...[O]ne senior European intelligence officer said if his agency ever came into possession of information that was incriminating to Trump or his circle, it would hold back from sharing with the United States for fear the U.S. president would seek revenge." http://wapo.st/2qZcOfZ BEHIND THE SCENES -- “Behind closed doors, Al Franken, Kirsten Gillibrand blast Rosenstein for withholding information,” by WaPo’s Ed O’Keefe: “Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s meeting with senators on Thursday grew especially heated when he faced questions from two frustrated liberal Democrats, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting. Rosenstein came to Capitol Hill to discuss the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey and his decision to hire Robert Mueller as a special counsel to probe Russian meddling in last year’s elections. ... Rosenstein faced especially aggressive questions from Democrats about the scope of the investigation set to be led by Mueller; why Attorney General Jeff Sessions was involved in the firing of Comey; and why Sessions is helping select the new director, according to multiple people.” http://wapo.st/2qDtSFs UH OH ... -- "F.B.I. Once Warned G.O.P. Congressman That Russian Spies Were Recruiting Him," by NYT's Matt Apuzzo, Adam Goldman and Mark Mazzetti: "The congressman, Dana Rohrabacher of California, has been known for years as one of Moscow’s biggest defenders in Washington and as a vocal opponent of American economic sanctions against Russia. He claims to have lost a drunken arm-wrestling match with the current Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, in the 1990s. He is one of President Trump’s staunchest allies on Capitol Hill. ... "In a secure room at the Capitol, an F.B.I. agent told Mr. Rohrabacher in 2012 that Russian spies were trying to recruit him as an 'agent of influence' -- someone the Russian government might be able to use to steer Washington policy-making, former officials said." http://nyti.ms/2q2WrKy NEW POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL -- “Poll: Majority disapprove of Trump sharing intel with Russians,” by Cristiano Lima: “A majority of voters say it was ‘inappropriate’ for President Donald Trump to share highly classified information with Russian officials, according to a new poll released Friday. And a plurality of voters — 41 percent — say Trump’s disclosure means they are ‘not confident at all’ in the president's ability to handle highly classified material. “Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed in a new Morning Consult/POLITICO poll disapproved of the president’s decision to divulge sensitive materials to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak during an Oval Office meeting last week. Only 22 percent of those polled deemed Trump’s actions ‘appropriate,’ while 20 percent remained undecided.” http://politi.co/2pRHHmF ISAAC DOVERE on “Trump’s divisive unity plea”: “President Donald Trump loves division, except when he’s the one under attack. Then he goes all kumba-do-what-I-say. ‘I hate to see anything that divides,’ said the man who ran one of the most divisive campaigns in one of the most divisive elections in history, when he was asked about his view on the appointment of a special counsel to investigate whether his own aides were involved in Russian efforts to swing the 2016 election. “Thursday, under the most intense fire of his fire-filled presidency, Trump tried a defense of saying he had nothing to do with the offense, and that it’s all a ruse by a small number of entrenched politicians who were trying to shake him from his great goal of bringing the country together—’whether it’s Russia or anybody else, my total priority, believe me, is the United States of America,’ he said. It also gave him cover to sneak in a few more punches along the way. Standing in the East Room of the White House at a press conference with the Colombian president, Trump went on to bash Obamacare and anyone who doesn’t believe in his border wall. He also took time to point out the differences between Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the ‘much more successful Trump campaign.’” http://politi.co/2q2ZaDA FIRST PERSON – BENJAMIN WITTES on Lawfareblog.com, “What James Comey Told Me About Donald Trump”: “Comey understood Trump’s people as having neither knowledge of nor respect for the independence of the law enforcement function. And he saw it as an ongoing task on his part to protect the rest of the Bureau from improper contacts and interferences from a group of people he did not regard as honorable. … The first incident he told me about was the infamous ‘hug’ from Trump after the inauguration: The hug took place at a White House meeting to which Trump had invited law enforcement leadership to thank them for their role in the inauguration. “Comey described really not wanting to go to that meeting, for the same reason he later did not want to go to the private dinner with Trump: the FBI director should be always at arm’s length from the President, in his view. … [A]s he told me the story, he tried hard to blend into the background and avoid any one-on-one interaction. He was wearing a blue blazer and noticed that the drapes were blue. So he stood in the back, right in front of the drapes, hoping Trump wouldn’t notice him camouflaged against the wall. … Comey was disgusted. He regarded the episode as a physical attempt to show closeness and warmth in a fashion calculated to compromise him before Democrats who already mistrusted him.” http://bit.ly/2q344Ao CALLING IN THE LAWYERS -- “Trump meets with lawyers at the White House,” by Alex Isenstadt and Josh Dawsey: “President Donald Trump convened his legal team on Thursday to discuss the escalating investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. The huddle, according to four people briefed, took place the day after it was announced that former FBI Director Robert Mueller would serve as the investigation's special counsel. One White House official said the discussion, which came the day before Trump leaves for his first trip abroad since taking office, centered around the nuts and bolts of how the investigation would work - and how the administration will need to handle the inquiry. “Among those in attendance was longtime Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen, who came down from New York to attend. Cohen declined to comment when reached Thursday afternoon. McGahn and his team, one official said, is urging the White House - and Trump - to be cautious in its comments with a special prosecutor involved. McGahn has begun explaining to aides in detail about records retention and potential requests, two people familiar with the conversations say. One objective: to keep Trump from hurting himself any further. Two senior administration officials said they believed Trump’s letter firing Comey was a mistake. White House spokespeople declined to comment. … Mueller’s appointment has put the administration in bunker mode – and there is a growing realization, officials say, that life in the administration will grow more difficult in the months to come. Some aides have begun reaching out to lawyers to see if they need counsel, according to one attorney who has spoken to several of them.” http://politi.co/2ryv64H JARED FOR THE WIN! -- “$110 Billion Weapons Sale to Saudis Has Jared Kushner’s Personal Touch,” by NYT’s Mark Landler, Eric Schmitt and Matt Apuzzo: “On the afternoon of May 1, President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, welcomed a high-level delegation of Saudis to a gilded reception room next door to the White House and delivered a brisk pep talk: ‘Let’s get this done today.’ Mr. Kushner was referring to a $100 billion-plus arms deal that the administration hoped to seal with Saudi Arabia in time to announce it during Mr. Trump’s visit to the kingdom this weekend. The two sides discussed a shopping list that included planes, ships and precision-guided bombs. Then an American official raised the idea of the Saudis’ buying a sophisticated radar system designed to shoot down ballistic missiles. “Sensing that the cost might be a problem ... Mr. Kushner picked up the phone and called Marillyn A. Hewson -- the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, which makes the radar system -- and asked her whether she could cut the price. As his guests watched slack-jawed, Ms. Hewson told him she would look into it, officials said. Mr. Kushner’s personal intervention in the arms sale is further evidence of the Trump White House’s readiness to dispense with custom in favor of informal, hands-on deal making. It also offers a window into how the administration hopes to change America’s position in the Middle East, emphasizing hard power and haggling over traditional diplomacy.” http://nyti.ms/2rl2QWf COMING UP: HILL GOP-WHITE HOUSE CLASH -- “U.S. could get first paid family leave benefit under Trump budget proposal,” by WaPo’s Danielle Paquette and Damian Paletta: “President Trump’s budget proposal next week will include a new benefit for America’s working parents, one Democrats have long championed and Republicans have long opposed: paid family leave. The president’s first detailed budget request on Tuesday will seek funds for the creation of a program to grant mothers and fathers six weeks of paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child, two senior White House budget office officials said.” http://wapo.st/2qYVPuu MNUCHIN’S TAX REFORM PLAY -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is trying to ignore all the noise about Trump and Russia keep his eye on the prize: a major tax reform package. Mnuchin met Thursday with Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, has huddled with Rep. Richie Neal (D-Mass.), ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, and has stepped up outreach to K Street. “There’s an emphasis on engagement at the trade association level and with industry groups,” according to a source familiar with the agency’s strategy. The “listening sessions” tactic is similar to the strategy House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has employed over the years to meet with lawmakers and others to discuss the substance of legislative packages, but not push policy on them.

Several sources close to Flynn and to the administration tell The Daily Beast that Trump has expressed his hopes that a resolution of the FBI’s investigation in Flynn’s favor might allow Flynn to rejoin the White House in some capacity—a scenario some of Trump’s closest advisers in and outside the West Wing have assured him absolutely should not happen. Those sources said Trump didn’t believe Flynn should be under investigation in the first place. ‘Trump feels really, really, really bad about firing him, and he genuinely thinks if the investigation is over Flynn can come back,’ said one White House official.” http://thebea.st/2qZ0fS4 NO LOVE LOST -- “Republicans shove Chaffetz on his way out,” by Rachael Bade: “A handful of top Republicans have a message for outgoing Rep. Jason Chaffetz: It's time to relinquish the House Oversight Committee gavel.Several senior GOP lawmakers are quietly encouraging Chaffetz to step down from his chairmanship soon, even though the Utah Republican doesn’t plan to resign from Congress until June 30. While his retirement announcement Thursday said nothing about his future work, Chaffetz has told lawmakers he’ll be heading to Fox News. “But GOP insiders say Chaffetz has been reluctant to let go of his panel’s leadership before he leaves Congress -- and now he’s thrown himself into the thick of the Russia scandal that’s consuming Washington. It’s made for an uncertain transition at the committee and a sore subject for House Republicans. ‘If the chairman is on his way out... he should step down and allow the Steering Committee to move immediately to appoint a new chairman,’ said Rep. Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican who sits on the Steering panel, which selects committee chairmen. ‘Sooner, not later.’” http://politi.co/2q2Vq55 ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: In order to create more opportunities for Detroiters to secure well-paying jobs, JPMorgan Chase worked to boost the city’s workforce readiness, and today, there are clear signs of progress.

House Majority PAC, the principal Democratic outside group focused on House races, is purchasing $25,000 of TV airtime in the state. The buy is a small one; the candidates and parties have so far spent over $8 million on the Montana race. But it underscores how Democrats are making a late play in the contest. “National Democrats, wary of wasting money on a conservative seat seen as a reach, have largely stayed out of the race, which pits Republican technology executive Greg Gianforte against Democratic musician Rob Quist. Until now, House Majority PAC hadn’t spent anything, while the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent only around $280,000 on commercials. Republican outside groups, meanwhile, have combined to air over $4 million of ads.” http://politi.co/2pZxgtb HOW DETROIT IS BEATING ITS BLIGHT: Land banks are the Swiss Army knives of urban reclamation efforts, wielding an array of powers to make abandoned, tax-foreclosed properties useful again.

Morrell will report to BP’s Group Chief Executive Bob Dudley. “It will be a big change for our family, but one we’re looking forward to,” D.C. native Morrell said of his upcoming move to London. Morrell joined BP in 2011 as the company was facing a series of investigations and lawsuits related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. His hire was widely seen as a signal that the company was taking a more aggressive approach inside the Beltway. Morrell joined the company after serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs and Pentagon press secretary to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Prior to that he covered the White House for ABC News. Mary Streett, a former Clinton administration official and regulatory attorney who has been at BP for the past three years, will take over for Morrell in Washington. As he takes on this new role, Morrell said he is focused broadly on the changes in how people communicate. BP operates in nearly 80 countries around the world -- a vast, and complex canvas for a corporation. “We need to do government relations different in all of those places, but what is universal to them all is there is enormous changes underway in how we communicate and what’s expected from companies in terms of transparency and accountability and we need to keep pace. I think that is the biggest challenge our organization will face.” Excerpts from the interview THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MORE WILLING TO ENGAGE: “There is no question that [the Trump administration’s] commitment to regulatory reform, regulatory relief to some degree, is welcomed by the oil and gas industry. We are not anti-regulation, but we also don’t believe that if you have more sensible regulations that that somehow is anti-environment. We think you can have sensible regulations that protect the environment and still promote investment in America … What we’ve seen from the administration thus far is a willingness to have conversations about how to strike that balance.” COMPANIES SHOULD TALK, EVEN DURING LITIGATION: “A lot of companies may say, ‘This is being adjudicated in court. We’re going to do our speaking in court and refrain from doing so in the media.’ But I think that’s naive and fails to appreciate that they have shareholders and partners and contractors and employees who very much need to know what the company is thinking and doing on these issues. … I am a strong believer that you cannot bunker down and you have to communicate even during intense litigation. You can tell your story without putting yourself in greater legal jeopardy. It can and should be done.” ADVERTISING MATTERS: “People are skeptical about the power of advertising today. It’s become almost as dirty a word as lobbying, but both of them are still alive and well because they work. When you you have messages to get out, stories to tell and the media is focused elsewhere, perhaps justifiably, often times paid advertising is the only way to communicate to your stakeholders. I’ve come to believe it is still a really important tool in your toolbox.” MEDIAWATCH -- “Reporter manhandled by FCC guards because he asked question,” by Julie Schoo on the National Press Club’s website: “Security guards at the Federal Communications Commission headquarters here manhandled a well-regarded reporter at a public hearing [on Thursday] and forced him to leave the premises after he had tried to politely ask questions of FCC commissioners. ... Throughout the FCC meeting, the security guards had shadowed [CQ Roll Call’s John M.] Donnelly as if he were a security threat, he said, even though he continuously displayed his congressional press pass and held a tape recorder and notepad. They even waited for him outside the men’s room at one point. When Donnelly strolled in an unthreatening way toward FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly to pose a question, two guards pinned Donnelly against the wall with the backs of their bodies until O’Rielly had passed. O’Rielly witnessed this and continued walking.” http://bit.ly/2qZ0bSe REMEMBERING ROGER AILES -- MICHAEL WOLFF in The Hollywood Reporter, “Roger and I spoke a week ago, just after the last ouster at Fox -- Bill Shine, his lieutenant who had taken over his job, following by a week the ouster of Bill O’Reilly -- and, invariably, the subject was Fox’s quickly eroding fortunes and the possibilities for a new conservative network. Roger, yet proscribed by the non-compete provisions of his separation agreement, nevertheless had a plan in his head, and was taking calls. ‘I can’t call. But I can’t stop people from calling me,’ he said. As we spoke, Beth texted pictures of their view and of a newly svelte Roger lying lazily in the sun.” http://bit.ly/2pZXews --“Bill O’Reilly: Roger Ailes endured hatred ‘and it killed him.

Bharat Iyer Head - Research | JP Morgan GST a seminal reform; may see retrospective changes in GDP: JP Morgan Reaction to state elections results to be asymmetric: JPMorgan Expect consolidation, hold year-end Nifty target: JPMorgan With the Goods and Services Tax (GST) council on Thursday fixing tax rates on 1211 items, most of which will likely become cheaper as the new rates will be lower than the current effective levies and the Indian equity market continuing its bull run, it is a crucial time for the economy and markets. CNBC-TV spoke to Bharat Iyer, MD & Head-India Equity Research, JPMorgan India and Sajjid Chinoy, Chief India Economist, JPMorgan to know the macro outlook going forward. GST is one of the seminal reforms, and a big medium-term positive said Iyer. The beneficiary sectors could be the consumption space, particularly urban consumption, logistics space on the back of ease of doing business should benefit. According to him, valuations are a bit of a headwind at this point in time because the good news, on an immediate term basis, is already in the price. Chinoy said the first benefit of GST would be growth in production. It is like India signing a free trade agreement (FTA) with itself. Second, would be tax buoyancy although in the near-term there could be disruption especially when an informally economy is pushed to a formal economy. So, one could see a retrospective change in the GDP. Iyer clear believes the retail investor has done a lot better than the sophisticated institutional investors. “Local investor money coming into the market is a structural trend,” he said. Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview. Q: The goods and services tax (GST) rate, it now looks like it is July 1 and it now looks like practically no sector is going to pay more taxes, if any less. How does that change your India call and your sector call? Iyer: First and foremost I think we should appreciate that this is one of the several reforms we have seen in our history. What this means over an 18-24 month period for the macro is going to be very substantive be it the fiscal account, be it the inflation trajectory, be it the kind of liquidity we could have in the system potentially and the kind of government spending that could come in on the back of this. I think all these are very meaningful. I think even near-term I think the government has gone out of its way to ensure that there is no major disruption and which is the reason most product categories, the GST is now closer to what it was and there has been no major disruption. We still see beneficiaries. I think the consumption space should do very well, particularly urban consumption. I think ease of business is going to go up phenomenally and I think the logistics space will be a key beneficiary. So, on balance I think a very big medium-term positive. Q: The markets are celebrating it for ITC with 6 percentage point salute and generally FMCGs, the Colgate’s of the world have all been doing well. Are you upping your view on the FMCG space itself? Iyer: Not completely. We have been running neutral stance on consumer staples, the sector we are discussing and I guess while we understand the medium-term implications in terms of how this could boost demand because there will be lower prices which could be passed on, valuations are a bit of a headwind at this point in time because let us face it, the market has been preparing for this event for nearly a year and so valuations have been pegged at a level where a substantive part of the good news at least on an immediate term basis is priced in. Q: How does this change your macro GDP forecast. Clearly, the tax to GDP ratio is rising this year or next you think? Chinoy: I think it might take a little time. I think the key for the GST is not to jump to what the revenue implications are, it is to appreciate the fact that India finally has a common market. I think the first round effect will be a big increase in productivity growth in the GDP numbers. For me that is the exciting part that this is tantamount to India signing a free trade agreement with itself. So, think about the first round being productivity growth. The second round will be tax buoyancy. Now in the near term, there might be some disruptions, we should not panic, we should brace for that. Whenever you aggressively push the informal economy to the formal economy, you could have some disruption to supply chains, you could have uncertainty about inventory holdings for example but that is a one, two quarter phenomena. I think what is very impressive is this grand fiscal federal experiment has worked and more importantly, there is a concerted effort to make sure that there won’t be inflationary pressures on the back of this. With what we have heard so far, 80 percent of goods so far are going to be 18 percent or below. So, I think in the near-term, let us hope that there is no price effect, you get big productivity increases and let us give the economy a couple of years for the dynamism to flow through and then the tax buoyancy to pickup. Let us not be in a rush to try and document how much the tax GDP has gone up. Q: That is perhaps the FY19 story, but even in FY18 are you giving the GDP some more points than you previously had not just because GST is successful and here, but also because the WPI is lower than we thought historically and so must be even prospectively and IIP is not as bad as we thought. So, what was your GDP number and are you likely to, are you on the front foot to change it higher? Chinoy: I think in May we will see retrospective higher revisions both on account of the IIP and the WPI but for me that is water under the bridge, those are statistical changes. The key for growth this year is more than statistical. It is the fact that exports have picked up sharply. So upward revisions to GDP growth in my view over the next 12 months will come from two sources. One is if you get this global growth recovery sustaining for a few quarters, India’s new exports, engineering goods, pharmaceuticals are very cyclical. You have seen in the last three to four months, when there is any pickup in global growth, they respond very sharply. If that process continues for a couple of quarters, that is the trigger for an upwards revision along with the fact that at the margin, the worries about the monsoon have become a little bit less. So those two for me are the more fundamental drivers of any growth uptick this year. Q: 7.4 percent, what are your working with? Chinoy: We are still more muted. We actually think we might get a number around 7-7.2 percent. I think last year will end closer to 7 percent for FY17, for FY18 I think we will still be in that range. There are some drags as well related to investment. Remember last year you had a great monsoon on the back of two droughts which meant agriculture grew at 5 percent. This year you will get a good monsoon on the back of a good monsoon which means agriculture is at 2 percent. So, there will be some offsetting drags. Q: Your big India call, I mean what seems to be standing out now and this is almost an old story is that we don’t care for foreign institutional investors (FII) money. The tidal wave of domestic investments and physical investment is getting into financial is almost inexorable now, never ending. How does that change the India call, what would be – how does it change your Sensex perception for 12 months down the line or Nifty perception? Iyer: I think we have to give credit to the local investor. I think the local investor has been extremely sharp. When inflation was a big concern, we saw all the money going into real assets. The minute inflation stopped being such a concern, the money came back into financial assets. Again within financial assets we have seen a very good shift from debt towards equity as there were indications that the monetary easing cycle was done with. So, first I think full marks to the retail investor; I think he has done a lot better than most of the sophisticated institutional investors.In terms of the point you raised, the local investor money coming in, I think this is a structural trend. What this really implies is that sell-offs are going to be more shallow. They will not be as deep as they used to be when we were completely dependent on foreign money. However, that said, can we write off the foreign money completely, does it mean that we don’t need the foreign money? No way. tags #Economy #JP Morgan #MARKET OUTLOOK Related news Business GST could be a game changer for economy & markets; put 60% of portfolio in equities: IIFL May 20, 2017 11:43 AM Business EXCLUSIVE: Full list of GST rates for services; IPL in 28% slab, property at 12% May 19, 2017 11:54 PM Business Steel PSUs not holy cows, must compete with pvt players: Min May 19, 2017 11:16 PM Business No impact of GST on renewables, no need for lower taxes: Goyal May 19, 2017 11:08 PM Business All households to have access to electricity by May 2018: Piyush Goyal May 19, 2017 10:51 PM Business Fixing corporates necessary along with banks for recovery: Viral Acharya May 19, 2017 10:19 PM Business Three years of Modi Government: Report card of performance on job creation front May 19, 2017 09:51 PM Business GST: Rate shocker for insurance sector, premiums may go up 3% May 19, 2017 07:17 PM Business GST: No scope for rethinking July 1 deadline, says Arun Jaitley May 19, 2017 07:08 PM News Most Popular Top News Fund managers increased their holding in these 20 blue-chip companies in April Top 10 stocks which rose up to 100% during Nifty50 journey from 9000-9500 Take Notice!

(WTNH) — The Connecticut Department of Labor has announced that they will be replacing the debit cards with new ones for people using them for unemployment insurance benefits. The Labor Department says they have notified individuals opting to receive their benefits using the debit cards currently issued by Chase Bank that a new KeyBank card will be replacing it. This transition is set to begin at the end of May. The decision is being made because JP Morgan Chase is discontinuing its prepaid card program. Once the red-colored Key2Benefits debit card has been issued to a claimant, any unemployment benefits an individual is entitled to will be placed on the new card. Card holders though should have received a letter to all claimants stating that they should continue to use the Chase debit card until there is no balance left. Any funds remaining on the Chase debit card cannot be transferred to the new KeyBank card. While debit card holders will not see any changes in how benefits are deposited to the card, several new features include free AM balance inquiries at specified banks, free mailed statements, and unlimited free calls to KeyBank’s customer service center. “Although the majority of our customers filing for benefits prefer direct deposit to their savings or checking account, debit cards issued through our bank vendor are always an option,” said State Labor Commissioner Scott D. Jackson. “However, claimants wanting to switch to direct deposit can do this at any time by visiting our secure website at Claimants making the switch to direct deposit must select the green button/message box on the website and after logging in can access the payment method option and provide the necessary banking information. Those seeking additional information about the KeyBank debit card can access a “Frequently Asked Questions” site at Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

While Trump has taken heat from Muslims in the U.S. for his anti-terrorism travel ban and his overtures to Israel, here in the Gulf, the conservative Arab sheikdoms are welcoming the new administration as a return to transactional diplomacy in the Middle East. The White House they see now is presided over by a strong leader – a model Gulf monarchs recognize from their own governing styles – and if Trump surrounds himself with business-friendly family members high in his administration, well, so do they. Key to this weekend's meetings with Trump and his team, as Arab leaders see it, will be identifying opportunities to do business and cut diplomacy deals. Traveling with the Trump team will be dozens of U.S. business leaders, including the heads of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Dow Chemical and General Electric. Nearly 40 heads of state from across the Islamic world, joined by Arab business leaders, are also expected to gather to see what Trump has to offer. Saudi Aramco, the national oil giant that is preparing to open itself to outside investment for the first time next year, will be talking deals with U.S. oil services companies. "Saudi Arabia is transforming. The government is getting into the business mode on a fast track and this is where Trump comes from. He wants to make a lot of deals. Saudi Arabian leaders understand this language and they're excited," said Ahmed Alibrahim, a Saudi businessman who lobbies his government on behalf of U.S. companies. The Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, will host Trump at a summit on Sunday. "The GCC countries are not only excited about Trump, but the people he's chosen to have around him," said Alibrahim, who dismissed former President Barack Obama as "the worst president ever," unwilling to confront Iran and its Shiite Muslim proxies in Syria and neighboring Yemen, whom the Sunni leaders of the Gulf see as rivals. "We suffered for the past eight years a weak America," Alibrahim said. Some of Trump's advisers had previous connections to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis led U.S. Central Command, which includes the Middle East. ExxonMobil under Tillerson maintained deep ties with Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter. Saudis, at least at the official level, appear eager to move past the Obama administration's focus on human rights, including its frequent talk of promoting the standing of women in a kingdom where their ability to vote, run for office, own property, travel and even drive is less than that of men. Hoda Helassi, one of 30 women appointed to the Saudi monarchy's 150-member consultative council, said Obama failed to take into account how much progress Saudi women have made. "We have fought for our modern rights and we are getting them," said Helassi, who planned to participate in a panel discussion and attend meetings with Ivanka Trump this weekend. "There is an air of positiveness, an atmosphere of hope with this visit and I hope it pans out," Helassi said. "There are more areas of common ground than there were before. It's this administration understanding the necessity to change at the pace of Saudi society. A lot of what happened in the past was not understanding why or where we are." Gulf leaders see Trump as a businessman first, a president who has pursued a transactional foreign policy that fits with their notion of how deals get done. That includes what's shaping up to be a $100 billion U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia and a $40 billion Saudi investment in Trump's domestic infrastructure plan. Trump's secretary of state, former ExxonMobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, signaled in March that the administration would lift the Obama-era restrictions on a $2.8 billion sale of U.S. fighter jets and other arms to Bahrain, imposed over human rights concerns. "What Trump is doing is resetting that relationship." said Faisal Abbas, editor of the Jidda-based Arab News. Trump will have to tread lightly, given his recent proposed travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and anti-Muslim rhetoric, which provoked outcry in the Middle East. But the president's policies on Iran and Syria, welcomed by Gulf Arabs, and the many business deals in the offing, are likely to mute any potential criticism here in the Gulf. His expected speech to Arab leaders about Islam on Sunday, seen by some as a potential diplomatic minefield, will likely register as little more than "background noise," said Fawaz A. Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. The president successfully hosted several Arab leaders earlier this year, including Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, a former general criticized for jailing dissidents and other rights violations. "Trump is a welcome change from Barack Obama because he does not remind them, does not pressure them, about American values and ideas about human rights and democracy. This president is a hardcore realist: He just doesn't care. This goes well with many leaders in this part of the world," Gerges said. Trump has already impressed Gulf Arab leaders by escalating the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and supporting the Saudi fight against Houthi rebels in Yemen. "What the Trump team is trying to do is send a message near and far that Trump's doctrine 'America First' does not necessarily contradict American leadership overseas, particularly in the Middle East," Gerges said. "They're trying to reassure America's allies that America has their back." Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said Trump's decision to make his first state visit to the Gulf demonstrates just that. "What's wrong with an American president saying 'America First'?" Jubeir said during a briefing at the foreign ministry ahead of Trump's arrival. "We are the largest purchaser of American defense equipment. Millions of American jobs depend on the relationship with Saudi Arabia. American lives depend on the security cooperation between the kingdom and the United States." Arab officials here see Trump as "a practical, pragmatic businessman" and a trustworthy, cosmopolitan "man of the world" Jubeir said. "We are very supportive of the policies the Trump administration is pursuing," he added. "We share a very, very large amount of intelligence with the United States and vice versa. We will not have any hesitation about continuing to do so."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dow 30 Stock Roundup: Home Depot, Cisco, Wal-Mart Beat on Earnings Shutterstock photo The Dow traversed another tenuous week, marked by key earnings results and political developments which heightened investor concerns. Gains in energy and technology stocks helped the index gain on Monday. However, the Dow inched lower on Tuesday following news that President Trump had shared sensitive information with Russian officials. The index suffered grievous losses on Wednesday following reports of Trump’s interference into the FBI probe regarding Mike Flynn’s involvement with Russian sources. Encouraging earnings from a key component helped the index end with gains on Thursday. Last Week’s Performance The Dow lost 0.1% last Friday, dragged down by declines in bank and retail stocks. Weaker than expected monthly inflation data raised concerns about the possibility of a future rate hike, which eventually affected banks. CPI increased by 0.2% while core CPI gained 0.1%, reversing a 0.1% decline in the previous month. Consumer prices rose unadjusted 2.2% over last year, a decline from a 2.4% increase in March. The blue-chip index lost 0.5% over last week. Last Tuesday, Trump discharged Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), James Comey from office. Comey was accused of injudiciously commenting that „hundreds and thousands” of Clinton’s emails were forwarded by Clinton aide Huma Abedin to former Rep. Anthony Weiner’s personal computer. Investors remained worried that such a dismissal could delay implementation of Trump administration’s pro-growth agenda. The Dow This Week The index advanced 0.4% on Monday, boosted by gains in energy and technology stocks. Energy shares moved north due to an uptick in oil prices after energy ministers from Saudi Arabia and Russia spoke about the need for extending output cuts. The energy ministers discussed the possibility of extending oil production cuts to the end of March next year in an attempt to stabilize the global crude market and reduce global oil inventories to their five-year average level. Meanwhile, Software security stocks moved higher following a cyber-attack on Friday that affected at least 200,000 computers across the world, as per EU law enforcement agency Europol estimates. Cybersecurity stocks gained on expectations that attacks were likely to continue into the current week. The index declined by 2.19 points on Tuesday amid heightened political uncertainty in the U.S following news that President Trump had shared sensitive information with Russian officials. Energy shares declined following a report released by International Energy Agency (IEA). Meanwhile, investors kept a close watch on the housing starts and the industrial production data released on Tuesday. While housing starts for April declined by 2.6%, industrial production recorded a growth of 1% in April, marking its largest increase since February 2014. The Dow lost 1.8% on Wednesday following reports of Trump’s interference into the FBI probe regarding Mike Flynn’s involvement with Russian sources. This development raised concerns regarding the fate of Trump’s pro-growth agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation policies. The Dow declined below its 50-day moving average for first time since April. Stocks finished in the green on Thursday, boosted by gains in technology shares and upbeat jobless claims data. Meanwhile, the Dow increased 0.3%, aided by gains made by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT which moved northward following an encouraging earnings report. However, the controversy relating to investigation into former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn’s involvement with Russian sources kept investors cautious. Components Moving the Index Wal-Mart ‚s first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of $1.00 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents by 4.2% and increased 2.0% from the year-ago earnings of 98 cents on higher comps. Earnings reached the top end of the guided range of 90 cents to $1.00 per share. Total revenue came in at $117.5 billion (including membership and other income). The figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.6 billion by 0.07% but increased 1.4% year over year. Currency impacted sales by approximately $1.21 billion. The decline in the International business was more than offset by growth in sales at Wal-Mart U.S and Sam’s Club divisions. Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated Wal-Mart expects U.S. comp sales growth in the range of 1.5−2.0% for the 13-week period ending Jul 28. Sam’s Club comp sales, without the impact of fuel sales, are expected to increase 1-1.5%. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.00-$1.08 per share. (Read: Wal-Mart Tops Q1 Earnings on Higher Comps & Traffic ) Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 54 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings increased 5.3% on a year-over-year basis to 60 cents, which was slightly better than management’s guided range of 57-59 cents. The growth reflected benefits from operational efficiencies that boost operating margin in the quarter. Revenues declined 0.5% year over year to $11.94 billion but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.89 billion. Management had anticipated revenues to decline in the range of 2% or remain flat on a year-over-year basis. However, Cisco’s fourth-quarter outlook was disappointing. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are expected to decline in the range of 6-4% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be in the range 60-62 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 58 cents on revenue estimates of $12.52 billion. (Read: Cisco Q3 Earnings Beat, Shares Fall on Dim View ) The Home Depot Inc. HD posted fiscal first-quarter earnings of $1.67 per share, which escalated 16% from $1.44 in the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Net sales advanced 4.9% to $23,887 million from $22,762 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23,745 million. The company’s overall comparable-store sales (comps) increased 5.5%, while comps in the U.S. grew 6%. Following the robust fiscal first quarter performance, Home Depot raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 while it retained the sales view. The company projects both sales and comps to grow about 4.6% in fiscal 2017. The company now expects diluted earnings per share to increase nearly 11% to $7.15, including share repurchases. Previously, the company had anticipated earnings per share growth of 10.5% to $7.13. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM recently announced its intention to enter the retail fuel market of Mexico. To this end, the company is likely to spend almost $300 million over the next 10 years. The integrated energy company is anticipated to launch its first fuel service station in central Mexico, under the brand name ‚Mobil,’ in the second half of 2017. With this development, motorists in the country will now be able to avail Zacks Rank #3-rated Exxon Mobil’s high-grade Synergy gasoline and diesel fuels. The event signifies the opening of Mexico’s closed retail sales market after Pemex lost its monopoly following the reforms in 2013.

This move confirms confidence in the Irish capital at a time when various cities of the European Union are competing to convince financial institutions with large bases in the U.K. to choose them over others to carry out activities previously performed in London. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3. The new building, located in the Capital Dock development in Dublin, covers 130,000 square foot and its construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. The building will be able to accommodate around 1,000 staff members, which is double the number of people already employed by JPMorgan in Dublin.

JNJ discussed its future plans and showcased a strong pipeline of transformational medicines at a meeting held on May 17 with industry analysts. Johnson & Johnson intends to seek approval for 10 new products between 2017 and 2021. The company said that each of these products have blockbuster potential. Also, the company is targeting more than 50 line extensions of existing and new drugs.

This week was no different, dogged by controversies over Russia’s involvement with the Trump presidential campaign. Despite such a trend, investors will closely watch FOMC minutes as well home sales data scheduled for release next week. These reports are also likely to have a major impact on the fortunes of stocks in the week ahead.

Chart analyst Jason Hunter noted that if yields fall, sectors like financials could be threatened, adding the best-performing groups of the year "will top out at some point, and leave the broader S&P 500 Index vulnerable to a more material correction later this year." Fred Imbert | @foimbert 10 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Closing Bell Exchange: Tech mania, strongest inflows in 15 years    12 Hours Ago | 06:57 U.S. Treasury yields are hovering near one-month lows and a significant move lower may trigger a correction in equities, analysts at JPMorgan said. Technical analyst Jason Hunter said in a note Thursday "the technical case for a continued bear market in Treasuries this year has weakened further" given the 10-year note yield's recent fall, adding that some of the equity plays associated with the "U.S. reflation trade" have been largely correlated with Treasury yields. The reflation trade centers around stocks that benefit from higher inflation and yields, including financials. Investors and traders have been betting that inflation will rise under Donald Trump's presidency as he moves to enact an agenda that includes lower corporate taxes and infrastructure spending. The Financials Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLF), which tracks the S&P financials sector, has been a stalwart since Trump's victory, rising more than 17 percent since Nov. 8. XLF since US election Source: FactSet But the reflation trade has been under siege lately because of the decline in rates. The benchmark 10-year note yield has fallen from about 2.41 percent to 2.24 percent since May 10 and hit a one-month low on Wednesday. Financials, meanwhile, suffered their worst day since June 24 earlier this week on the back of the U.S. stock market's worst session of 2017. Stocks fell sharply on Wednesday on news that former FBI Director James Comey put together a memo outlining a conversation in which Trump asked him to halt an investigation into Michael Flynn's ties with Russian officials. Flynn is Trump's former national security adviser. Hunter noted that if yields fall, sectors like financials could be threatened, adding the best-performing groups of the year, technology and consumer discretionary, "will top out at some point, and leave the broader S&P 500 Index vulnerable to a more material correction later this year." "We will adopt a much more defensive bias if the market internals do not improve in the weeks ahead, the leadership groups start to form bearish momentum divergence patterns, and the S&P 500 Index carves out a multi-week/multi-month distribution pattern within the 2,392-2,486 target zone this summer."

A hiring manager at a shipping company would never cross paths with a media company headhunter. But over the last decade, as technology has transformed every company and every competitive dynamic, those lanes are suddenly merging. While the ability to lead, collaborate and communicate are still critical to landing a job, it’s having experience in the latest technical skills that will get hiring managers at the top companies clamoring for your attention. That’s what I heard after interviewing human resources leaders at 25 of the 50 LinkedIn Top Companies in the U.S. These HR heavyweights — spanning industries from technology and finance, from management consulting and media — all want the same thing: people with experience in machine learning, cybersecurity, data analytics and cloud technology. And the most in-demand roles: engineers and data scientists with these skills. “Bleeding-edge technology skills are relatively scarce and highly sought after," said Karla Samdahl, Cisco’s global head of executive talent acquisition. As new technologies like predictive analytics and artificial intelligence take hold, companies are having to seek out talent that enables them to keep up and stay ahead. “We are looking for software engineers and data scientists — change agents who want to tackle the transformation of digital commerce enabling payment via taps, dips or swipes on smartphones, tablets and even cars and appliances," said Visa’s Executive Vice President of HR Michael Ross. Even roles outside of R&D require a level of tech-fluency and knowledge. At JPMorgan Chase & Co. for example, bankers need to know more than just numbers. "As our customers in the consumer bank evolve, and as simple transactions continue to migrate to digital, we are looking for more tech savvy, complex issue resolution and relationship-oriented bankers,” said the company’s HR head, John L. Donnelly. The same is true at Deloitte, where the “3 Ds: Data, Digital and Disruption,” are not only an internal saying, but a description of the skills that are new to the marketplace and difficult to find for the company. “Those 3 Ds are a great North Star for us as we think about the workforce of the future,” said Heidi Soltis-Berner, a recruiting leader at the firm. She also added that those skills are new to the marketplace and difficult to find. Staffing for these future products and ideas is incredibly difficult, says hiring leaders like Verizon Senior Vice President and Chief Talent and Diversity Officer Magda Yrizarry. You’re looking for people who have skills that might be hard to define — or you need to get people who will invent those skills themselves. That’s especially true at Verizon, which is pushing into 5G technology. To find that talent, Yrizarry says, “You hire people who have in the past been able to bend the curve on technology. They may not have bent the curve on 5G for example, but they were there to create earlier iterations of technologies like IoT or cybersecurity. So you have a confidence that they are not beholden to the past, that they can create the future.” Competition for these new skills and related roles is fierce. At Square, engineers with machine learning and data science experience, as well as front-end developers, are in high demand. “I think a lot of tech companies are looking for similar types of folks,” said Square’s Head of Talent Acquisition Taylor Cascino. “So we find ourselves competing with other [technology] firms a lot of the time." For small tech companies like Square, attracting talent means competing with industry behemoths. To stand out, especially on the engineering side, Cascino says the company’s mission to help small businesses thrive and succeed, helps. “It’s a little bit different than adjusting pixels on a social networking site,” he said. “Not to say that that’s not valuable, it’s just less tangible.” At Workday, the company is still working to make its brand an employer of choice in the technology space. “It’s different if you’re a Google or a Facebook where people immediately understand that this is a great place for technologists to be,” said Workday’s Chief People Officer Ashley Goldsmith. “But I think we’re still developing our employer brand as a place where technologists would want to grow their career.” LinkedIn’s latest Workforce Report, which tracks employment trends in the U.S., found that April had the strongest month for hiring since June 2015. However, adding to the difficulty that some companies face in hiring highly-skilled workers is a tightening labor market, where there are more open jobs than workers to fill them. The fast pace of technology also makes it hard for academic institutions to keep up. “It’s very difficult for a professor to build a curriculum or course that addresses the needs of tech in real time,” said Ardine Williams, Amazon Web Services’ vice president of global talent acquisition. Of all the employees at the top 50 U.S. companies on the list, nearly half hold bachelor degrees, 18 percent have a master's degree and 4 percent have a doctorate, according to LinkedIn Economic Graph data. Twenty-three percent of employees at these companies don't list a degree on their LinkedIn profile. For some HR leaders and their companies, it’s not necessarily the skills that are hard to find, it’s recruiting diverse talent — including people of color and women — with those skills. Though a few cited a pipeline problem, others acknowledged that it’s about meeting talent where they are. "One area [in the hiring process] that has changed is our increased focus on diversity and inclusion, which has greatly influenced our hiring strategy,” said Visa’s Ross. “You’ve got to go where the talent is.” For Visa, this has meant targeted recruiting efforts at events like the annual National Society of Black Engineers convention. An analysis of skills of current employees at the 50 LinkedIn Top Companies in the U.S. reinforced what I heard from HR leaders. Not only are technical skills the fastest-growing among current employees spanning industries and companies on the list, but they are also the most sought after by recruiters who are using Inmails on LinkedIn to reach prospective hires. These skills include Web programming, followed by software engineering management and Java development. Cloud computing along with statistical analysis and data mining also ranked highly among the skills recruiters are after. Among the most sought-after technical skills within the engineering function were Web programming, followed by Java development and C/C++ coding languages. Cloud computing and machine learning also showed up near the top. Outside of technical skills, social media marketing has been growing significantly among the top 50 companies across all industries and functions, with a 61 percent year-over-year growth rate. Statistical analysis and data mining in the technology and financial services industries had a 25 percent growth rate across all functions. Check out the graphic below for the most sought-after skills by industry, across functions for the top 50 companies:© LinkedIn Provided by LinkedIn Besides robust hiring in the tech and innovation areas of the businesses, many top companies said they’re also hiring heavily in sales. “Sales and engineering are the two most populated pieces of our company,” said Dell’s HR chief Steve Price. “Those are two areas where we’re always on sharp patrol. We’re predators.” While hard skills and technical know-how are important, soft skills — or competencies as some HR leaders like to call them — still matter. “What’s most in demand and the hardest to get is the combination,” said Comcast Cable’s EVP of HR Bill Strahan. “It’s getting, for example, someone who is highly technical, but then has that and the leadership skills or to have that and the business strategy skills.” When asked what’s needed to stay competitive in today’s labor market and excel in the future workplace, HR leaders largely cited the ability to learn as most important. "[You] need to display a voracious appetite to learn,” said BlackRock’s Global Head of HR Jeff Smith. “No matter what stage you’re in in your career, you should never give up the mindset of a student.”  Amazon’s Williams agreed: “The pace of technology continues to accelerate and it doesn’t show any sign of slowing. You must have an insatiable curiosity about what’s changing and how, and stay current. Otherwise, you're going to be left behind." Sponsored: Want more? Check out these resources: Search for jobs.

However, Wall Street's major indexes were on track for their worst weekly declines since mid-April following reports that Trump had tried to interfere in a federal investigation. Investors were concerned that the uncertainty in Washington could hinder Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus, a bet on which Wall Street has rallied to record highs. Strong quarterly earnings from companies, including Autodesk and Deere & Co, boosted the market. Autodesk was among the biggest percentage gainers on the S&P and the Nasdaq after the software maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue. Deere hit an all-time high of $122.24 after the farm and construction equipment maker reported a quarterly profit that beat expectations. The news lifted Caterpillar's shares by 2 percent, making it the top stock on the Dow. "We think the Trump trade and the reflation trade have unwound almost entirely post election, and the market is relying on recovery in earnings and strong fundamentals," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Of the 452 S&P 500 companies that have released results so far, about 75 percent have topped earnings expectations. In a typical quarter, about 64 percent beat estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "You (also) didn't have a lot of news out of Washington, which is helping calm some of the anxiety," Jones said. At 11:09 a.m. ET (1509 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 122.39 points, or 0.59 percent, at 20,785.41, the S&P 500 was up 17.5 points, or 0.74 percent, at 2,383.22 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 43.57 points, or 0.72 percent, at 6,098.70. All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with industrials, materials and energy gaining more than 1 percent. Oil rose more than 2 percent, helping energy shares, amid talks of an extension to the supply limit deal among OPEC members. Wal-Mart was up 1.7 percent at $78.86 after BMO upgraded the big-box retailer's stock to "market perform" from "underperform" following higher-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,194 to 596. On the Nasdaq, 1,776 issues rose and 890 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 17 new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 57 new highs and 39 new lows.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Mark Pocan By Mark Pocan May 19 at 3:07 PM President Trump shakes hands with Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in March in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press) Mark Pocan, a Democrat, has represented Wisconsin’s 2nd Congressional District in the House since 2013. He sits on the House Appropriations Committee and is first vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Donald Trump ran for president as the world’s greatest dealmaker. His first international destination as president, Saudi Arabia, is where he reportedly registered eight companies during his campaign. Yet by announcing one of the largest arms-sales deals in U.S. history during this visit, Trump is revealing to the world a dark side to his boasts of creating jobs: He may be helping to create a famine as well. Yes, as Saudi Arabia is reportedly “pulling out all the stops” to “dazzle and impress” the president — not to mention the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Dow Chemical and Blackstone who have followed Trump to the country — the Saudi kingdom is using U.S.-made planes and bombs to enforce a blockade of food and aid on its neighbor, Yemen, the poorest country in the region. Last month, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres implored the world to ensure “the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian aid by air, sea and land” into the country to alleviate the suffering of 17 million food-insecure Yemenis caught in “the world’s largest hunger crisis,” which is “man-made” and is starving and crippling “an entire generation.” Yet Guterres’s plea appears to be falling on deaf ears in Saudi Arabia. As my Senate colleague Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) maintained this week, “the Saudis are deliberately trying to create a famine inside Yemen in order to essentially starve the Yemenis to the negotiating table” — and “the United States is participating.” In April, a bipartisan group of 54 of my House colleagues and I expressed deep concern that factions within the Trump administration are pushing for even deeper U.S. military involvement and escalation in this destructive Saudi-led war, which has directly killed thousands of civilians in indiscriminate airstrikes over the past two years. The Saudis’ seemingly deliberate bombing of roads, bridges, ports and cranes contributes to the death of a Yemeni child every 10 minutes, every day, according to the U.N. If our dealmaker in chief ever had leverage in a negotiation, it would be this one. With a hundred billion dollars’ worth of U.S. planes, ships and precision-guided munitions on the line, Trump could simply demand that the Saudis end the blockade, refrain from bombing Yemen’s major port and enter into a U.N.-brokered political settlement in exchange for the U.S.-made weapons. But he doesn’t have to listen to a progressive Democrat like me — these are precisely the policies that Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) has been calling for. Even Trump’s own appointee to the World Food Program, former South Carolina governor David Beasley (R), argued that in light of the president’s visit, “it’s very, very timely that the United States apply all the pressure it can with regard to all parties involved, including Saudi Arabia.” Trump has an opportunity to save millions of innocent lives — this may be the most consequential deal he has ever negotiated — and there’s every reason to worry that he’ll botch it by handing away billions of dollars in arms without extracting any concessions from the Saudis. That’s why the Constitution has granted Congress both the power of the purse and authority over war. Democrats and Republicans are increasingly alarmed that in Yemen, the Saudis are using U.S. planes to drop U.S. bombs, with U.S. pilots refueling them in midair and providing them with targeting assistance. This has become a U.S. war with no end in sight, a war that has never been publicly debated or congressionally authorized and that has nothing to do with fighting al-Qaeda — on the contrary, this war is strengthening al-Qaeda. As a small-business owner myself, I know that no savvy entrepreneur can afford to bask in a photo op before a deal is final. And make no mistake: Congress has not yet approved this weapons sale. If Trump’s deal with the Saudis ignores the suffering of millions of Yemenis on the brink of starvation, I can assure you that members of Congress will act swiftly, using every tool at our disposal — from blocking weapons shipments to forcing a debate and vote on U.S. military involvement in Yemen — to end this incomprehensible tragedy. opinions global-opinions global-opinions Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Oh, and you’ve probably never heard of it. Steve James (Hoop Dreams; Life Itself) digs in with his latest documentary Abacus: Small Enough to Jail (as in the inverse of “too big to fail”), which follows the embattled Abacus Federal Savings Bank, a Chinatown-based company that primarily serves the local immigrant community—until it serves as a possible political scapegoat for a New York County district attorney desperate to look tough on banks. The only problem? Abacus appears to be that exceedingly rare thing: a bank that isn’t the bad guy. Abacus was founded in 1984 by Thomas Sung, a lawyer and real estate developer who had come to America from China in his teens, after he had trouble securing a mortgage. “They were happy to take his deposits, but not to give him credit,” one of his daughters tells James. Abacus grew to six branches in three states, and some 150 employees. (Not exactly JPMorgan Chase & Co., but in a community that caters to immigrants, including undocumented ones, who often mistrust mainstream banks and operate largely in cash, it was a feat of some consequence.) Eventually, Sung’s daughters came to work with him, where, as a unit, they comprised something like the picture-perfect immigrant story, corner offices and all. Enter a poorly timed felonious employee (swiftly terminated by the Sungs, who James carefully details taking the correct measures to notify their financial regulators), a district attorney’s office eager to look tough, and suddenly a community bank is halfway between a symbol of the resistance and a signifier of no less than the malfeasance and avarice of the entire international banking system. In 2012, the Manhattan district attorney’s office indicted the bank and, eventually, 19 of its former employees, branding Abacus “a criminal conspiracy fueled by greed.” The Sung family suddenly plunged into a nightmarish court battle that consumed five years and $10 million. Never mind the fact that, as The New York Times reported during the trial, of the 3,104 loans from the bank that Fannie Mae acquired from Abacus in 2005 through 2009, only nine defaulted. Or that even after the 2008 disaster, the bank’s lending held up: In 2009, just 16 of 4,390 (or one-third of 1 percent) of Abacus mortgages were more than 90 days late. (The average rate of seriously delinquent prime loans in late 2009 was 6.26 percent.) If this all sounds boring—there are no bubble bath–dipped Margot Robbies to explain mortgage bonds to you here—I promise, it isn’t. As to what part cultural bias played in Abacus’s downfall (at least one talking head uttered, “These people don’t vote,” and there were some seriously bad optics courtesy of a makeshift chain gang) the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., called accusations “entirely misplaced and entirely wrong” in his on-screen interview. It is difficult to separate Abacus from the time in which it arrives. The film has the peculiar, particular benefit of premiering during great political and cultural turmoil, perhaps most for immigrant communities. It is at its strongest when it is essentially an underdog story: a family drawing together to fight back against the sweeping power of the United States government, because, as Sung repeatedly expresses to the camera, it’s the right thing to do. As Mr. Sung’s scene-stealing wife, Hwei Lin Sung, says in the film, “Tom is not easy to be pushed around, and my girls, they are tough, smart, capable women.” In the fraught year of 2017, that’s an unsurprisingly powerful message. The filmmakers have asked that the end of the film (though it’s in the public record) be kept shrouded, but suffice it to say that it does not arrive without some emotion. This is especially true when Abacus’s fate is compared with, as James does, all of the high-flying operators who are not indirectly responsible for the disaffection and greed that led to our current political predicament, and who escaped the market meltdown of 2008 unscathed—with multi-billion-dollar tax bailouts to boot. At one point, Don Lee, a community activist, tells James’s camera that Mr. Sung makes him believe in the survival of some shred of the American dream, an ideation that the film indicts and endorses in equal measure. In a country where you could do everything right and still be hauled off in handcuffs, what happens when we wake up? Consider what Mr. Sung did when reports of an embezzling Abacus employee provoked a run on the bank in 2003? He emulated one of his heroes, It’s a Wonderful Life’s George Bailey, and met the lines of worried customers face-to-face in the street to assuage their fears, to shake their hands. “Feel my warm hand,” he recalls to James’s camera. “I’m here.” Who from the tony reaches of Wall Street can you imagine doing the same?

They currently have $94.00 price objective on the medical technology company’s stock. According to Zacks, “Inogen reported a solid first quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. Over the last three months, the company outperformed the broader industry in terms of price. However, rental revenue headwinds are a concern, thanks to private insurance rate reductions, higher provisions for rental revenue adjustments and lower net patient additions. Inogen generates a significant portion of its revenues from the International market. Volatility in foreign exchange rate is expected to mar the company’s top line in the coming quarters. Furthermore, the stock looks a bit overvalued at the moment when compared to the market at large. However, Inogen has provided a positive guidance for full-year 2017. The company’s unique direct-to-customer business model, an innovative product line and growing patient base are key catalysts in our view.” INGN has been the subject of several other research reports. Stifel Nicolaus lifted their price objective on Inogen to $65.00 in a research note on Wednesday, March 1st. Needham & Company LLC began coverage on Inogen in a research note on Thursday, January 19th. They issued a strong-buy rating for the company.

Auto1 raised 360 million euros through a mixture of debt and equity financing in a round that closed earlier this year. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., BNP Paribas SA and BHF-Bank AG were lending banks. The company valuation has more than doubled since it reached about $1 billion in a funding round in 2015. Auto1 bills itself as an online stock exchange for used cars, buying vehicles from individuals and selling them on to dealerships. The company is based in Berlin, which has become an incubator for technology startups with Zalando S E, Delivery Hero and HelloFresh among firms based in the city. In 2016, Auto1 reported revenue of 1.5 billion euros, compared with 750 million euros the previous year. The valuation makes it big enough to list, though co-Chief Executive Officer Christian Bertermann said the company is well funded, and there are no current plans for an initial public offering. “We continue to target very high growth rates and seek to achieve a 10 percent market share in mainland Europe mid- to long-term,” Bertermann said in an interview. Auto1 has about 320 branches and sold around 330,000 cars in Europe last year. Auto1’s core markets are now profitable, according to the presentation. Bertermann declined to give a breakdown of earnings. Europe beat a global slowdown in venture capital funding at the end of last year, according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and CB Insights. Funding into the continent rose 22 percent in the fourth quarter and the number of deals rose even as global funding fell from the year before. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The settlement represents a moment of reckoning for one of the country's biggest and most significant banks, which is now accountable for providing some financial support to Americans whose lives were dismantled by the largest economic meltdown since the Great Depression. In addition to a $4 billion civil penalty being paid to the federal government, the bank will also pay $2.5 billion in consumer relief to help borrowers who lost their homes to foreclosure and about $500 million to settle claims from state attorneys general and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The agreement does not preclude the possibility of criminal prosecutions for the bank or individual employees in the future, Holder said. The $7 billion settlement, which represents about half of Citigroup's $13.7 billion profit last year, is the latest substantial penalty sought for a bank or mortgage company at the epicenter of the housing crisis. The Justice Department, criticized for not being aggressive enough in targeting financial misconduct, has in the last year reached a $13 billion deal with JPMorgan Chase & Co., the nation's largest bank, and also sued Bank of America Corp. for misleading investors in its sale of mortgage-linked securities. Yet the settlement packages pale in size compared to the broader damages caused by the Great Recession. The unemployment rate spiked to 10 percent as millions lost their jobs and their homes, causing losses that totaled in the trillions of dollars. Public advocacy groups criticized the settlement as a sweetheart deal. "In the context of the damage done, the damage even described by the attorney general, we're not even in the same ballpark," said Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate for Public Citizen, which represents consumer interests. The settlement stems from the sale of toxic securities made up of subprime mortgages, which led to both the housing boom and bust that triggered the Great Recession at the end of 2007. Banks, including Citigroup, minimized the risks of subprime mortgages when packaging and selling them to mutual funds, investment trusts and pensions, as well as other banks and investors. The securities contained residential mortgages from borrowers who were unlikely to be able to repay their loans, yet were publicly promoted as relatively safe investments until the housing market collapsed in 2006 and 2007 and investors suffered billions of dollars in losses. Those losses triggered a financial crisis that pushed the economy into the worst recession since the 1930s. One Citigroup trader wrote in an internal email that he "would not be surprised if half of these loans went down" and said it was "amazing that some of these loans were closed at all," the Justice Department said. Meanwhile, the bank increased its profits and share of the market. "They did so at the expense of millions of ordinary Americans and investors of all types — including other financial institutions, universities and pension funds, cities and towns, and even hospitals and religious charities," Holder said at a news conference. Justice Department officials called the $4 billion component the largest civil penalty of its kind. It will not be tax-deductible. The $2.5 billion in consumer relief is directed at underwater homeowners and borrowers in areas of the country with high numbers of distressed properties and foreclosures. The sum includes refinancing for homeowners struggling with high interest rates on their mortgages, closing cost help for borrowers who lost homes to foreclosure, donations to community development funds and financing for construction and affordable rental housing. The deal and others like it will probably benefit hundreds of thousands of Americans, said Associate Attorney General Tony West, though Holder also acknowledged that many people would not be adequately compensated. Citigroup should have the capital needed to absorb the $7 billion settlement, said Gerard Cassidy, a managing director and analyst at RBC Capital Markets. In fact, investors were relieved that the issue was no longer confronting the bank and pushed up Citigroup's stock price on Monday. CEO Michael Corbat said the settlement ends all pending civil investigations related to mortgage-backed securities. But the "unintended consequence" of the settlement is that banks such as Citigroup are less likely to lend, hurting would-be homebuyers with student debt who are seeking a mortgage. "Banks won't go near those customers because, in our opinion, the severity of the penalties that they paid," Cassidy said. The settlement followed months of negotiations in which the two sides were often far apart. The Justice Department prepared to sue the bank last month after it offered to pay under $4 billion, substantially less than what the government was seeking. After JPMorgan's $13 billion deal last year involving similar toxic mortgage-backed securities, Citigroup argued that it should settle for a comparatively modest sum because it issued fewer mortgages than JPMorgan and the subsidiaries that the bank acquired during the recession. But the Justice Department countered that the evidence showed that Citigroup offered a greater share of troubled mortgage-backed securities. Investors shrugged off the settlement, a sign they expect Citigroup will continue to operate without much disruption. Shares in Citi rose $1.42 — or 3 percent — to $48.42 because the bank beat the expectations in the market, after adjusting for the second-quarter $3.8 billion charge related to the Justice Department settlement. The bank said its net income dropped in the second quarter after the settlement was arranged. On a per-share basis, net income was 3 cents, compared with $1.34 in the second quarter a year earlier. Excluding the charges and an accounting loss, the bank's second-quarter profit rose 1 percent to $3.93 billion, or $1.24 a share. Revenue was $19.4 billion, excluding the accounting loss, compared with $20 billion a year earlier. ____ Josh Boak and Marcy Gordon in Washington and Steve Rothwell in New York contributed to this report.

But Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said that's not what he meant. At issue is a Depression-era law known as Glass-Steagall. It prevented Main Street banks that take government-insured deposits from customers from participating in the riskier investment banking business associated with Wall Street. It was repealed in 1999, leading to mergers that created banking behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America. Congressional proposals, including legislation introduced by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal critic of Wall Street, would reimpose those limits and require breaking up those banks. And Trump has made statements that seem to suggest he supports the idea. "Some people ... want to go back to the old system, right? So we're going to look at that," Trump said earlier this month when asked about breaking up banks. But in a testy exchange with Warren at a Senate hearing on Thursday, Mnuchin said that when Trump spoke of supporting a 21st Century version of Glass-Steagall, he did not support strict limits that would require breaking up the banks. "There are aspects of [Glass-Steagall] that we think may make sense," Mnuchin said. "But we never said before that we supported a full separation of banking and investment banking." Warren called that distinction "bizarre." She said the phrase "Glass-Steagall" means breaking up the banks. In response, Mnuchin said voicing support for a 21st Century version didn't mean breaking up the banks. Warren replied by mocking him: "We are in favor of a bill called breaking up the banks, only don't break up the banks." Mnuchin said the administration's position is "complicated," but that it definitely does not want to reimpose a wall between the two types of banking. It "would be a huge mistake" to break banks apart because it would dampen lending to business, he said. "If we did go back to a full separation, you would have an enormous impact on liquidity and lending to small and medium-sized businesses," Mnuchin added.

 The Trump administration's plans to crack down on Wall Street are being called into question Bob Bryan May 19, 2017, 1:27 AM 79,641 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mike Segar/Reuters Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sat in front of the Senate banking committee on Thursday and attempted to explain the Trump administration's position on various economic policies, including the regulation of large banks. Mnuchin continually said the administration supported a "21st-century Glass-Steagall" — except for the Depression-era law's defining aspect. "We do think there are potential things we could look at around regulation, but we do not support separation of banks and investment banks," Mnuchin said. A flabbergasted Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who sits on the committee, pointed out that Glass-Steagall was best known for the separation of commercial and investment banks. "There are aspects of Glass-Steagall that you support, but not breaking up the banks and separating commercial banking from investment banking?" Warren asked. "What do you think Glass-Steagall was if that's not right at the heart of it?" What Warren is getting at is this: The Trump administration is doing its best to make everyone think it is bringing back the Wall Street regulation — to deliver on a Republican campaign promise — when all it's really doing is using the old law's name. For background, Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999, clearing the way for commercial-investment mergers on Wall Street, such as combinations of JPMorgan and Chase along with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. This intermingling of the two sides of banking has been blamed by critics — including Warren — for helping to cause the financial crisis (though this point is up for debate among many economists and academics). Reinstating the law has since become a favorite talking point of the anti-Wall Street movement in Washington. Anti-Wall Street campaign Mark Wilson/Getty Images As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump railed against Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs, attacked Hillary Clinton for her ties to big banks, and pitted himself as a populist who would stand up to Wall Street. In fact, the official Republican platform included, for the first time, a call to reinstate Glass-Steagall. Even after taking office, Trump said he would consider breaking up the banks, and economic advisers like Mnuchin and Gary Cohn reiterated support for a "21st-century Glass-Steagall." Mnuchin's statements, however, appear to have nothing to do with the core of Glass-Steagall (or at least its most looming legacy) and appear to simply be an attempt to slap a tough name on another deregulation measure. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, maintained that the president was "consistent" in his support of reinstituting Glass-Steagall in February and March, but the so-called 21st-century Glass-Steagall sounded a bit different when Spicer discussed it May 1. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, holding a briefing at the White House on March 20. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque "The president's pro-growth agenda, including instituting what he has called a 21st-century Glass-Steagall, will allow [small] banks to spend less time complying with unnecessary requirements, many of which were designed to police much larger entities, and more time infusing their communities and local small businesses with capital," Spicer said. This, instead of sounding as if it would regulate larger banks, appears to be a deregulation effort for community financial firms. Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota who now leads the Financial Services Roundtable, told Bloomberg's Max Abelson that the new bill from the administration wouldn't really focus on large banks with both investment and commercial arms at all. "Following the president's remarks on the topic, Gary Cohn clarified the administration's view of a modern-day Glass-Steagall is a two-tiered approach to regulation in which smaller banks would receive some regulatory relief," Pawlenty said. Basically, Abelson reported, bank executives expect the new Glass-Steagall to be a deregulation effort for smaller banks, with little involving larger banks, that is sold under the guise of a bill for which anti-Wall Street groups have been clamoring. As Warren pointed out during the testimony, the Trump administration is even cribbing the 21st-century-Glass-Steagall language from a bill partially written by Warren that would, in fact, break up large banks if adopted.

But the negativity in BAC stock is overdone, and in fact, a long strategy should serve us well. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr Like Bank of America, other financial stocks have taken a turn moving lower since the beginning of March. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) have both seen declines, although the market was just recently setting all-time highs. Vince Martin just recently pointed out that BAC stock may be, as he calls it, a “set it and forget it” holding. He says that although the current political environment may not be a stable environment for financial stocks, he believes BofA — due to its size, diversification and less exposure to legal changes than other institutions — makes it a stable choice in the sector. That wasn’t much help Wednesday, of course. The market was ruthless overall, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding 1.78%.Will the market make a full recovery and test all-time highs soon again, or will stocks throw in the towel and give what many have been asking for — a pullback? That remains to be seen, but something has changed for the time being, and that’s implied volatility. Keeping this as simple as I can, implied volatility is how options are priced. The higher the implied volatility, the more expensive options are. Generally, when the market or stocks fall like on Wednesday, implied volatility rises making option prices more expensive. One stock that I noticed a pretty substantial increase in was Bank of America. Earlier in the week, the 30-day implied volatility of BofA’s options was in the 18.5% range. At the time of this writing, it has spiked up to the 26.5% range. So what does this mean for BAC stock? If you’re an options trader, it means you can sell the higher premium here. One potential option is selling a vertical credit spread, expecting the stock to not move through a certain area. How to Trade BAC Stock Here Taking a look at the chart just below, you can see that since Bank of America closed above the $22 level back on Dec. 6, 2016, shares have not closed below that level. Click to Enlarge Although the stock has drifted down and close, the area has acted as support and moved the stock higher again.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Big banks can relax a little By Ben White and Aubree Eliza Weaver 05/19/2017 08:00 AM EDT BIG BANKS CAN RELAX A LITTLE — Executives at some of the nation’s largest banks freaked out a bit recently when both President Trump and NEC Director Gary Cohn talked about supporting a “21st Century Glass-Steagall” that some feared could break up the universal banking model. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin walked that back in his Senate testimony. Mnuchin told Sen. Elizabeth Warren it would be a “huge mistake” to break up the banks. The comments follow private remarks from Cohn to bankers clarifying that the administration has something very different in mind than simply forbidding banks from engaging in certain lines of business. Story Continued Below More Mnuchin: “If we had supported a full Glass-Steagall, we would have said at the time that we believed in Glass-Steagall, not a 21st Century Glass-Steagall.” POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt has more from the hearing. Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg: “We found it very interesting that Mnuchin never responded to the question [of what a 21st Century Glass-Steagall would look like] directly. In a later conversation with a Republican senator, Mnuchin suggested you could separate investment banking from commercial banking without a structural change. “To us, this sounds like the idea that FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig and others have advocated, which is to push the broker-dealer to the holding company from the bank.” Cap Alpha’s Ian Katz: “Mnuchin didn’t explain exactly what he wants, but for big banks, especially JPMorgan and Citigroup, his words are welcome news. A separation of banking functions would probably affect them the most. … “What does the administration actually want? The strongest indications so far are that it would like greater differentiation of rules for large banks and small ones. … The deregulatory emphasis is, and will continue to be, on relief for small banks. It’s one area where there’s bipartisan agreement.” RYAN STAYS BULLISH ON TAX REFORM — On Wednesday it was House Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady telling MM that we have it all wrong when we suggest getting a big tax reform package done this year would be close to impossible. On Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan doubled down on the pledge as well. Asked if tax reform could slip to 2018: “I don’t think this is the case. Our goal, and I believe we can meet this goal, is calendared 2017 for tax reform. And I think we’re making good progress.” Like Brady, Ryan also continued to make a strong pitch for the border adjustment tax despite strong opposition to the policy in the Senate and in the White House. POLITICO’s Rachel Bade has more on Ryan’s comments. MM still can’t figure out the play here. Ryan and Brady have a great intellectual case to make for the BAT as perhaps the most dynamic way to do tax reform that would not run afoul of reconciliation rules. But the fierce lobbying campaign against it by the Kochs, retailers, energy companies and others has been highly effective. So do they really think they can change minds? Or are they holding onto to it in hopes of getting some alternate version? MM isn’t sure what that alternate version would be. If you have a good read on this let me know on bwhite@politico.com ICYMI here’s Brady telling me they can get tax reform done this year. YES FED HIKE IS STILL COMING (PROBABLY) — Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “The probability of a rate hike on June 14, as implied by the fed funds future, has dropped to 90 percent, from a peak of 99 percent on May 5. The turmoil in Washington is responsible for most, if not all, of the shift in expectations, but political events alone will not stop the FOMC, in our view. “If, however, the stock market were to suffer more days like Wednesday, so that measures of broad financial conditions tighten materially, it is not impossible that policymakers will hold fire. We think that would be a mistake, but this is a cautious Fed” BUDGET LEAK — ThirdWay on Thursday posted what it said was a leaked version of Trump’s budget, expected to be released next week. Via ThirdWay president Jon Cowan: “There are a lot of numbers in this proposed budget, but our initial reading is that it is harsh toward the poor and those struggling to reach the middle class. It treats climate change as if it were a hoax” Read more. WHITE HOUSE ASSUMES 3 PERCENT GROWTH — WSJ’s Nick Timiraos got a briefing on the budget from a White House official: “The White House projects the nation’s economic growth rate will rise to 3 percent by 2021, compared with the 1.9 percent forecast under current policy by the Congressional Budget Office. “It’s unusual to see the White House’s growth forecasts differ from the CBO and other blue-chip projections by such a large margin over such a long stretch of the 10-year budget window.” Read more.

DRIVING THE DAY — President Trump on Friday departs for his first foreign trip, an eight-day journey that will take him to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Rome, Brussels and Sicily … House Ways and Means subcommittee has a hearing at 9:00 a.m. on IRS reform … GLOBAL RECOVERY STILL IN SYNC — Bloomberg’s Theophilos Argitis and Blaise Robinson: “With the first-quarter earnings season coming to a close, the verdict seems to be in on the synchronized global recovery: it’s intact. A picture of strong earnings growth and positive surprises has emerged across both industries and geography, adding to evidence the world’s major economies are increasingly running in lockstep. “It’s a reassuring development that should bolster confidence in the resiliency of the expansion at a time when economic data have painted a mixed picture, with ‘hard’ data like GDP numbers less convincing than the largely rosier consumer and business sentiment surveys worldwide” NEWS OF THE WEIRD — Daily Beast’s Ben Collins: “As a video circulated that appeared to partially absolve … Trump in the administration’s Russian meddling scandal on trading floors on Thursday, stocks surged for the first time in days on the apparent breaking news. The video, it turns out, was actually two weeks old, misleadingly edited with the intention of falsely accusing former FBI director James Comey of perjury — and was initially aired by conspiracy website InfoWars on Thursday around noon” Read more. WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN TRUMP DISCLOSURE — POLITICO’s Darren Samuelsohn: “Trump may boast about it, but he won't be breaking new ground by releasing updated financial disclosure forms one year before it's required. Every president since Ronald Reagan has done the same. “Still, his 2016 disclosure to the Federal Election Commission — expected out as soon as this week — promises to generate intense scrutiny. The report, which aides said he would release voluntarily, will open a window into his books .. But don't expect the kitchen sink. The report won't show how much Trump paid in taxes last year or his total business debt — the kinds of details that could show whether his businesses create conflicts of interest with his government gig.” Read more. WALL STREET STEADIES — FT’s Dave Shellock and Jamie Chisholm: “U.S. stocks steadied after the previous day’s savage sell-off, although the global market mood remained very nervous given this week’s intensification of political concerns in Washington. There was a partial reversal of Wednesday’s strong gains for so-called ‘haven’ assets, such as U.S. Treasuries, the yen and gold. “Heightening the cautious tone was a report in a leading Brazilian newspaper alleging president Michel Temer had endorsed bribe payments, which sent Brazilian stocks and the real tumbling.” Read more. ** A message from the National Restaurant Association: Debit swipe protections save consumers $5.8 billion each year. But big banks are pressuring Congress to repeal these protections so they can pad their own bottom line, placing a multi-billion-dollar tax on American consumers and small businesses. Congress must stop this Debit Card Tax.

In Israel, Mr. Trump has long sought a tower project in Tel Aviv. But he has shelved that ambition for now, given his self-imposed ban on foreign deals during his … “In Saudi Arabia, his executives scouted a hotel deal in recent years, but opted not to move forward. Before his inauguration, Mr. Trump handed his business, the Trump Organization, over to his eldest sons and his executives. But even with that distance, Mr. Trump continues to be the face of the company that bears his name, adding an unusual dimension to his foreign tours and diplomatic outreach — with the potential that he could return again as a businessman.” Read more. MNUCHIN CONCERNED ABOUT SCORING MODELS — Reuters’ Lindsay Dunsmuir: “U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers on Thursday that he has some doubts that what are known as alternate scoring models will give enough credit to the potential for economic growth when assessing the impact of the Trump administration's tax plan. “In late April, the administration put out a one-page overview of its tax reform plans, which would cut taxes for businesses to 15 percent, as well as cutting taxes and simplifying income tax brackets for individuals. Critics questioned how the tax cuts would be offset without driving up the federal deficit.” Read more. COOPERMAN SETTLES INSIDER TRADING CHARGES — FT’s Kara Scannell: “Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors has agreed to pay $4.9m to settle allegations he traded on inside information, ending a stand-off with US securities regulators. Under the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission Mr. Cooperman will not admit or deny wrongdoing or be banned from the industry. “The settlement resolves one of the highest-profile insider trading cases in recent years, involving a patriarch of the hedge fund industry whose institutional investors have largely deserted him since the claims surfaced. The SEC alleged Mr. Cooperman increased his longstanding position in Atlas Pipeline Partners after learning from a company executive that it was in talks to sell its Elk City operations” Read more. CORZINE LOOKS FOR ANOTHER COMEBACK — NYT’s Ben Protess: “It has been years since the last major high note in [former Goldman Sachs CEO Jon] Corzine’s career. In 2011, he faced the ignominy that came with the collapse of the brokerage firm he ran, MF Global, when about $1 billion of customer money temporarily went missing. “It ranked as one of the largest Wall Street bankruptcies since Lehman Brothers’. Now, here in his cramped office, Mr. Corzine is plotting his next and possibly final act: starting a hedge fund. And not just any hedge fund, but one designed to take advantage of the turmoil in the Trump era.” Read more. SOME STATES STILL HAVEN’T RECOVERED — AP’s Jeff Amy: “Call them the unrecovered - a handful of states where job markets, nine years later, are still struggling back to where they were before the recession. That's true in Mississippi, where job numbers and the overall size of the economy remain below 2008 levels. Unlike states that have long since sprinted ahead, Mississippi is struggling with slow economic growth and slipping population in a place that's rarely at peak economic health. “Not only Mississippi, but also Alabama, Michigan, New Mexico, and West Virginia are still short of pre-recession job levels by multiple measures. That contrasts with states including Colorado, North Dakota, Texas and Utah, where employment numbers have soared. Nationwide, job numbers surpassed pre-recession peaks in the middle of 2014, about the same time Mississippi was saddled with the nation's highest unemployment rate.” Read more. BOFA TALKS LOWERING MORTGAGE DOWN PAYMENTS — Reuters’ Dan Freed and David Henry: “The head of Bank of America Corp, the United State's fourth-biggest mortgage lender, said on Thursday banks would be able to supply a bigger share of funding for home purchases if the standard down payment for buyers was cut to 10 percent from 20 percent. “The vast majority of mortgages are underwritten to strict standards set by the U.S. government or quasi-government entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While down payment requirements can vary, they offer fairly little latitude to lenders that do not want to take all the risk themselves. As a result, many prospective homebuyers who cannot come up with a 20 percent down payment are unable to get a loan.” Read more. TRUMP ECONOMIC ‘UNCERTAINTY’ PASSES 2008 LEVELS — CNBC’s Steve Liesman: “From the standpoint of creating economic uncertainty, the election of Donald Trump has been more tumultuous than the 1987 stock market crash and the 2008 financial crisis. “Judged by the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index — devised by economists from Stanford, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern — the election of President Trump stands as the third-biggest source of uncertainty in the index's 30-plus-year history. It is eclipsed only by the 9/11 terrorist attack and the battle over the fiscal cliff in 2011” Read more. SHOULD MARKETS BE WORRIED ABOUT NORTH KOREA? — Bloomberg’s Narae Kim: “Investors may be glued to the latest political turmoil in Washington, but there’s a long-present danger that’s now looming larger for some analysts: North Korea. ‘Financial markets need to care’ about the risks from nuclear-armed North Korea, Citigroup Inc. analysts including Asia Pacific chief economist Johanna Chua wrote in a 40-plus page report dated Wednesday. “Bellicose rhetoric and military provocation including nuclear-weapon tests are nothing new for the dictatorship in Pyongyang, but the analysts said there’s ‘good reason to believe that risks are ratcheting higher now than in the past.’” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — HULTGREN ON THE CFPB — Rep. Randy Hultgren in Daily Caller op-ed: “Enter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), one of the most unaccountable government entities in American history.

Elizabeth Warren “endorsed single-payer and urged Democrats to promote the issue to voters across the country” Read more. TRUMP KICKS OFF NAFTA RE-DO — POLITICO’s Megan Cassella: “The Trump administration formally began its long-promised renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement on Thursday, sending Congress a letter that starts the clock on a 90-day waiting period before U.S. negotiators can sit down with their counterparts from Canada and Mexico. “The letter, signed by newly minted U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, outlines the administration's goal of modernizing the pact and pledges to work ‘closely and transparently’ with Congress throughout the process. Lighthizer noted that the administration's primary goal in renegotiating the more than 23-year-old agreement will be to update it, including by adding provisions on digital trade, intellectual property rights and labor and environmental standards” Read more. ** A message from the National Restaurant Association: Protections established in 2010 reduce the fees small businesses like restaurants must pay Wall Street banks every time a consumer pays with a debit card. Businesses have passed those savings onto their customers, saving consumers $5.8 billion each year. But now Wall Street is pressuring Congress to repeal these protections and place a huge tax on small businesses and consumers. If Congress repeals critical swipe fee protections as part of the Financial CHOICE Act, the cost of goods and services would increase dramatically for small businesses and consumers alike – making it more expensive for American families to eat out at their local restaurants. Wall Street doesn’t need another big bailout paid for by the American people. Congress should oppose the Debit Card Tax and keep the current protections in place. It’s a win-win for restaurants and consumers alike.

Photographer: Angel Navarrete/Bloomberg Banco Popular Espanol SA’s decade-old crisis may finally be coming to a head. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up For years, the Spanish lender managed to hold onto a mountain of soured real-estate loans made before the global financial crisis, tapping shareholders for new capital three times in the last five years. Now, with the stock down 98 percent from its 2007 peak and a market value barely above the amount it raised from investors last year, Chairman Emilio Saracho is pulling out all the stops to stabilize the lender. Emilio Saracho Photographer: Luca Piergiovanni/EPA On Tuesday, the bank said it asked competitors whether they’d be interested in buying the company. A day later, the lender raised cash selling a stake in a property company. Then on Thursday, Popular moved to reassure markets that it will pay a July coupon on its riskiest bonds after the notes tumbled on speculation losses may be imposed on the debt to preserve reserves. “The best outcome would be that there is a deal on the table -- that would be the cleanest solution,” said Puja Karia, an analyst CreditSights Ltd. in London. “Things can’t linger on.” $4 Billion Loss The events of this week highlight the pressure on Saracho, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. vice-chairman elected in December to replace Angel Ron, who held the post for more than a decade and refused a state bailout in 2012. Now Saracho is on a mission to line up more capital for the bank or sell it, after it booked a 3.6 billion-euro ($4 billion) loss for 2016. Buyer interest has been muted, with mainly two rivals raising their hands so far, El Pais newspaper has reported: Banco Santander SA, Spain’s biggest lender, and Bankia SA, the fourth-biggest. Santander’s capital position looks thin relative to its European peers. Bankia is state-owned after it was nationalized as part of a European bank bailout. Santander hired Citigroup Inc. to advise it on a potential bid for Popular, a person familiar with the matter said Friday. It has requested state guarantees to protect against potential future losses at Popular, said the person, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Officials for the banks declined to comment. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said Tuesday that Bankia was examining Popular’s situation. Susan Monahan, a spokeswoman for Citigroup in London, had no immediate comment. Popular’s shares rose as much as 8.6 percent on the news of Santander’s interest, which was earlier reported by El Confidencial. The stock was trading 4.6 percent higher at 12:18 p.m. in Madrid, paring losses this year to 25 percent. That’s still the worst performance in the 38-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index, which is up 9 percent. “I don’t see any incentive to offer the equity holders of Popular really very much -- if they offer them anything,” Daragh Quinn, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, said by phone. “Popular doesn’t have much negotiating power at this point.” Popular’s one attraction is its business serving small and medium-sized Spanish companies, said Inigo Lecubarri, founding partner of Abaco Asset Management LLP, who helps oversee more than $1 billion invested in mostly European financial stocks. Margins in the business are attractive because it is based on relationship banking that’s shielded to some extent from low-cost competitors, he said. “Here you have the chance to buy 7 percent banking market share in Spain with no premium -- it’s a fantastic opportunity,” said Lecubarri. “If I were a bank, I would definitely be interested in looking at Popular.” Soured Loans Popular would add about 34 billion euros of performing loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, a business where Santander already claims a 20 percent market share. But any buyer would also have to deal with Popular’s 37 billion euros of non-performing assets. Santander closed the first quarter with a CET1 fully-loaded ratio of 10.66 percent. That compares with 11.6 percent at BNP Paribas, 12.5 percent for Barclays Plc and 11.5 percent at Spanish rival CaixaBank SA. Bankia’s balance sheet is relatively clean after its bailout, with a 13.4 percent ratio that’s the highest of Spain’s main banks. Santander could decide to use a purchase of Popular as a pretext to raise more funds from shareholders and shore up its own capital ratio, said Andrew Lowe, an analyst at Berenberg in London. Santander is adamant that its capital levels are adequate and that it’ll continue to build them as it generates profits. ‘Over-Raise Capital’ “They could in theory over-raise capital to fund an acquisition and repair their own capital situation at the same time,” said Lowe. Would-be buyers could also accelerate cost cuts at a lender that still has almost 12,000 staff and 1,779 branches, even after reducing headcount by 21 percent over the past year, said Jefferies International analyst Benjie Creelan-Sandford. Saracho had initially focused on selling off assets and a return to the core lending business, but rising concern about the bank’s financial strength has put a spotlight on Popular’s strategic options. The lender this month reported a worse-than-expected first-quarter loss as it booked charges to cover real estate losses. Both capital and bad-loan ratios worsened. Share Slump On Thursday, Popular sold a 2.86 percent stake in Merlin Properties for 143.8 million euros, a filing showed. The bank is in talks to sell its U.S. business to Chile’s Banco de Credito e Inversiones, people familiar with the matter said last month. The unit could be valued at about $500 million, the people said. Creelan-Sandford estimates Popular itself would have to raise at least 4 billion euros of capital to take capital and loan loss coverage levels up to those comparable with its peers. While Popular is still open to a capital increase, the European Central Bank and Spanish regulators have told it that a sale would be the most appropriate option under the current circumstances, El Pais reported, citing unidentified sources. The bank is working with JPMorgan and Lazard Ltd. to test interest among potential buyers, people familiar with the matter said last week. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(Photo: Bryan Mitchell / Special to Detroit News) 21 CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE Whoever thought the words “General Motors” and “moves quickly” could never be uttered in the same sentence probably didn’t anticipate CEO Mary Barra. Under her leadership, Detroit’s No. 1 automaker is moving quickly to redefine its global automotive footprint, to boost its margins, to redeploy precious capital to high-profit pickups, SUVs and their flip side: the steadily evolving autonomy-and-mobility space. Her moves to stop selling cars in India and to off-load GM’s South Africa operations to Isuzu Motors Ltd., announced Thursday, are two more examples of a continuing global pullback that shows the automaker is deadly serious about fattening profits and focusing finite automotive capital where it can generate the best return and better ensure its future. Old GM it ain’t. This is not your father’s auto industry anymore, either. The industrial hegemony atop the nation’s most valuable companies has been displaced by leading tech and financial heavyweights like Apple and Google parent Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com and Facebook, Microsoft and JP Morgan Chase. They are now America’s most highly valued companies, not the likes of GM and Ford Motor Co. or their industrial peers. Tech’s fluid and fast-moving business models are reshaping investor perceptions and driving expectations for growth and innovation — a high bar for the low-margin auto industry to meet, if it can at all. That reordering, complete with the fat margins and growth prospects to go with it, is exerting relentless pressure on Detroit’s century-old automakers to rationalize, to exit businesses offering meager profit expansion, to make smart plays in autonomy and mobility lest its high-tech nemeses get there first. This is a race, and right now GM is outpacing Ford. Barra’s decisiveness is drawing a distinct contrast to Ford’s apparent indecision. Ford’s move to offer 1,400 salaried buyouts in North America and Asia evinces a more cautious response to investors demanding to see a clearer path to sustained growth. GM’s electric Chevrolet Bolt is in showrooms; Ford’s answer is not expected to debut until 2020. GM is exiting such marginally profitable markets as India; Ford continues to study its presence there, where the Blue Oval’s global “One Ford” products have been deemed wrong for a market that mostly cannot afford them. Neither GM nor Ford have summoned the courage to mimic Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and exit small cars in the United States. But Ford is giving the segment a hard look, despite back pressure from internal constituencies and dealers, in an increasingly urgent bid to answer two questions: where to play, and how to win? The upshot: America’s two largest mass-market automakers are fast approaching the point where they will cease being all things to all people, chiefly because the slim returns don’t justify the outsized expense. And, second, because looming autonomy, mobility and electrification plays represent more competition for finite resources, not less. Barra and President Dan Ammann aren’t just talking about strategic realignment. They’re doing it, adding two more markets to a lengthening list that includes exiting Russia and the rest of Europe, ending production in Australia and Indonesia, and leaving battered operations in Venezuela. They don’t have much choice: Detroit’s automakers, as well as its foreign-owned rivals, are negotiating a fraught transition from the century-old auto industry they know into a broader transportation ecosystem they’re learning by doing. Its new technologies and new competitors, many deeply rooted in Silicon Valley, are forcing the companies that put America on wheels to overhaul their business — or risk being left behind by markets of consumers, investors or both. Shares of GM are stuck in neutral, and shares in Ford are down 40 percent since CEO Mark Fields succeeded Alan Mulally in July 2014. No more can Detroit’s automakers be pension and health-care providers first and vehicle sellers second. No more can they pay workers not to work or reward executives for under-performing. Not for long can they keep playing in markets with the wrong products at the wrong price and call it success. History can be cruel. Detroit’s legacy of capital destruction and cyclical busts continues to weigh on the ability of GM, Ford and FCA to gain traction with investors. That and the fact that seven-plus years into their revival, all three are more dependent than ever on the truck and SUV sales customers want but investors don’t value so much. That’s the industry’s conundrum. It may not be fair, but it’s real. Daniel.Howes@detroitnews.com (313) 222-2106 Daniel Howes’ column runs Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.

Financial services firms need a regulated subsidiary in an EU country to offer their products across the bloc, and this could lead some to move jobs out of Britain if it loses access to the European single market. Thirteen major banks have given an indication of how they would bulk up their operations in Europe to secure market access. These plans could see more than 9,000 jobs move to the continent in the next two years. Following are some details and reports on the subject: STANDARD CHARTERED Standard Chartered <STAN.L> is in talks with regulators about making Frankfurt its European base to secure market access to the European Union when Britain leaves the bloc. HSBC Stuart Gulliver, CEO of HSBC <HSBA.L>, Europe’s biggest bank, said it would relocate staff responsible for generating around a fifth of its UK-based trading revenue, or around 1,000 people, to Paris. Chairman Douglas Flint has told lawmakers that banks without operations elsewhere in the EU will likely trigger migration plans immediately after EU divorce talks begin, estimating “tens of thousands” of jobs are linked to EU “passporting” rights. BARCLAYS Banks in Britain will start shifting some operations to continental Europe reasonably soon to avoid disrupting links with customers after Brexit, Barclays <BARC.L> Chief Executive Jes Staley said. He added that obtaining a licence to trade on the continent and changing financial contracts to another jurisdiction took a year to 18 months. The bank is preparing to make Dublin its EU headquarters after Brexit, according to a source familiar with the matter. Staley previously told BBC Radio that Barclays would keep the bulk of its activities in Britain after Brexit and any changes to how the bank operates would be small and manageable. UBS Swiss bank UBS <UBSG.S> would have to “move 1,500 people” from London to an EU destination in order to retain full passporting rights across the EU, according to UBS chairman Axel Weber. That would be more than a quarter of its current 5,500 staff in London. Separately, Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti has said UBS has a degree of flexibility if its UK outpost looks set to lose its ability to operate across the EU. The world’s biggest wealth manager has also set up a bank in Frankfurt to consolidate most of its European wealth management operations, after the Brexit vote dashed London’s chances of being the host city. CREDIT SUISSE Credit Suisse’s <CSGN.S> Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam said in September his bank was relatively well placed to deal with the impact of Brexit and that only around 15-20 percent of volumes in the investment bank would be impacted. LLOYDS BANKING GROUP Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L>, Britain’s largest mortgage lender and the only major British retail bank without a subsidiary in another EU country, is close to selecting Berlin as a European base to secure market access to the EU after Britain withdraws. GOLDMAN SACHS U.S. bank Goldman Sachs <GS.N> is considering moving up to 1,000 staff from London to Frankfurt because of concerns over Brexit, Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper reported in January, citing financial sources. Goldman Sachs will begin moving hundreds of people out of London before any Brexit deal is struck as part of its contingency plans, the Wall Street firm’s Europe CEO said in March. Three people familiar with the matter told Reuters in November that Goldman Sachs was considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt. MORGAN STANLEY U.S. bank Morgan Stanley <MS.N> has identified many of the roles that will need to be moved from Britain after Brexit, sources involved in the processes told Reuters. Morgan Stanley, which bases the bulk of its European staff in Britain, will have to move up to 1,000 jobs in sales and trading, risk management, legal and compliance, as well as slimming the back office in favour of locations overseas, one source told Reuters. Morgan Stanley may initially shift 300 staff from Britain following its exit from the EU, and is scouting for office space in Frankfurt and Dublin, Bloomberg News reported in February. CITIGROUP Citigroup <C.N>, which has also identified roles that will need to be moved out of the UK and has a large banking unit in Dublin, will need to move 100 posts in its sales and trading business, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Separately, Citigroup’s European chief said the U.S. bank would make a decision on its Brexit contingency plans in the first half of the year and choose from a number of potential EU countries to relocate some investment banking business. JPMORGAN JPMorgan Chase <JPM.N> has agreed to buy a Dublin building with room for 1,000 staff in the first sign of a financial services company expanding significantly in Ireland since the government began a major campaign to attract firms after Brexit. However, the bank, which currently employs around 500 people in Dublin, did not say how many jobs would be created or whether any positions would be moved from the United Kingdom. Daniel Pinto, head of investment banking at the Wall Street firm, had told Bloomberg on May 3 that the firm planned to move hundreds of London-based bankers to expanded offices in Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg. CEO Jamie Dimon had previously said the bank was not planning to move many jobs out of Britain in the next two years. Before the vote, Dimon said the bank would be forced to move 4,000 of its 16,000 staff currently based in Britain if the country loses access to the single market. BANK OF AMERICA CORP Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> said in August its businesses and results could be adversely affected and it may have to incur additional costs if Brexit limited the ability of its UK entities to conduct business in the EU. Dublin is Bank of America’s default option for a new base within the EU, but other centres are on the table and no decision has yet been made, an executive said in Germany on March 14. DEUTSCHE BANK Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> warned on April 26 up to 4,000 UK jobs could be moved to Frankfurt and other locations in the EU as a result of Brexit – the highest potential move of any bank. EUROCLEAR Settlement bank Euroclear is looking at the option of setting up a branch or subsidiary to provide a route between its UK and Irish markets following Brexit, the head of its UK and Irish operation said. DAIWA SAECURITIES GROUP Daiwa Securities Group Inc <8601.T>, Japan’s No. 2 brokerage firm, may decide as early as mid-June to move dozens of London-based staff to Frankfurt or another European city, ahead of Britain’s exit from the EU, Chief Executive Seiji Nakata said. The German city is Daiwa’s favoured destination, as London-based staff can easily be transferred to its investment banking branch in Frankfurt, Nakata said. Daiwa said it would keep staff in London even after Brexit, but declined to say how many. It currently employs around 450 people in the EU, mostly in the British capital. JULIUS BAER Britain’s planned departure from the European Union opens the door for a UK-Swiss deal covering financial services, said Boris Collardi, chief executive at Julius Baer, Switzerland’s third-biggest private bank.

The Fed said it imposed the penalties after Christopher Ashton failed to respond to the central bank’s June 2016 allegations that he participated in online chat rooms used to manipulate FX prices, according to a statement. Ashton is allegedly part of The Cartel -- the name given to a now notorious group of senior traders at banks including Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS Group AG that shared information and agreed on ways to try to move currency benchmarks. The Fed initially announced its plans to fine Ashton and bar him from the industry in August of last year. The Fed required Barclays to pay $342 million over the FX rigging in a May 2015 settlement.

The slogan beneath reads, 'Together we prevail.' The signs, along with others pairing the U.S. and Saudi flags, can be seen alongside roads and outside hotels throughout the Saudi capital. They're difficult to miss. When Air Force One touches down in Riyadh on Saturday, it will kick off a foreign trip by President Trump that has taken on an air of the bizarre before it even begins. In Washington, the U.S. president is battling investigations into possible collusion with Russian interference in the U.S. election and obstruction of justice. As a result, Trump’s nine-day overseas tour has drawn comparisons to President Richard Nixon’s trip to Egypt and Israel in June 1974, an apparent attempt to lift his political fortunes that took place weeks before he was forced to resign as a result of Watergate. No matter the rumbling at home, Trump can expect a warm welcome in Saudi Arabia, where his visit is being talked up in glowing terms. Much of Saudi Arabia's media have applauded the visit as marking the dawn of a new phase in Saudi-American relations. The mass circulation newspaper Okaz reported on Friday that the visit would launch "new phase of close relations between the Kingdom and the United States in various fields." In the historically outspoken al-Watan newspaper, poet and writer Abdel Matloub Badrani called Trump's visit "historic," and described Trump as breaking with past policies of former President Obama, whom he criticized for "taking Iran's side." In the English-language Arab News, editor-in-chief Faisal J. Abbas wrote of Trump's visit, "The stars cannot be any better aligned for a real, positive an lasting change change to occur." Foreign PolicyPresident Trump Is Headed to Saudi Arabia. He Once Said It Wants 'Women as Slaves and to Kill Gays' Saudi ArabiaPresident Trump Is Visiting Saudi Arabia to Cement a Friendship Saudi ArabiaSaudi Arabia Says Trump's Visit Will Help the Fight Against Extremism Donald TrumpPresident Trump Will Visit Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican on First Foreign Trip Saudi ArabiaPowerful Saudi Prince Says Iran Is Trying to 'Control the Islamic World' Saudi ArabiaSaudi Arabia Must Empower Women If it Truly Wants to Move Forward Yemen10,000 People Have Been Killed In Yemen's Bloody War, U.N. Confirms Saudi ArabiaA Saudi Prince Says It's Finally Time to Let Women Drive It's a stark contrast with the treatment of President Obama, towards the end of his term. In 2016, tensions emerged with the Saudi Royal family after Obama held up a delivery of weapons over the killing of civilians in the Saudi-led military offensive on Yemen. In mainstream Saudi discourse, Obama came to be seen as leaning diplomatically toward regional rival Iran, following the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. Accordingly, many Saudis TIME spoke to expressed hope that Trump’s visit could represent an opportunity to refresh relations with the United States. “I’m optimistic that it’s going to be a good thing,” said Meshal al-Turki, 29 who described himself as a purchaser for a specialized company. Asked about Trump’s history of anti-Muslim remarks, he said, “At the beginning, yes, I was surprised. His response was strange, but it’s the opposite of his response now,” he says. “It’s strange, maybe he got the right message about Islam as a religion, about Islamic society.” The President will have an opportunity to finesse that message in the centerpiece of his visit, a speech on Islam that will be his answer to Barack Obama’s iconic speech in Cairo in June 2009 in which the former president attempted to open a new era of respect and open relations between between America and Muslims. Related YemenWhat You Need to Know About the Crisis in Yemen Yemen What You Need to Know About the Crisis in Yemen Trump’s speech promises to strike a different tone, as it is being written by policy advisor Stephen Miller, one of the architects of Trump’s executive order in January that banned citizens of seven Muslim majority nations from entering the United States. At the time the order was issued, the American-allied Saudi government remained silent on the issue, and today many Saudis seem relieved that they were not included in the initial ban, which has now been suspended by a U.S. court order. No doubt his speech on Sunday will be more inclusive than some of his former remarks about Muslims, and indeed the religion's spiritual home. In the past, Trump has said that Islam “hates us” and claimed that Saudi Arabia “wouldn’t exist” without American protection. But ordinary Saudis seem prepared to set aside his explosive rhetoric from the past. Outside a supermarket in an upscale Riyadh shopping mall, 60-year-old retiree Fahad Muhammad expressed criticism at the "kind of racism" in Trump's entry ban on citizens from Muslim countries. However, he still welcomed Trump’s visit. “It’s necessary to sit at the same table. Americans and the West, sitting with the Arabs and Muslims, Muslim Arab states. It’s better that way, to have a discussion.” Trump's discussions are expected to extend from diplomacy to an area he's more familiar with — business. He's expected to seal a set of arms deals that he can later claim led to the creation of jobs, one of his core campaign promises, and top executives from the likes of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Lockheed Martin, Dow Chemical and General Electric are due to attend an expansive two-day series of conferences, including leaders from 55 different countries . “This is not an exercise in affection. It’s not a celebration of common values,” says Charles Freeman, a retired career diplomat and former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. “The Saudis felt a loyalty to the United States. That’s been gone for quite a while. This relationship is transactional. Everyone asks, what’s in it for me?” This wheeler-dealing likely won't leave a lot of time for raising human rights concerns — for example, over the case of three young men in Saudi prison who are now facing the death penalty after being arrested as teenagers during a crackdown on protests in 2012. That's not really Trump's style anyway, says Hatoon al-Fassi, a prominent Saudi historian currently at Qatar University. “He doesn’t come across as someone who is very keen on women’s rights or any humans rights. I think he’s a very pragmatic person. We don’t have any high expectations. We are looking at the event as very good PR for Saudi Arabia.” Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) 19 May 2017 09:35PM (Updated: 20 May 2017 04:50AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail NEW YORK: U.S. stocks rose but closed below their session highs on renewed concerns about Donald Trump's presidency, after two new reports related to a federal investigation into possible coordination between Russia and Trump's election campaign. A senior White House adviser is a significant person of interest in the law enforcement investigation of possible Russian ties, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. Separately the New York Times reported that Trump told Russian officials at the White House that firing FBI Director James Comey relieved "great pressure" from the ongoing probe. The Times report cited a document summarizing the meeting. "I'm sure some of (the move) is related to that, and the fact that Trump is going to be out of the country and nobody's quite sure what he's going to do," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. He added, however, that the market did not seem too concerned as the major indexes were still in positive territory. Advertisement Advertisement "We've got two days now to wring our hands about what might happen," he said. Trump left on Friday for his first foreign trip since taking office, which the White House hopes will shift the focus away from domestic controversies. While Wall Street ended higher it failed to fully regain all the ground lost in Wednesday's big selloff after reports earlier this week that Trump tried to interfere in the federal investigation. Investors have been closely following events in Washington as they worry whether Trump will be able to fulfill campaign promises for fiscal stimulus and tax reform. Many investors saw the policy promises as a key reason for the post-election rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 141.82 points, or 0.69 percent, to 20,804.84, the S&P 500 had gained 16.01 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,381.73 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 28.57 points, or 0.47 percent, to 6,083.70. But all three indexes clocked losses for the week with the Dow and S&P falling 0.4 percent and Nasdaq off 0.6 percent All of the 11 major S&P industry sectors ended the day higher. Industrials showed the biggest percentage gain with a 1.36 percent jump while Energy rose 1.24 percent. Oil company shares were boosted by a 2 percent increase in oil futures related to growing expectations that OPEC and other producing countries will agree at a meeting next week to extend crude output cuts. Some market participants said that for much of the session, they turned their focus to strong quarterly earnings from companies such as Autodesk Inc and Deere & Co . Software developer Autodesk jumped 14.7 percent and was the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P after reporting better-than-expected quarterly revenue. Deere hit an all-time high of US$122.24 and closed up 7.3 percent at US$120.90 after the farm and construction equipment maker posted a better-than-estimated quarterly profit. Deere helped lift Caterpillar Inc 2.2 percent. General Electric Co was the S&P's top driver with a 2.4 percent rise. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.75-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 81 new highs and 58 new lows. About 7.03 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges in line with the average volume for the last 20 sessions.

However, Wall Street's major indexes were on track for their worst weekly declines since mid-April following reports that Trump had tried to interfere in a federal investigation. Investors were concerned that the uncertainty in Washington could hinder Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus, a bet on which Wall Street has rallied to record highs. Strong quarterly earnings from companies, including Autodesk and Deere &amp; Co, boosted the market. Autodesk was among the biggest percentage gainers on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq after the software maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue. Deere hit an all-time high of $122.24 after the farm and construction equipment maker reported a quarterly profit that beat expectations. The news lifted Caterpillar's shares by 2.5 percent, making it the top stock on the Dow. "We think the Trump trade and the reflation trade have unwound almost entirely post election, and the market is relying on recovery in earnings and strong fundamentals," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Of the 452 S&amp;P 500 companies that have released results so far, about 75 percent have topped earnings expectations. In a typical quarter, about 64 percent beat estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "You (also) didn't have a lot of news out of Washington, which is helping calm some of the anxiety," Jones said. At 12:53 p.m. ET (1653 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 172.09 points, or 0.83 percent, at 20,835.11, the S&amp;P 500 was up 21.68 points, or 0.91 percent, at 2,387.4 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 49.56 points, or 0.82 percent, at 6,104.69. All three indexes were on track to post their biggest daily percentage gains for the month. All the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were higher, with industrials, materials and energy gaining more than 1 percent. Oil rose more than 2 percent, helping energy shares, amid talks of an extension to the supply limit deal among OPEC members. Wal-Mart was up 1.8 percent at $78.95 after BMO upgraded the big-box retailer's stock to "market perform" from "underperform" following higher-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,321 to 537. On the Nasdaq, 1,910 issues rose and 881 fell. The S&amp;P 500 index showed 21 new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 68 new highs and 46 new lows.

The slogan beneath reads, 'Together we prevail.' The signs, along with others pairing the U.S. and Saudi flags, can be seen alongside roads and outside hotels throughout the Saudi capital. They're difficult to miss. When Air Force One touches down in Riyadh on Saturday, it will kick off a foreign trip by President Trump that has taken on an air of the bizarre before it even begins. In Washington, the U.S. president is battling investigations into possible collusion with Russian interference in the U.S. election and obstruction of justice. As a result, Trump’s nine-day overseas tour has drawn comparisons to President Richard Nixon’s trip to Egypt and Israel in June 1974, an apparent attempt to lift his political fortunes that took place weeks before he was forced to resign as a result of Watergate. No matter the rumbling at home, Trump can expect a warm welcome in Saudi Arabia, where his visit is being talked up in glowing terms. Much of Saudi Arabia's media have applauded the visit as marking the dawn of a new phase in Saudi-American relations. The mass circulation newspaper Okaz reported on Friday that the visit would launch "new phase of close relations between the Kingdom and the United States in various fields." In the historically outspoken al-Watan newspaper, poet and writer Abdel Matloub Badrani called Trump's visit "historic," and described Trump as breaking with past policies of former President Obama, whom he criticized for "taking Iran's side." In the English-language Arab News, editor-in-chief Faisal J. Abbas wrote of Trump's visit, "The stars cannot be any better aligned for a real, positive an lasting change change to occur." Foreign PolicyPresident Trump Is Headed to Saudi Arabia. He Once Said It Wants 'Women as Slaves and to Kill Gays' Saudi ArabiaPresident Trump Is Visiting Saudi Arabia to Cement a Friendship Saudi ArabiaSaudi Arabia Says Trump's Visit Will Help the Fight Against Extremism Donald TrumpPresident Trump Will Visit Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican on First Foreign Trip Saudi ArabiaPowerful Saudi Prince Says Iran Is Trying to 'Control the Islamic World' Saudi ArabiaSaudi Arabia Must Empower Women If it Truly Wants to Move Forward Yemen10,000 People Have Been Killed In Yemen's Bloody War, U.N. Confirms Saudi ArabiaA Saudi Prince Says It's Finally Time to Let Women Drive It's a stark contrast with the treatment of President Obama, towards the end of his term. In 2016, tensions emerged with the Saudi Royal family after Obama held up a delivery of weapons over the killing of civilians in the Saudi-led military offensive on Yemen. In mainstream Saudi discourse, Obama came to be seen as leaning diplomatically toward regional rival Iran, following the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. Accordingly, many Saudis TIME spoke to expressed hope that Trump’s visit could represent an opportunity to refresh relations with the United States. “I’m optimistic that it’s going to be a good thing,” said Meshal al-Turki, 29 who described himself as a purchaser for a specialized company. Asked about Trump’s history of anti-Muslim remarks, he said, “At the beginning, yes, I was surprised. His response was strange, but it’s the opposite of his response now,” he says. “It’s strange, maybe he got the right message about Islam as a religion, about Islamic society.” The President will have an opportunity to finesse that message in the centerpiece of his visit, a speech on Islam that will be his answer to Barack Obama’s iconic speech in Cairo in June 2009 in which the former president attempted to open a new era of respect and open relations between between America and Muslims. Related YemenWhat You Need to Know About the Crisis in Yemen Yemen What You Need to Know About the Crisis in Yemen Trump’s speech promises to strike a different tone, as it is being written by policy advisor Stephen Miller, one of the architects of Trump’s executive order in January that banned citizens of seven Muslim majority nations from entering the United States. At the time the order was issued, the American-allied Saudi government remained silent on the issue, and today many Saudis seem relieved that they were not included in the initial ban, which has now been suspended by a U.S. court order. No doubt his speech on Sunday will be more inclusive than some of his former remarks about Muslims, and indeed the religion's spiritual home. In the past, Trump has said that Islam “hates us” and claimed that Saudi Arabia “wouldn’t exist” without American protection. But ordinary Saudis seem prepared to set aside his explosive rhetoric from the past. Outside a supermarket in an upscale Riyadh shopping mall, 60-year-old retiree Fahad Muhammad expressed criticism at the "kind of racism" in Trump's entry ban on citizens from Muslim countries. However, he still welcomed Trump’s visit. “It’s necessary to sit at the same table. Americans and the West, sitting with the Arabs and Muslims, Muslim Arab states. It’s better that way, to have a discussion.” Trump's discussions are expected to extend from diplomacy to an area he's more familiar with — business. He's expected to seal a set of arms deals that he can later claim led to the creation of jobs, one of his core campaign promises, and top executives from the likes of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Lockheed Martin, Dow Chemical and General Electric are due to attend an expansive two-day series of conferences, including leaders from 55 different countries . “This is not an exercise in affection. It’s not a celebration of common values,” says Charles Freeman, a retired career diplomat and former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. “The Saudis felt a loyalty to the United States. That’s been gone for quite a while. This relationship is transactional. Everyone asks, what’s in it for me?” This wheeler-dealing likely won't leave a lot of time for raising human rights concerns — for example, over the case of three young men in Saudi prison who are now facing the death penalty after being arrested as teenagers during a crackdown on protests in 2012. That's not really Trump's style anyway, says Hatoon al-Fassi, a prominent Saudi historian currently at Qatar University. “He doesn’t come across as someone who is very keen on women’s rights or any humans rights. I think he’s a very pragmatic person. We don’t have any high expectations. We are looking at the event as very good PR for Saudi Arabia.” Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT I to Acquire Real Estate Assets and Asset Management Business from Phillips Edison Limited Partnership CINCINNATI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT I, Inc. (“PECO I” or the “company”) entered into a definitive contribution agreement on May 18, 2017 to acquire real estate assets and the third party asset management business of its sponsor and external advisor, Phillips Edison Limited Partnership (“PELP”), in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $1 billion, subject to closing adjustments. Upon the closing of the transaction, this highly strategic acquisition will create an internally-managed, non-traded grocery-anchored shopping center REIT with an expected total enterprise value of approximately $4 billion. The resulting enterprise will own a high-quality, nationally-diversified portfolio of 230 shopping centers in 32 states that is well positioned to drive sustained growth and create enhanced value for all shareholders. PECO I estimates that, on a pro forma basis, funds from operation (“FFO”) would have increased by 8-10% on a per share basis for the three months ended March 31, 2017 relative to actual results. Under the terms of the agreement, PELP will receive approximately 45.2 million operating partnership units ( “OP units”) in PECO I’s operating partnership, Phillips Edison Grocery Center Operating Partnership I, L.P. (“PECO I OP”), inclusive of 4.8 million Class B Units in PECO I OP already outstanding, and approximately $50.0 million in cash in exchange for the contribution of PELP’s ownership interests in 76 shopping centers and its third party asset management business. Each OP unit is exchangeable for PECO I common shares. PECO I’s board of directors recently reaffirmed that the company’s common stock has an estimated value per share of $10.20 as of March 31, 2017. An independent third party valuation firm, Duff & Phelps, provided a range of the estimated value per share of the company’s common stock based substantially on its estimate of the market value of the company’s portfolio as of March 31, 2017. The cash portion of the consideration will be used to retire certain minority interests in PELP to help ensure the combined company maintains its qualification as a REIT. Management will receive no cash consideration in this transaction and will be subject to traditional and customary lockup provisions. Additionally, PECO I will not pay any internalization fees in connection with the transaction, i.e., no consideration is being paid for the advisory services that PELP provides to PECO I. Outstanding debt of approximately $501 million is expected to be refinanced or assumed by PECO I at closing under the terms of the agreement. The agreement also includes an earn-out structure with an opportunity for PELP to receive up to an additional 12.49 million OP units if certain milestones are achieved related to a liquidity event for PECO I shareholders and fundraising targets in PELP’s third non-traded REIT, Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT III. On a pro forma basis, immediately following the closing of the transaction, PECO I shareholders are expected to own approximately 80.2%, and former PELP shareholders are expected to own approximately 19.8% of the combined company. The transaction was approved by the independent special committee of PECO I’s board of directors, which had retained independent financial and legal advisors. The closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. Although not required by law or under PECO I’s governing documents, PECO I has conditioned the closing of the transaction on the receipt of the approval of its shareholders. PELP will also seek the approval of its partners. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2017. “Shareholders of PECO I will benefit from a combined enterprise with internalized management, increased size and scale, higher earnings potential, greater earnings growth potential, improved dividend coverage and enhanced access to capital,” said Stephen Quazzo, the chair of the special committee of PECO I’s board of directors. “Importantly, we expect this strategic transaction to be immediately accretive to FFO per share, and it positions PECO I well for future capital market opportunities including potential liquidity alternatives.” Summary of Strategic Benefits The transaction is expected to create significant operational and financial benefits, including: Maintains Grocery Focus: Combined portfolio and all assets under management are focused entirely on grocery-anchored shopping centers with an emphasis on necessity-based retailers, which have proven to be both internet and recession resilient. Improved Earnings: Expected to be accretive to funds from operations (FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”)) through meaningful cost synergies from an internalized management structure. Estimated pro forma FFO for the first quarter of 2017 would have increased by approximately 8-10% relative to the performance of stand-alone PECO I. Dividends and Dividend Coverage: Future monthly distributions for PECO I are expected to remain unchanged following the transaction. PECO I estimates that pro forma FFO would have fully covered distributions for the three months ended March 31, 2017, relative to actual coverage of 92% for PECO I standalone. Strengthened Balance Sheet: The combined company is expected to have an improved capital position on a Total Debt/EBITDA basis and a total debt to enterprise value of approximately 41.4%, which positions the company well for attractive future financing opportunities. Better Alignment of Management: Internalized management structure creates better alignment with its shareholders. Through its investment in OP Units, management will be PECO I’s largest equity owner, owning over 18 million OP Units and common shares, with a long-term view of shareholder value and will be subject to traditional and customary lock-ups. Increased Potential for Future Growth: Acquired real estate has the opportunity for higher net operating income growth, and the asset management business provides an additional avenue for future long-term earnings growth as assets under management increase. Improved Geographic and Tenant Diversity: The combined company will own a high-quality portfolio of 230 grocery-anchored shopping centers comprising approximately 25.5 million square feet in established trade areas located in 32 states, and will benefit from greater geographic, grocery anchor and tenant diversification. Superior Financial Strength and Flexibility: With enhanced size and scale, the combined company will have additional access to capital, which can be used to support strategic investments to drive future growth opportunities. Liquidity Opportunities: Given its enhanced size, scale, improved financials and internalized management structure, the combined company is better positioned to capitalize on capital market opportunities, including potential liquidity alternatives. Distribution Reinvestment Plan and Share Repurchase Program In connection with the proposed acquisition, PECO I has modified its distribution reinvestment plan (DRP) for the month of June, and DRP participants will receive their June distribution in cash. The DRP plan will resume in July after the expected filing of a preliminary proxy statement in June. The share repurchase program (SRP) is suspended for the month of June and is also expected to resume in July after the filing of the same preliminary proxy statement in June.

However, Wall Street's major indexes were on track for their worst weekly declines since mid-April following reports that Trump had tried to interfere in a federal investigation. Investors were concerned that the uncertainty in Washington could hinder Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus, a bet on which Wall Street has rallied to record highs. Strong quarterly earnings from companies, including Autodesk and Deere & Co, boosted the market. Autodesk was among the biggest percentage gainers on the S&P and the Nasdaq after the software maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue. Deere hit an all-time high of $122.24 after the farm and construction equipment maker reported a quarterly profit that beat expectations. The news lifted Caterpillar's shares by 2 percent, making it the top stock on the Dow. "We think the Trump trade and the reflation trade have unwound almost entirely post election, and the market is relying on recovery in earnings and strong fundamentals," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Of the 452 S&P 500 companies that have released results so far, about 75 percent have topped earnings expectations. In a typical quarter, about 64 percent beat estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "You (also) didn't have a lot of news out of Washington, which is helping calm some of the anxiety," Jones said. At 11:09 a.m. ET (1509 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 122.39 points, or 0.59 percent, at 20,785.41, the S&P 500 was up 17.5 points, or 0.74 percent, at 2,383.22 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 43.57 points, or 0.72 percent, at 6,098.70. All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with industrials, materials and energy gaining more than 1 percent. Oil rose more than 2 percent, helping energy shares, amid talks of an extension to the supply limit deal among OPEC members. Wal-Mart was up 1.7 percent at $78.86 after BMO upgraded the big-box retailer's stock to "market perform" from "underperform" following higher-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,194 to 596. On the Nasdaq, 1,776 issues rose and 890 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 17 new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 57 new highs and 39 new lows.

Saudi Arabia will be President Donald Trump’s first stop in his first overseas tour. The Saudis have laid out a massive red carpet for Trump and his business delegation with multiple events. It’s emblematic of the importance the Saudis have bestowed on Trump and the rebirth of its relationship with the US. It’s not unusual for a US president to visit Saudi Arabia — President Barack Obama, who was viewed cautiously by Riyadh, came more times than any of his predecessors. It is, however, a first for a US president to be visiting the kingdom on his maiden trip. Business comes first. Bilateral trade between the two nations is strong, amounting to almost $40 billion in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau. In fact, last year was the first time in 21 years the US sustained a trade surplus with Saudi Arabia, mainly due to lower oil prices. For Trump, Saudi Arabia is a long-term business partner offering enormous potential for US companies as the Middle East nation prepares for its post-oil future. Attracting US investment is vital for its foreign-direct investment programs and successful implementation of Saudi Vision 2030. Taking a leading position in Saudi Arabia’s business opportunities is on the table with officials planning to privatize four sectors this year, including Saline Water Conversion Corp., a power generation company under Saudi Electricity Co., grain silos and sports clubs. During Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s March visit to the US, Trump supported the development of a new US-Saudi program in energy, industry, infrastructure and technology valued at more than $200 billion in direct and indirect investment over the next four years. Trump, in turn, has said he intends to push for $1 trillion in US infrastructure investments over the next decade, with $200 billion coming from taxpayers and the rest from the private sector. Saudi Arabia, through its Public Investment Fund invested $3.5 billion in the US ride-share company Uber Technologies Inc. in 2016. Assisting Saudi Arabia in the successful transitioning of its economy beyond oil is a boon for all. Saudi Arabia’s economic direction is clear: rid itself of oil dependency, while becoming a logistics hub, develop upstream and downstream mining capacity, deepen the tourism sector, build up the indigenous entertainment sector and increase local military manufacturing capacity. Officials and ministries are far more accountable via several new institutional mechanisms than at any time in the past. There is a sense of hope among young people that the country is changing and is addressing issues such as labor and female participation. The Saudi Aramco initial public offering is another opportunity. It showcases the importance of US financial services in what would be the largest IPO thus far, expected to reach $100 billion. There is much to like, as a possible dual listing in Riyadh and on the New York Stock Exchange will only help to deepen the solid business relations of the two countries. The NYSE is the world’s largest stock market and includes oil majors such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil among its listings. Saudi Arabia has provided ample business to US investment banks and financial advisers working on the Saudi Aramco IPO. Two of the three leading underwriters are US firms — JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley — the third is HSBC. A New York listing will bolster Trump’s business first motto. For the Saudis, there is much to like in Trump. In Riyadh, the Obama administration was seen as being too pro-Iranian, confusing, and raised doubts about the wider role of the US in the Middle East. Trump represents the opposite. The strategic-military relationship is central to the Saudi-US partnership. For decades the US has been a crucial supplier of land and aerial equipment. Saudi Arabia wants more sophisticated equipment and Trump has promised to stimulate the US economy by generating more manufacturing jobs. Saudi Arabia is looking for partners as it constructs its post-oil economy and it’s almost certain that it found it in America’s Trump.

Photo: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images Donald Trump will hop on Air Force One and head overseas on Friday for his first trip abroad as president. Even before a special counsel was appointed, Trump aides were describing the trip as a much-needed “turning point” for an administration mired in scandal here at home. However, considering Trump’s unpredictability, limited attention span, and distaste for straying too far from his home turf, the journey offers a whole new array of potentially serious pitfalls. Trump will spend more than a week abroad, with stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican, Belgium, and Sicily. It’s not a coincidence that the itinerary includes the religious centers for Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. White House officials portrayed the tour as an opportunity to unite the three religions in the fight against “intolerance” and radical extremism (i.e. destroying ISIS and isolating Iran). It could also be seen as delayed damage control for a president who embraced Islamophobia, attacked the Pope, and shared an anti-Semitic meme during the campaign. “I think the importance of this trip and President Trump’s leadership around bringing people the world over to understand we are in this together,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Thursday. “This is not a battle about religions. This is not a battle about cultures. This is a battle about good and evil.” Despite the hype, Trump seems unenthused about this new presidential obligation. He reportedly “barked at an aide” that the trip should be half as long, and has had trouble focusing on preparations for his meetings with foreign leaders. According to Reuters, National Security Council officials have resorted to repeating Trump’s name throughout his briefing materials in an effort to make sure he reads them. In other words, it’s unlikely that an entirely new Trump is going to step off Air Force One. Here’s a look at the controversies that are already brewing, and what to expect when our inexperienced and possibly agitated president throws himself into delicate foreign-policy matters. Saudi Arabia By scheduling his first foreign meeting in Saudi Arabia, Trump is breaking with tradition. Recent presidents have typically made an early trip to Canada or Mexico, which offer lower stakes and signal neighborly goodwill. Those probably wouldn’t have been comfortable visits for Trump, with his border wall and NAFTA threats, but Riyadh presents complications too. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized Saudi Arabia, and he once accused them of being behind the 9/11 attacks twice in one day. Just last month, he said, “Frankly, Saudi Arabia has not treated us fairly, because we are losing a tremendous amount of money in defending Saudi Arabia.” Nevertheless, the Saudis are planning a “grandiose reception” for President Trump, according to the New York Times. It includes a royal banquet and an “Arab Islamic American Summit” with leaders from about 50 predominantly Muslim countries. Among the rumored invitees is Omar Bashir, the president of Sudan, who is wanted for war crimes — specifically genocide. The optics are bad, especially since Sudan is still on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror. The U.S. Embassy in Khartoum and the State Department made it clear that Bashir’s attendance is unacceptable. “My understanding was that he would NOT be at the meeting with the president,” Michael Anton, the spokesman for the National Security Council, told The Guardian. However, Sudan’s foreign minister has said Bashir is coming, and Sudan is looking forward to normalizing relations with the U.S. Trump plans to deliver a speech on Islam during the summit. It was reportedly written by adviser Stephen Miller, the architect of the January executive order than banned people from seven Muslim-majority nations from the U.S. Trump will have some treats for the Saudis, including a $100 billion arms deal and a plan to build an “Arab NATO,” details TBD, primarily as a check on Iran. Trump is also expected to sign several bilateral deals with Saudi Arabia, including reported agreements between Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil company, and some U.S. companies. According to the Financial Times, some of these deals were already in the works before Trump’s presidency, but they’ll be celebrated with fanfare nonetheless. A number of American CEOs — including JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon and Dow Chemical’s Andrew N. Liveris — will join the Saudis for a CEO forum while Trump is in town. Trump will cap off his time in Saudi Arabia with a Twitter forum for young people, where absolutely nothing could go wrong. Israel Trump’s itinerary suggests he’s flying directly from Saudi Arabia to Israel, which would mark the first ever direct flight between the two countries, according to Haaretz. However, he will not fly to Masada, an ancient fortress in Israel. Trump wanted to land his helicopter at the top of the site, according to Newsweek, but Israeli officials refused because it is a UNESCO World Heritage site that is believed to have been built before 100 A.D. Israeli officials offered a compromise: Trump could fly his helicopter to Masada’s base, and then take the cable cars to the top, as his predecessors George W. Bush and Bill Clinton did. Trump opted to nix the visit and speech altogether. An aerial photo of the ancient hilltop fortress of Masada. Photo: MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP/Getty Images Instead, Trump will speak at the Israel Museum. He’ll also lay a wreath at the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem, though he only plans to spend 15 minutes there. Some criticized this, noting that Israeli officials say 90 minutes is the “bare minimum” needed to cover the 45-acre complex. Later Trump will dine privately with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife. The following day, May 23, Trump will meet with Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem before visiting the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Trump will be the first sitting president to visit the site, and it will not be without controversy. After a U.S. official planning the stop suggested the Western Wall was in the West Bank, and not part of Israeli territory, National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster declined to say who has claim to the holy site. The official reportedly said Trump’s visit to the Western Wall was private, and the president did not want Netanyahu to accompany him. Aside from all the local controversies, the stop in Israel also comes days after Trump shared highly classified information about ISIS with the Russians, which is believed to have come from Israeli intelligence. The Vatican Trump is set to meet Pope Francis at the Vatican on May 24, followed by a tour of St. Peter’s. Somehow this, too, will be an awkward meeting for Trump, as he’s been feuding with the pontiff. During the campaign, Pope Francis suggested that a man so passionate about building walls is “not Christian.” “If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened,” the Trump campaign said in a statement in 2016. “ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.” Pope Francis has made other comments supporting climate change and immigration that appeared to be aimed at Trump, but unsurprisingly, he suggested he wants to turn over a new leaf. “I will tell him what I think, he will tell me what he thinks, but I never wanted to judge someone before I listen to the person first,” Pope Francis told reporters last week. Trump will also meet with Italian president Sergio Mattarella before heading to Brussels. Belgium If Trump makes it through the religious portion of his tour, he’ll land in Brussels on May 25 and meet with Belgium’s King Philippe and Prime Minister Charles Michel. Next, he’ll have to resist replaying some of his greatest hits when he heads to European Union headquarters, meets newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron (rather than his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen), and attends a summit of leaders of NATO nations. Trump’s remarks at the NATO summit will reportedly also be drafted by Miller, who is a Bannon-esque isolationist. “We’re just hoping the remarks don’t turn out to be ‘America First’ on steroids,” a European official told BuzzFeed News. “But who knows with Miller.” Trump’s speech is expected to reaffirm America’s commitment to the military alliance, while also doubling down on NATO freeloaders. Sicily Finally, Trump heads back to Italy for a G-7 summit in Sicily. Macron, Shinzo Abe of Japan, Paolo Gentiloni of Italy, Theresa May of Britain, Angela Merkel of Germany, and Justin Trudeau of Canada are set to attend, so Trump will have a chance to try out all his new awkward handshakes. After the trip, Trump won’t get much of a break. The White House said he’ll make a final decision on the Paris Climate Agreement when he gets back from the G-7 summit. He plans to continue talking it over with his advisers, and presumably he needs to sleep on it — in his own bed.

Usually wage growth accelerates when the job market is tight: Employers have to pay more to attract and retain workers. But even though the unemployment rate hit a decade low of 4.4 percent in April, average hourly earnings grew just 2.3 percent over the past year—compared with an annual rate of more than 4 percent the last time the jobless rate was this low. What has happened to the historical, and seemingly logical, link between unemployment and wages? A lot of people want to know, including the policymakers at the Federal Reserve, who’d ordinarily be raising interest rates much more than they have to prevent a wage-price inflation spiral. In the absence of a single convincing explanation, here are eight theories. One is that the Phillips curve is effectively dead. In textbooks, wage growth is on the vertical axis and unemployment on the horizontal: The curve goes smoothly down to the right as unemployment rises and wage growth falls. In reality, the correlation has been so inconsistent in recent years that a Phillips curve graph looks more like a Jackson Pollock drip painting or the footprints of a staggering drunk. Steve Forbes, the editor-in-chief of Forbes and former Republican presidential candidate, calls the curve “a quack theorem.” Economists aren’t as quick as Forbes to reject the Phillips curve; it just makes intuitive sense that a tight labor market such as this will eventually push up wages. So some fall back on the explanation that workers’ bargaining power has weakened. The decline of unions is a crucial factor, says Peter Temin, a retired MIT economics professor and author of a new book, The Vanishing Middle Class: Prejudice and Power in a Dual Economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says fewer than 11 percent of wage and salary workers were union members last year, down from 20 percent in 1983. Globalization has also weakened the leverage of American workers, says Jonas Prising, chairman of Manpower Group, by allowing companies to shift production where wages are cheaper. “Whether you know it or not, you are competing on a global scale,” Prising says. It could be that workers are content with what they’re earning. Employees will be more willing to settle for small raises if they’re confident inflation will remain low, as it has since the recession of 2007-09. The tortoise-like pace of wage hikes has beaten the snail-like pace of consumer prices by almost 5 percentage points since unemployment peaked at 10 percent in 2009. Alternatively, maybe companies are making do with the workers they have—retraining employees rather than paying top dollar for new recruits and raising pay only for the particular jobs where they need to attract talent. “We have very robust development programs to make sure that we got the right labor at the right time and the right place,” Todd Teske, chief executive officer of Briggs & Stratton Corp., which makes lawnmowers and other products, told analysts in an April earnings call. Then again, maybe the workers simply aren’t worth more money. Output per hour of work has shrunk in four of the past six quarters, according to the BLS. If workers’ productivity is weak, companies may be resisting their wage demands to protect their profit margins, says Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Weak productivity growth isn’t entirely workers’ fault: Companies have chosen to stash profits offshore or return them to shareholders rather than invest in the modern equipment and software that would enable their employees to do their jobs efficiently. Load Error Some economists explain the Phillips curve anomaly by saying there’s more slack in the labor market—and therefore less leverage for workers—than the 4.4 percent unemployment rate indicates. Only 78.6 percent of people age 25-54 are employed, down from 80 percent before the last recession. If workers demanded big wage hikes, employers could try to pull people off the sidelines into the workforce. “The unemployment rate is not measuring the tightness of the labor market in the same way it used to,” says James Diffley, chief regional economist for IHS Markit Ltd., which collaborates with payroll services company Paychex Inc. on an index of small-business jobs. Other economists argue the real problem is that wage growth is being undermeasured. Neil Dutta, head of economics for Renaissance Macro Research, wrote in a May 15 note to clients that the oft-quoted average hourly earnings gauge devised by the BLS may not accurately capture what’s happening in the labor market. It’s true that average hourly earnings growth didn’t accelerate from the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017, but other wage indicators from the BLS did, in some cases dramatically. Hourly compensation, which includes benefits along with wages and salaries, grew 3.9 percent in the 12 months through this year’s first quarter, up from 2.4 percent a year earlier. The wages and salaries measure in the Employment Cost Index rose 2.6 percent, up from 2 percent a year before. “Taking an average of all measures points to underlying wage growth of about 3.0 percent,” Dutta wrote. Consider construction: Desperate for skilled help, builders are showering workers with pay hikes and even signing bonuses, says Joseph Natarelli, a partner and head of the construction practice at Marcum LLC, an accounting and advisory firm. Yet according to the BLS, average hourly earnings in construction rose just 2.1 percent in the year through April. Says Natarelli: “I don’t know where that data is coming from.” Last but not least is the theory that bigger wage increases will begin to appear soon—the forces of supply and demand can’t be denied. Last year, Federal Reserve Board Principal Economist Jeremy Nalewaik released a paper called Non-Linear Phillips Curves With Inflation Regime-Switching. The thrust was that the famous curve has a sharp bend: There’s a wide range of unemployment rates where wage growth is unaffected, but below a certain threshold, wages begin to rise rapidly. “It would be unwise to assume the Phillips curve remains so flat at all levels of the unemployment rate,” Nalewaik wrote. Some members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the rate-setting arm of the Federal Reserve System, seem to be swinging in Nalewaik’s direction. Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who was once a dove on monetary policy—favoring low interest rates—has become a hawk. In a May 10 speech in Vermont, he argued that the jobless rate is on the way to “overshooting”—becoming too low for comfort. He urged three quarter-point hikes in the federal funds rate over the rest of the year, vs. the median projection of two hikes among FOMC voters. Many economists simply don’t believe wage growth will remain modest with unemployment headed toward 4 percent or lower. Says JPMorgan’s Silver: “The logic behind the Phillips curve just makes sense.” The bottom line: Globalization and low inflation may be among the reasons U.S. workers haven’t realized bigger wage gains.

The transaction will make Steward the largest private for-profit hospital operator in the United States with 36 hospitals across ten states, managed care operations in Arizona, Utah and Massachusetts, and projected revenues of almost $8 billion in 2018, the first year of consolidated operations. The merger is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2017, subject to customary regulatory approvals, terms and conditions. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Steward currently operates 18 hospitals and directly employs more than 1,300 multi-specialty physicians in locations across Massachusetts, Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania.

Through this transaction, Steward will operate nearly 7,500 patient beds across ten states with approximately 38,000 employees including more than 1,800 directly employed multi-specialty physicians and several thousand aligned physicians.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.4 percent. Japan's Nikkei shed 1.5 percent, Australian shares lost 1.2 percent and South Korea's KOSPI declined 0.5 percent. Equities in Asia took cues from Wall Street, where the Dow and S&P 500 both sank about 1.8 percent overnight following reports that Trump tried to influence a federal probe. The allegations have not only thrown doubt over the future of the pro-growth policies that Trump promised, but they have raised the possibility he could end up leaving the presidency. A small but growing number of Trump's fellow Republicans called on Wednesday for an independent probe of possible collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russia, and one even mentioned impeachment. The region's shares showed little reaction to news that former FBI chief Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election, although the S&P mini futures were a shade higher while the dollar bounced modestly against the safe-haven yen. The greenback was up 0.25 percent at 111.080 yen after hitting a three-week low of 110.530. It was still down a significant 2 percent on the week. "The appointment appears to be an attempt at tackling the problem early. While it is a bit of good news, further investigations are needed and it still remains to be seen what those could reveal. As such, the markets are still faced with uncertainty," said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. In political developments elsewhere, trouble mounted for Brazilian President Michel Temer, who was recorded discussing payments to silence testimony by a potential witness in the country's biggest-ever graft probe. An exchange-traded fund of Brazilian equities was down more than 8 percent in Tokyo, where it is traded. In currencies, the euro extended its overnight surge to touch $1.1174, its highest since November before pulling back slightly to $1.1154. "There are two implications from the latest developments in Washington, first being the possibility of congressional procedures reaching an impasse and second is the potential of Trump being forced out," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. "But judging by how steeply the dollar has fallen, participants may have already priced in much of the negative news regarding Trump. The dollar could even benefit with the market thinking of post-Trump scenarios." The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was down 0.1 percent at 97.518, not far from a six-month trough of 99.333 reached the previous day. The US currency was hurt as Treasury yields declined significantly with allegations against Trump lowering economic stimulus hopes. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.234 percent after going as low as 2.209 percent overnight, its lowest since April 21. With Treasury yields falling, the gap between US and German government debt yields reached its narrowest in more than six months on Wednesday, as a tumultuous week in Washington contrasted with a sense of improved political stability in Europe.  In commodities, oil prices dipped after settling at a two-week high overnight. An ongoing effort by OPEC to cut production has partially propped up oil but prices remain under pressure from still plentiful supplies. Brent crude slipped 0.25 percent to $52.08 a barrel. Gold hovered near a two-week high thanks to the weaker dollar and the risk aversion gripping the broader markets. Spot gold hit $1,263.02 an ounce, its highest since May 1.

Trading was halted for an hour. The decline washed 26 billion real ($7.7 billion) off the market values of Brazilian Banco Itaú and petroleum giant Petrobras. Read more Brazilian president Temer refuses to resign amid corruption probe “Brazilian stocks and assets and their currency have rallied very strongly up until really today. It's a big pullback, and it at least brings the risk up to the surface again,” said Alliance Bernstein Managing Director of Equity Product Management Eric Sprow, as quoted by Reuters. The Brazilian currency plunged eight percent to 3.38 against the US dollar, the real's lowest level in five months. At the same time, the yield on the country’s 10-year dollar bond swelled almost nearly 53 basis points to a two-month high of five percent. The sharp declines were reportedly triggered by fresh allegations of President Michel Temer's involvement in the unfolding bribery scandal. On Wednesday, local media reported the president had been recorded endorsing the bribery of a key figure in the so-called Lava Jato scandal, which covered big sectors of Brazil’s business and political leadership. Operation Lava Jato is a probe into allegations of corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. President Temer has denied the allegations and refused to resign. #Clashes in #Brazil: Hundreds descend on President #Temer’s HQ in #impeachment protests (VIDEOS) https://t.co/BrQ4M6FbCDpic.twitter.com/ODY68diWzg— RT (@RT_com) May 19, 2017 Economists at UBS Securities and JPMorgan Securities downgraded recommendations on Brazil’s equities to ‘neutral’ amid substantial risks that ambitious pension and labor reforms wouldn’t be immediately implemented. “For the market, it's not a question of whether Temer will be ousted or not. The question is whether it will be quick and for how long reforms will be delayed,” said Thiago Castellan, a trader at Sao Paulo-based Renascenca brokerage.

Eight possible explanations. by Peter Coy @petercoy More stories by Peter Coy May 19, 2017, 5:00 AM EDT From Subscribe Reprints U.S. Jobless Claims Fall 4000 to 232,000 The U.S. economy is behaving mysteriously. Usually wage growth accelerates when the job market is tight: Employers have to pay more to attract and retain workers. But even though the unemployment rate hit a decade low of 4.4 percent in April, average hourly earnings grew just 2.3 percent over the past year—compared with an annual rate of more than 4 percent the last time the jobless rate was this low. What has happened to the historical, and seemingly logical, link between unemployment and wages? A lot of people want to know, including the policymakers at the Federal Reserve, who’d ordinarily be raising interest rates much more than they have to prevent a wage-price inflation spiral. In the absence of a single convincing explanation, here are eight theories. One is that the Phillips curve is effectively dead. In textbooks, wage growth is on the vertical axis and unemployment on the horizontal: The curve goes smoothly down to the right as unemployment rises and wage growth falls. In reality, the correlation has been so inconsistent in recent years that a Phillips curve graph looks more like a Jackson Pollock drip painting or the footprints of a staggering drunk. Steve Forbes, the editor-in-chief of Forbes and former Republican presidential candidate, calls the curve “a quack theorem.” Economists aren’t as quick as Forbes to reject the Phillips curve; it just makes intuitive sense that a tight labor market such as this will eventually push up wages. So some fall back on the explanation that workers’ bargaining power has weakened. The decline of unions is a crucial factor, says Peter Temin, a retired MIT economics professor and author of a new book, The Vanishing Middle Class: Prejudice and Power in a Dual Economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says fewer than 11 percent of wage and salary workers were union members last year, down from 20 percent in 1983. Globalization has also weakened the leverage of American workers, says Jonas Prising, chairman of Manpower Group, by allowing companies to shift production where wages are cheaper. “Whether you know it or not, you are competing on a global scale,” Prising says. It could be that workers are content with what they’re earning. Employees will be more willing to settle for small raises if they’re confident inflation will remain low, as it has since the recession of 2007-09. The tortoise-like pace of wage hikes has beaten the snail-like pace of consumer prices by almost 5 percentage points since unemployment peaked at 10 percent in 2009. Alternatively, maybe companies are making do with the workers they have—retraining employees rather than paying top dollar for new recruits and raising pay only for the particular jobs where they need to attract talent. “We have very robust development programs to make sure that we got the right labor at the right time and the right place,” Todd Teske, chief executive officer of Briggs & Stratton Corp., which makes lawnmowers and other products, told analysts in an April earnings call. Then again, maybe the workers simply aren’t worth more money. Output per hour of work has shrunk in four of the past six quarters, according to the BLS. If workers’ productivity is weak, companies may be resisting their wage demands to protect their profit margins, says Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Weak productivity growth isn’t entirely workers’ fault: Companies have chosen to stash profits offshore or return them to shareholders rather than invest in the modern equipment and software that would enable their employees to do their jobs efficiently. Some economists explain the Phillips curve anomaly by saying there’s more slack in the labor market—and therefore less leverage for workers—than the 4.4 percent unemployment rate indicates. Only 78.6 percent of people age 25-54 are employed, down from 80 percent before the last recession. If workers demanded big wage hikes, employers could try to pull people off the sidelines into the workforce. “The unemployment rate is not measuring the tightness of the labor market in the same way it used to,” says James Diffley, chief regional economist for IHS Markit Ltd., which collaborates with payroll services company Paychex Inc. on an index of small-business jobs. Other economists argue the real problem is that wage growth is being undermeasured. Neil Dutta, head of economics for Renaissance Macro Research, wrote in a May 15 note to clients that the oft-quoted average hourly earnings gauge devised by the BLS may not accurately capture what’s happening in the labor market. It’s true that average hourly earnings growth didn’t accelerate from the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017, but other wage indicators from the BLS did, in some cases dramatically. Hourly compensation, which includes benefits along with wages and salaries, grew 3.9 percent in the 12 months through this year’s first quarter, up from 2.4 percent a year earlier. The wages and salaries measure in the Employment Cost Index rose 2.6 percent, up from 2 percent a year before. “Taking an average of all measures points to underlying wage growth of about 3.0 percent,” Dutta wrote. Consider construction: Desperate for skilled help, builders are showering workers with pay hikes and even signing bonuses, says Joseph Natarelli, a partner and head of the construction practice at Marcum LLC, an accounting and advisory firm. Yet according to the BLS, average hourly earnings in construction rose just 2.1 percent in the year through April. Says Natarelli: “I don’t know where that data is coming from.” Last but not least is the theory that bigger wage increases will begin to appear soon—the forces of supply and demand can’t be denied. Last year, Federal Reserve Board Principal Economist Jeremy Nalewaik released a paper called Non-Linear Phillips Curves With Inflation Regime-Switching. The thrust was that the famous curve has a sharp bend: There’s a wide range of unemployment rates where wage growth is unaffected, but below a certain threshold, wages begin to rise rapidly. “It would be unwise to assume the Phillips curve remains so flat at all levels of the unemployment rate,” Nalewaik wrote. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Some members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the rate-setting arm of the Federal Reserve System, seem to be swinging in Nalewaik’s direction. Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who was once a dove on monetary policy—favoring low interest rates—has become a hawk. In a May 10 speech in Vermont, he argued that the jobless rate is on the way to “overshooting”—becoming too low for comfort. He urged three quarter-point hikes in the federal funds rate over the rest of the year, vs. the median projection of two hikes among FOMC voters. Many economists simply don’t believe wage growth will remain modest with unemployment headed toward 4 percent or lower. Says JPMorgan’s Silver: “The logic behind the Phillips curve just makes sense.” The bottom line: Globalization and low inflation may be among the reasons U.S. workers haven’t realized bigger wage gains.

Sibanye, which was established in 2013 after Gold Fields divested from its ageing South African gold assets, said that the rights offer was fully underwritten and expected to open on Monday, May 29, and close at noon on Friday, June 9. It said shareholders would participate in the rights offer for R11.28 a share at a 60 percent discount on Wednesday’s share price. Sibanye said it planned to publish the results of the rights issue on Monday, June 12, on SENS and in local media on Tuesday, June 13. Share this story Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman Read also: The State of SA Property market revealed It also said shareholders had expressed intent of underwriting the deal. “Gold One, which holds approximately 19.9 percent of Sibanye shares, has expressed in writing to Sibanye its intention to exercise the share rights allocated to it under the terms of the rights offer,” Sibanye said. The miner also said that it had entered into an underwriting agreement with Citigroup Global Markets, HSBC Bank, JP Morgan Securities and Morgan Stanley. Meryl Pick, Gold Fund manager at Old Mutual Equities boutique, said the discount was bigger than expected. “This signals that management is trying hard to ensure that the majority of shareholders take up their rights,” she said. “Given the discount, I would expect most shareholders to follow their rights. "At this point, shareholders who are unhappy with the deal would have reduced their position or sold out entirely,” Pick said. Sibanye announced in December last year that it planned to raise a minimum of $750 million, charging that the transaction would enhance its asset base by adding two low-cost, low-risk, steady state producing platinum group metals mines to its portfolio as well as improve its cash flow. But last month the company changed its tune and said it would raise the amount owing to the stronger rand and spot precious metals prices. It said the capital would be raised taking into consideration its response to feedback from certain shareholders regarding the impact of these on the ability of the company to achieve a more desirable financial leverage ratio. Stillwater is Sibanye’s first foreign asset after it ventured into the platinum industry following its acquisition of Aquarius Platinum and Anglo American Platinum's Rustenburg operation. Sibanye has previously said the Stillwater deal would give it access to a portfolio of low-cost assets with growth potential. Stillwater’s platinum group metals reserves comprise approximately 78 percent palladium, the company said in December.
