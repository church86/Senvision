"It is a view around risks concerning both the ECB and the Bank of Japan next month," Sally Auld, a fixed income and foreign-exchange strategist at JPMorgan, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Tuesday. "We broadly see the U.S. dollar as a range trade for the rest of the year." Auld noted that while JPMorgan's economists expected both the BOJ and the European Central Bank would ease at their policy meetings next month, both central bank decisions posed market risks. "The risks around the calls are not that we're going to get more easing than our economists expect, but that we might actually get less," she said, noting that some central banks may have begun to indicate that unconventional policy measures were nearing the end of the line. "If we were starting to get a sense that these central banks were really starting to worry that there really wasn't much left in the tank, investors are pretty good at extrapolating small changes in policy into big ones and you could see both euro and yen actually do better against the dollar," she said. Auld also noted that she doesn't expect the U.S. Federal Reserve would tighten policy until December, leaving few catalysts to potentially boost the greenback. To be sure, Auld warned about entering into fresh dollar short positions while heading into the Jackson Hole meeting. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's Monetary Policy Symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming will be held later this week. The annual Fed symposium has sometimes been used by Fed chairs to make important policy pronouncements. Fed chief Janet Yellen's speech in Jackson Hole on Friday has been anticipated for weeks, especially after Fed speakers over the past several days suggested the Fed could raise rates as early as September. Rather than shorting the dollar ahead of the conference, Auld tipped selling the Swiss franc against the greenback. "It doesn't really feel like the right thing to be doing ahead of Jackson Hole is to be initiating fresh U.S. dollar shorts," she said, noting that the dollar actually appeared to be currently trading cheaply against some currencies, such as the yen, where traders already have taken short dollar positions. The yen has climbed against the dollar so far this year, with the greenback fetching just 100.27 yen at 12:21 p.m. HK/SIN on Tuesday, compared with levels over 120 yen in January.

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that the agreement with Deutsche Bank and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was signed on Friday, JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing. It resolves claims among the three parties over more than $6bn in securities backed by flawed Washington Mutual mortgages. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has said that he would have demanded a much lower price for Washington Mutual given the unexpected legal costs from that deal and the acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos. The takeovers, done during the crisis, saddled the bank with billions of dollars of litigation and regulatory expenses.

They’re testing systems for exchanging collateral for the trades, signing new legal documents and pursuing regulatory approval for models that could help blunt the cost of compliance, according to lawyers, executives and consultants helping firms meet one of the biggest changes in decades to the swaps market. The hundreds of pages of restrictions taking effect are the result of years of deliberation by regulators around the world after the financial crisis when risk built up directly between traders. Global regulators estimate that the rules could eventually require more than €700 billion (RM3.19 trillion) in cash, government bonds and other forms of collateral to protect against the threat that the default of one trader spreads risk to others and potentially throughout the financial system. “This has been on the horizon for a while, but it was always going to be a challenging timetable and it’s just going to go right to the wire,” Deepak Sitlani, a London-based partner at Linklaters LLP law firm, said in an interview. Global deadline From the US to Japan, swap-dealing divisions of banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc, will have to start complying with the requirements on Sept. 1. In Europe, regulators said they couldn’t meet next month’s global deadline and intend for the rules to take effect early next year, threatening to fracture the market. Regulators in Singapore and Australia said today that they would postpone the requirements. Singapore said the decision would help avoid unintended disruptions to financial markets and takes into account cross-border coordination issues and the level of industry preparedness. Neither country set a new deadline. The Bank for International Settlements puts the size of the over-the-counter derivatives market at US$493 trillion as of the end of last year. US regulators said firms would eventually need about US$315 billion in initial margin to meet the requirements. Buyers and sellers of swaps in the EU market may need at least €200 billion, the bloc’s regulators said this year. The actual cost of financing collateral would be smaller, though the US Federal Reserve has said it could still cost banks billions of dollars. The rules take effect for big banks first and will be phased in for smaller firms. Banks and their clients must exchange variation margin to offset risks during the life of a transaction starting on March 1. ‘Compressed time frame’ “Final regulations from domestic regulators emerged relatively late in the day, in some cases less than six months before the scheduled Sept. 1 start date,” said Scott O’Malia, chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. “Given much of the detailed preparation and implementation couldn’t begin until final rules were published, this has meant a huge amount of complex work has had to be done in a very compressed time frame.” One of the banks’ top priorities ahead of the deadline is to get approval to use a framework developed by ISDA, the industry’s main trade group, for calculating margin requirements instead of the one-size-fits-all method set by regulators. Banks would be able to adjust ISDA’s system, known as the standard initial margin model, to fit their specific situation. ‘Significant multiples’ ISDA has said that it is essential for banks to be able to use models because the amounts of margin required under the regulators’ method are too onerous. The Fed in its final rule said it expected banks to be able to rely on models and that the amount of margin would be US$315 billion rather than the US$3.6 trillion the industry estimated based on the regulatory method. “You could easily be talking about the standardised numbers coming out as being very significant multiples of the SIMM results,” according to Nicholas Newport, managing director in London at InteDelta, a consulting firm that’s working with banks on the requirements. In the US, bank regulators must approve some models before they can be used, while the industry-funded National Futures Association is in charge of reviewing other models. NFA said its reviews could take 90 days and include an on-site exam. The NFA doesn’t plan to disclose its decisions, though firms could tell each other if they’ve won approval. ISDA is drafting standard legal documents for banks to comply with the rules. The rules have forced banks to have legal relationships with counterparties, set up accounts at custody banks where collateral can be deposited and seek opinions from law firms about contractual standards in countries around the world, lawyers said. Parent companies Many banks have multiple divisions that are registered in the US, each of which needs to set up new arrangements. European and Asian banks also have units that are registered in the US and may also need to meet the requirement even if their parent companies are headquartered abroad. “Even between just two dealers, you could have a number of legal entity pairings that require an IM arrangement,” Sitlani said, referring to initial margin. “Multiply that out by the number of dealers subject to the rules and you quickly get to a lot of new agreements that need to be signed up.” AcadiaSoft Inc, a Norwell, Massachusetts-based company owned and backed by the industry runs a system that is designed to help firms automate the process of managing collateral. Thirty financial entities are participating in the system and 700 people across the firms have been working on the project since the beginning of the year, said Chris Walsh, AcadiaSoft’s chief executive. “The infrastructure is in place,” Walsh said in an interview. “But there is still a lot of on-boarding and testing.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Australia’s Crown Resorts casino staff arrested in China Lufthansa pilots’ strike wreaks havoc on flight schedule Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower UK’s Hammond sets target for cyclically-adjusted budget deficit Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

 BOUTIQUE BLOWOUT: 3 tiny firms will make a killing on a $14 billion pharma deal Portia Crowe Aug. 22, 2016, 8:53 AM 6,238 facebook linkedin twitter email print Andrew Burton/Getty Images Pfizer is buying the cancer drugmaker Medivation for $14 billion, and three small banks helped make it happen. Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners advised Pfizer on the deal, while JPMorgan and Evercore advised Medivation. Guggenheim and Centerview are expected to split between $40 million and $50 million in buy-side fees, while JPMorgan and Evercore's combined sell-side fees will be about $50 million to $60 million, according to the consultant Freeman & Co. Guggenheim was founded in 1999 and has since grown to employ about 2,500 people throughout the US, Europe, and Asia. It recently advised St. Jude Medical on its $25 billion sale to Abbott Labs and Verizon on its recent deal for Yahoo. Guggenheim also advised on Pfizer's failed deal for Allergan. Centerview lists 30 partners on its website. It recently advised NBCUniversal on its $3.8 billion deal for DreamWorks and Unilever on its deal for Dollar Shave Club. Centerview had also advised Pfizer on the Allergan deal before that was blocked. Evercore was founded in 1996 by Roger Altman, David Offensend, and Austin Beutner. It lists around 80 senior managing directors in corporate advisory globally on its website. It was the sole adviser to Tesla on its recent deal for SolarCity.

 BOUTIQUE BLOWOUT: 3 tiny firms will make a killing on a $14 billion pharma deal Portia Crowe Aug. 22, 2016, 8:53 AM 6,238 facebook linkedin twitter email print Andrew Burton/Getty Images Pfizer is buying the cancer drugmaker Medivation for $14 billion, and three small banks helped make it happen. Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners advised Pfizer on the deal, while JPMorgan and Evercore advised Medivation. Guggenheim and Centerview are expected to split between $40 million and $50 million in buy-side fees, while JPMorgan and Evercore's combined sell-side fees will be about $50 million to $60 million, according to the consultant Freeman & Co. Guggenheim was founded in 1999 and has since grown to employ about 2,500 people throughout the US, Europe, and Asia. It recently advised St. Jude Medical on its $25 billion sale to Abbott Labs and Verizon on its recent deal for Yahoo. Guggenheim also advised on Pfizer's failed deal for Allergan. Centerview lists 30 partners on its website. It recently advised NBCUniversal on its $3.8 billion deal for DreamWorks and Unilever on its deal for Dollar Shave Club. Centerview had also advised Pfizer on the Allergan deal before that was blocked. Evercore was founded in 1996 by Roger Altman, David Offensend, and Austin Beutner. It lists around 80 senior managing directors in corporate advisory globally on its website. It was the sole adviser to Tesla on its recent deal for SolarCity.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Medivation — Pfizer announced a $14 billion deal to acquire the biotech firm in an all-cash transaction. The deal is worth $81.50 per share and Pfizer expects it to add 5 cents per share to earnings in the first year. CST Brands — The gas station and convenience store operator is being bought by Canada's Couche-Tard in a $4.4 billion deal worth $48.53 per share. Intersil — Intersil is close to being bought by Japan's Renesas Electronics in a $3 billion deal, according to Reuters. A deal for the U.S. based chipmaker could be reached as early as this month. Syngenta — Syngenta's deal to be bought by ChemChina for $43 billion has been cleared by a U.S. national security panel. The pesticides maker said it still expects the deal to be finalized by the end of 2016. Facebook — Facebook shares could rise by more than 20 percent over the next year, according to Barron's. The paper said the boost would come on the strength of growing advertising revenue across Facebook's various platforms. Viacom — Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman has resigned, with Chief Operating Officer Thomas Dooley taking over as interim CEO. Dauman will remain as non-executive chairman through September 13. Volkswagen — Volkswagen will resume contract talks with suppliers today, trying to resolve a dispute that has halted auto production at some of its plants. JPMorgan Chase — The bank will receive $645 million from the estate of Washington Mutual, after settling a dispute with the FDIC arising from its purchase of WaMu during the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan will drop more than $1 billion in claims as a result of the settlement. Valeant Pharmaceuticals — Valeant announced the hiring of Paul Herendeen as chief financial officer, luring him away from animal health company Zoetis. Mattel — Mattel got a favorable mention in this weekend's Barron's, which said the toymaker could return an additional 20 percent to investors, including dividends, as its recent overhaul continues to provide a boost to operations. Rovi — The entertainment-focused data analytics company signed a 10-year patent licensing renewal deal with Dish Network. Discover Financial Services — The credit card issuer announced plans to repurchase an additional $100 million of its common shares between now and June 30, 2017. L Brands — Goldman Sachs upgraded the Victoria's Secret parent to "buy" from "neutral," saying a slump in productivity and profit margins has likely bottomed. Marathon Oil — Chief Financial Officer J.R. Sult is leaving the company for personal reasons, which the energy producer said is unrelated to any disagreement with the company over business matters. Vice President Pat Wagner has been appointed interim CFO while the search for a permanent replacement is conducted. Office Depot — The office supplies retailer announced that CEO Roland Smith plans to retire, but will stay on until a successor is found. The company expects that to occur by the end of the first quarter of 2017 and that Smith will remain as chairman. Questions? Comments?

JPMorgan is also working on a similar project. 花旗集团(Citigroup)正在研究自己的“Citicoin”解决方案，高盛(Goldman Sachs)已经为可以让交易近乎瞬间完成结算的“SETLcoin”申请了专利。摩根大通(JPMorgan)也在推进类似项目。 The utility settlement coin, based on a solution developed by Clearmatics Technologies, aims to let financial institutions pay for securities without waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed. They would use digital coins convertible into cash at central banks. 多功能结算币基于由Clearmatics Technologies研发的一种解决方案，旨在让金融机构无需等待传统转账完成就可以为证券进行支付。他们会在各央行将数字货币转换成现金。 The coins would be stored using the blockchain allowing them to be quickly swapped for the securities being traded. 利用区块链存储的数字货币，可以与被交易的证券迅速实现交换。 “You need a form of digital cash on the distributed ledger in order to get maximum benefit from these technologies,” said Hyder Jaffrey, head of fintech innovation at UBS. He said the project team would aim for a “limited and low risk” commercial launch by early 2018. 瑞银金融科技创新主管海德尔·杰弗里(Hyder Jaffrey)说：“你需要一种分布式账本上的数字货币，才能从这些技术中获得最大效益。”他表示，项目团队的目标是在2018年初投入“有限、低风险”的商用。 The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada are among central banks examining the potential benefits of digital currencies. But concerns include the security and the impact on banking stability. 美联储(Fed)、英国央行(Bank of England)、加拿大央行(Bank of Canada)等央行都在考察数字货币的潜在好处。但各方仍存在对其安全性以及对银行业稳定性影响的担忧。 译者/申凯 相关文章 互联网金融监管的逻辑 比特币发明者“中本聪”真人现身 当金融科技遇到泡沫 相关话题 银行业 关注 互联网金融 关注 虚拟货币 关注 您可能感兴趣的文章 关于我们 加入我们 问题回馈 联系方式 合作伙伴 服务条款 广告业务 版权声明 最新动态 © The Financial Times Ltd 2016 FT and 'Financial Times' are trademarks of The Financial Times Ltd.

On Wall Street, technology companies led the Nasdaq to a record intraday high and robust housing market data strengthened the case for a firming economy. Housing stocks jumped 2 percent <.HGX> after the Commerce Department reported new U.S. single-family home sales unexpectedly soared in July to near nine-year highs. European equities rose 0.9 percent <.STOXX>, led by mining stocks, after data pointed to continuing gradual improvement in the region's economy. Homebuilders there also saw a bounce following a solid update from UK homebuilder Persimmon , which closed 4.2 percent higher and was the biggest riser on the blue-chip FTSE 100 <.FTSE>. The index closed at its highest level since the UK voted to leave the European Union. The housing data helped traders fill the gap as markets await further clues on whether the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates this year, ahead of an annual gathering of global central bankers and a speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Friday in the mountains of Wyoming. "If we continue to keep getting strong economic data it will become hard for the Fed to rationalize not hiking rates," said Erik Wytenus, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Palm Beach Florida. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 29.45 points, or 0.16 percent, to 18,558.87, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 6.01 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,188.65 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 19.21 points, or 0.37 percent, to 5,263.81. Oil prices jumped as much as 2 percent, reversing earlier losses, after Reuters reported that Iran was sending positive signals that it may support joint OPEC action to prop up the market. Brent crude settled up 80 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $49.96 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 69 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $48.10. The bump in new home sales helped the U.S. dollar trim losses, though the greenback was still down 0.02 percent to 94.54 against a basket of major currencies <.DXY>. New Zealand's dollar, meanwhile, was up 0.47 percent at $0.7302 after the country's central bank forecast another 35 basis points in possible rate cuts, less than many investors had wagered on. "The (U.S.) dollar is weakening ... due to the general anticipation around Jackson Hole on Friday," said Saxo bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy. "There is also a general reach for yield happening. That was one of the things we saw with (New Zealand central bank governor) Wheeler waving the white flag that he is not going to use easing to try and weaken the currency." In focus later on Tuesday, will be the first of this week's reports on U.S. inventories, which analysts expect will show a decline in crude and gasoline stocks.

By Dyan Machan Biography January 12, 2013 In a cold November rain, David Cote and his youngest brother Bruce stood facing a U-Haul truck stuck in the mud up to its axle on a rural New Hampshire road. Cote was 23 years old, and his brother was 16. They'd been clearing the brush from their family's property to haul it away. "It was freezing, I was hungry, and the job was impossible," recalls Bruce. He begged his brother to call a tow truck, to no avail. After hours of lurching backward and forward, inches at a time, they finally got the truck out of the mud. Jump ahead 37 years, and David Cote (pronounced Coty) is exhibiting the same kind of stubbornness and persistence in dealing with another kind of ditch. As a member of the steering committee of the Fix the Debt coalition, Cote is the public face of the organization's 140 corporate chieftains. A Republican with close ties to the Obama administration, he has taken the lead to coax Congress out of its political mud and the country out of a $16.4 trillion ditch. "He's all in," says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group affiliated with Fix the Debt. Enlarge Image Close "Running a company is a hell of a lot more rewarding" than working with politicians, Cote says. Gary Spector for Barron's So far, Cote isn't happy with the results. The year-end fiscal-cliff deal was light-years away from the $4 trillion debt-reduction plan that he had argued for. Though frustrated, Cote is keeping the heat on Washington. "It's so painfully difficult to get anything done," he says, "Running a company is a hell of a lot more rewarding."

For 2012, the company is expected to report record earnings of $3.5 billion, or $4.47 a share, on revenue of $37.5 billion. That's up from a loss of $220 million on $22.3 billion in revenue in 2002, the year Cote took over Honeywell, then rife with infighting following an ill-conceived 1999 merger with AlliedSignal. "It was just a mess," Cote says. Since arriving at the company, Cote personally has overseen the acquisition and integration of 70 companies and the sale of 50 units. He prefers small acquisitions to splashy big swings, which he says are often trouble because they get done for the wrong reason. "Dave's quick to spot the risk, where to put the investment dollars, and find the returns," says Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Cote sits on the board of the big bank. COTE HAS BEEN CREDITED WITH slowly moving Honeywell away from the defense business in advance of the military downsizing. What he has gleaned from his Capitol Hill exploits hasn't hurt here, although he calls such insight "minimal." Indeed, he's been preaching the vulnerabilities of the Defense Department budget for eight years. "I knew eventually I'd be right," he says with a smile. Honeywell's defense-space group accounts for 13% of sales, down from 17% in 2003. Shifting from defense aviation to commercial hasn't been disruptive, as the two groups share research and development and plant facilities. Cote calls it "survival of the most flexible." Since 2002, Honeywell has increased its labor force 22%, to 132,000, while sales are up 69%. Keeping costs lean has helped him generate operating leverage to boost earnings. The critical tool he helped develop and has been employing is the Honeywell Operating System, based on Toyota's manufacturing processes. Thirty percent of the plants still are slated for the improvements that will increase their productivity and fatten Honeywell's margins. "There is still runway," he says. On Cote's watch, Honeywell's shares have nearly tripled, to $66, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 62% in the same period. Investors have rewarded Honeywell for the smoother cycles and earnings predictability that Cote's decade-long turnaround efforts have forged, says analyst Nicholas Heymann of William Blair. But Cote isn't happy. The stock trades at 13.6 times year-ahead earnings estimates, a small premium to its group. For years, it traded at a 5% discount. Cote suspects the discount is an overhang from Honeywell's problem years.

"There certainly seems to be room for another," he says. POP MUSIC AND HIP-HOP blare throughout David Cote's office at Honeywell's Morristown, N.J., headquarters. Round Here by Counting Crows and Not Afraid by Eminem are just two of the songs in rotation among the 10,783 songs on his iPod. His desk is littered with books, magazine articles and company reports, and Boston team sports jerseys are draped nearby. A baseball given to him by Bobby Valentine, former manager of the Boston Red Sox, sits on top of a cardboard box stuffed with manila folders, and the office shelves are crammed with ribbons, bottle caps, skipping stones from New Zealand—items that boys collect. When a visitor inspects them for dust, Cote says, "I doubt they do much around here," indicating the cleaning staff has given up on him. Cote says he feels uncomfortable when it's quiet, perhaps a throwback to growing up in a boisterous house with two brothers and two sisters. He wears an open-collar, greenish-grey silk shirt tucked into jeans, and casual Mephisto shoes—normal work attire—and looks modestly uncomfortable in a suit. Another thing he often wears: a smile that can spread to cover his face. Honeywell's CEO grew up in a French-Canadian enclave of Suncook, N.H., a mill town about 30 miles north of Nashua. His father worked 12-hour days, six days a week, running a garage, while his mother managed five rambunctious children. Cote speaks with an undisguised New England accent—"idea" comes out as "i-dee-yer"—and wears his working-class roots proudly, although not deliberately. "He is authentic," says Mark Huddleston, president of the University of New Hampshire. For that reason, Huddleston couldn't envision Cote as a politician: "Politicians must construct different personas. He doesn't have the patience for that." An indifferent student who took six years to graduate from UNH, Cote delivered the university's 2011 commencement address. One highlight: "The greatest learning occurs where you're uncomfortable because you don't know it all. Push yourself. Be willing to take a chance. Don't wait for approval or perfect knowledge." "He's the classic case of the C student managing the A students," Huddleston says.

When he graduated from high school in 1970, he drifted, washing cars and pounding nails until he grew tired of it. He had passed up the deadlines for enrolling in UNH but browbeat an admissions officer until he was let in. At college he was branded a troublemaker. He once started a snowball fight that involved hundreds, he says. Cote was asked to move off campus. Soon he would move way off campus, when he took a break from school to buy a 33-foot fishing boat. For a year he was a cod fisherman in Maine, another exercise in how not to get ahead. Being married and expecting his first child is what pushed him forward. "It scared the bejesus out of me," he says. He and his first wife were living in a third-floor apartment "where you could see wind come through the rinky-dink drapes," he recalls. Cote completed his degree while working as a night-shift laborer at a General Electric engine plant. After graduation in 1976, he became an auditor and later a financial analyst for the engine division. What he found shocking about corporate life is how much he liked it. He found enormous pleasure in setting goals and achieving results. But no one led the way for him. Cote recalls a meeting in 1983, when he mentioned to a GE executive that he wanted to be a general manager. The executive laughed, and according to Cote, said, " 'Come on, be serious, what do you really want to do some day?' " "A number of times. I've been underestimated," Cote says. He kept asking for new jobs and rose steadily in manufacturing, marketing, planning, and general management in GE's consumer-electronics, jet engines, and plastics divisions. "I always said, 'Look, I'm willing to do it, and if I can't do it, I'm willing to take the chance that you'll fire me.' " Cote sensed his capability in the way his suggestions were implemented by those above him. It wasn't until he was nearly 40 that he started aiming for a chief-executive role. In 1996, he was made CEO of the $6 billion GE Appliances group. But when he knew he wasn't in the running for retiring chief Jack Welch's position, he took a job in 1999 at Cleveland's TRW, an industrial manufacturer, with the understanding that he would become CEO. The job and Cote's ascension to CEO at TRW were what he calls "an unpleasant process" and the kind of learning experience one hopes never to have. Cote was the fourth potential successor brought in to replace a CEO who didn't want to leave. The other three had been fired. Ultimately, the CEO stepped down in 2001 but not before he made Cote's life miserable. "You know he is trying to kill you," he says. "It was very unpleasant just to constantly be dealing with that." AFTER TWO AND A HALF YEARS at TRW, he was recruited as Honeywell's CEO in 2002. Though the company lost $220 million that year, Cote saw the opportunity to execute his own vision assembling great businesses in industries that are expected to grow steadily at 4% to 6% percent a year. Cote got the warring factions speaking again, settled long-time asbestos claims, and introduced a Toyota-inspired operating system. In 2002, he started going to Washington so that lawmakers knew what Honeywell had to offer. Ultimately, part of what Honeywell had to offer was Cote. His involvement stepped up when he was invited as one of a small group of CEOs to meet the newly elected president in 2009. Barack Obama named him to the Simpson-Bowles deficit-cutting commission in 2010. Cote's name has been mentioned for a possible cabinet post, including commerce secretary. But he says he's happy where he is. "I like what I'm doing; I like it a lot," he says, "Here, I can be relatively assured people will listen."

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) America's economy has a problem: Workers just aren't producing as much as they once did. Some blame social media. Employees might feel like they're toiling away at the office, but if they are tweeting and Facebook messaging their friends, that's not doing much to boost the economy. "What do we produce? We just go around and text each other," Carl Icahn, a prominent hedge fund manager and supporter of Donald Trump, told CNN. Whatever the reason, Americans aren't working harder, and it's holding the U.S. economy back. Output per American worker (know as "worker productivity") is at its lowest level since the 1970s, according to government data. Throughout the 1990s, worker productivity shot up by 2.2% a year, on average. In the early 2000s, it went up a brisk 2.6% a year. Since the Great Recession, it's been crawling along at barely more than 1% a year, on average. Now it's getting worse. The latest reading came in at negative 0.5% for the period between April and June. (Yes, that means American workers were less productive this spring than a year ago). Economists agree: The U.S. is in an alarming productivity slump, and it's not clear how to fix it. The two most popular solutions are: Get businesses to invest in better equipment or revise the productivity statistics to take into account the benefits of the smartphone economy. Businesses aren't investing "The most important issue is a lack of investment spending," says David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan. Companies are sitting on near record levels of cash. In a healthy economy, businesses typically spend money on new factories, tools and research. That's not happening. Businesses are either hording cash in their bank accounts or using it to buy back stock. Those activities do little to help the economy. "You have to give each more worker tools" to be productive, says Kelly. Productivity boomed in the 1990s and early 2000s because businesses were investing in technology to improve factories and processes. The same worker could suddenly make a lot more gadgets or serve more people. Today there are lots of reasons businesses are holding back on spending. Some blame the U.S. election. Sixty-two percent of business economists surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics this summer said "uncertainty about the national election" is holding back growth, mostly because companies are hesitant to invest for the future. Blame regulations and the Federal Reserve? Other experts point to regulations. "Part of the reason is surely increased regulatory compliance cost," says economist Bill Watkins of California Lutheran University. "Increased regulatory burden translates to more hours [worked] with no positive impact on output." Then there's the Federal Reserve. America's central bank has kept interest rates extremely low -- barely above 0% -- since the crisis in 2008. In theory, that should have made businesses want to borrow money and go spend it on new projects. But it may have backfired. Stocks and bonds have surged since the Fed cut rates to historic lows. Economists believe that companies preferred to put money in the markets than factories. "Money has been diverted away from the types of investment spending which tends to enhance productivity," says Kelly of JPMorgan. The productivity data my be flawed The final theory is that perhaps American workers are working harder, but the government statistics are flawed. It's easy to calculate how productive a worker in a factory is each hour. It's harder to judge output per worker per hour for someone who's job involves social media. As investment firm AllianceBernstein noted in a recent research report, the vast majority of new jobs in America are in the service sector, not manufacturing. It's harder to measure service jobs. Call it the iPhone dilemma. Apple's first one debuted in 2007, the same year U.S. productivity started to really fall. "I can do things with my smartphone that my parents' generation couldn't have dreamed of," says Kelly. "But the advent of the smartphone has hardly shown up at all in terms of increased output." © Distributed by LAKANA. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter Treasury 10-year notes are stuck in their tightest monthly trading range in a decade as investors await Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s speech on Friday for clues to the path of interest rates. The yield hasn’t closed above 1.6 percent since June 23, the day the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. Investors turned even more neutral on Treasuries in the week ended Aug. 22, with both long and short positions declining, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. survey showed. "It’s the boring part ahead of Yellen," said David Keeble, New York-based head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole SA. "The Fed can control the short end to some extent --that control has lessened with each promise they’ll hike which hasn’t been fulfilled. But if Yellen does give a firm signal we’ll get a rate hike fairly soon, perhaps September or December, we’ll definitely react.” The Fed chief is scheduled to speak at an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 26, at a time when Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer and other Fed colleagues have stated that interest rates may still rise in 2016. Fed officials are trying to balance their desire to hike this year, following liftoff from near zero in December, with longer-term concerns that slowing global growth may prevent the policy rate from rising to levels seen in previous economic cycles. The Treasury 10-year note yield was little changed at 1.55 percent as of 5 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.5 percent security due in August 2026 was 99 18/32. The yield has been in a range of 15 basis points this month, the narrowest on a closing-price basis since February 2006. Fed Outlook There’s about a 54 percent chance the Fed will increase rates this year, up from a 36 percent probability seen at the end of July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on fed fund futures. “It’s a wait-and-see kind of mode for Treasuries,” said Orlando Green, a rates strategist at Credit Agricole SA’s corporate and investment-banking unit in London. The 1.60 percent level for 10-year yields “seems to be an area where the market can’t seem to break through,” he said. “It may need something a little bit stronger from Yellen.” The U.S. on Tuesday sold $26 billion in two-year debt, the coupon securities most sensitive to Fed policy, in the first of three fixed-rate note sales this week. The August 2018 notes yielded 0.76 percent, in line with the 0.76 percent yield at the previous two-year debt sale July 25. The Treasury will sell $34 billion of five-year securities on Wednesday and $28 billion of seven-year debt a day later, in addition to a $13 billion offering of two-year floating-rate notes Wednesday.

Operation Homefront has awarded over 550 homes to military families nationwide, including 380 donated by JPMorgan Chase, the organization that donated a mortgage-free home to the Uptain family. The Uptain family received a recently renovated home on August 16 in the Cahaba Cove neighborhood, for Sergeant Joshua Uptain, his wife Anna, and their three children to live in. Photo by Megan Miller Operation Homefront created the Homes on the Homefront program with the assistance of corporate partners to award mortgage-free homes to veterans and military families. After serving in the Army for seven years, Joshua said he’s excited for his children to have a place to play, call home and make friends. “My daughter has been in four schools in four years,” Joshua said. “People always talk about how soldiers are the brave ones, but they’re not, it’s the kids, because they have to pick up and move all the time.” Joshua and his wife Anna both agree they are also excited for the kids to be able to attend Trussville City Schools. “We’re excited about the school system,” Joshua said. “It’s a very good area to be living in.” Although the house was the primary reason the family has moved to Trussville, Anna also got a job in the area, and said she’s glad to be only five minutes from work each day. Anna and Joshua are also both looking forward to being closer to family. Operation Homefront reviews applications to award homes to families that are currently serving in the military, including active and inactive National Guard and Reserve, or honorably discharged. Applicants must not already own a home, must be committed to living in the home as a primary residence for a period of at least two years and must be financially capable of maintaining the home during the transition period and beyond. ‹ Previous Next › Comments Doris Franklin says: August 23, 2016 at 6:31 pm what a great story!

Business Home LBoard Family cremates wrong body after hospital mix-up FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Stressed pension funds urge UK to sell more inflation-proof debt Reuters | August 23, 2016 LONDON: Pension funds are pushing the British government to issue more index-linked bonds to insulate them from inflation and help cope with worrisome accounting deficits that have intensified since Britain voted in June to leave the European Union. The UK’s Debt Management Office said on Tuesday that its latest consultations with the investors meant it would sell at least one index-linked bond through syndication and two in regular auctions during the third quarter of this year. Since the Brexit vote, sterling has plunged, leading many analysts to raise their forecasts for inflation. At the same time, the Bank of England has cut interest rates and re-opened its bond-buying programme, causing gilt yields to plummet – exacerbating long-running funding gaps at pension funds. Ratings firm Fitch on Tuesday warned that the Brexit vote is near-term negative for UK pensions, and that it expects pension deficits to deteriorate further in 2016. “Pension funds have to hedge inflation risk as around 70-80 percent of the liabilities are inflation-linked: the main means by which you do that is the index-linked gilt market so there’s enormous demand,” said Jonathan Crowther, head of liability driven investment at AXA Investment Managers. The Bank of England recently raised its inflation forecasts after sterling’s fall, predicting it will reach 2.4 percent in 2018 and 2019. “Many pension funds are struggling to stabilise their balance sheets – you can see that reflected in the real yields on long-dated inflation-linked gilts. More issuance would certainly provide some relief,” said Sorca Kelly-Scholte, head of pensions solutions and advisory EMEA, JP Morgan Asset Management. The real yield on inflation-linked gilts has fallen across the curve in recent weeks: a November 2065 inflation-linked bond, for example, has dropped 57 basis points to minus 1.67 percent since June 23, according to Thomson Reuters data. The available stock of inflation-linked bonds is just 396.5 billion pounds, according to the UK’s debt management office, compared with 1.1 trillion pounds of conventional gilts. Review hope “The industry has lobbied successive governments for years to issue more inflation-linked bonds with little success. However, the very stringent (deficit) restrictions put in place by the previous chancellor seem to have been eased,” said John Walbaum, head of investment at Hymans Robertson, a consultancy. Former finance minister George Osborne was aiming for a fiscal surplus by 2020. But after the cabinet posts changed following the EU referendum, the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, said that fiscal policies could be reset if necessary. The UK’s Debt Management Office already has fixed issuance plans for the year, said a spokesman. “But the plan can get revised at the Autumn statement and we do have some flexibility within the remit to respond to high quality demand for a particular instrument,” the DMO official said, referring to the statement made by the UK finance minister every year to update parliament on taxation and spending plans. Ongoing Issue Pension schemes have been grappling with a mismatch between assets and liabilities for several years now. Hymans Roberston said the combined deficit of UK Defined Benefit schemes – the difference between the cost of insuring liabilities and the value of the pension scheme assets – has hit 1 trillion pounds. This is a huge increase from the 885 billion pounds at the start of August. “While this imbalance exists, it remains expensive for schemes to hedge to protect against higher inflation, and there are risks of similar situations such as BHS and Tata if another company goes insolvent,” said Walbaum. British high street retailer BHS went insolvent earlier this year. The firm’s pension scheme, which has 20,000 members and a deficit of 571 million pounds, was unable to meet obligations and had to be taken on by Pension Protection Fund, a “lifeboat” scheme paid for by a compulsory annual levy on all British pension schemes.
