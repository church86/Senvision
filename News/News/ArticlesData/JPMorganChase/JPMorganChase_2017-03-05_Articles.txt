ETF Trends publisher Tom Lydon spoke with Julian DelSignore, Executive Director and Head of ETF Distribution at JP Morgan, at the Inside ETFs conference that ran Jan. 22-25, 2017 to talk about what financial advisors are looking for in the markets today. “We were consistently hearing what [advisors] were looking for were products and investments solutions that help manage volatility and increase diversification among their portfolios,” DelSignore said. Consequently, J.P. Morgan has approached the multi-factor ETF space to meet the increased demand for this targeted volatility strategy among financial advisors. DelSignore pointed out that J.P. Morgan’s multi-factor ETFs help solve for that “volatility problem, help keep their clients invested, despite volatility that we certainly did experience and will continue to experience, moving into 2017.” J.P. Morgan offers a suite of Diversified Return Equity ETFs, including the JPMorgan Diversified Return Emerging Markets Equity ETF (NYSEArca: JPEM), JPMorgan Diversified Return Global Equity ETF (NYSEArca: JPGE), JPMorgan Diversified Return US Equity ETF (NYSEArca: JPUS), JPMorgan Diversified Return Europe Equity ETF (NYSEArca: JPEU), JPMorgan Diversified Return Europe Currency Hedged Equity ETF (NYSEArca: JPEH), JPMorgan Diversified Return International Equity ETF (NYSEArca: JPIN) and JPMorgan Diversified Return International Currency Hedged Equity (NYSEArca: JPIH). DelSignore also explained that these multi-factor ETFs provide advisors and investors direct access to hedge fund exposure inside an ETF vehicle. The underlying indices diversify risks that are less likely to be rewarded while overweighting areas that are more likely to be rewarded. The underlying customized FTSE Russell index selects components based on a diversified set of factor characteristics, such as relative valuation, price momentum and quality. The enhanced indexing process would allow the ETFs to exclude expensive, low quality companies with poor momentum, which could help the ETFs diminish drawdowns without sacrificing too much from any potential upside of a market recovery. The multi-factor process has “served to be a really nice volatility dampener for advisors as they’re trying to keep clients invested,” DelSignore said. “We take it that one step further and advisors talking to us about diversification needs; we’ve actually been able to really leverage the research at J.P. Morgan and take, essentially, our hedge fund strategy into an ETF structure.” You might also like: A Closer Look at the Dividend Growth ETF Strategy The Power of Active Bond ETFs in 2017 Fed No Longer in Driver Seat for Economic Growth Under Trump Administration A Smart Beta Bond ETF Strategy in a Rising Rate Environment Post Comment Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The lender may lease 50,000 square feet (4,645 square metres) to 150,000 square feet of space and wants flexibility from landlords to shrink or expand depending on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, some of the people said, asking not to be named because the plans aren’t public. That amount of space would be enough for several hundred employees. "Other options are still very much on the table," the bank said in a statement. "We want to see how negotiations progress. No final decisions have been made." UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to pull Britain out of the single market has prompted international banks to begin looking to move jobs to the continent. London could lose 10,000 banking jobs and 20,000 roles in financial services as clients move 1.8 trillion euros ($1.9 trillion) of assets to the continent after Brexit is completed, according to think tank Bruegel. Other estimates range from as much as 232,000 jobs to as few as 4,000. Before the June 23 referendum Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told UK staff that as many as 4,000 of them could be relocated in the event of Brexit. In January, he said that number could be even higher — or lower — depending on how the government’s negotiations played out. Frankfurt and Dublin are emerging as the favored destinations for banks preparing to flee London after Brexit. Standard Chartered and Barclays are considering the Irish capital for their EU base while Goldman Sachs Group, and Morgan Stanley are weighing Frankfurt. JPMorgan already has subsidiary units in Ireland and Germany with broker/dealer licences. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:50 AM, March 7, 2017 LONDON - A spate of big deals by financial services companies in Europe could earn investment banks an estimated $332 million in advisory fees, with Goldman Sachs <GS.N> set to take the lion's share of the pot. In the past two days, Standard Life <SL.L> revealed plans to buy Aberdeen Asset Management <ADN.L> and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> said it would raise 8 billion euros ($8.48 billion) from investors, potentially generating a big payday for investment banks working on those transactions. Earlier, British bank Shawbrook Group <SHAW.L> said it had received a $1 billion bid from two private equity firms. Goldman Sachs, which secured a major role in all three deals, has pocketed the highest fees from investment banking in the first two months of 2017 and pushing usual top dog JPMorgan <JPM.N> into third place. The U.S. bank could earn between $18 and $24 million for advising Standard Life while an additional $13 to $18 million could come from its advisory work with Shawbrook, according to estimates from Freeman Consulting. Aberdeen's corporate brokers, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse <CSGN.S>, which advised the Scottish asset manager on its sale, could share proceeds of between $23 and 30 million. But the biggest boost to investment banks' fees will come from Deutsche Bank's 8 billion euro share sale which could pay advisers up to 260 million euros, according to Freeman Consulting, based on underwriting fees of between 2 and 3.25 percent of the total raised. Goldman Sachs is one of eight banks underwriting Deutsche's the rights issue alongside Credit Suisse, Barclays <BARC.L>, BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, Commerzbank <CBKG.DE>, HSBC <HSBA.L>, Morgan Stanley <MS.N> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI>. The German bank will also pay more fees to a pool of banks underwriting the public offering of part of its asset management business, estimated at between 2.75 and 3.5 percent of the amount of money raised, according to Freeman. Appetite for big takeovers and fundraising deals in the financial services industry remains strong even if some have run up against regulatory and political hurdles. The long-awaited 29 billion euro merger of the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> with German rival Deutsche Boerse <DB1Gn.DE> was expected to pay a combined $184 million in advisory fees. But this deal is hanging by a thread after LSE turned down demands from European antitrust regulators to sell a trading platform in Italy. Since the start of the year, nearly $10 billion of financial services takeover deals have been announced in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), with Britain accounting for almost half of the value, according to Thomson Reuters data. Equity capital markets deals across EMEA have almost doubled since the start of the year, with $36.7 billion of equity fundraisings since January compared with $21.3 billion in the same period last year. Italy's biggest bank UniCredit, which tapped investors in February, is expected to pay about $450 million to Goldman Sachs and other banks who worked on its 13 billion euro share sale, according to Freeman Consulting.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search JPMorgan Joins Growing List Of U.S. Banks Calling For A Big Stock Pullback March 6, 2017 11:06am NYSE:IVV ShareTweet From Tyler Durden: First it was Goldman, then Citigroup, now, completing the trifecta of suddenly bearish big banks is JPMorgan, whose US equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas writes that while the fundamental backdrop remains supporting, the “short-term downside risk” in the S&P is increasing. JPM released the note after the S&P hit the bank’s year end price target of 2,400. Unlike Bank of America, JPM has not rushed to raise it year-end bogey, yet. As JPM writes, the S&P 500 reached the bank’s price target of 2,400 last week. The market is up 11% since the US election driven by intra-cycle expansion, pro-business agenda of the new administration, and improving sentiment. Despite the challenging path forward for fiscal legislation with passage and efficacy far from certain, business and investor confidence is high. It is increasingly evident that the market has been pricing in pro-growth policy reforms. The beneficiaries of corporate tax reform (JPAMTAXP +16% vs S&P 500 +11%), deregulation (JPAMDREG +24%), and infrastructure spending (JPAMINFR +24%) have significantly outperformed since the US election. At the same time, the largest US importers (JPAMIMPR +3%) and companies sensitive to wages (JPAMWAGE +3%) have underperformed. Over the medium-term, progrowth policy reforms and solid fundamentals should likely result in higher equity values. However, the Croatian strategist notes, “in the near-term we see increasing risk of a sell-off due to more hawkish Fed rhetoric at a time when investor positioning is stretched and equity volatility is likely to rise from low levels.” Some more details on JPM’s bearish warning: Downside risk in the short-term? Hedge Fund exposure to equities is approaching record levels as Macro and Long/Short Equity funds each exhibit ~95th percentile beta to equities (see Figure 1). Short positions across stocks, ETFs and equity futures remain near 10-year lows (see Figure 2). Low sector and equity correlations as well as option dynamics have suppressed equity volatility in recent weeks. A decrease in either of these drivers would result in higher equity volatility, leading systematic strategies to reduce their elevated equity exposures. Additionally, the recent hawkish shift by the Fed (March hike probability spiked to 96% from 40% in the last week) could pressure the already high S&P 500 equity multiple of 18.6x (based on our 2017 policy-neutral $128 EPS estimate). So sell in March and go away? Not exactly, more like wait for the dip and buy it aggressively, as the “Medium-term equities likely remain supported by: (1) continued expansion in JPM business cycle indicators (QMI) domestically and abroad (see page 4); (2) solid fundamental backdrop reinforced by encouraging 4Q results and earnings guidance (see pages 5-6); (3) likelihood of pro-growth policy reforms, which we estimate could add an additional ~$8 to S&P 500 EPS.” And while JPM has yet to revise its year end target higher, following the anticipated near-term swoon, the bank’s chief strategist hints that such a move may be coming: Encouraging corporate guidance and consensus earnings trend reinforce our 2017 policy-neutral S&P 500 EPS target of $128. 4Q16 earnings season delivered a record-high S&P 500 EPS of $31.37 (+6.3% y/y vs. +4.6% est.) on 4% revenue growth and better than expected margin expansion (10.4% actual vs. 10.2% estimate). Additionally, we came away from this earnings season incrementally more constructive on growth based on guidance. While guidance and earnings revisions are typically negative at beginning of the year, the adjustment this year has been minor compared to recent years. In particular, corporate guidance was the best in last five years, providing little reason for the Street to aggressively revise down estimates (2017E EPS is down only 1.2% YTD vs. ~5% during prior two years). This activity supports our view for high-single-digit EPS growth this year driven by mid-single-digit organic sales growth, some margin expansion (improving operating leverage and expense rationalization), and continued share repurchases. For now, the market remains remarkably resilient to ay and all such warnings, and in fact continues to propel higher despite increasingly vocal cautions by some of the most prominent sellside strategists. The iShares S&P 500 Index ETF (NYSE:IVV) was trading at $238.58 per share on Monday morning, down $1.39 (-0.58%). Year-to-date, IVV has gained 6.04%, versus a 6.07% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Goldman Sachs is one of eight banks underwriting Deutsche's the rights issue alongside Credit Suisse, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and UniCredit. The German bank will also pay more fees to a pool of banks underwriting the public offering of part of its asset management business, estimated at between 2.75 and 3.5 percent of the amount of money raised, according to Freeman. Appetite for big takeovers and fundraising deals in the financial services industry remains strong even if some have run up against regulatory and political hurdles. The long-awaited 29 billion euro merger of the London Stock Exchange with German rival Deutsche Boerse was expected to pay a combined $184 million in advisory fees. But this deal is hanging by a thread after LSE turned down demands from European antitrust regulators to sell a trading platform in Italy. Since the start of the year, nearly $10 billion of financial services takeover deals have been announced in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), with Britain accounting for almost half of the value, according to Thomson Reuters data. Equity capital markets deals across EMEA have almost doubled since the start of the year, with $36.7 billion of equity fundraisings since January compared with $21.3 billion in the same period last year. Italy's biggest bank UniCredit, which tapped investors in February, is expected to pay about $450 million to Goldman Sachs and other banks who worked on its 13 billion euro share sale, according to Freeman Consulting.

The program, called COIN, for Contract Intelligence, does the mind-numbing job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went online in June, consumed 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation. Attendees discuss software on Feb. 27, the eve of JPMorgan’s Investor Day. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg While the financial industry has long touted its technological innovations, a new era of automation is now in overdrive as cheap computing power converges with fears of losing customers to startups. Made possible by investments in machine learning and a new private cloud network, COIN is just the start for the biggest U.S. bank. The firm recently set up technology hubs for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue, while reducing expenses and risks. The push to automate mundane tasks and create new tools for bankers and clients -- a growing part of the firm’s $9.6 billion technology budget -- is a core theme as the company hosts its annual investor day on Tuesday. Behind the strategy, overseen by Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames and Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy, is an undercurrent of anxiety: Though JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as one of few big winners, its dominance is at risk unless it aggressively pursues new technologies, according to interviews with a half-dozen bank executives. Redundant Software That was the message Zames had for Deasy when he joined the firm from BP Plc in late 2013. The New York-based bank’s internal systems, an amalgam from decades of mergers, had too many redundant software programs that didn’t work together seamlessly. “Matt said, ‘Remember one thing above all else: We absolutely need to be the leaders in technology across financial services,’” Deasy said last week in an interview. “Everything we’ve done from that day forward stems from that meeting.” A QuickTake explainer on fintech The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up After visiting companies including Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. three years ago to understand how their developers worked, the bank set out to create its own computing cloud called Gaia that went online last year. Machine learning and big-data efforts now reside on the private platform, which effectively has limitless capacity to support their thirst for processing power. The system already is helping the bank automate some coding activities and making its 20,000 developers more productive, saving money, Zames said. When needed, the firm can also tap into outside cloud services from Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. Tech Spending JPMorgan will make some of its cloud-backed technology available to institutional clients later this year, allowing firms like BlackRock Inc. to access balances, research and trading tools. The move, which lets clients bypass salespeople and support staff for routine information, is similar to one Goldman Sachs Group Inc. announced in 2015. JPMorgan’s total technology budget for this year amounts to 9 percent of its projected revenue -- double the industry average, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck. The dollar figure has inched higher as JPMorgan bolsters cyber defenses after a 2014 data breach, which exposed the information of 83 million customers. “We have invested heavily in technology and marketing -- and we are seeing strong returns,” JPMorgan said in a presentation Tuesday ahead of its investor day, noting that technology spending in its consumer bank totaled about $1 billion over the past two years. Attendees inspect JPMorgan Markets software kiosk for Investors Day. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg One-third of the company’s budget is for new initiatives, a figure Zames wants to take to 40 percent in a few years. He expects savings from automation and retiring old technology will let him plow even more money into new innovations. Not all of those bets, which include several projects based on a distributed ledger, like blockchain, will pay off, which JPMorgan says is OK. One example executives are fond of mentioning: The firm built an electronic platform to help trade credit-default swaps that sits unused. ‘Can’t Wait’ “We’re willing to invest to stay ahead of the curve, even if in the final analysis some of that money will go to product or a service that wasn’t needed,” Marianne Lake, the lender’s finance chief, told a conference audience in June. That’s “because we can’t wait to know what the outcome, the endgame, really looks like, because the environment is moving so fast.” As for COIN, the program has helped JPMorgan cut down on loan-servicing mistakes, most of which stemmed from human error in interpreting 12,000 new wholesale contracts per year, according to its designers. JPMorgan is scouring for more ways to deploy the technology, which learns by ingesting data to identify patterns and relationships. The bank plans to use it for other types of complex legal filings like credit-default swaps and custody agreements. Someday, the firm may use it to help interpret regulations and analyze corporate communications. Another program called X-Connect, which went into use in January, examines e-mails to help employees find colleagues who have the closest relationships with potential prospects and can arrange introductions. Creating Bots For simpler tasks, the bank has created bots to perform functions like granting access to software systems and responding to IT requests, such as resetting an employee’s password, Zames said. Bots are expected to handle 1.7 million access requests this year, doing the work of 140 people. Matt Zames Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg While growing numbers of people in the industry worry such advancements might someday take their jobs, many Wall Street personnel are more focused on benefits. A survey of more than 3,200 financial professionals by recruiting firm Options Group last year found a majority expect new technology will improve their careers, for example by improving workplace performance. Click here for Options Group’s survey on technology’s impact “Anything where you have back-office operations and humans kind of moving information from point A to point B that’s not automated is ripe for that,” Deasy said. “People always talk about this stuff as displacement. I talk about it as freeing people to work on higher-value things, which is why it’s such a terrific opportunity for the firm.” To help spur internal disruption, the company keeps tabs on 2,000 technology ventures, using about 100 in pilot programs that will eventually join the firm’s growing ecosystem of partners. For instance, the bank’s machine-learning software was built with Cloudera Inc., a software firm that JPMorgan first encountered in 2009. “We’re starting to see the real fruits of our labor,” Zames said. “This is not pie-in-the-sky stuff.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The gun-rights group lobbied against a rule that would have effectively prevented most people with disabling mental illnesses from purchasing firearms. By Eric Lipton and Binyamin Appelbaum / The New York Times WASHINGTON — Giants in telecommunications, like Verizon and AT&T, will not have to take “reasonable measures” to ensure that their customers’ Social Security numbers, web browsing history and other personal information are not stolen or accidentally released. Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase will not be punished, at least for now, for not collecting extra money from customers to cover potential losses from certain kinds of high-risk trades that helped unleash the 2008 financial crisis. And Social Security Administration data will no longer be used to try to block individuals with disabling mental health issues from buying handguns, nor will hunters be banned from using lead-based bullets, which can accidentally poison wildlife, on 150 million acres of federal lands. These are just a few of the more than 90 regulations that federal agencies and the Republican-controlled Congress have delayed, suspended or reversed in the month and a half since President Trump took office, according to a tally by The New York Times. The emerging effort — dozens more rules could be eliminated in the coming weeks — is one of the most significant shifts in regulatory policy in recent decades. It is the leading edge of what Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, described late last month as “the deconstruction of the administrative state.” In many cases, records show that the changes came after appeals by corporate lobbyists and trade association executives, who see a potentially historic opportunity to lower compliance costs and drive up profits. Slashing regulations, they argue, will unleash economic growth. On a near daily basis, regulated industries are now sending in specific requests to the Trump administration for more rollbacks, including recent appeals from 17 automakers to rescind an agreement to increase mileage standards for their fleets, and another from pharmaceutical industry figures to reverse a new rule that tightens scrutiny over the marketing of prescription drugs for unapproved uses. As of late Friday, word had leaked that the automakers’ request for a rollback was about to be granted, too. “After a relentless, eight-year regulatory onslaught that loaded unprecedented burdens on businesses and the economy, relief is finally on the way,” Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a memo last week. But dozens of public interest groups — environmentalists, labor unions, consumer watchdogs — have weighed in on the potential threat to Americans’ well-being. “Americans did not vote to be exposed to more health, safety, environmental and financial dangers,” said one letter, signed by leaders of 137 nonprofit groups to the White House last week. In other cases, the Obama-era rules under attack have drawn objections even from some liberal groups that called them examples of overreach, like the American Civil Liberties Union’s protest of a system to block mentally ill people from buying guns. The regulatory retrenchment is unfolding on multiple fronts. Congress, with Mr. Trump’s approval, has erased three Obama-era rules in the last month, lifting regulations related to coal mining and oil and gas exploration, as well as the sale of guns to the mentally ill. More than 25 more rules could also be erased in the coming weeks; the House has already voted to eliminate nearly half. Mr. Trump has separately signed executive orders directing agencies to pursue the reversal of other rules, including a requirement that financial advisers act in the interest of their clients, and a rule aimed at protecting drinking water from pollution. New White House appointees at agencies including the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have also personally intervened in recent weeks to block, delay or start the process to nullify other rules, such as a requirement that corporations publish tallies comparing chief executive pay with average employee wages. The Trump administration has also imposed a broad regulatory freeze, instructing agencies to delay the adoption of any rules not already in effect, and to consider whether those rules should be targeted for elimination. And it has set up barriers to enact any new regulations — such as a requirement that for each new rule, at least two others must be identified for repeal — and ordered every federal agency to create a team of employees to look for more rules that can be eliminated. “By any empirical measure, it is a level of activity that has never been seen,” said Curtis W. Copeland, who spent decades studying federal regulatory policy on behalf of Congress while at the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office. “It is unprecedented.” Mr. Trump, in his address to Congress last week, called it “a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations,” a line that drew thunderous applause from Republicans. Presidents wield considerable influence over the rule-making process. They set the agenda and appoint the rule-makers, and, since the Reagan administration, a White House office has reviewed every major regulation to try to ensure that benefits to society exceeded compliance costs. It is not uncommon for new presidents to make quick changes in regulatory policy or try to reverse certain last-minute rules their predecessors enacted. Barack Obama, shortly after being elected president, pressed the E.P.A. to let the State of California set more stringent limits on auto emissions, a proposal that the Bush administration had rejected. But the courts have generally held that new administrations need to justify such reversals. The Reagan administration tried to rescind a rule requiring airbags in passenger vehicles. The courts found the move unjustified. “It is not a relevant or adequate defense to say that the president told us to do it,” said Michael Eric Herz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. The Trump administration could face a host of similar challenges — the requirement that agencies must find two regulations to eliminate before enacting any new rules is already being challenged in federal court. In addition, Democratic attorneys general from New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon and Vermont have threatened in recent days to sue the Trump administration to try to block some of the regulatory rollbacks. It is a radical role reversal for state attorneys general — their Republican colleagues spent the last eight years suing the federal government to block the enactment of many Obama-era rules. Now the Democrats are planning to try to prevent many of these same rules from being revoked. “Demolish the administrative state? I don’t even know what that means,” Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts said during a visit to Washington last week, where she and other state attorneys general met with Mr. Trump at the White House. The pushback has hardly deterred industry executives. The Business Roundtable, which represents some of the nation’s largest corporations and is led by Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, in mid-February gave Mr. Trump a wish list of 16 rules it wanted killed, including the mandatory disclosure of how much chief executives are paid compared with other employees, and a rule intended to curb the trade in minerals that might benefit militant groups in parts of Africa. Efforts to repeal at least 10 of those measures are underway. “The majority of these regulations directly and negatively impact economic growth,” the executives said in their letter, adding that they were convinced that rules could be repealed “without undermining critical protections for consumer health, safety and the environment.” The reversals by federal regulators are happening, at times, at an extraordinary speed. Lawyers representing the National Mining Association, the American Petroleum Institute and other fossil fuel trade groups and companies asked the Interior Department on Feb. 17 to suspend a new rule changing the way these companies pay royalties for oil, gas or coal extracted from federal lands. While the lawyers called the requirement “impractical and in some cases impossible,” environmentalists and conservative nonprofit groups like Taxpayers for Common Sense praised the effort, saying that for decades energy companies had been underpaying the federal government. The new standard was expected to push up federal revenue by as much as $85 million annually. The Interior Department wrote the industry lawyers back five days later, telling them that the agency, after three years of backing the rule, would suspend enforcement of the new standards. “We agree you have raised serious questions,” the agency’s letter said. This shift in federal regulatory policy is already having implications for tens of thousands of citizens nationwide. Nearly two years ago, the Social Security Administration first moved to set up a new system that would automatically turn over to the Justice Department information it collects on Americans who are receiving federal benefits based on a disabling mental illness for inclusion in a database used for gun background checks. This would effectively prevent these individuals — an estimated 75,000 a year — from buying guns unless they sought a Justice Department waiver after being rejected, given the longstanding federal limitation on the sale of firearms to individuals with known mental illnesses. Groups like the National Rifle Association, the A.C.L.U. and the National Alliance on Mental Illness objected to the provision, which had been scheduled to go into effect in January. They argued that it unfairly presumed a tendency toward violence by a wide range of people with mental disabilities, including conditions like bulimia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Mr. Trump signed legislation on Tuesday revoking that rule under the Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress a limited window to overturn the decisions of regulatory agencies. A total of 46 such Congressional Review Act resolutions are now pending in Congress, on topics including air pollution, unemployment compensation, endangered species listings, debit card fees and oil and gas drilling on federal lands as well as the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf. The act, first adopted in 1996, had been used only once before to nullify a regulation, at the start of the Bush administration in 2001, when a Clinton-era rule was revoked. Rules not subject to congressional review may still be at risk. The most radical shift has perhaps come at the Federal Communications Commission, which voted on Wednesday to halt new government rules related to data security from taking effect this week, after objections were raised by companies including Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. Ajit Pai, a Republican whom Mr. Trump recently named as the F.C.C. chairman, has also made clear that he intends to push to roll back or abandon several other major rules, including the landmark net neutrality regulation intended to ensure equal access to content on the internet, as well as efforts to keep prison phone rates down and a proposal to break open the cable box market. The efforts have been praised by telecommunications giants, like Comcast, but condemned by consumer advocates. The administration started its campaign against regulation on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, with a memo from Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, instructing agencies to halt work on new regulations and to delay putting completed regulations into effect. So far, the effective dates of at least 75 rules have been delayed as a result of this order, based on an analysis of the Federal Register. That includes a measure intended to prevent potentially toxic formaldehyde exposure in homes caused by certain furniture products — an effort that has been underway since victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were moved into contaminated government-issued trailers. Such delays are not uncommon with new presidents — both George W. Bush and Mr. Obama did the same, to differing degrees. And certain measures are still going into effect as the Trump administration gets underway, including one that prohibits smoking in public housing nationwide as of Feb. 3. Still, the general Trump administration freeze has drawn broad opposition, some of it surprising. The Department of Agriculture has delayed a rule that would make it easier for chicken farmers to sue chicken processors. Business groups, including the National Federation of Independent Business, want to kill the rule. But small-scale chicken farmers are fighting back. Mike Weaver, a West Virginia farmer who said he had voted for Mr. Trump and was pleased with most of what he had seen so far, said he wished Mr. Trump would meet with farmers. “I’d love to have a visit with the president about this, to tell him that these are federal regulations, yes, but these are good regulations,” said Mr. Weaver, the president of a small-farm group called the Organization for Competitive Markets. “These are regulations that we want implemented.” Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Under Trump, regulatory leashes are coming off print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2987707 false President Donald Trump signs back-to-back executive orders in the White House on Feb. 28. In its first month and a half, the Trump administration has already delayed, suspended or reversed more than 90 regulations. (Stephen Crowley/The New York Times) Click here to enlarge image Under Trump, regulatory leashes are coming off By Eric Lipton and Binyamin Appelbaum / New York Times News Service Published Mar 6, 2017 at 12:02AM WASHINGTON — Giants in telecommunications like Verizon and AT&T will not have to take “reasonable measures” to ensure their customers’ Social Security numbers, web browsing history and other personal information are not stolen or accidentally released. Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase will not be punished, at least for now, for not collecting extra money from customers to cover potential losses from certain kinds of high-risk trades that helped unleash the 2008 financial crisis. And Social Security Administration data will no longer be used to try to block individuals with disabling mental health issues from buying handguns, nor will hunters be banned from using lead-based bullets, which can accidentally poison wildlife, on 150 million acres of federal lands. These are just a few of the more than 90 regulations that federal agencies and the Republican-controlled Congress have delayed, suspended or reversed in the month and a half since President Donald Trump took office, according to a tally by The New York Times. The emerging effort — dozens more rules could be eliminated in the coming weeks — is one of the most significant shifts in regulatory policy in recent decades. It is the leading edge of what Stephen Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, described late last month as “the deconstruction of the administrative state.” In many cases, records show that the changes came after appeals by corporate lobbyists and trade association executives, who see a potentially historic opportunity to lower compliance costs and drive up profits. Slashing regulations, they argue, will unleash economic growth. On a near daily basis, regulated industries are sending in specific requests to the Trump administration for more rollbacks, including recent appeals from 17 automakers to rescind an agreement to increase mileage standards for their fleets, and another from pharmaceutical industry figures to reverse a new rule that tightens scrutiny over the marketing of prescription drugs for unapproved uses. As of late Friday, word had leaked that the automakers’ request for a rollback was about to be granted, too. “After a relentless, eight-year regulatory onslaught that loaded unprecedented burdens on businesses and the economy, relief is finally on the way,” Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a memo last week. But dozens of public interest groups — environmentalists, labor unions, consumer watchdogs — have weighed in on the potential threat to Americans’ well-being. “Americans did not vote to be exposed to more health, safety, environmental and financial dangers,” said one letter, signed by leaders of 137 nonprofit groups to the White House last week. In other cases, the Obama-era rules under attack have drawn objections even from some liberal groups that called them examples of overreach, like the American Civil Liberties Union’s protest of a system to block mentally ill people from buying guns. The regulatory retrenchment is unfolding on multiple fronts. Congress, with Trump’s approval, has erased three Obama-era rules in the last month, lifting regulations related to coal mining and oil and gas exploration, as well as the sale of guns to the mentally ill. More than 25 more rules could also be erased in the coming weeks; the House has voted to eliminate nearly half. Trump has separately signed executive orders directing agencies to pursue the reversal of other rules, including a requirement that financial advisers act in the interest of their clients, and a rule aimed at protecting drinking water from pollution. New White House appointees at agencies including the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have also personally intervened in recent weeks to block, delay or start the process to nullify other rules, such as a requirement that corporations publish tallies comparing chief executive pay with average employee wages. Presidential influence Presidents wield considerable influence over the rule-making process. They set the agenda and appoint the rule-makers, and, since the Reagan administration, a White House office has reviewed every major regulation to try to ensure that benefits to society exceeded compliance costs. It is not uncommon for new presidents to make quick changes in regulatory policy or try to reverse certain last-minute rules their predecessors enacted. Barack Obama, shortly after being elected president, pressed the EPA to let the state of California set more stringent limits on auto emissions, a proposal that the Bush administration had rejected. But the courts have generally held that new administrations need to justify such reversals. The Reagan administration tried to rescind a rule requiring air bags in passenger vehicles. The courts found the move unjustified. “It is not a relevant or adequate defense to say that the president told us to do it,” said Michael Eric Herz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. The Trump administration could face similar challenges — the requirement that agencies must find two regulations to eliminate before enacting any new rules is being challenged in federal court. In addition, Democratic attorneys general from New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon and Vermont have threatened in recent days to sue the Trump administration to try to block some of the regulatory rollbacks. Effects on citizens This shift in federal regulatory policy is having implications for tens of thousands of citizens nationwide. Nearly two years ago, the Social Security Administration first moved to set up a new system that would automatically turn over to the Justice Department information it collects on Americans who are receiving federal benefits based on a disabling mental illness for inclusion in a database used for gun background checks. This would effectively prevent these individuals — an estimated 75,000 per year — from buying guns unless they sought a Justice Department waiver after being rejected, given the long-standing federal limitation on the sale of firearms to individuals with known mental illnesses. Groups like the National Rifle Association, the ACLU and the National Alliance on Mental Illness objected to the provision, which had been scheduled to go into effect in January. They argued that it unfairly presumed a tendency toward violence by a wide range of people with mental disabilities, including conditions like bulimia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Trump signed legislation Tuesday revoking that rule under the Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress a limited window to overturn the decisions of regulatory agencies. A total of 46 such Congressional Review Act resolutions are pending in Congress, on topics including air pollution, unemployment compensation, endangered species listings, debit card fees and oil and gas drilling on federal lands as well as the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf. The act, first adopted in 1996, had been used only once before to nullify a regulation, at the start of the Bush administration in 2001, when a Clinton-era rule was revoked. Rules not subject to congressional review may still be at risk. The most radical shift has perhaps come at the Federal Communications Commission, which voted Wednesday to halt new government rules related to data security from taking effect this week, after objections were raised by companies including Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. Ajit Pai, a Republican whom Trump recently named FCC chairman, has also made clear that he intends to push to roll back or abandon several other major rules, including the landmark net neutrality regulation intended to ensure equal access to content on the internet, as well as efforts to keep prison phone rates down and a proposal to break open the cable box market. The efforts have been praised by telecommunications giants, like Comcast, but condemned by consumer advocates. 16642015 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact This Software Does in Seconds What Took Lawyers 360,000 Work Hours Rehan Ahmed 4 days ago JP Morgan Chase & Co, one of the world’s biggest banking and financial services company, has a massive technology budget of $9.6 billion and employs around 20,000 developers. They are trying to leverage modern technology to drastically reduce the workload on its lawyers. Their strategy has focused mainly on developing tools that could automate mundane tasks for bankers as well as clients. Finally, they are seeing some of the efforts pay off. Their new software, called Contract Intelligence (COIN), has the task of interpreting commercial-loan agreements and was implemented in June last year. The task, when done by lawyers and loan officers, could take up as many as 360,000 hours of work annually. COIN, on the other hand, is capable of reviewing documents in mere seconds. It is also less prone to error, specifically cutting down on loan-servicing mistakes— a common human error. The software is the result of some huge investments made by JP Morgan in technologies like machine learning as well as a new private cloud network. The biggest bank in the United States, the firm has set up technology hubs for teams specializing in fields like big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure and keeps a track of around 2,000 technology ventures. Work, which could previously take hundreds of thousands of lawyer hours, is now being done with the help of a software that uses machine learning and big data. Automation softwares are in demand these days. A Pakistani entrepreneur also caught the headlines recently when he, bored of the repetitive work he was required to do, automated his whole job, and then made a thriving startup out of it. via Bloomberg Image Credits — MovedAndShaken Primary Sidebar Viral Stories Pakistan and Genetically Modified Crops: Is the Risk Worth the Reward? 10 Reasons Why Its a Great Idea to Start Your Business during College Easypaisa Parts Ways with Telenor Pakistan Get Wholesale Prices on Tech Products & Accessories with PakLap.Pk These Pictures From PSL 2017 Show How Pakistan Won Against Terrorism This Technology Will Self Destruct Your Phone As Soon As its Snatched Alibaba Officials are in Islamabad Latest Today Google Reveals the All-Time Best Selling Content on Play Store Huawei Pakistan Was At The P10 & P10 Plus Launch Event During MWC 2017 Nike Launches Its First Ever Sports Hijab for Female Muslim Athletes Pakistan and Genetically Modified Crops: Is the Risk Worth the Reward?

And Social Security Administration data will no longer be used to try to block individuals with disabling mental health issues from buying handguns, nor will hunters be banned from using lead-based bullets, which can accidentally poison wildlife, on 150 million acres of federal lands. These are just a few of the more than 90 regulations that federal agencies and the Republican-controlled Congress have delayed, suspended or reversed in the month and a half since President Trump took office, according to a tally by The New York Times. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter The emerging effort — dozens of additional rules could be eliminated in the coming weeks — represents one of the most significant shifts in regulatory policy in recent decades. It is the leading edge of what Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, described late last month as “the deconstruction of the administrative state.” In many cases, records show that the changes came after appeals by corporate lobbyists and trade association executives, who see a potentially historic opportunity to lower compliance costs and drive up profits. Slashing regulations, they argue, will unleash economic growth. On a near daily basis, regulated industries are now sending in specific requests to the Trump administration for more rollbacks, including recent appeals from 17 automakers to rescind an agreement to increase mileage standards for their fleets, and another from pharmaceutical industry figures to reverse a new rule that tightens scrutiny over the marketing of prescription drugs for unapproved uses. As of late Friday, word had leaked that the automakers’ request for a rollback was about to be granted, too. “After a relentless, eight-year regulatory onslaught that loaded unprecedented burdens on businesses and the economy, relief is finally on the way,” Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a memo last week. But dozens of public interest groups — environmentalists, labor unions, consumer watchdogs — have sounded the alarm about the potential threat to Americans’ well-being. “Americans did not vote to be exposed to more health, safety, environmental and financial dangers,” said one letter, signed by leaders of 137 nonprofit groups, that was sent to the White House last week. In other cases, the Obama-era rules under attack have drawn objections even from some liberal groups that called them examples of overreach, like the American Civil Liberties Union’s protest of a system to block mentally ill people from buying guns. The regulatory retrenchment is unfolding on multiple fronts. Congress, with Mr. Trump’s approval, has erased three Obama-era rules in the last month, lifting regulations related to coal mining and oil and gas exploration, as well as the sale of guns to the mentally ill. More than 25 additional rules could also be erased in the coming weeks, with the House having already voted to eliminate nearly half of them. Mr. Trump has separately signed executive orders directing agencies to pursue the reversal of other rules, including a requirement that financial advisers act in the interest of their clients, and a rule aimed at protecting drinking water from pollution. New White House appointees at agencies including the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have also personally intervened in recent weeks to block, delay or start the process to nullify other rules, such as a requirement that corporations publish tallies comparing chief executive pay with average employee wages. The Trump administration has also imposed a broad regulatory freeze, instructing agencies to delay the adoption of any rules not already in effect, and to consider whether those rules should be targeted for elimination. And, through yet more executive orders, it has set up barriers to enact any new regulations — such as a requirement that for each new rule, at least two others must be identified for repeal — and ordered every federal agency to create a team of employees to look for more rules that can be eliminated. “By any empirical measure, it is a level of activity that has never been seen,” said Curtis W. Copeland, who spent decades studying federal regulatory policy on behalf of Congress while at the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office. “It is unprecedented.” Mr. Trump, in his address to Congress last week, called it “a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations,” a line that drew thunderous applause from Republicans. Presidents wield considerable influence over the rule-making process. They set the agenda and appoint the rule-makers, and, since the Reagan administration, a White House office has reviewed every major regulation to try to ensure that benefits to society exceeded compliance costs. It is not uncommon for new presidents to make quick changes in regulatory policy or try to reverse certain last-minute rules their predecessors enacted. Barack Obama, shortly after being elected president, pressed the E.P.A. to let the State of California set more stringent limits on auto emissions, a proposal that the Bush administration had rejected. But the courts have generally held that new administrations need to justify such reversals. The best-known case involved the Reagan administration, which tried to rescind a rule requiring airbags in passenger vehicles. The courts found the move unjustified. “It is not a relevant or adequate defense to say that the president told us to do it,” said Michael Eric Herz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. The Trump administration could face a host of similar challenges — the new requirement that agencies must find two regulations to eliminate before enacting any new rules is already being challenged in federal court by two liberal groups. In addition, Democratic attorneys general from New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon and Vermont have threatened in recent days to sue the Trump administration to try to block some of the regulatory rollbacks. It is a radical role reversal for state attorneys general — their Republican colleagues spent the last eight years suing the federal government to block the enactment of many Obama-era rules. Now the Democrats are planning to try to prevent many of these same rules from being revoked. “Demolish the administrative state? I don’t even know what that means,” Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts said during a visit to Washington last week, where she and other state attorneys general met with Mr. Trump at the White House. “But we need to wake up to what is actually going on.” But the pushback has hardly deterred industry executives. The Business Roundtable, which represents some of the nation’s largest corporations and is led by Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, went so far in mid-February as to give Mr. Trump a wish list of 16 rules it wants killed, including the mandatory disclosure of how much chief executives are paid compared with other employees, and a rule intended to curb the trade in minerals that might benefit militant groups in parts of Africa. Efforts to repeal at least 10 of the measures on this list are now underway. “The majority of these regulations directly and negatively impact economic growth,” the executives said in their letter, adding that they were convinced that rules could be repealed “without undermining critical protections for consumer health, safety and the environment.” The reversals by federal regulators are happening, at times, at an extraordinary speed. Lawyers representing the National Mining Association, the American Petroleum Institute and other fossil fuel trade groups and companies asked the Interior Department on Feb. 17 to suspend a new rule changing the way these companies pay royalties for oil, gas or coal extracted from federal lands. While the lawyers called the requirement “impractical and in some cases impossible,” environmentalists and even conservative nonprofit groups like Taxpayers for Common Sense praised the effort, saying that for decades energy companies had been underpaying the federal government. The new standard has been estimated to push up federal revenue by as much as $85 million annually. The Interior Department wrote the industry lawyers back five days later, telling them that the agency, after three years of backing the rule, would suspend enforcement of the new standards. “We agree you have raised serious questions,” the agency’s letter said. This shift in federal regulatory policy is already having implications for tens of thousands of citizens nationwide. Nearly two years ago, the Social Security Administration first moved to set up a new system that would automatically turn over to the Justice Department information it collects on Americans who are receiving federal benefits based on a disabling mental illness for inclusion in a database used for gun background checks. This would effectively prevent these individuals — an estimated 75,000 a year — from buying guns unless they sought a Justice Department waiver after being rejected, given the longstanding federal limitation on the sale of firearms to individuals with known mental illnesses. Groups like the National Rifle Association, the A.C.L.U. and the National Alliance on Mental Illness objected to the provision, which had been scheduled to go into effect in January. They argued that it unfairly presumed a tendency toward violence by a wide range of people with mental disabilities, including conditions like bulimia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Mr. Trump signed legislation on Tuesday revoking that rule under the Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress a limited window to overturn the decisions of regulatory agencies. A total of 46 such Congressional Review Act resolutions are now pending in Congress, on topics including air pollution, unemployment compensation, endangered species listings, debit card fees and oil and gas drilling on federal lands as well as the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf. The act, first adopted in 1996, had been used only once before to nullify a regulation, at the start of the Bush administration in 2001, when a Clinton-era rule was revoked. Rules not subject to congressional review may still be at risk. The most radical shift has perhaps come at the Federal Communications Commission, which voted on Wednesday to halt new government rules related to data security from taking effect this week, after objections were raised by companies including Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. Ajit Pai, a Republican whom Mr. Trump recently named as the F.C.C. chairman, has also made clear that he intends to push to roll back or abandon several other major rules, including the landmark net neutrality regulation intended to ensure equal access to content on the internet, as well as efforts to keep prison phone rates down and a proposal to break open the cable box market. The efforts have been praised by telecommunications giants, like Comcast, but condemned by consumer advocates. The administration started its campaign against regulation on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, with a memo from Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, instructing agencies to halt work on new regulations and to delay putting completed regulations into effect. So far, the effective dates of at least 75 rules have been delayed as a result of this order, based on an analysis of the Federal Register. That includes a measure intended to prevent potentially toxic formaldehyde exposure in homes caused by certain furniture products — an effort that has been underway since victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were moved into contaminated government-issued trailers. Such delays are not uncommon with new presidents — both George W. Bush and Mr. Obama did the same, to differing degrees. And certain measures are still going into effect as the Trump administration gets underway, including one that prohibits smoking in public housing nationwide as of Feb. 3. Still, the general Trump administration freeze has drawn broad opposition, some of it surprising. The Department of Agriculture has delayed a rule that would make it easier for chicken farmers to sue chicken processors. Business groups, including the National Federation of Independent Business, want to kill the rule. But small-scale chicken farmers are fighting back. Mike Weaver, a West Virginia farmer who said he had voted for Mr. Trump and was pleased with most of what he had seen so far, said he wished Mr. Trump would meet with farmers. “I’d love to have a visit with the president about this, to tell him that these are federal regulations, yes, but these are good regulations,” said Mr. Weaver, the president of a small-farm group called the Organization for Competitive Markets. “These are regulations that we want implemented.” Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen last Friday also signalled a potentially steeper pace of further rate hikes this year. A Commerce Department report showed US factory goods orders rose 1.2 percent in January, beating economists’ expectations. US Treasuries fell, pushing yields on the 10-year note three basis points higher to 2.51 percent, while the greenback strengthened. Wall Street weakened. In 1.16pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent. In 1.01pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.4 percent. The Dow fell, led by declines in shares of JPMorgan Chase and those of Intel, recently down 1.3 percent and 1.1 percent respectively. Tyson Foods shares declined as a deadly form of bird flu was found in a Tennessee operation that supplies the largest US chicken producer. This is the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic H7 avian influenza in commercial poultry in the US this year, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said in a statement. “Based on the limited scope known to us at this time, we don’t expect disruptions to our chicken business and plan to meet our customers’ needs,” Worth Sparkman, a spokesman for Tyson, told Bloomberg. State officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be killed to prevent the spread of the disease, the USDA said, adding that birds from the flock will not enter the food system. Shares of Tyson Foods traded 3.4 percent weaker as of 12.07pm in New York. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a decline of 0.5 percent from the previous close.The UK’s FTSE 100 Index retreated 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index gave up 0.5 percent, and Germany’s DAX Index dropped 0.6 percent. Shares of Deutsche Bank closed 3.2 percent after the Germany’s biggest lender on Sunday announced it is seeking to raise about 8 billion euros by issuing new shares as part of a plan to overhaul its business. “The question is … whether the bank will need more yet again in a few years,” Stefan de Schutter, a trader at Frankfurt-based Alpha, told Reuters. “ Until now, none of the restructuring measures have borne fruit.” Bucking the trend, shares of Standard Life climbed 5.7 percent after it agreed to acquire Aberdeen Asset Management to form one of Europe’s biggest fund managers. In other deal news, shares of PSA Group of France closed 2.7 percent higher in Paris after it agreed to buy Opel from General Motors.

UBS › Pro Analysis JPMorgan predicts short-term market pullback due to Fed rate increase, complacent hedge funds Giovanny Moreano | @GiovannyMoreano 12 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Lucas Jackson | Reuters Traders works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as a television screen displays coverage of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen shortly after the announcement that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates, in New York, December 14, 2016. The massive rally in the stock market since the U.S. presidential election could soon hit a wall, according to strategists at JPMorgan. "In the near-term we see increasing risk of a sell-off due to more hawkish Fed rhetoric at a time when investor positioning is stretched and equity volatility is likely to rise from low levels," JPMorgan's U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note to clients Monday. U.S. stocks are up 11 percent since the election on Nov. 8, led by financial stocks, which are up nearly 24 percent over the same period. Other cyclical sectors such as industrials, technology and materials are each up at least 11 percent. Given the strong gains, stocks already pierced last week through the firm's year-end price target of 2,400, likely limiting the upside potential from here, at least in the short term, JPMorgan said.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Wall St retreats, led by financials Margreet Dietz Tuesday March 7, 2017 Share Play NBR radio on Equities on both sides of the Atlantic moved lower as investors reassessed valuations amid the prospect the US Federal Reserve will increase interest rates at next week's meeting. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen last Friday also signalled a potentially steeper pace of further rate hikes this year. A Commerce Department report showed US factory goods orders rose 1.2% in January, beating economists' expectations.

At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 51.37 points, or 0.2%, to 20,854.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4% to 5849.17 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index slid 0.3% to 2375.31. The Dow fell, led by declines in JPMorgan Chase and Intel shares, down 1.0% and 1.1% respectively. Tyson drops on bird flu report Tyson Foods shares declined as a deadly form of bird flu was found in a Tennessee operation that supplies the largest US chicken producer. This is the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic H7 avian influenza in US commercial poultry this year, the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said. "Based on the limited scope known to us at this time, we don't expect disruptions to our chicken business and plan to meet our customers' needs," Tyson spokesman Worth Sparkman told Bloomberg. State officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be killed to prevent the spread of the disease, the USDA said, adding that birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

Shares of Deutsche Bank dropped 3.2% after the Germany's biggest lender announced it is seeking to raise about €8 billion by issuing new shares as part of a plan to overhaul its business.

"Until now, none of the restructuring measures have borne fruit." Bucking the trend, Standard Life shares rose 5.7 % after it agreed to acquire Aberdeen Asset Management to form one of Europe's biggest fund managers.

Wayne Duggan , Benzinga Staff Writer     {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} March 06, 2017 1:33pm   Comments Share: Related 15 Biggest Mid-Day Losers For Monday SNAP Back To Reality Snapchat: What You Need To Know (Seeking Alpha) If you were trying to short sell shares of Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) right out of the gate following its high-profile IPO, it may have been more difficult than you anticipated. Since 2005, Regulation SHO has required brokers to have a reasonable belief that they will be able to borrow and deliver shares of any equity that their clients short sell. Quiet Periods IPO underwriters are forbidden by rule from lending out shares of the IPO stock within the first 30 days of trading. That means that firms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Credit Suisse will not be able to lend their shares of Snap for the time being. While a limited number of Snap shares are certainly already available to borrow, the relatively few borrowable shares coupled with the huge demand from short sellers makes Snap shares very difficult to borrow at the moment. Hard-To-Borrow List Brokers use a “hard-to-borrow” list to keep track of which shares are difficult to find. The hard-to-borrow list is typically internal, but many firms make a related easy-to-borrow list available to their clients on a daily basis. Brokers often allow clients limited access to hard-to-borrow shares, provided they enroll in a special program or agree to special terms, but that access comes at a cost. One of the major disadvantages of shorting stocks that appear on a hard-to-borrow list is the extremely high fees associated with the trade. In extreme cases, hard-to-borrow fees can approach 100 percent on an annualized basis. In addition to the fees, there are other concerns when it comes to shorting hard-to-borrow stocks. Fidelity addresses the main concerns on its website. “Not only could it impact the interest rate you have to pay on your ‘loan,’ shorting hard to borrow stocks increases the likelihood that you will be bought in. In the case of a buy in, you’re forced to cover your short if the lender pulls back the shares that your broker is borrowing, which makes those shares unavailable.” In other words, through no fault of your own, your broker can cover your short position in hard-to-borrow stocks at any time at market price. With Snap shares up another 4.2 percent in premarket trading on Monday, it may be very tempting to short the stock at this point. However, until the stock makes its way off the hard-to-borrow lists, there are a number of reasons to think careful about the risk involved in taking a short position.

Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail March 06, 2017 12:30 PM Eastern Standard Time OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TD Ameritrade, Inc. (“TD Ameritrade”), a broker-dealer subsidiary of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (Nasdaq:AMTD), is today releasing the Investor Movement Index® reading for February 2017. The Investor Movement Index, or the IMXSM, is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade that aggregates Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors are actually doing and how they are positioned in the markets. The February 2017 Investor Movement Index for the four weeks ending February 24, 2017, reveals: Reading: 6.15 (compared to 5.71 in January) Trend direction: Positive Trend length: 1 month Score relative to historic ranges: High February’s IMX rose to 6.15, breaking above 6.0 for the first time, and surpassing the previous record high of 5.87 set in March 2014. Equity markets were on the rise during the February IMX period with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting their 11th record high for the year. TD Ameritrade clients increased their exposure to equity markets by rotating into diversified instruments and buying popular stocks, like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA). “A year ago, retail clients were dialing back their equity exposure and the February 2016 IMX was at 4.44,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade. “Indices are now at an all-time high as retail clients continued to increase their exposure to equity markets. Investor confidence was further fueled by February’s market highs, earnings and other macroeconomic influences.” In February, TD Ameritrade clients continued to be net buyers of banks. JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) were both net buys. Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), which saw its share price reach an all-time high early in the period, then large decreases late in the period following downgrades by Wall Street, was a net buy as well. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), which reported better-than-expected earnings, was another net buy. Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK), which has been under pressure following natural gas prices trending lower, was another net buy. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Macy’s, Inc. (M), both of which reported upbeat earnings, were also bought up. Additional popular names bought included Dry Ships Inc. (DRYS) and Ford Motor (F). Apple Inc. (AAPL) was once again net sold during the February IMX period as the company’s market cap topped $700 billion and the stock reached a new all-time high. Alcoa Corp. (AA) and Arconic Inc. (ARNC), which previously comprised former Dow component Alcoa, both trended upward during the period and were net sold. Energy names ConocoPhillips Corp. (COP) and Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI), which each posted decreases during the period, were net sold. Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) both saw new 12-month highs and were also sold. Tesla Motors, Inc. (TSLA) was net sold after reaching a new all-time high in the middle of the period. Additional popular names sold include Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) and Alibaba Group Holding (BABA). About the IMX The IMX value is calculated based on a complex proprietary formula. Each month, TD Ameritrade pulls a sample from its client base of 6 million funded accounts, which includes all accounts that completed a trade in the past month. The holdings and positions of this statistically significant sample are evaluated to calculate individual scores, and the median of those scores represents the monthly IMX. For more information on the Investor Movement Index, including historical IMX data going back to December 2010; to view the full report from February 2017; or to sign up for future IMX news alerts, please visit www.tdameritrade.com/IMX. Additionally, TD Ameritrade clients can chart the IMX using the symbol $IMX in either the thinkorswim® or TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader platforms. Inclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold. Past performance of a security, strategy, or index is no guarantee of future results or investment success. Historical data should not be used alone when making investment decisions. Please consult other sources of information and consider your individual financial position and goals before making an independent investment decision. The IMX is not a tradable index.

(CFR) to “Buy” March 6th, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Jeff Wilder Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (NYSE:CFR) from a hold rating to a buy rating in a report issued on Tuesday morning. They currently have $105.00 target price on the stock. According to Zacks, “Cullen/Frost's shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Southwest Banks industry over the last one year. Also, the company’s organic growth remains on track with increasing loans and deposits balances. Though rising costs stemming largely from expanding franchise are likely to deter bottom-line growth, with further rise in interest rates, the company’s non-interest bearing deposits, a major low-cost funding source, will likely improve net interest income and net interest margin. Also, Cullen/Frost’s strong capital position keeps it well poised to continue capital deployment activities.” Other equities research analysts have also recently issued reports about the stock. Maxim Group increased their price objective on shares of Cullen/Frost Bankers from $85.00 to $95.00 and gave the stock a buy rating in a research report on Monday, December 19th.

Jon Brodkin - Mar 6, 2017 5:29 pm UTC Enlarge Mike Mozart reader comments 101 Share this story Speculation that Sprint will merge with T-Mobile USA or another competitor has ramped up since the inauguration of President Donald Trump. That continued Friday when a report from The New York Times suggested that Sprint could combined with either T-Mobile or Comcast, the nation's largest cable company. Masayoshi Son, founder and CEO of Sprint owner SoftBank, "and his financial advisers are weighing several major possible deals for Sprint," the Times wrote. "Be it a tie-up with T-Mobile US, Sprint’s closest competitor, or a more ambitious marriage with the cable colossus Comcast, a transaction would allow Mr. Son to fulfill a long-held ambition to invest aggressively in wireless networks in the United States and enable next-generation mobile technology." Further ReadingHow Sprint’s new boss lost $70 billion of his own cash (and still stayed rich) Titled "The World’s Top Tech Investor Is Betting Big on Trump," the Times report says that "the Trump administration’s push for lighter regulation and lower taxes has been a powerful lure for cash-rich investors the world over." SoftBank, which is based in Japan, had several of its executives "spen[d] a day in Washington talking to senior members of Mr. Trump’s economic team" last month, according to bankers who were briefed on the meetings, the Times report said. US regulators opposed wireless consolidation during the Obama administration, preventing potential mergers between AT&T and T-Mobile and later between Sprint and T-Mobile. With four major nationwide carriers, US wireless competition recently led to an expansion of unlimited data plans. “The Federal Communications Commission looks very smart for blocking the AT&T/T-Mobile deal,” telecom analyst Philip Cusick of JPMorgan Chase told The New York Times. “Five years ago, Sprint and T-Mobile were irrelevant. Now we are seeing them drive down prices. Why would you want to change that?” Trump and Son have been friendly since the election, with Trump taking credit for SoftBank's planned investments in the US. T-Mobile USA CEO John Legere was asked about the potential for wireless industry consolidation in an earnings call last month. Legere said there are no ongoing merger talks because "we're in an anti-collusion period during the low-band spectrum auction," but said that T-Mobile will have numerous options after that quiet period ends. "I couldn't be more excited about the period that's going to come up when this auction is over, while we continue to do what we just announced and then engage in understanding what the future of this industry is going to be, which is fascinating," Legere said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript. Sprint has struggled while T-Mobile solidifies its position as the third-place US carrier after Verizon and AT&T. SoftBank is willing to give up control of Sprint to T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom AG in order to finish a merger deal, Reuters reported last month. That's a turnabout from 2014, when SoftBank wanted to buy T-Mobile and retain control. Comcast has mobile plans, with or without Sprint A Sprint merger with Comcast wouldn't reduce the number of major wireless carriers, but it would expand the power of the country's biggest home Internet service provider. When Comcast's attempt to buy Time Warner Cable was blocked in 2015, US regulators explained that giving Comcast more Internet subscribers would pose a threat to online video streaming services that compete against Comcast's TV business. Buying Sprint would quickly give Comcast a major presence in the mobile Internet market, but Comcast has at least one other compelling option. Comcast is planning to offer mobile phone service this year through a reseller agreement with Verizon Wireless. By reselling Verizon data, Comcast can offer mobile Internet service without buying a wireless carrier and without building its own cell towers. We've asked SoftBank and Comcast for comment on the New York Times report today but haven't heard back yet.

Losses, however, were limited by fresh deal-making activity in the auto and asset management sectors, which helped the STOXX 600 fall just 0.5 percent and stay just over half a percentage point below a 15-month peak hit last week. Deutsche Bank dropped nearly 8 percent, making the stock the biggest drag on the pan-European index and pulling the European banking index down 1.2 percent. Peers Credit Suisse and Italy's Banco BPM also fell more than 4 percent. Deutsche Bank, which also announced an overhaul of its business structure and plans to list its asset management arm to help raise extra cash, will start the rights issue in two weeks. JPMorgan hailed the new strategic direction taken by the bank as steps "in the right direction", but kept its neutral rating on the stock, saying more details on the financial impact of the planned measures were needed. PSA Group rose 2.7 percent after the French carmaker agreed to buy Opel from General Motors in a 2.2 billion-euro deal that is expected to generate cost savings of 1.7 billion euros. The deal will create a regional giant to challenge market leader Volkswagen, which fell 0.8 percent. Merger activity also buoyed asset managers after Aberdeen and Standard Life set terms of their planned 11 billion pound all-share tie-up that could pressure rivals to follow suit as industry margins sag. Aberdeen and Standard Life rose 4.2 and 5.7 percent respectively. "We see a strong industrial logic for the merger in terms of scale, capabilities and cost savings," said Ben Cohen, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. "There must also be a reasonable likelihood of a counter-bid, for one or both of the parties, given accelerating consolidation in the industry". Europe's Basic Resources index was a weak spot, down 2.2 percent, with big miners such as Glencore, Anglo American and Antofagasta all falling more than 2 percent, tracking a decline in metal prices. Among outstanding movers was Ultra Electronics, which rose 4.8 percent to a record high after the British defence contractor reported its biggest sales growth in six years.

Care Services to Local Community News provided by AAMCO Transmissions, Inc. Mar 06, 2017, 11:21 ET Share this article HORSHAM, Pa., March 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- AAMCO Transmissions, Inc. ("AAMCO"), franchisor of the world's largest branded chain of transmission specialists and an industry leader in total car care services, announced today it has expanded in South Carolina with the opening of its first location in Summerville on Feb. 1. The new auto repair shop is located at 1550 Old Trolley Road and features transmission, auto repair and fleet services. AAMCO Summerville marks the brand's eighth location in South Carolina and is owned and operated by Greenville resident and longtime franchisee Chris Ebert. Ebert opened his first AAMCO shop in the Greenville area in 2010 after spending 12 years in the mortgage industry and many years as a restaurant owner prior to that. When asked what drew him to franchising and to AAMCO in particular, he said, "As a manager with JPMorgan Chase, I learned how to follow best practices and to achieve success by doing what has proven to work. The experts at AAMCO have spent over 50 years developing their business. I know I can follow this path they have created, put in the hard work and have a thriving business." That path to success led Ebert to open a Columbia-area shop in 2014 and a Charlotte, North Carolina-area location in 2015. He has already purchased the rights to expand in Mount Pleasant and Anderson, South Carolina, as well as Asheville, North Carolina, and expects to have those three locations open with the next 24 months.   "Total car care is a specialty business that people are always going to need," said Ebert. "We work hard to build trust with our customers and help them maintain their car year-round, whether it's a transmission replacement in the heat of the summer or a routine spring tune-up. It's important to me to bring value to each community in which I do business and to be known for quality work and customer service."   For more than 50 years, AAMCO's network of locally owned and independently operated automotive service centers has employed the latest technology. Expert technicians diagnose a repair, fix it right the first time and back it with a nationwide warranty. Known as the world's leading transmission expert, the company has evolved into a total car care brand that provides a variety of services including brake repair, tune-ups, shocks and struts, routine maintenance and more. AAMCO was named to Entrepreneur's 2017 Franchise 500 ranking top of its category for the third consecutive year. Based on network size, growth rate and financial strength, last year, the brand also earned a spot on Entrepreneur's "Best of the Best" list. Additionally, AAMCO has been consecutively ranked on Franchise Times' Top 200+ for the last two years. AAMCO Summerville serves customers Monday – Friday from 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. and Saturday from 8 a.m. – 4 p.m.  The center is closed on Sunday. For more information, please visit www.aamcosummervillesc.com or call 843-376-5525. About AAMCO AAMCO is the world's largest branded chain of transmission specialists and a leader in total car care services.

And although I wouldn’t describe the mood as “vivacious” out there ("keeping our noses to the grindstone" would be more appropriate), in terms of demographics I have noticed more and more younger faces at conferences. Indeed, Pew Research finds that as of the end of last year there were over 58 million millennial workers in the US labor force ranking this group #1 in size vs. 53 million Gen X workers coming in at #2. Bank and M&A news. Tricon Capital Group announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire public single-family rental (SFR) operator Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. by way of an all-cash transaction for approximately $1.4 billion, which values the company at $21.50 per share. Tricon Capital indicated that the acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2017. Tricon Capital is the parent company of Tricon American Homes (TAH), which is the firm's wholly owned operator of its U.S. single-family rental business. The acquisition of Silver Bay will create the fourth largest publicly-owned SFR company. After the completion of the acquisition, TAH will hold more than 16,800 homes in its total SFR portfolio, of which nearly 9,800 are currently included in three single-borrower securitizations totaling $1.1 billion. Is it true that banks are where all the money is? Perhaps. Banks' profit hit a record high of $171.3 billion last year, a 4.9% increase from 2015, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Unprofitable banks made up 4.2% of the system, the lowest level since 1995. Global regulators working on the Basel III banking rules have ended a two-day meeting without setting a date for their issuance, but have expressed a determination to reach agreement and completion, saying that many outstanding matters have been resolved. The US has not yet appointed a Federal Reserve official who would oversee banking supervision, and this has been cited as a main reason for the delay. With hints of lessening regulations (heck, everyone would be happy if we did away with triple damages with the False Claims Act) will banks pick up the pace in residential lending? As everyone knows more borrowers are choosing non-depository lenders than ever before to obtain a home loan. In 2011, 50 percent of all new mortgage loans originated from the three largest banks: JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. However, in September 2016, that share plunged to 21 percent. During that time, non-banks emerged as six of the 10 largest lenders by volume, including Quicken Loans, loanDepot, and PHH Mortgage. In 2011, only two of the 10 largest lenders were non-banks. Obviously, depository banks have a wide range of revenue earning products whereas the standard mortgage bank only has first liens and mortgages. Non-banks are a little nimbler and can offer more home loan products. As depository banks have backed away from the mortgage business due to onerous and often overlapping & conflicting regulations from the last ten years, non-bank lenders have filled the void. Appraisal, collateral, and value trends & developments Has the appraisal crunch we had six months ago in many parts of the nation died down due to volumes falling? To some extent, yes. But some inherent structural problems remain, and I received this note from the president of a well-known bank in the West on the lack of new, young appraisers. "First off, the entrepreneurial return to enter/pursue the business just hasn't been there. With the 4-year degree and 2-year apprentice requirements (which many lenders and realtors don't have this level of experience) many would-be candidates maybe choosing different business lines that can pay them more much sooner with their experience. "Along the same line, the appraiser has long been one of the least underpaid part of the real-estate transaction.  Even at current 'high' fee levels, a '2 appraisal a day' appraiser turning 600 in a year charging $700/appraisal is making gross $420K/yr. before overhead expenses and assuming full capacity. Reduce this by 50% for those factors and a very good appraiser (established with degree and client base) may make $200K/yr. How many real estate agents and originators make more than this? Lots of them! "Also, apply this to new folks looking to enter the market and you can see where it may deter many. The presence of CU and other automated tools may likely change this landscape dramatically in the next 5-years as appraisers may take on 2 roles: property viewer/certifier of condition (non-technical), and specialized/unique property appraiser (specialized and more difficult). Finally, much of this is due to the current rate environment.  If volume slows, the noise is likely to drop a lot.  Experienced appraisers have been through this before and are unlikely to build up their business when they may have to deal with overhead cuts soon." Quicken Loans' National Home Price Perception Index (HPPI) showed the average appraisal value was 1.47 percent below what owners expected in January. This two-month drop in the HPPI comes on the heels of a six month stretch where opinions between homeowner and appraiser were steadily moving closer to equilibrium. Appraisal values in January stayed mostly flat, slipping only 0.34 percent last month per Quicken Loans' Home Value Index (HVI). When viewed annually, appraised values continue to rise, increasing 3.93 percent year-over-year.   Ditech Financial posted a Job Aid when ordering VA appraisals through the WebLGY application in the online Veterans Information Portal for its Wholesale Clients. The Job Aid will help clients generate a complete and accurate VA Request for Determination of Reasonable Value Form (26-1805-1) and reduce errors that may delay the appraisal inspection and issuance of the VA Notice of Value (NOV). Nationstar Mortgage now maintains and distributes a monthly Appraiser Exclusionary List in an effort to continue to ensure collateral quality.  Correspondents are encouraged to review the Nationstar Mortgage Appraiser Exclusionary List prior to submitting a loan for loan purchase. If a loan delivered to Nationstar utilizes an appraiser on the Appraiser Exclusionary List, the loan is ineligible for purchase.  Wells Fargo Funding added an authorized appraisal management companies (AMCs) to include Assurant® Valuations (formerly StreetLinks). Beginning February 14, 2017. Updates to NYCB's Appraisal Fee Schedule [WSL:652] will be effective 02.20.17 for all new registrations on Table Funding loans and all Correspondent transactions where the appraisal is ordered through Gemstone. The Appraisal Fee Screen's functionality at Stearns was improved to simplify the LE process. Its newest enhancement to SNAP 2.0 enables you to automatically pull the exact Appraisal Fee into your loan based on the state and appraisal type requested. No matrix or grids to review. To avoid delays, any LE generated on or after 2/10 will require the new appraisal fee to be disclosed on your LE. Visit SNAP 2.0 to reference the new appraisal fee schedule. Effective for Insurance Applications received by MGIC on or after Feb. 15, 2017, Fannie Mae PIWs will be accepted as meeting the Underwriting Requirements when offered by Desktop Underwriter®(DU®) and exercised by the lender in accordance with requirements published in Fannie Mae's SEL-2016-08 and its Selling Guide. Further, MGIC will not rescind coverage on a loan with an exercised PIW based on a Material Value Variance, unless fraud, misrepresentation or inaccurate data were involved in obtaining the PIW or the PIW was not valid under the Fannie Mae Selling Guide. Home values influenced by pot? According to a study from the University of Mississippi and software technology company FNC Inc., marijuana legalization could drive housing values up. Capital markets By now a March rate hike is nearly fully priced into the market. At least, if anyone is paying attention to what all the Fed officials are saying in their speeches it should be. In the last 48 hours, we've had additional comments by Governors Brainard and Powell expressing support for a 25-basis point rate hike at the March meeting. And to its credit the Fed has been relatively transparent in their various speeches. With this as a backdrop, the 10-year note's yield broke 2.50% for the first time since mid-February closing at 2.49%. (The 5-year note and agency MBS prices worsened about .125.) The highlight of today's calendar will be the five scheduled Fed speakers, and we can all expect more hints at our economy doing well enough for the FOMC to vote for another increase. There aren't any big scheduled economic numbers coming out, merely some secondary or tertiary numbers like some Markit Services PMI and ISM Non-manufacturing PMI later in the morning. In the early going the 10-year is yielding 2.50% and agency MBS prices are approximately unchanged versus last night's close. Jobs and Announcements Turning to the job market, an established national mortgage lender is looking to acquire a wholesale sales team.

In last week's address to Congress, President Trump called for comprehensive tax reform to help American businesses that labor under some of the most anti-business tax rates and rules in the world. While Republicans in Congress work to turn this rhetoric into reality, and get bogged down in debating the comprehensive tax reform facets like the border adjustable tax, American small business job creators need and want tax relief now. Small businesses are unique because they do not have access to the tax lawyers, lobbyists, and fixers of their wealthier and better connected counterparts. That's why tax reform must be broader than just focusing on the country's anti-competitive corporate tax rate - it must focus on providing relief for America's 28 million small businesses and the 85 million Americans who owe their livelihoods to them. These businesses have been struggling under the weight of a 40 percent marginal federal tax burden, which can reach 50 percent when state taxes are included, and 60 percent when payroll and other taxes are added in. That's nearly the most onerous in the world, according to the Tax Foundation. Is this any way to treat the job creation engine of the economy? Small businesses account for two-thirds of new jobs, half of existing jobs, and a significant portion of the new innovations that improve our quality of life. This heavy tax burden dramatically reduces their ability to expand, create jobs, and raise wages. Two out of three small business owners admitted as much in a recent nationwide poll conducted by the Job Creators Network. Economic indicators also suggest small businesses are struggling. A new JPMorgan Chase study shows that small business expansion is negligible. Meanwhile, the decades-long slowdown in new business creation continues. The share of businesses less than a year old has plummeted by one-third and their employment share by half since the 1980s. Yet small business optimism has surged since the election of Donald Trump. Owners are hopeful that the "you didn't build that" mentality in Washington for the past eight years has come to an end. Tax relief would provide a greater incentive to start and grow businesses, which would employ some of the tens of millions of Americans who are part of the long-term unemployed, "prime-age" quitters of the labor force, and underemployed. Outside of Washington the business owners and workers laugh when they hear that unemployment rate is less than 5 percent. Correctly measured, one in 10 Americans is unemployed. What would such small business tax reform look like? House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) has a good tax bill that would chop the tax rate to 25 percent. That's a start. Even better is a bill called the Bring Small Businesses Back Tax Reform Act, which will be introduced tomorrow by Reps. Rand Hultgren (R-Ill.) and Jason Smith (R-Mo.). This bill would lower the tax rate on the first $150,000 of small business income to only 12 percent, and to 25 percent for all income above that threshold. While some critics argue against lower taxes on small businesses for fear of "gaming the system" and "avoiding payroll taxes," there is a solution: create a simple, straightforward rule with appropriate safeguards around reasonable compensation. This would end years of legal controversy and uneven IRS enforcement. Some business owners may not like such a rule, but this opposition cannot stand in the way of real tax relief for millions of others. Hultgren and Smith's legislation would allow for immediate expensing of all equipment, meaning an end to the hassle of complicated depreciation schedules and reduced tax compliance costs. The third and final part would allow for cash accounting, allowing small businesses to defer income declaration until payment is actually received. Such small business tax relief is needed now. While comprehensive tax reform for individuals is a worthy effort, that may take time to work out. For now, congress should deliver pro-jobs business reform. It's been 30 years since businesses have gotten a break from IRS tyranny and delivering relief this year will help employers and their workers alike. We even think a business tax reform bill for these 85 million Americans who depend on small businesses will get the backing of some Democrats. Who isn't for small business and jobs?

News World Americas Donald Trump disassembles 90 federal state regulations in just over a month in White House The massive de-regulation effort is believed to be one of the most significant shifts in regulatory policy in decades   Chloe Farand Monday 6 March 2017 15:41 GMT Click to follow The Independent US US President Donald Trump Getty Donald Trump’s administration has managed to deconstruct no fewer than 90 state regulations during his short time in office.  Giant telecommunications companies will no longer have to take “reasonable measures” to protect their customers’ personal data from being stolen or accidentally released.  People with disabling mental health illnesses will no longer be prevented from buying handguns and Wall Street banks will not be punished for not collecting extra money from customers to cover losses from high-risk trades, which were in part responsible for the 2008 financial crash.  Read more Donald Trump the 'dealmaker' has met his match in Pyongyang Trump launches Irish ‘Make America Great Again’ hat – makes mistake Trump to sign new travel ban executive order today excluding Iraq Wall Street investors make $3 trillion since Trump’s election victory Congress responds angrily to Trump's request to investigate Obama These are some examples of the 90 regulations that have been delayed, suspended or reversed since Mr Trump’s inauguration, according to The New York Times, which compiled the data.  This massive de-regulation effort is believed to be one of the most significant shifts in regulatory policy in decades.  Less than 10 days after his inauguration, Mr Trump signed an executive order that sought to hack federal regulations by requiring agencies to cut two existing regulations for every new rule introduced.  The executive order is expected to prepare a process for the White House to set an annual cap on the cost of new regulations. But until the end of the 2017 fiscal year, the cap will require that the cost of any additional regulations be completely offset by undoing existing rules. White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon has previously said that one part of the work of the Trump administration was the “deconstruction of the administrative state”.

The Republican-led US Senate has launched their much-anticipated effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act by passing a budget blueprint which would allow them to begin rolling back the health care reforms Getty Images The argument, which has been long held by the Republicans, is that state regulations burden American businesses and are a barrier for economic growth.  Corporate lobbyists and trade association executives are reportedly sending requests to the White House to get rid more regulations. Leading car manufacturers have reportedly asked to roll back an agreement to increase mileage standards.   Letters obtained by The New York Times also show that the pharmaceutical industry has called to overturn a regulation that tightens scrutiny over the marketing of prescription drugs for unapproved uses, .  One from the Business Roundtable, a conservative group of chief executives from major US companies said in a letter addressed to the White House that the "majority of these regulations directly and negatively impact economic growth." Chaired by the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, the group attached a "Top Regulations of Concern" list, along with recommendations to mitigate their impact. However, the group made it clear that it was "not proposing that all regulations on this list be repealed", but it said "some are so deficient they cannot easily be fixed.”   Environmentalists, unions and consumer watchdogs have warned of the dangers of slashing regulations, which they claim include pollution-induced disease, contaminated food, unsafe workplaces and shoddy financial practices.  World news in pictures 32 show all World news in pictures 1/32 5 March 2017 A member of the Tinstix of Dynamite aerobatics team flies in front of a wall of fire during the Australian International Airshow in Melbourne Getty Images 2/32 5 March 2017 A participant stretches on the beach before the start of an annual two-mile sea swimming competition in Colombo, Sri Lanka Reuters 3/32 5 March 2017 Participants jump into water during the annual two-mile sea swimming competition in Colombo, Sri Lanka Reuters 4/32 5 March 2017 Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko wave to bid farewell as they depart for Thailand from Phu Bai International Airport in the central city of Hue, Vietnam, ending their six-day long visit to the country EPA 5/32 5 March 2017 Reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on display indoors at the International Defence Exhibition in Iraq (IQDEX) 2017 Getty Images 6/32 5 March 2017 A participant presents hisr vintage vehicle during the 59th International Vintage Car Rally Barcelona-Sitges, at plaza Sant Jaume in Barcelona, Spain.

Wall Street banks made about $85 million in fees on Snap 's giant IPO, with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs taking the lion's share. According to SEC filings, lead underwriter Morgan Stanley got 60 million Snap shares, or, 30.2 percent of the shares given to underwriters — which would mean $25.71 million in fees, the biggest cut of any bank. The second biggest —Goldman — sold nearly 50 million shares, or 24.8 percent, amounting to about $21.08 million. Other big chunks went to JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, while a slew of more than 20 other banks sold slivers, each less than 10 percent. (Some of these banks could also have been paid additional fees that haven't yet been disclosed.) Here's how it works: A group of banks work with Snap and potential early IPO buyers -- mainly large institutional investors -- to figure how how many shares they'll be able to sell at what price. The banks keep a percentage of the total amount raised, and give the rest to Snap. That percentage is subject to negotiation. Snap's $3.4 billion IPO raised more than twice as much as every 2016 venture-backed tech IPO combined, according to Renaissance Capital. But the 2.5 percent underwriting fee for the banks could be the third-lowest ever for a major technology offering, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year. Snap's IPO underwriters had a difficult task, Recode reports: They wanted to make sure the IPO price was not too high or too low before it hit the public market, as early investors and founders of the company wanted a fair deal. Here are the banks that underwrote the IPO, and the number of shares they received.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Maiya Keidan and Svea Herbst-Bayliss | LONDON/BOSTON LONDON/BOSTON Bank stocks are back in vogue for hedge funds, which have shunned the industry over the past seven years due to a squeeze on banks' profitability from low interest rates and because of their opaque balance sheets. The election of U.S. President Donald Trump has already tempted some hedge funds back into bank stocks to raise their bets on deregulation and interest rate rises in the United States, which could help banks to earn higher returns on deposits. "I think people are overweighting," Hilmi Unver, partner at hedge fund investor Notz Stucki Group, said. "Financials should benefit from interest rates going up." He also said Trump was pro deregulation, which would benefit U.S. banks. Banks made up five of the 50 stocks most commonly in the top ten holdings of hedge funds at the start of 2017, the largest portion since 2013, data from Goldman Sachs showed. Among the top five stocks were Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Citigroup and Citizens Financial Group. Globally, institutional investor appetite for hedge funds buying bank stocks has risen in January to its highest level since 1999, estimated at 16.4 percent, up from 13.9 percent in December 2016, according to preliminary data from industry tracker Blue Lion Research. Many managers favor U.S. banks stocks, but some hedge funds are also trickling into European banks even though some of these lenders are still dealing with fallout from the 2008 financial crisis and now face uncertainty from upcoming elections. "European banks trade at almost half the valuation of U.S. banks and I think the political risk is overstated ... a lot of people are on the sidelines," said one London-based hedge fund manager who started adding European banks to his portfolio in January. "The big money will be made by buying these things now." “One of our biggest long positions is Credit Suisse," Lars Franstedt, chief investment officer and partner at $150 million Madrague Capital Partners, said. "We believe that it’s one of the best ways to play long in the financial industry." Said Haidar, president and chief executive officer at $313 million Haidar Capital Management, which is long banks globally, also said European banks looked cheap. Low and even negative interest rates in Europe have made it difficult for banks to generate profits on deposits, depressing their shares, which has kept many hedge funds away. But banks' profits could improve now interest rates are on the rise in the United States and ultimately could rise in Europe too. "In Europe, where banks trade at steep discounts to book (value), steeper curves, the coming end to quantitative easing followed by rate hikes in late 2018 or early 2019 should bolster results," Haidar said. Wellington Management’s hedge fund Bay Pond Partners, a fund which focuses on the financial sector in general, has benefited from a strong move in bank stocks. After losing 7.1 percent in 2016, the fund gained 6.4 percent in January, several people familiar with the fund’s performance said. Representatives for the fund were not immediately available to comment. U.S. hedge fund manager Dan Loeb shifted his focus to banks, he wrote in an investor letter on Wednesday, with the sector now making up 11.8 percent of his $15 billion fund, up from 4.4 percent on Nov. 8. Before the financial crisis, many hedge funds reaped big rewards from a bull market in banks between 2005 and 2007. They then took short positions on banks between mid-2007 and 2009, betting on falling share prices. During this period, for example, Bank of America shares lost almost 75 percent of their value, according to Thomson Reuters data. But after 2009, most funds stepped back from banks because of pressure on deposits from low interest rates. Some even shut up shop completely. Lansdowne Partners, one of London's oldest hedge funds, closed its financials fund last year, which had lost 18.7 percent in the first 40 days of 2016.

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Despite stocks reaching new peaks, extending the rally that began after the U.S. election, the trade remains supported by robust macroeconomic indicators, strategists including Mislav Matejka and Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note. It’s a sentiment echoed by their peers at Natixis SA, who said that equities remain the asset class to be in as the reflation theme continues and the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy. “Equities are continuing to defy numerous correction calls,” JPMorgan strategists wrote on Monday. “Activity momentum might be peaking, but we find that this is not enough to take risk off the table. One should remain constructive and look through any weakness.” An uptick in earnings momentum and a pickup in inflation that would boost top-line growth and corporate pricing power are among factors JPMorgan sees helping equities, saying the asset class remains underowned. Consumer prices are expected to rise faster in both Europe and the U.S. this year. JPMorgan strategists are overweight euro-area stocks, and within the region, prefer Germany. The DAX Index looks “relatively cheap” and will benefit from any euro weakness, they wrote. The benchmark trades at 13.6 times the estimated earnings of its members, a lower valuation than the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, even after surging 17 percent since a November low. The bank is also bullish on Japan, while cautioning that a stronger yen would pose a risk, and underweight U.K. equities. With the prospects of a Fed rate hike in March almost entirely priced in, “the time might be approaching” to re-enter emerging markets, according to JPMorgan. Natixis also sees value in developing market equities, as well as in the U.S. Protectionist policies from U.S. President Donald Trump and a rising dollar pose risks for emerging markets but are unlikely to materialize in the short term, prompting a “tactical bull call,” its strategists including Emilie Tetard wrote in a note on Monday.

JPMorgan already has subsidiary units in Ireland and Germany with broker/dealer licences. Published: 15:22 March 6, 2017 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE London, Dublin JPMorgan Chase & Co. is scouting for office space in Dublin and Frankfurt that may be used as an enlarged European Union hub following the U.K.’s vote to leave the bloc, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The lender may lease 50,000 square feet (4,645 square meters) to 150,000 square feet of space and wants flexibility from landlords to shrink or expand depending on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, some of the people said, asking not to be named because the plans aren’t public. That amount of space would be enough for several hundred employees. “Other options are still very much on the table,” the bank said in a statement. “We want to see how negotiations progress. No final decisions have been made.” UK. Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to pull Britain out of the single market has prompted international banks to begin looking to move jobs to the continent. London could lose 10,000 banking jobs and 20,000 roles in financial services as clients move 1.8 trillion euros (Dh6.98 trillion; $1.9 trillion) of assets to the continent after Brexit is completed, according to think tank Bruegel. Other estimates range from as much as 232,000 jobs to as few as 4,000. Before the June 23 referendum Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told UK staff that as many as 4,000 of them could be relocated in the event of Brexit. In January, he said that number could be even higher — or lower — depending on how the government’s negotiations played out. Frankfurt and Dublin are emerging as the favoured destinations for banks preparing to flee London after Brexit. Standard Chartered Plc and Barclays Plc are considering the Irish capital for their EU base while Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Morgan Stanley are weighing Frankfurt.

Forums Join   Sprint is Trying to Sell Trump on a Comcast or T-Mobile Merger by Karl Bode Monday Mar 06 2017 07:40 EST Sprint and Softbank boss Masayoshi Son met with the Trump administration last month to sell the administration on a megamerger between Sprint and either T-Mobile or Comcast, notes the New York Times. In presentations to the Trump camp, Softbank executives made the case that "because of a lack of advanced digital investments," the competitiveness of the United States economy was at risk. This risk, Softbank told the Trump team, could only be averted by further industry consolidation. But Sprint's first attempt to acquire T-Mobile was blocked by regulators who felt such a deal would have reduced competition. That worry hasn't gone away. "The Federal Communications Commission looks very smart for blocking the AT&T T-Mobile deal," Philip Cusick, a telecommunications expert with JPMorgan Chase tells the Times. "Five years ago, Sprint and T-Mobile were irrelevant. Now we are seeing them drive down prices. Why would you want to change that?" Trump was notably anti-telecom merger on the campaign trail, promising he'd block AT&T's $100 million acquisition and even work to break up the already merged Comcast/NBC Universal. But Wall Street telecom analysts continue to believe Trump will be overall relatively friendly toward sector megadeals, since they'll allow him to use the deals to piggyback on job creation claims (be they truth or fantasy). And Sprint has been providing Trump with plenty of ammunition on that front. Masayoshi Son met with Trump back in December, allowing the President to claim to the press that he was directly responsible for $100 billion in Softbank investment and 50,000 new jobs coming to the states (those plans, as it turned out, had been in the works since before Trump was even elected). Last week the wireless industry watched as competition from T-Mobile finally forced AT&T and Verizon to bring back unlimited data. That would have never happened if regulators hadn't blocked AT&T's attempted acquisition of T-Mobile. And given Sprint's ongoing inability to find its footing in the market, a Sprint T-Mobile tie up could be equally fatal to sector competition. Carriers hadn't been allowed to communicate due to incentive auction rules, but merger talk should heat up once the auction smoke settles next month. tags: competition · business · consumers · Sprint Mobile Broadband · T-Mobile US · wireless · cellular News Jump Comcast: Symmetrical Cable Broadband Coming in Next 24 Months10% of Broadband Users to Go Wireless Only in Next YearYankees YES Network Returns to Comcast March 311.7 Million Cable TV Users Cut The Cord in 2016Monday Morning LinksT-Mobile Takes Heat For Quietly Bumping 'Activation Fee' to $25»Sprint is Trying to Sell Trump on a Comcast or T-Mobile MergerDish Customers Lose Access to Hearst Stations in 26 MarketsForum Topic: Users Say Comcast Usage Meters Still Not ReliableEmployee Error to Blame For Huge Amazon S3 Outage This Week----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 16 comments toolman1990 join:2016-05-19 Cincinnati, OH toolman1990 Member Yesterday 8:00 am Merger A Comcast and Sprint merger would go through less scrutiny through an FCC and DOJ Review since it would leave four national wireless carriers in place. · actions · Yesterday 8:00 am · C0deZer0 Oc'D To Rhythm And Police Premium Member join:2001-10-03 Tempe, AZ52.7 5.4 ·Cox HSI C0deZer0 Premium Member Yesterday 7:59 am A thousand times, no! Masayoshi son wanted to buy in to sprint to create the kind of oligopoly that he enjoys in his home country and market. He simply assumed and chose poorly, picking a Bolivian thief in the form of Marcelo claure to run things here. Problem is, Claure pays himself like he is already number one (Robbie Rotten notwithstanding) without the credibility to back it up, leaving no money to invest in the network. Yet while he's had plenty of opportunities to get rid of the ass clown to create even a semi respectable network, son chose not to. Since son just wants to create a monopoly, he should be forced to lay in the bed he's created. Considering Claure is such an intolerable shit that he needs armed security just to visit his own offices, son should be made to take over and fix his own polished turd sandwich. Nobody with any sense would want to buy the cancerous stain that is Sprint now. The spectrum they currently hold is worth more than the rest of the company. That's how bad it is over there.

By Tas Bindi | March 6, 2017 -- 05:18 GMT (21:18 PST) | Topic: Innovation The Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund, a global fintech fund managed by venture capital firm Quona Capital, has secured $141 million in capital contributions from a consortium of institutional investors including Accion, MasterCard, and JPMorgan Chase. what's hot on zdnet Why Raspberry Pi is the future of computing devices Eight obstacles to overcome in your digital transformation journey Ford to trial Stratasys system to use 3D printing of one-piece auto parts IBM, Maersk aim to speed up shipping with blockchain technology The Washington-based fund will invest in "inclusive fintech" startups that improve the accessibility and quality of financial services in emerging markets including sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Asia, with a particular focus on Southeast Asia and India. "Three billion people are left out of, or poorly served by, the global financial system," said Michael Schlein, CEO and president of Accion. "The fund will support innovators using new technologies to help create a financial system that works for everyone. By focusing on both social impact and financial returns, we believe the fund shows the importance of harnessing the capital markets to solve society's most challenging problems." The Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund has invested in eight startups to date including: Coins, a mobile payments platform that uses blockchain to provide a suite of services to low income consumers in the Philippines; Konfio, which uses data analytics to deliver working capital loans to micro-businesses in Mexico; and Creditas, which provides home and auto equity loan solutions for the emerging middle class in Brazil. Other fund investors include MetLife, TIAA Investments, and the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group. "The diversity and caliber of investors the fund has attracted and the capital they have put behind it is an unambiguous validation of our investment thesis and a milestone for both financial inclusion and the impact investing industry," said Monica Brand Engel, a founding partner at Quona Capital. In February, a report by professional services firm KPMG showed that global fintech funding slid by 47 percent from $46.7 billion in 2015 to $24.7 billion in 2016. The Australian and Asian regions, however, trended upwards in 2016 with a record $656 million being invested in fintech in Australia and a record $8.6 billion being invested in fintech in Asia.

Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase will not be punished, at least for now, for not collecting extra money from customers to cover potential losses from certain kinds of high-risk trades that helped unleash the 2008 financial crisis. And Social Security Administration data will no longer be used to try to block individuals with disabling mental health issues from buying handguns; nor will hunters be banned from using lead-based bullets, which can accidentally poison wildlife, on 150 million acres of federal lands. These are just a few of the more than 90 regulations that federal agencies and the Republican-controlled Congress have delayed, suspended or reversed since President Donald Trump took office, according to a tally by the New York Times. The effort — dozens of additional rules could be eliminated in the coming weeks — represents one of the most significant shifts in regulatory policy in recent decades. It is the leading edge of what Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist, has described as "the deconstruction of the administrative state." In many cases, records show that the changes came after appeals by corporate lobbyists and trade association executives, who see a potentially historic opportunity to lower compliance costs and drive up profits. Slashing regulations, they argue, will unleash economic growth. Ty Wright &#x2022; New York Times Gun provision: Social Security Administration data will no longer be used to try to block individuals with disabling mental health issues from buying guns. The NRA and the ACLU objected to the provision. On a near daily basis, regulated industries are sending in specific requests to the Trump administration for more rollbacks, including recent appeals from 17 automakers to rescind an agreement to increase mileage standards for their fleets, and another from pharmaceutical industry figures to reverse a new rule that tightens scrutiny over the marketing of prescription drugs for unapproved uses. As of late Friday, word had leaked that the automakers' request for a rollback was about to be granted. "After a relentless, eight-year regulatory onslaught that loaded unprecedented burdens on businesses and the economy, relief is finally on the way," Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote. But dozens of public interest groups — environmentalists, labor unions, consumer watchdogs — have sounded the alarm about the potential threat to Americans' well-being. "Americans did not vote to be exposed to more health, safety, environmental and financial dangers," said one letter signed by leaders of 137 nonprofit groups that was sent to the White House last week. The regulatory retrenchment is unfolding on multiple fronts. Congress, with Trump's approval, has erased three Obama-era rules, lifting regulations related to coal mining and oil and gas exploration, as well as the sale of guns to mentally ill people. More than 25 additional rules could also be erased in the coming weeks. Trump has separately signed executive orders directing agencies to pursue the reversal of other rules, including a requirement that financial advisers act in the interest of their clients, and a rule aimed at protecting drinking water from pollution. New White House appointees at agencies including the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have also personally intervened in recent weeks to block, delay or start the process to nullify other rules, such as a requirement that corporations publish tallies comparing chief executive pay with average employee wages. The Trump administration has also imposed a broad regulatory freeze, instructing agencies to delay the adoption of any rules not in effect, and to consider whether those rules should be eliminated. A total of 46 Congressional Review Act resolutions — which gives Congress a window to overturn the decisions of regulatory agencies — are pending in Congress on topics including air pollution, unemployment compensation, endangered species listings, debit card fees and oil and gas drilling on federal lands as well as the Arctic outer continental shelf. The act, first adopted in 1996, had been used only once before to nullify a regulation, at the start of the Bush administration in 2001, when a Clinton-era rule was revoked.

While Republicans in Congress work to turn this rhetoric into reality, and get bogged down in debating the comprehensive tax reform facets like the border adjustable tax, American small business job creators need and want tax relief now. Small businesses are unique because they do not have access to the tax lawyers, lobbyists, and fixers of their wealthier and better connected counterparts. That’s why tax reform must be broader than just focusing on the country’s anti-competitive corporate tax rate — it must focus on providing relief for America’s 28 million small businesses and the 85 million Americans who owe their livelihoods to them. ADVERTISEMENT These businesses have been struggling under the weight of a 40 percent marginal federal tax burden, which can reach 50 percent when state taxes are included, and 60 percent when payroll and other taxes are added in. That’s nearly the most onerous in the world, according to the Tax Foundation.   Is this any way to treat the job creation engine of the economy? Small businesses account for two-thirds of new jobs, half of existing jobs, and a significant portion of the new innovations that improve our quality of life. This heavy tax burden dramatically reduces their ability to expand, create jobs, and raise wages. Two out of three small business owners admitted as much in a recent nationwide poll conducted by the Job Creators Network. Economic indicators also suggest small businesses are struggling. A new JPMorgan Chase study shows that small business expansion is negligible. Meanwhile, the decades-long slowdown in new business creation continues. The share of businesses less than a year old has plummeted by one-third and their employment share by half since the 1980s. Yet small business optimism has surged since the election of Donald TrumpDonald TrumpDHS head: US may seek better vetting from 13 or 14 more nations Student objects to Trump University settlement: report Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey, Trump at odds on wiretapping | Obama advisers press Trump to act on cyber MORE. Owners are hopeful that the “you didn’t build that” mentality in Washington for the past eight years has come to an end. Tax relief would provide a greater incentive to start and grow businesses, which would employ some of the tens of millions of Americans who are part of the long-term unemployed, “prime-age” quitters of the labor force, and underemployed. Outside of Washington the business owners and workers laugh when they hear that unemployment rate is less than 5 percent. Correctly measured, one in 10 Americans is unemployed. What would such small business tax reform look like? House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin BradyKevin BradyOvernight Healthcare: GOP releases ObamaCare bills House GOP bill repeals ObamaCare taxes — with one exception GOP releases bills to repeal and replace ObamaCare MORE (R-Texas) has a good tax bill that would chop the tax rate to 25 percent. That's a start. Even better is a bill called the Bring Small Businesses Back Tax Reform Act, which will be introduced tomorrow by Reps. Rand Hultgren (R-Ill.) and Jason Smith (R-Mo.). This bill would lower the tax rate on the first $150,000 of small business income to only 12 percent, and to 25 percent for all income above that threshold. While some critics argue against lower taxes on small businesses for fear of “gaming the system” and “avoiding payroll taxes,” there is a solution: create a simple, straightforward rule with appropriate safeguards around reasonable compensation. This would end years of legal controversy and uneven IRS enforcement. Some business owners may not like such a rule, but this opposition cannot stand in the way of real tax relief for millions of others. Hultgren and Smith’s legislation would allow for immediate expensing of all equipment, meaning an end to the hassle of complicated depreciation schedules and reduced tax compliance costs. The third and final part would allow for cash accounting, allowing small businesses to defer income declaration until payment is actually received. Such small business tax relief is needed now. While comprehensive tax reform for individuals is a worthy effort, that may take time to work out. For now, congress should deliver pro-jobs business reform. It’s been 30 years since businesses have gotten a break from IRS tyranny and delivering relief this year will help employers and their workers alike. We even think a business tax reform bill for these 85 million Americans who depend on small businesses will get the backing of some Democrats. Who isn’t for small business and jobs?

Mikko Perez of Ayannah and Simon Bakker of Kennemer were handpicked as the 9th and 10th Philippine-based high-impact entrepreneurs at Endeavor’s 69th international selection panel held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Growing up in the Philippines, Perez witnessed poverty firsthand. After graduating with honors from Ateneo de Manila, he left the city to become a community organizer and adult educator in the countryside. It was there that he realized how entrepreneurship could uplift poor families out of poverty. ADVERTISEMENT After graduating from Harvard Business School, he worked for JP Morgan’s technology investment banking group in San Francisco and Next Century Partners where he managed a private equity fund. During his stint in the US, Mikko started to view modern technology as a way to address infrastructure gaps in his home country. He co-founded Chikka, a mobile instant messaging service that was acquired by PLDT in 2009. Fueled by Chikka’s success, Mikko founded Ayannah, which seeks to address the Philippines’ $40-billion underserved domestic remittance and financial services industry. As urban-rural remittances continue to be predominantly cash-based, some taking place through pawnshops, he saw the existing process as costly and inefficient. Perez and his team of engineers built Sendah, an electronic platform that gives unbanked Filipinos easy access to a suite of financial products and services through a network of 7,000 agents that include pawnshops, convenience stores and other retail establishments as well as individuals. “The [Endeavor] ISP (international selection panel) was a unique opportunity to learn from amazing mentors and entrepreneurs from around the world. The feedback helped us refine our business plan and prepare to take our business to the next level to achieve market leadership in the Philippines and expand to other emerging markets,” Perez said. “The Endeavor network gives us access to a collaborative community working to build businesses that create value and social impact,” he said. Dutch entrepreneur Simon Bakker earned a Masters in Economics from the University of Amsterdam, afterwards serving as the managing director for Asia-Pacific at Fidelity National Information Services, a US banking and payments technology company. He arrived in the Philippines in 1994. His first venture was as co-founder of Enderun Colleges. As the company grew, the founders took in more partners that left Bakker thirsting to start his own company. Inspired by his homeland’s connection to the chocolate industry, Simon started a business that involved buying cacao beans from Filipino farmers in 2011. Soon after, he met with buying representatives and shared success stories of consolidated growership programs around the world. While most growership arrangements only offer support in one area— such as planting and using fertilizers—Simon believed a true end-to-end support organization could increase overall productivity, revenue, and social impact. Though the Philippines has farmed cacao for over 300 years, it has historically been a low-yield, backyard crop. Simon hired agronomists to develop cacao growing and post-harvest technology and worked with local banks to develop cacao loan programs to help farmers establish new farms. Today, Kennemer supplies best-in-industry knowledge, planting materials, fertilizers, and loan products, multiplying the productivity of Philippine smallholder farmers by four times on average to bring a 300-600 percent increase in their annual income. This not only supplies Kennemer with a steady source of high-quality fermented cocoa beans to export to global clients but also transforms the lives of millions of smallholder farmers. “The ISP was a rare experience. The Endeavor panelist provided me with valuable feedback on how to further scale up our cacao sourcing model. At the same time, the interaction with my fellow entrepreneurs from various regions in the world was truly inspiring,” Bakker said. play_circle_filled Duterte confirms existence of DDS during martial law March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Duterte to CA: Allow Gina Lopez to present her mining stance March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Nationwide smoking ban to include indoor cigarette use, says Palace March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Palace: There was a 'certain attempt' to influence Duterte financially March 07, 2017 TAGS: Business, Cacao, Filipino financial technology (fintech) For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.

Medical expenses are a burden whenever they hit, but a recent study found they’re most common around the first few months of the year. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) Share story By SARAH SKIDMORE SELL The Associated Press Medical expenses are a burden whenever they hit, but a recent study found they’re most common around this time of year. The study found that one in six families makes a major medical payment in any given year, and they tended to occur in the first few months of the year. The study found the median payment was $1,143 and most households take more than a year to recover from the hit. Although the reason for the timing is unclear, researchers at economic think tank JP Morgan Chase Institute who conducted the study hypothesize that people are either putting off treatment or bill paying until tax refund time when they can afford it, or simply facing a fresh new set of deductibles and other out-of-pocket insurance expenses to meet for the year. We gathered a few expert tips for managing the pain of medical expenses: Most Read Stories Hit man in San Antonio murder-for-hire slaying set to die Exhausted mom needs sleep before marriage crumbles | Dear Carolyn Dick’s Drive-In to open new location — and you can vote on where Is your kid absent more than classmates?

SAVE It’s much easier to bear big expenses when you have some emergency savings. If you don’t have much set aside, you aren’t alone. Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Start small, automate your savings and try to keep your hands off it unless you really need it. Other preventative steps include staying within your health insurer’s network or bundling your care so you reach deductibles sooner. You may also want to get an estimate of costs ahead of time so you can better prepare. Some providers and insurers will help with this or you can use Amino, a free online service that estimates the costs of many common health care procedures. VERIFY Review all your bills carefully when they arrive. About half of medical bills contain errors, said Caitlin Donovan of the National Patient Advocate Foundation. Make sure you are being billed only for services and goods you received. If you feel like you are being billed for something that should be covered by insurance, reach out to your plan for an explanation. You can also appeal any decision by your insurer not to pay. There are companies that will audit bills for you to make sure they are correct. Some, like Remedy, will only take a percentage of what they save you as payment. You can also reach out to a patient advocate organization for assistance. SEEK AID If you cannot foot the bill at all, seek help as soon as possible. Hospitals are often willing to negotiate the amount you owe or set up a payment plan. Ask if they have a financial assistance plan or know of one that could help you. There are many nonprofit organizations set up specifically to help people manage their medical bills. Also consider seeking help from friends or family with a crowdfunding page, such as Gofundme.com.

The study found that one in six families makes a major medical payment in any given year, and they tended to occur in the first few months of the year.

You may also want to get an estimate of costs ahead of time so you can better prepare. Some providers and insurers will help with this or you can use Amino, a free online service that estimates the costs of many common health care procedures. VERIFY Review all your bills carefully when they arrive. About half of medical bills contain errors, said Caitlin Donovan of the National Patient Advocate Foundation.

The study found that one in six families makes a major medical payment in any given year, and they tended to occur in the first few months of the year. The study found the median payment was $1,143 and most households take more than a year to recover from the hit. Although the reason for the timing is unclear, researchers at economic think tank JP Morgan Chase Institute who conducted the study hypothesize that people are either putting off treatment or bill paying until tax refund time when they can afford it, or simply facing a fresh new set of deductibles and other out-of-pocket insurance expenses to meet for the year. What impact will the Trump administration have on feds? Read the latest in our First 100 Days section. We gathered a few expert tips for managing the pain of medical expenses: Advertisement SAVE It’s much easier to bear big expenses when you have some emergency savings. If you don’t have much set aside, you aren’t alone. Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Start small, automate your savings and try to keep your hands off it unless you really need it. Other preventative steps include staying within your health insurer’s network or bundling your care so you reach deductibles sooner. You may also want to get an estimate of costs ahead of time so you can better prepare. Some providers and insurers will help with this or you can use Amino, a free online service that estimates the costs of many common health care procedures. VERIFY Review all your bills carefully when they arrive. About half of medical bills contain errors, said Caitlin Donovan of the National Patient Advocate Foundation. Make sure you are being billed only for services and goods you received. If you feel like you are being billed for something that should be covered by insurance, reach out to your plan for an explanation. You can also appeal any decision by your insurer not to pay. There are companies that will audit bills for you to make sure they are correct. Some, like Remedy, will only take a percentage of what they save you as payment. You can also reach out to a patient advocate organization for assistance. SEEK AID If you cannot foot the bill at all, seek help as soon as possible. Hospitals are often willing to negotiate the amount you owe or set up a payment plan. Ask if they have a financial assistance plan or know of one that could help you. There are many nonprofit organizations set up specifically to help people manage their medical bills. Also consider seeking help from friends or family with a crowdfunding page, such as Gofundme.com.

But by September 2016, the share of loans by these three big banks dropped to 21 percent. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, FILE)   Michele Lerner The Washington Post     Most borrowers, whether they are purchasing property or refinancing their home, focus on their mortgage rate and loan terms rather than the type of lender they choose. Yet the landscape of the lending market has shifted dramatically over the past few years from domination by big banks to a market where more loans are made by non-banks -- financial institutions that only make loans and do not offer deposit accounts such as a savings account or checking account. "For consumers, it doesn't really matter whether you get your loan through a bank or a non-bank, although in some ways non-banks are a little more nimble and can offer more loan products," said Paul Noring, a managing director of the financial-risk-management practice of Navigant Consulting in Washington, D.C. "The impact is bigger on the housing market overall, because without the non-banks we would be even further behind where we should be in terms of the number of transactions." In 2011, 50 percent of all new mortgage money was loaned by the three biggest banks in the United States: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. But by September 2016, the share of loans by these three big banks dropped to 21 percent. At the same time, six of the top 10 largest lenders by volume were non-banks, such as Quicken Loans, loanDepot and PHH Mortgage, compared with just two of the top 10 in 2011. --- Before the financial crisis, mortgages were the last thing a consumer would default on, Noring said. "That flipped in 2009, when people started defaulting on their mortgages first," he said. "That was a tsunami for everyone in the mortgage business, and we're still seeing the fallout. Lenders were not prepared to deal with it and didn't do a great job, plus new rules were coming out that they needed to follow." The withdrawal of banks from the mortgage business is the result of the fundamental shift in regulations that took place in response to the housing crisis, said Meg Burns, managing director of the Collingwood Group, an adviser for financial services companies in D.C. "The regulatory atmosphere changed from a risk-management regime to a zero-tolerance and 100-percent-compliance regime," Burns said. "Not only were new regulations implemented, but new regulators like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were created. At the same time, the CFPB and other agencies became more assertive in their enforcement practices." Burns said that stepped-up regulations from the CFPB include prescriptive rules that pinpoint exactly how lenders are to make loan decisions. "The intent should be to broadly make sure borrowers can repay their loans and sustain homeownership instead of this narrow approach," Burns said. "In the face of stiff penalties and aggressive scrutiny, banks were left with a tremendous uncertainty and risk that made it hard to keep lending." Jeffrey Taylor, managing partner of Digital Risk, a provider of mortgage-processing services and risk analytics in Maitland, Florida, said that while the post-crisis regulations were well-intentioned, the result was to make banks more cautious. "Now banks only approve 'perfect' loans, not 'good-enough' loans," Taylor said. "This created an opportunity for non-banks that focus entirely on mortgages and are less regulated than big banks." The cost of complying with new regulations and the risk of making mistakes drove many banks to reduce their mortgage business, said Rick Sharga, chief marketing officer of Ten-X, an online real estate marketplace in Irvine, California. "Headline risk is another element of this, because if the media perceives you're doing something incorrectly, it can really hurt your entire business," he said. In the initial aftermath of the housing crisis and the debacle of loan defaults, banks began to add their own overlays, which are loan-approval guidelines and fees that go beyond the requirements of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Not only have banks reduced their mortgage loan volume, but the entire private market of investors in mortgages disappeared in 2007 and 2008 and, unlike other financial markets, has yet to come back, Wachter said. "The aftermath of the crisis was lots of litigation and a decline in trust across the board," Wachter said. Banks were forced to pay fines and to take back loans that were considered flawed. At the same time, they were required to meet stress tests and have more capital on their books in case they have to handle more defaults, Wachter said. "Non-banks don't have to have capital, which could mean that taxpayers are more exposed than in 2009 if numerous defaults take place among loans made by non-banks," Wachter said. Noring said that non-banks were more lightly regulated in the initial aftermath of the housing crisis, although in the past two years, regulators have stepped up their scrutiny of these lenders. Non-banks are regulated in every state where they are licensed to provide loans, said David Norris, chief revenue officer for loanDepot in Foothill Ranch, California. "Prior to the financial meltdown, loan-guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were substantially lower for banks compared to non-banks, but as part of the financial reform, those fees are now similar for all types of lenders," Norris said. "Now banks and non-banks are competing on a level playing field, which encouraged more non-banks to increase their business." Many large banks have reduced their FHA loan business. Burns said FHA loans were created to serve people with a riskier profile, but she said the recent zero-tolerance policy of the Justice Department has undermined this loan program. "Lenders were supposed to use good judgment on FHA loan approvals, such as looking at the continuity and stability of the borrower's income," Burns said. "The DOJ has used the False Claims Act to target banks in particular to fine them for defects in loan files. But a 'perfect' loan is pretty much impossible, particularly for borrowers applying for FHA loans." FHA loans appeal to first-time buyers and lower-income borrowers, who are perceived to be more likely to default on a loan, Norris said. He said non-banks are originating more FHA loans to make up for the lack of banks offering the loans. --- Many banks now limit their loans to conventional 30-year fixed-rate loans for borrowers who neatly fit into the approval box, said Sharga of Ten-X. "Banks are also approving jumbo loans for high-net-worth individuals that they keep as portfolio loans," Sharga said. "They are offering these loans so they can sell other banking services to those customers." During the last housing boom, many non-bank lenders targeted subprime borrowers, he said. "This time around, the non-bank lenders are not being reckless," Sharga said. "Some offer loans to borrowers with lower FICO scores, but they are still not making risky loans. Consumers are benefiting from non-banks because they offer more opportunities to borrowers who are not perfect." On the negative side, though, Sharga said that competition from non-banks has contributed to the closing of many community banks, which particularly hurts communities that are geographically underserved. The entire ecosystem of the mortgage markets is fragile, said Burns, which has a chilling effect on the economy. "The lack of access to credit not only hurts consumers, but it hurts builders and therefore contributes to the lack of affordable housing," Burns said. "That, in turn, has an impact on the broader economy, because housing construction impacts a lot of segments such as banking, construction workers, home-improvement businesses and more." The pullback in lending from banks contributes to the overall decline in homeownership, said Burns, because people with a slightly risky credit profile are underserved. "The expansion of non-banks in response is a good thing, but we're still missing a million or more homeowners, in part because many millennials are still not able to get credit through traditional means," Wachter said. "For good or bad, consumers with marginal credit scores and unverifiable income are out of the market now." --- Rather than decide on a bank or non-bank, many borrowers focus primarily on the price of their loan or opt for a lender that provides them with other financial services or one recommended by a real estate company or builder they are using for a purchase. According to the J.D. Power 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study, 27 percent of first-time buyers regret their choice of a lender and 21 percent of all borrowers regret their choice. The most common reasons for dissatisfaction include lack of communication, unmet promises or feeling pressured to choose a particular loan. But choosing one type of lender over another is no guarantee of satisfaction. The top 10 most highly rated mortgage providers in the survey are evenly split between banks and non-banks. Digital Risk's Taylor said banks and non-banks are aware that customers who don't feel as if they are well-served will find another provider, which is why so many financial institutions are investing heavily in technology. "It's a race to improve the customer experience," he said. "Borrowers realize that there's not a lot of difference between loan providers on pricing, so they focus on the ease of the loan process and the service they receive." Taylor said there are generational differences in the way consumers approach borrowing money. "Generation Xers and baby boomers have more loyalty to their financial institutions and tend to look first for a credit card, a car loan or a mortgage to their bank," he said. "Millennials don't feel the same way and prefer to start with an internet search for their best mortgage options." --- Rising interest rates and anticipated deregulation under the Trump administration could change the mortgage-lending business again and impact the volume of loans. "We're likely to see more banks come back into the mortgage market as interest rates rise, because there's more profit to be made," Wachter said. "But demand will be down because fewer people will refinance and because affordability issues will mean that first-time buyers are still missing from the market." Sharga said that rising rates increase profitability but also reduce refinancing, which forces lenders to compete harder for purchase-loan business, so even borrowers with a few minor issues with their loan application may qualify for a loan. "Higher interest rates will cause funding costs to rise for non-banks, since they have to borrow money from capital markets to make their loans," said Navigant Consulting's Noring. "That could mean a rebalancing among lenders because banks fund their loans with deposits." Burns, however, thinks addressing regulatory issues will have a bigger impact on the lending atmosphere than rising rates. "The mortgage industry is overregulated now, so the goal should be to align important safeguards and yet get more investors and lenders back into the market," Taylor said. "I expect we'll see some right-setting of regulations so that different products can come into the mortgage market." In particular, Taylor anticipates the use of different metrics to evaluate borrowers rather than focusing tightly on FICO scores as lenders do now. "There are already opportunities to make smart decisions based on other data, such as Fannie Mae's Day 1 Certainty program that uses independent tools to validate a borrower's income, assets and employment and make it simpler and faster for lenders to approve loans," Taylor said. "The ultimate winner will be customers, because the more clarity a lender has on what it takes to get a loan, the less risk the lender has to take." Both bank and non-bank lenders are impacted by regulations and guidelines from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. "If the Trump administration is successful in relaxing regulations, then the headwinds lenders face could be slowing down," Sharga said. "That would be good for consumers and for the housing market, as long as it doesn't lead to the laxity and craziness of the previous housing boom."

He is co-author of The Next Africa. More posts by this contributor: The secure communications technology company, Symphony, is expanding its customer base. Bred as a Wall Street alternative to Bloomberg’s messaging service, the Palo Alto startup is now targeting clients from law firms to governments. Symphony — which raised at a $1 billion-plus valuation in late 2016 — has a  strategy to “increase seats” (or individual users) based on price, adaptability, and scale. The firm is offering clients more platform customization — opening up APIs for tailored apps and offering tools to integrate analytics services. On price, Symphony’s monthly product fee of $15 per head is comparatively low. This puts it within budgetary reach of non-financial services firms. Symphony is also a cheaper alternative for the Wall Street trading crowd than Bloomberg’s chat tool, which comes on Bloomberg’s Terminal analytics platform with thousand dollar plus monthly fees. “We started in financial services, but there are other markets,” said Symphony CEO David Gurle. “Think about manufacturing, defense, insurance, energy, which are very [business-to-business] centric and the relative value of confidentiality, of data ownership, and security of information is extremely high.” Bloomberg Influence, Goldman Roots Symphony has been touted as a “Bloomberg killer”, launched by a cabal of Wall Street firms in 2014 after Bloomberg News journalists reportedly snooped on Bloomberg Terminal client messages. That’s not exactly the story. An independent review indicated Bloomberg reporters had viewed employee login frequency, rather than message content, of some Terminal clients. And the predecessor to Symphony―an internal Goldman chat platform called LiveCurrent — was already in use dating back to 2012, explained a Goldman Sachs spokesperson. Goldman developed LiveCurrent largely due to the upsurge of non-secure SMS and social media services for messaging and breaking news. Goldman had a limited number of Bloomberg’s $20K plus a head Terminal subscriptions and it was not feasible to expand those only for the secure chat function. “We needed a practical way for the firm’s 30,000 employees to share news and information real-time and  Bloomberg’s Terminal was just too expensive for that,” said the Goldman spokesperson. The firm recognized the value of its messaging app as an industry-wide platform. In 2014, Goldman connected LiveCurrent to a consortium of 14 financial firms (including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and BlackRock), acquired existing messaging startup Perzo for $66 million, and put it all together to launch Symphony. Capturing Seats David Gurle estimates the potential market for Symphony’s secure messaging product at 100 million individual seats, with 8-10 million of those in financial services and 20 million in insurance, education, government, and healthcare. The strategy for capturing those seats is twofold, according to Gurle. Within financial services firms, Symphony looks to leverage the product’s adaptability to “integrate with other systems” and “expand as a collaboration tool…to the rest of the organization.” Outside of finance, Gurle points to the product’s “value proposition to other organizations” and the planned “launch of a salesforce this year to go after them.” Of course, underpinning the success of Symphony and its competitors is the ability to ensure secure communications in a world that’s seen epic digital breaches over the last year. Any major failure carries a high level of reputational risk, according to Gartner Research Director Adam Preset. “Obviously, your business model is in danger if you don’t do the job,” he said. Symphony views both product privacy and usability as key. “We’ve had to develop a system that is both convenient, but with security measures that are unbeatable,” said Gurle, referencing the product’s end-to-end encryption and “two-factor authentication.”  Expanding Playing Field As it pursues a larger client base on Wall Street and beyond, Symphony finds itself in a competitive and expanding marketplace. In financial services, Bloomberg’s Terminal is still dominant. The product’s entry price is $24,000 annually and it has 325,000 users worldwide, according to a Bloomberg rep speaking on background. Bloomberg does not currently offer the option to separate its messaging service from the Terminal for a lower price. Thomson Reuters’ Eikon analytics product―a Bloomberg Terminal rival―offers its Eikon Messenger service on the overall platform or separately for free, according to a company spokesperson. Eikon Messenger users reached 300,000 at the end of 2016, surging after the discontinuation of Yahoo Messenger. Thomson Reuters would not verify how many use its chat service for free vs the paid Eikon platform. The company does not provide public pricing info, but a fully loaded Eikon setup is said to cost roughly $20K annually. Both Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters have taken steps over the last several years to open up APIs and allow greater customization of their analytics product platforms. In its bid to expand, Symphony faces competition from many secure comms providers. Gartner’s Preset highlights two categories. “There are services that do secure communications, instant messaging, email, and serve audit and compliance purposes, and integrate with third-party systems,” he said. “Then there are others that focus purely on just a secure mobile vending app.” Similar to Symphony and Bloomberg’s IP, Preset named Global Relay and Ice Chat as confidential comms services with more expansive B2B application and functionality. He highlighted Wickr and Signal as apps with more crossover to general institutional and personal use. “There are about 60 different vendors out there solving the problem of secure messaging across different verticals. It’s extremely competitive,” said Preset. In the financial services chat and analytics world — given the resources behind Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters products — Symphony is more likely to force greater adaptability and downward price pressure than to kill either of the leaders off. And in the broader secure comms market, time will tell if Symphony can tap the growing demand faster than a crowded list of competitors.

Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article Walter T. Yurt, an American travel writer based in Kuala Lumpur. – Pictures by Choo Choy MayKUALA LUMPUR, March 5 — Walter T. Yurt is used to being stared at. A tall, bald American man, he is a formidable presence despite his gentle giant demeanour. Whether it’s visiting his friend’s family in rural Kedah or exploring the majestic Angkor Wat in Cambodia, he’s used to standing out and attracting curious attention from locals. Which is a fantastic thing when you’re travel writer collecting experiences and stories. The author of two books, Finding Myself: The Adventures of An American in Malaysia and its sequel Finding My World: The Further Adventures of an American in South-east Asia and Beyond, Yurt hails from Louisville, Kentucky. He recalls an idyllic childhood with his parents and younger sister, in “one of the coolest neighbourhoods in America, best known for housing hippies to hipsters throughout the decades. Our family home is about equidistant between the Kentucky Fried Chicken world headquarters and Colonel Sanders’ grave.” Growing up, Yurt went to Saint Xavier High School, where one of his fellow students was Tommy Mapother (perhaps better known to the world at large as Tom Cruise). He credits his parents for giving him the travel bug during these formative years: “I can still remember sitting in the family car at age 10 and seeing the skyline of New York City for the first time. The feeling that one day I wanted to live in a big city with big skyscrapers like NYC has; little did I know that that city, decades later, would end up being Kuala Lumpur.” After years of working for large corporations such as Ford Motor Company and JP Morgan Chase, Yurt found himself getting retrenched as the 2008 financial crisis lurked around the corner. He recalls, “I decided to expand my job search internationally. Within weeks I had been put in touch with a Malaysian woman who was running an English school in Kuala Lumpur. Two weeks after that I was offered, and accepted a teaching position here.” Throughout his life, Yurt had always been fascinated with Asian culture therefore his move to Malaysia, mere months after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, felt like perfect timing. Besides teaching students for the first time (teaching being a childhood dream), he also made full use of the opportunity to travel around Malaysia and South-east Asia. According to Yurt, his Malaysian friends would tease him about how he is more Malaysian than they are. He says, “They tell me I have been to more places in Malaysia than they have and participate in more cultural events here than they do. Malaysia fits me like a glove and I have fallen in love with Malaysian food (as my waistline will attest). I truly, truly love it here — Malaysia is home for me.” Yurt’s travel adventures became fodder for his books, which delve deep into experiences with the places he has been and the people he has encountered. He says, “When I write about an event like Thaipusam, where I get incredibly, emotionally moved by who and what I am surrounded by, I can’t help but try my best to give my readers a true sense of what I am feeling. The same goes for my experiences at Angkor Wat or the Killing Fields in Cambodia or spending a few incredible days in a 160-million-year-old rainforest that Taman Negara is!” Yurt’s two books, Finding Myself: The Adventures of An American in Malaysia and Finding My World: The Further Adventures of an American in South-east Asia and BeyondOutside of Kuala Lumpur, Yurt’s favourite city is Phnom Penh. He explains, “It’s compact and convenient, and there’s all that beautiful Khmer architecture. More importantly, it’s the Cambodian people and their history that I witnessed in my lifetime, growing up in the States. It really affected me. How these people are so friendly and open despite the horrors of war before.” Beyond sharing travel stories, Yurt hopes to let his “readers know they can take huge chances in their lives; great leaps of faith like I did when I left everyone and everything I had ever loved and moved to Malaysia. And that those great leaps of faith can not only work out, but can give them experiences that they have never even dreamt of!” Looking back at when he made the momentous decision to find a new life in Malaysia, Yurt remembers how family and friends thought he was crazy. “Still, no one stopped me and my parents were very supportive, as they’ve always been. “My advice to others in the same situation would be to ‘Just do it!’ Don’t keep thinking. The worst that could happen is you don’t like the place; you can always go home or move to another city. Find a place that fits your personality, rather than chase the money trail.” While Yurt has found a place where he truly belongs in Malaysia, he feels his Malaysian friends have the opposite problem — the nagging thought that they would be better off starting a new life elsewhere. He explains, “I always tell them, my very good and smart Malaysian friends, ‘Don’t leave. Malaysia needs you.’ The grass isn’t always greener on the other side.” Yurt’s passion may be in travelling and seeing more of the world but he is grateful for finding a real home away from home. He says, “Whether I’m in the States or in Malaysia, it’s great to be in two places where literally millions of people want to come to – to work, to live, to start new lives. I can’t say that about most countries I’ve visited but I can for my homeland and my adopted country. I just wish more Malaysians realised this.” Perhaps making a home for oneself allows one to keep exploring. From “The Little Gidding”, the last of T. S. Eliot’s Four Quartets: “We shall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time.” For Yurt, arriving where he first started may not be returning to Kentucky but to his original desire to see more of the world. He has seen, and he will keep exploring, and he will always experience every place with fresh eyes, always for the first time. Yurt’s books are now available at MPH Bookstores.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fury over ‘degrading’ Saint Laurent ad campaign Slipping and sliding in 'awfully' tough wife-carrying event (VIDEO) After a partner dies, mourning the loss of sex Breaking the bank: Thai vets remove 915 coins from turtle Works inspired by the memory of Zaha Hadid on show at Design Shanghai Fury over ‘degrading’ Saint Laurent ad campaign Brazilian-Chinese model is Miss Universe Malaysia 2017 Salt x Paper: Bringing beautiful stationery to Sabah Kentucky to Kuala Lumpur: How an American ‘found himself’ in Malaysia Forced smiles mask pain of Hong Kong’s trafficked bar girls Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Allen Parker, the former presiding partner of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, has been tapped to serve as Wells Fargo & Co.’s general counsel. The corporate partner stepped down as the firm’s presiding partner in January, the Financial Times reports. Parker practiced with Cravath for more than 25 years and replaces James Strother, who served as Wells Fargo’s general counsel since 2003. Last week, the bank cut compensation for eight top executives, including Strother, the American Lawyer reports. The move followed allegations that Wells employees opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ permission as part of an alleged scheme led by sales goals and potential bonuses. The bank agreed to settle the claims for $185 million, according to the article, and has set aside $1.7 billion for potential future litigation. Tim Sloan, the bank’s president and CEO, who also was denied a 2016 bonus and other compensation, described Parker as an “extraordinary leader and strategic adviser” in a statement. “Allen is well known throughout the legal and financial services industries not only for advising some of the world’s largest companies on their most complex legal matters but also for his strong character, integrity and high ethical standards,” Sloan wrote. “His background and corporate experience make him the ideal leader for this role as his efforts will be instrumental in helping our company continue to rebuild trust, make things right with customers, and build a better Wells Fargo.” Parker, who currently is based in New York, is expected to begin the new position March 27, at Wells’ San Francisco headquarters. Strother will stay to help with the transition, the bank said. A Columbia Law School graduate, Parker joined Cravath in 1984. He became a partner in 1990, and his clients include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup and DreamWorks Studios. He was selected as the firm’s presiding partner in 2012, succeeding Evan Chesler, who now serves as the firm’s chairman. Parker also chaired its diversity committee until recently. “Over the last 25 years, Allen has been one of the most respected banking lawyers in the United States, a highly valued and admired partner in our firm, and a mentor to countless young people,” Faiza Saeed, Cravath’s current presiding partner, said in a statement. “We are so pleased that Allen will now be joining our client of many years, Wells Fargo, and we look forward to continuing our relationship with him in this new capacity.” Previous: As funding for immigration enforcement increases, so will court backlog Filed under: In-house Counsel | Careers You might also like: If workplaces want to cut back on burnout, vacation email bans may be a good start Chadbourne gave bonuses to 44% of male and only 28% of female partners in 2015, says equal pay suit As a college journalist, SCOTUS nominee Gorsuch defended conservatism, gave space to the other side Trump's cabinet has fewer lawyers than in past administrations Yahoo's general counsel resigns after report finds lawyers didn't adequately respond to hack View the comments for this story We welcome your comments, but please adhere to our comment policy and the ABA Code of Conduct.

Banks gave back some of their recent gains after a jump in interest rates last week sent them sharply higher. Mining and chemical companies declined after China cut its economic growth forecast, and airlines slumped after a Delta said its business isn't improving as fast as it hoped. There were few winners to be found on Wall Street as more than two-thirds of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange fell. That included consistent losses for banks, investment firms and insurance companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 7.81 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,375.31. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 51.37 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 20,954.34. The Nasdaq composite lost 21.58 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5,849.17. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks sank 9.88 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 1,384.25. All four indexes reached all-time highs last week, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have risen for six weeks in a row. That's on top of a big surge in November and December. Those rapid gains the last few months have prompted some analysts to turn cautious. "We think there's a reasonable chance at the end of the year we'll be a little bit lower than we are right now," said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Over the weekend Premier Li Keqiang, China's top economic official, trimmed the country's growth target to 6.5 per cent. The Chinese economy is the second-largest in the world, and the prospect of slower growth there hurt mining, packaging and chemical companies and sent the price of copper lower. But investors weren't nearly as alarmed about the latest signs of slowing growth in China as they were in the past. Stocks plunged in early 2016 as investors worried the Chinese economy might weaken in a hurry and drag the global economy down with it. Wren said Wall Street now thinks growth in China will slow down gradually. "The market's pretty comfortable with this controlled slowdown," he said. "A lot of that sell-off was due to the fear that Chinese growth was ... basically going to collapse," he said. Delta Air Lines gave a disappointing revenue projection for the second quarter and its stock lost $1.28, or 2.6 per cent, to $48.85. United and American Airlines each fell 3 per cent. Poultry companies slumped after 70,000 chickens were killed at a Tennessee farm after a bird flu outbreak was discovered there. The affected farm is a supplier to Tyson Foods, and while Tyson said it doesn't expect its business to suffer, the new brought back bad memories for investors: in 2015, U.S. poultry producers lost 48 million birds to a different strain of the virus. Tyson stock gave up $1.61, or 2.5 per cent, to $61.99. Sanderson Farms gave up $1.86, or 2 per cent, to $92.53 and Pilgrim's Pride lost 25 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to $20.70. French automaker PSA Group agreed to buy General Motors' European business, which has lost $20 billion since 1999 and hasn't made an annual profit over that span. Investors were glad to see it go, as GM's stock jumped almost 5 per cent when the talks were disclosed last month. PSA makes Peugeot and Citroen cars, and the addition of the Opel and Vauxhall brands will make it the second-largest automaker in Europe. Its stock rose 2.7 per cent. GM's stock dipped 32 cents to $37.91. Bond prices continued to slip. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.49 per cent from 2.48 per cent. Bond yields jumped last week as investors grew more certain the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month. Companies that pay big dividends, like real estate investment trusts, fell again. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of their high yields, and higher bond yields make them less appealing to investors. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 13 cents to $53.20 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, picked up 11 cents to $56.01 a barrel in London. Natural gas companies rose as futures jumped 2.6 per cent to $2.90 per 1,000 cubic feet. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.67 a gallon and heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.60 a gallon. Gold fell $1 to $1,225.50 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $17.77 an ounce. Copper lost 4 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $2.65 a pound. The dollar inched down to 113.92 yen from 114.05 yen. The euro dipped to $1.0588 from $1.0605. In Germany the DAX fell 0.6 per cent. France's CAC 40 slipped 0.5 per cent and the FTSE 100 in Britain shed 0.3 per cent. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index fell 0.5 per cent and the South Korean Kospi gained 0.1 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 0.2 per cent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Marley Jay, The Associated Press ©2017 The Canadian Press Share Twitter Facebook Google+ Reddit Forward Topics:  International Join the Discussion 650 CKOM is happy to provide a forum for commenting and discussion.

Japan’s benchmark edged lower, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose as China’s finance minister expressed confidence over the government’s ability to handle rising levels of debt. KEEPING SCORE: The Nikkei 225 stock index in Tokyo edged 0.2 percent lower to 19,345.49 but most other indexes gained. The Hang Seng gained 0.3 percent to 23,673.80 and the Shanghai Composite index was flat at 3,234.76. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 climbed 0.2 percent to 5,755.10 and South Korea’s Kospi was up 0.5 percent to 2,091.14. Shares in Taiwan and Southeast Asia were higher. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks finished lower Monday for the second time in the last three trading days, with losses in banks, investment firms and insurance companies. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 0.3 percent to 2,375.31, the Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.2 percent to 20,954.34 and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.4 percent to 5,849.17. Some analysts have turned cautious after the rapid gains of recent months. TRUMP WATCH: Without any major financial news to drive trading, investors are watching for the latest developments from the U.S. Federal Reserve and U.S. President Donald Trump. Overnight, Trump’s administration released a revised version of border restrictions for travelers from majority-Muslim countries.

ANALYST VIEWPOINT: “‘Trump on, Trump off’ (TOTO) is the new ‘risk on, risk off,'” Chris Weston of IG said in a commentary. Trump’s revised travel restrictions for travelers from majority-Muslim countries would have limited impact in Asia, since none of the countries directly affected are in the region. “Again, this story is not really one for markets to be concerned with, but it highlights the lack of news focus in the session.” CHINA CONFIDENCE: China’s financial minister, Xiao Jie, told reporters risks from financing were manageable. “China’s government debt risks are generally within control,” the official Xinhua News Agency cited Xiao as saying on the sidelines of the annual session of the national legislature. He said total net debt amounted to 27.33 trillion yuan (about $3.96 trillion dollars) or about 36.7 percent of the country’s GDP.
