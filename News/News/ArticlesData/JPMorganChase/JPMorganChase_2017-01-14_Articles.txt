A big part of the recent gains for stocks like JPMorgan ( JPM : up +23.1% since November 8th), Bank of America ( BAC : up +34.8% in that time period) and others reflect market participants' hopes that the incoming administration will roll back all or most of the regulatory constraints, implement tax reform, and give the U.S. economy's growth trajectory a positive nudge. But the more tangible catalyst for bank earnings, particularly this earnings season, has been the post-election uptrend in interest rates. We didn't really see the full impact of higher interest rates on the banks' net interest margins in Q4 results. But higher interest rates, increased confidence and the resultant enhanced appetite for risks did juice JPMorgan and Bank of America's trading revenues. JPMorgan's trading revenues were up +24% from the year-earlier level, with fixed income trading revenues up +31%. Bank of America showed strong gains in fixed income trading as well, with the bank's Q4 fixed income trading revenues up +12% from the year-earlier level. This momentum in trading revenues offers favorable read-throughs for Goldman Sachs ( GS ), which reports next week (Jan. 18th) and has a storied trading franchise. Morgan Stanley ( MS ), which reports a day ahead of Goldman, has been reducing its trading business over the last many years. It is still fairly early, with results from only 5 Finance sector companies in the S&P 500 (out of 90 total) out already, but these 5 companies are the some of the largest in the entire index and account for more than a quarter of the sector's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 5 Finance sector companies are up +15.6% from the same period last year on +1.4% higher revenues, with all 5 beating EPS estimates but only 2 beating top-line estimates. This is better earnings growth than we have seen from the same group of 5 banks in other recent periods, which is having a favorable impact on the aggregate Q4 growth expectation for the sector as a whole. Total Q4 earnings for the Finance sector as a whole, combining the reported actuals with the still-to-come estimates, are expected to be up +17.1% from the same period last year. The table below shows the sector's Q4 earnings growth expectations at the medium-industry level contrasted with estimates for the following four quarters and actual results for the preceding three periods. Please note that the Major Banks industry, of which JPMorgan, Bank of America and others are part, accounts for roughly 45% of the sector's total earnings (insurance is the second biggest earnings contributor, accounting for about 25% of the total). The sector's growth pace for the quarter remains in double-digits even after we adjust for the easy comparisons at AIG ( AIG ). Excluding AIG, the sector's Q4 earnings would be up +11.7%. The sector's earnings are on track to be flat in 2016. But they were expected to be up materially in 2017 and 2018 even before the aforementioned favorable developments. The chart below shows the sector's annual earnings growth expectations. With a number of policy oriented developments still to unfold after the new administration takes office, it is reasonable expect positive revisions to these expectations. And if that is the case, then bank stocks should continue their momentum. Valuations have no doubt caught up with underlying fundamentals, but they are by no means stretched relative to historical periods, particularly given the emerging interest rate trajectory. Q4 Scorecard ( as of Friday, January 13th ) With Q4 results from 29 S&P 500 members already on the books, total earnings are up +11.2% on +3.1% higher revenues, with 69% beating EPS estimates and 44.8% coming ahead of top-line expectations. The table below provides the current Q4 scorecard The charts below provide a comparison of the results thus far with what we have seen from this same group of 29 S&P 500 members in other recent periods. As you can see, the Q4 growth pace, particularly for earnings, is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 29 index members in other recent periods. But positive surprises seem to be hard to come by, with revenue surprises particularly on the weak side. That said, the sample size is still on the small side and will most likely shift as the reporting cycle ramps up this week. We have 81 companies reporting results this week, including 34 S&P 500 members. The chart below shows the weekly summary reporting calendar for companies in the S&P 500 index. Q4 Expectations As a Whole For Q4 as a whole, total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up +4.2% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.8% growth in Q3 earnings on +2.3% higher revenues, the first instance of positive earnings growth for the index after five quarters of back-to-back declines. Comparisons for the Energy sector, a big driver of the earnings recession, turn positive in Q4, with the sector's earnings growth turning positive for the first time after 8 quarters of declines. The chart below shows that positive earnings growth resumed in 2016 Q3 after 5 quarters of declines, with the growth pace expected to improve in Q4 and ramp up notably in the following quarters. The table below shows the summary picture Q4 contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding quarter.

U.S. stock indexes moved higher in early trading Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 as investors pored over earnings reports from several big lenders. Banks and other financial companies were up the most. Utilities were the biggest laggard. Energy stocks also fell as crude oil prices headed lower. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Story continues below video × Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell.

The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Is Trump Making CEO Bank Accounts Great Again? Posted on January 13, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann Donald Trump is still a week away from becoming the 45th president of the United States. Yet that hasn’t stopped him from making CEO stock options great again. That’s the thrust of a recent Reuters story on the big gains in CEO stock option values since the billionaire businessman won the White House. Here’s the first, and quite compelling, paragraph from the article: Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as “the worst banker in the United States,” but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) $50 million richer. Becoming $50 million richer since the election isn’t too shabby. So, if you’re a bit jealous of Mr. Dimon right now, I understand. The story point outs that the JPMorgan chief is just one of many high-profile CEOs to run companies where the share prices have spiked since Election Day. Reuters conducted an analysis of CEO option grants from the companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It found that things really are great again for many of the world’s top chief executives. Image credit: mandelman.ml-implode.com Per Reuters: Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump’s election win. Reuters said that the figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015, and not options that expired or vested in 2016. The Reuters analysis pointed out that Jamie Dimon has seen his stock options spike in value by more than $50 million to $146 million since the election. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein, a company that candidate Trump criticized harshly during the campaign, witnessed his stock options go from being worthless to being worth more than $11 million in a matter of weeks. Again, per the Reuters piece: Blankfein’s 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Now, I don’t know which candidate for president Mr. Blankfein or Mr. Dimon voted for on Nov. 8, but I do know that both are Democrats. So, I presume that means they probably didn’t vote for Donald Trump (although I can’t be certain). My point here is not to comment on either executive’s vote. Nor is it to criticize CEO compensation in general, or to demonize those who have benefited mightily since Election Day. Related story: The Rich Got $237 Billion Richer in the ‘Year of Populism’ Rather, I want you to realize that the reality of investing (as well as the reality of life) is that — regardless of whether you love or hate the current state of politics or the politicians in charge — you need to know that even the whiff of the proposals proffered by them can really move markets. Goldman Sachs’ stock has soared 27% since Election Day, and JPM is up 18.2% in the same time frame. We’ve seen that already, not just in the Dow, but also in the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and particularly the Nasdaq-100, which is up nearly 4% so far in this young 2017. In all of 2016, the Nasdaq-100 was up just 5.9%. The willingness on the part of Wall Street to, so far, buy into the Trump pro-growth, anti-regulation, lower-tax proposals reflects the optimism wafting throughout the country that we may indeed see a renewal of economic activity that “makes America great again.” Yet be forewarned here that if a President Trump and the Republican majority in Congress fail to deliver on the agenda Wall Street has bought into, then things could get very uncomfortable for the bulls … and very quickly. *** What say you about the increase in stock options for top executives in the Dow? Do you think Wall Street will continue buying into the Trump optimism trade? I’d love it if you shared your thoughts with me, and to do so all you have to do is leave me a comment on our website or send me an e-mail. *** Stocks finished the week slightly lower, although certain sectors (financials) helped buoy the major averages after strong earnings reports. The Nasdaq Composite closed at another record high. So did the FTSE 100 Index, which marked the UK’s 14th-straight day of gains. • Financials were the star of the trading show Friday, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported a beat on both its top and bottom lines for the fourth quarter thanks to solid performance across all its businesses. • Bank of America (BAC) also reported better-than-expected earnings Friday morning; however, revenue came in slightly below forecasts. The one bank that failed to impress was scandal-plagued Wells Fargo (WFC). The company missed on both earnings and revenue in Q4. • Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the House of Representatives passed a budget bill Friday that is a procedural step toward repealing the “Affordable Care Act.” By a vote of 227-to-198, the House approved a budget resolution that instructs committees to write plans for repealing much of the law commonly known as Obamacare. The Senate approved the measure on Thursday. • On the security front, the TSA reported that a record number of guns — 3,391 — were discovered in passengers’ carry-on bags at American airports in 2016, up 28% from the year before. That’s an average of nine firearms per day. Good luck and happy investing, Brad Hoppmann Publisher Uncommon Wisdom Daily Your thoughts on “Is Trump Making CEO Bank Accounts Great Again?” Books says: January 13, 2017 at 7:01 pm Yep, the top people gain billions and the poor lose their healthcare and pensions. Reply Billy says: January 13, 2017 at 11:09 pm Hi Brad, This CEO compensation is simply disgusting! And all they are doing are coat tailing the final rally before problems set in with respect to capital markets. Should be the old buy the election sell the inauguration!!! Look, there is absolutely no question that Donald Trump will try to fix more things in Government than has been done by the last 8 presidents combined , but just him being president ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT solve the major imbalances of the world, namely the Worldwide and specifically European Sovereign DEBT CRISIS…We are absolutely overdue for a major stock market correction, which WILL ABSOLUTELY take place. A world with over $400 TRILLION in DEBT is extremely alarming, especially against a rising dollar, terrible demographics, massive overbuilding, especially in the commercial real estate sector, a shrinking middle class and most importantly, a millennium generation that is delaying family formation way into the future. Reply Paula says: January 14, 2017 at 1:28 pm Unintentionally. Trump is not in office yet, Obama is still in. The market went haywire because those who bought saw an opportunity to make money with the new administration coming in. People and businesses were euphoric. Also, the Fed raised interest rates which also made CEO’s smile, again, with a “democratic”administration. Reply Eleanor Allert says: January 14, 2017 at 3:29 pm Apparently Wall Street has already changed its mind about the Trump boost since his press conference. Is it possible he could still be presidential? Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 13, 2017 at 6:08PM The Chase Tower in Dallas, Texas. Image source: Wikimedia Commons. If it wasn't clear before, it certainly is after fourth-quarter earnings: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has emerged as one of the biggest winners in the bank industry over the past decade. The bank reported on Friday that its earnings in the final three months of last year soared by $1.3 billion, or 24%, compared to the year-ago period. "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year, reflecting our intense client focus and solid performance across our businesses," noted chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon in prepared remarks. All told, JPMorgan Chase earned $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter. That's an enormous amount of money that puts the New York-based bank in a league of its own. The next two biggest banks in the United States -- Bank of America and Wells Fargo -- don't even come close, each earning less than $5 billion over the same three-month stretch. Data source: Fourth-quarter earnings releases. Chart by author. Elevated trading revenue JPMorgan's results were fueled by a surge in trading revenue, as the bank is one of -- if not the -- largest market maker on Wall Street.  The bank had said in December that its trading revenues were trending 15% or so higher compared to the same quarter last year. JPMorgan Chase's actual results came in above this. Its trading revenue increased 24% in the fourth quarter, to a record $4.5 billion. That compared to $3.6 billion in the year-ago period. The results for its fixed-income unit were even better, growing by 31%. The presidential election in November served as the catalyst for the surge. The unexpected outcome required institutional investors to reposition their portfolios in the election's wake. "When clients transact, we're able to capture the flow," said chief financial officer Marianne Lake on a conference call Friday. Higher interest rates The $2.5 trillion bank also benefited from higher interest rates, though not as much as it will in the current year. Higher interest rates broadly translate into higher rates on loans, specifically. And higher rates on loans translate into higher revenue and earnings for banks. According to JPMorgan, as of Sept. 30 of last year, a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates would equate to $3 billion or so in additional net interest income over the 12 months following the rise. If you divide that by four, you get a sense for the impact on a quarterly basis. JPMorgan didn't experience the full benefit from this trend, as rates didn't rise until well into the quarter. Long-term rates shot up 90 basis points in the wake of the presidential election. Short-term rates followed suit a month later as the Federal Reserve boosted the fed funds rate by 25 basis points at its monetary policy committee meeting in December.

The thing to watch now is the current quarter -- the first quarter of 2017 -- which should benefit from the entirety of the boost, pushing the bank's profits even higher. Finally, JPMorgan's record quarter was also helped by lower expenses and credit costs. The bank's operating costs fell by $430 million, or 3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Its provision for loan losses shed 31%, or $387 million. All told, it was an extraordinary performance from one of the most venerable names in finance. And better yet, it seems as if things will only get better from here. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Retail sales crept up for December, but clothing retailers recently have been closing stores and cutting jobs Comments aAFont Size NEW YORK -- Profits at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America surged last year, the banks said Friday as the industry enjoyed a stock market rally that accelerated after the presidential election. The industry is entering what analysts say could be a period of renewed growth as rising interest rates make it easier for banks to earn a profit and President-elect Donald Trump has said he would roll back regulations put in place after the financial crisis that have hampered industry profits. Increased trading levels across U.S. markets, which are near record levels, has also helped the industry. JPMorgan and Bank of America, two of the largest banks in the world, both beat analysts' profit expectations and gave positive forecasts for the future. "The optimism for positive change here at Bank of America and among our customers is palpable," Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said on a conference call with analysts. The new administration has raised the prospect of a corporate tax overhaul and regulatory changes, Moynihan said. "We'll have to see how these topics play out but that we are optimistic," he said. The North Carolina bank reported its largest yearly profit, nearly $18 billion, or $1.50 a share, since the financial crisis. During the fourth quarter, net income jumped 43 percent to $4.7 billion, or 40 cents a share, compared with the same period in 2015 as Bank of America continued to cut costs. Revenue increased about 2 percent during the quarter to $20 billion. At JPMorgan, CEO Jamie Dimon also expressed optimism. "The U.S. economy may be building momentum," he said in a statement. "Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth." In a conference call, Dimon said he is "comforted" that Trump has picked "professionals" for his administration, including Treasury Department nominee Steven Mnuchin. "Give him some time," said Dimon, who is serving on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum. JPMorgan's profits jumped 24 percent during the fourth quarter to $6.73 billion, or $1.71 a share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 a share, during the same period a year ago. For the entire year, profits were up about 1 percent to $24.7 billion, or $6.18 a share, while revenue reached more than $95 billion. "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year," Dimon said in a statement. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo lagged behind its competitors as it continues to recover from a sales scandal that put it in the cross hairs of lawmakers and sparked several federal investigations. In September, the bank admitted that thousands of low-level employees had set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas. In some cases, the customers were charged various fees for accounts they did not know existed. The bank has apologized repeatedly and refunded more than $3 million to customers for fees they were charged on accounts they didn't ask for. Earlier this week, the company announced a new pay plan that replaces the sales goals. But the scandal appears to still be weighing on its bottom line. Wells Fargo opened 40 percent fewer checking accounts and 43 percent fewer credit cards in December compared with the same period in 2015. It reported a 4 percent dip in profits last year, $21.9 billion, or $3.99 a share, compared with $22.9 billion, or $4.12 a share, in 2015. Revenue increased about 3 percent to $88.3 billion. During the fourth quarter, net income dipped to $5.3 billion, or 96 cents a share, at the San Francisco bank compared with $5.6 billion, or $1.03 a share, during the same period in 2015. Revenue was unchanged during the quarter at about $21 billion. "We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders," CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. "While we have more work to do, I am proud of the effort of our entire team to make things right for our customers and team members and to continue building a better Wells Fargo for the future."

Investors largely shrugged off the biggest fall in Chinese exports since 2009 to focus on U.S. data that suggested stronger growth. Market participants largely resumed buying across equity markets based on higher growth expectations that had tailed off this week, with bank shares leading the way. Top U.S. bank executives, in their first public comments about quarterly earnings, expressed optimism about the outlook for this year as leading financial institutions recorded profits for the fourth quarter. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, for instance, reported a 47-percent rise in fourth-quarter profit, while JP Morgan Chase also reported strong earnings, with a 24-percent rise in profit. U.S. economic data have also boosted the market, as retail sales rose in December given strong demand for automobiles and furniture. Producer prices expanded as well. "Our medium-term view is still positive on the stock market," said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. "Donald Trump is seen as a positive factor for stocks in the longer term as he begins to execute on his plans of reducing taxes and rebuilding U.S. infrastructure." The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. The dollar, meanwhile, was down 0.16 percent against a basket of major currencies at 101.19, but was off a five-week low hit this week. The greenback was down 0.2 percent at 114.54 yen. The dollar index, though, posted its worst weekly performance in more than two months. "Markets, overall, have stabilized following the post-Trump press conference shake-up," said Action Economics in its latest blog. "Some consolidation is expected now (in dollar/yen), though should data continue to strengthen, keeping Fedspeak leaning to the hawkish side, dollar/yen upside can be expected to resume." The 'reflation trade' that had sent the dollar to a 14-year high last month was based on Trump's campaign promises of increased fiscal spending, lower taxes, and deregulation, all of which are inflationary and would likely drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than its normal pace. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board, bolstered by Friday's better-than-expected data, led by U.S. retail sales, producer prices, as well as the big rise in U.S. inflation expectations as shown in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment report. Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields fell 10/32 in price, yielding 2.4 percent, up from Thursday's 2.361 percent. German 10-year bond yields were also higher, up at 0.264 percent, from 0.234 percent late on Thursday. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 1 percent to 1,447.22. Germany's DAX rose 0.94 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.62 percent, its 14th consecutive daily gain. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent after rising to its highest since late October the previous session. It was up 1.8 percent for the week. Japan's Nikkei stock index finished up 0.8 percent, though it still ended the week down 0.9 percent. Brent crude was down 0.8 percent at $55.59 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 0.9 percent at $52.53. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,197.90 an ounce, having risen overnight to a seven-week high above $1,200.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel An increase in Facebook pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 also rose after major US banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of US Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed US retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook , which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favour with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions. Tags  Wall Street Dow Jones Nasdaq S&P500 US Market Buy, Hold, Sell ?

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

The Wall Street Journal.2:10 Legal experts: Trump's business plan falls short CNN Money3:21 UP NEXT The three biggest U.S. banks posted fourth-quarter results that buttressed investors’ belief Donald Trump’s victory and stronger economic growth will reinvigorate the long-struggling financial sector. Quotes in the article Bank of America Corporation BAC ▲ 23.01 +0.09 +0.39% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 86.70 +0.46 +0.53% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▲ 55.31 +0.81 +1.49% The performance of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. was largely in line with what Wall Street had been expecting: trading revenue was upbeat thanks to increased market activity and volatility following the election; expenses remain an area of intense focus; credit quality continues to improve; and a recent upward move in interest rates should produce gains in banks’ income, even if it doesn’t immediately flow to the bottom line. Investors viewed the results positively enough that they continued to nudge the banks’ stocks higher, even though they have each already gained more than 20% since the election. J.P. Morgan, the country’s biggest bank by assets and the world’s largest by market value, was the standout. Its quarterly profit of $1.71 a share handily outpaced analyst expectations, largely due to strong trading results. Full-year 2016 net income of $24.73 billion was a record. Bank of America’s earnings per share of 40 cents beat analyst expectations as the bank cut enough expenses to offset lower-than-expected revenue. At $17.91 billion, its 2016 net income was its biggest annual profit in a decade. Wells Fargo reported lower fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, at 96 cents a share and $21.58 billion, that both missed analysts’ expectations. The bank’s shares, though, rose after it repeatedly referenced a charge related to interest-rate moves as the reason for coming in below estimates. Wells Fargo said its customer loyalty and satisfaction scores were still down versus a year earlier as the bank struggles to recover from its September sales-tactics scandal. Going forward, the burden is on banks to live up to heightened investor expectations while showing that increased profits are sustainable. And while investors now believe a turn in the interest-rate cycle is at hand, which would bolster bank profits, rates remain super low by historical standards. That continues to drag on results: Wells Fargo’s quarterly return on equity hit its lowest level in years at 10.94%. Finance chief John Shrewsberry acknowledged that the market has lifted bank valuations based on no more than current performance. “Now banks need to, over some period of time, demonstrate how they’re going to earn into that,” he said in an interview. At Bank of America, CLSA analyst Mike Mayo asked officials for a timeline on when they might meet goals on profitability measures such as return on assets and equity. Bank of America’s return on equity in 2016 was just 6.71%, its highest level in five years but still well below banks’ theoretical cost of capital of 10%. CFO Paul Donofrio replied to Mr. Mayo that the bank was moving in the right direction but wouldn’t set a time frame. “It seems like, from an investor standpoint, you get a free pass,” Mr. Mayo said. “‘When you get there is when you get there.’” Speaking a week before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, bank officials offered vague support for tax reform and regulatory relief, but didn’t enumerate specific requests they might want from the new administration. They also expressed optimism about the economy over the coming year. Among specific businesses, trading continued to gain ground. After a brutal start in 2016, trading activity ramped up following the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union in June and accelerated further after Mr. Trump’s election. At J.P. Morgan and Bank of America, annual trading revenue for 2016 increased above their year-earlier levels for the first time in at least three years. In the fourth quarter, J.P. Morgan’s trading revenue rose 24%, and Bank of America’s rose 11%. Wells Fargo’s relatively small presence in trading has sometimes been an advantage in recent years but has been a handicap of late. Still, it isn’t clear how long the trading jolt can continue. Bank of America noted the postelection rise in long-term bond yields had slowed demand for trading municipal bonds and other products tied to interest rates. Consumer banking was less buoyant: revenue was down at J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo versus the prior year, and flat at Bank of America. Mortgage-banking revenue was also challenged due to the rise in interest rates and looks set to continue falling this year. Reflecting a continued emphasis on cost control, executives held the line on pay for traders and investment bankers. Compensation expenses in J.P. Morgan’s corporate and investment bank was 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter, down from 27% in the third. The cost-cutting drive continued in other parts of banks. Bank of America’s Mr. Moynihan has made expense savings a key part of his business strategy, and the company cut annual expenses nearly 5% to $54.95 billion. Mr. Moynihan promised this summer to reduce annual expenses to about $53 billion by 2018. On the plus side, all three banks released reserves they had set aside for loan losses, in part due to continued improvement in credit quality. Such reserve releases bolster profit. As well, the rebound in energy prices removed one of the biggest challenges to bank profitability. The Federal Reserve’s December decision to raise interest rates had little immediate impact on the banks’ fourth-quarter results, but made them hopeful about the coming year. At Bank of America, officials said they expect an extra $600 million in net interest income in the first quarter, compared with the bank’s $10.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Bank of America is particularly dependent on the Fed increasing interest rates because of its large base of U.S. deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities.

Investors largely shrugged off the biggest fall in Chinese exports since 2009 to focus on U.S. data that suggested stronger growth. Market participants largely resumed buying across equity markets based on higher growth expectations that had tailed off this week, with bank shares leading the way. Top U.S. bank executives, in their first public comments about quarterly earnings, expressed optimism about the outlook for this year as leading financial institutions recorded profits for the fourth quarter. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, for instance, reported a 47-percent rise in fourth-quarter profit, while JP Morgan Chase also reported strong earnings, with a 24-percent rise in profit. U.S. economic data have also boosted the market, as retail sales rose in December given strong demand for automobiles and furniture. Producer prices expanded as well. "Our medium-term view is still positive on the stock market," said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. "Donald Trump is seen as a positive factor for stocks in the longer term as he begins to execute on his plans of reducing taxes and rebuilding U.S. infrastructure." The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. The dollar, meanwhile, was down 0.16 percent against a basket of major currencies at 101.19, but was off a five-week low hit this week. The greenback was down 0.2 percent at 114.54 yen. The dollar index, though, posted its worst weekly performance in more than two months. "Markets, overall, have stabilized following the post-Trump press conference shake-up," said Action Economics in its latest blog. "Some consolidation is expected now (in dollar/yen), though should data continue to strengthen, keeping Fedspeak leaning to the hawkish side, dollar/yen upside can be expected to resume." The 'reflation trade' that had sent the dollar to a 14-year high last month was based on Trump's campaign promises of increased fiscal spending, lower taxes, and deregulation, all of which are inflationary and would likely drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than its normal pace. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board, bolstered by Friday's better-than-expected data, led by U.S. retail sales, producer prices, as well as the big rise in U.S. inflation expectations as shown in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment report. Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields fell 10/32 in price, yielding 2.4 percent, up from Thursday's 2.361 percent. German 10-year bond yields were also higher, up at 0.264 percent, from 0.234 percent late on Thursday. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 1 percent to 1,447.22. Germany's DAX rose 0.94 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.62 percent, its 14th consecutive daily gain. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent after rising to its highest since late October the previous session. It was up 1.8 percent for the week. Japan's Nikkei stock index finished up 0.8 percent, though it still ended the week down 0.9 percent. Brent crude was down 0.8 percent at $55.59 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 0.9 percent at $52.53. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,197.90 an ounce, having risen overnight to a seven-week high above $1,200.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America <BAC.N>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores <WMT.N> and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook <FB.O>, which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 14 January 2017 | MYT 8:43 AM Nasdaq hits record; bank earnings validate Wall St rally NEW YORK: An increase in Facebook pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 also rose after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook, which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Markets You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Celebrations a spectacle to behold Dell Vostro 14: Value for money Do we really need to fear China money?

By Abby Schultz Jan. 13, 2017 4:15 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Pixabay JPMorgan Chase slashed the outsized sign-up bonus for its high-end travel card Chase Sapphire Reserve this week, but the bank is offering a sweet new deal that could entice those who missed out – that is if you’re an Amazon Prime Member. The new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card unveiled this week offers 5% cash back on anything Amazon Prime members buy at Amazon.com. It also gives 2% cash back spent at any restaurant, gas station or drugstore and 1% back on every other purchase. And there’s no annual fee. Amazon Prime membership itself costs $99 a year. For those keeping track at home, the two cards – Sapphire Reserve and Amazon Prime Rewards – offer very different perks and are issued from different units in Chase’s card division (The Amazon card is considered a “co-branded” card). Chase says the timing is coincidental. We just think it’s interesting. Chase Sapphire Reserve is great if you travel and dine out a lot and can take advantage of the many potential rewards it offers in exchange for a hefty $450 annual fee. Sadly, Chase cut the sign-up bonus on Sapphire Reserve from 100,000 points (a $1,500 travel value) to 50,000 points (a $750 value) this week. You can still get the higher bonus, though, if you walk into a Chase bank branch and apply. The branch offer lasts through March 12. One similarity is both cards only make sense if you pay your balance in full each month. Otherwise any benefit from the cards is wiped away by finance charges of at least 14.74% for Amazon Prime and 16.49% for Sapphire Reserve, depending on your credit score. More from Barron's When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get the Cheapest Fare Best Credit Cards for Holiday Spending This Trick Lets You Live (Nearly) Rent Free A better comparison for the Amazon Prime card is Chase Freedom, a no annual fee card with 5% cash back on a rotating set of categories and 1% cash back on everything else. That rotating category list includes gas stations and local commuter transportation, and grocery stores and drug stores. The list has at times included Amazon.com. Discover’s Discover It card has also included Amazon in its own rotating 5% cash back program. Though it’s worth nothing that Discover doubles the reward in the first year. https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cash-back/it-card.html But Chase’s new Amazon card is the first one to offer full-time Amazon rewards. John Ganotis, founder of Credit Card Insider, says the card “looks like a great deal for anyone who uses Amazon Prime.” With no annual fee it’s a card that a Prime member could consider opening up just for Amazon purchases, he says. If you already have one, you can still hold onto your cash back card like Chase Freedom or Discover It. “All of these cards have no annual fee, and credit scoring models generally like to see more accounts and more available credit,” Ganotis says. Chase offers what it calls “co-branded” cards with 10 partners like Amazon as well as United, Marriott, and Disney, among others. It’s had a relationship with Amazon for nearly 20 years, says Steve Goodman, Chase’s Card Services general manager, and Chase still offers all Amazon members an Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card with 3% cash back on Amazon.com purchases, 2% back on gas and 1% back on everything else. Current Amazon.com card holders who are Prime members will be automatically upgraded to the new card. If you’re not a member, you’ll still get a redesigned card that now has no foreign transaction fees -- same as the Prime card.

Chase offers what it calls “co-branded” cards with 10 partners like Amazon as well as United, Marriott, and Disney, among others. It’s had a relationship with Amazon for nearly 20 years, says Steve Goodman, Chase’s Card Services general manager, and Chase still offers all Amazon members an Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card with 3% cash back on Amazon.com purchases, 2% back on gas and 1% back on everything else. Current Amazon.com card holders who are Prime members will be automatically upgraded to the new card. If you’re not a member, you’ll still get a redesigned card that now has no foreign transaction fees -- same as the Prime card.

The question is whether the stock is a buy at its current price of more than $813 a share following a 37% gain over the past 12 months, double the gain of the Standard & Poor’s 500. A fresh story on TheStreet site suggests that the stock can continue to beat the market for a variety of reasons, only one of which has to do with its selling platform.

But Amazon, despite its successful foray into gadgets, is still primarily a retail distribution platform.

These companies aren’t adding thousands of new workers like Amazon. “Instead, Macy’s plans to close 100 stores to improve profitability, and Sears has sold its Craftsman tools line for roughly $900 million to raise cash. “Conceivably, one or both of these historic chains could go bankrupt,” writes Samuelson. There there’s the news that The Limited is closing all its 250 stores, and Kmart, owned by Sears, continues to reduce its retail footprint with store closings. In theory, this kind of downsizing could lead to a happier outcome, as these companies become more efficient. But Samuelson points out that it hasn’t worked that way in this industry. “What’s puzzling about this episode of creative destruction is that we’ve gotten much pain but are still waiting for the gain,” writes Samuelson. “Instead of improving, productivity growth has slowed dramatically.” As he puts it, “people no longer buy everything in stores, but stores are still necessary. (In 2016, e-commerce totaled about 8 percent of retail sales.) Still, the loss of sales makes brick-and-mortar stores less productive, and their loss of productivity offsets some or all of the gains from digital technologies,” he writes. “This is, I think, the basic explanation of what’s happening at Macy’s and Sears. They have to invest in the new technology, even as the value of the old technology erodes. The effect is compounded because they’ve been slow to shut marginal stores. There’s always the hope that these stores will bounce back and avoid large losses.” Must be nice to be Amazon, which doesn’t have to worry about legacy assets like stores.

The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The index had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.48 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,372.05. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co., all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which will lead to higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The major stock indexes headed higher early in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from the three banking giants, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly because of a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom Inc. fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc. slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean Ltd. lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum Corp. fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38.

 U.S. banks to stay in fashion as earnings kick off Reuters Jan. 14, 2017, 1:43 AM 311 facebook linkedin twitter email print A street sign for Wall Street is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan, New York City Thomson Reuters By Sinead Carew and Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Wells Fargo & Co. , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America kicked off the earnings season on a positive note on Friday, sending the S&P 500's banking sub-sector <.spxbk> up as much as 2.3 percent to its highest since February 2008 before paring gains. It closed trading up 0.8 percent compared with a 0.2 percent gain for the broader S&P 500 <.spx>.</.spx></.spxbk> The banks' top executives expressed optimism on Friday about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 8. The bank index rose 24.8 percent between Nov. 8 and Dec. 9 then traded sideways for a month as bond yields fell. Investors were waiting for earnings and for concrete plans from Trump who has said he supports lower taxes, fiscal stimulus and lighter regulation, which would all help banks. Results and guidance from the big banks scheduled to report in the week ahead could boost the sector, according to John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. "Results are likely to be good and the outlook is going to be positive so there's room for further gains," said Praveen. The S&P banks index has traded recently at 13.6 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compared with its five-year average multiple of about 11 but in line with the 10-year average of 13.1, including the 2008 financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters data. The banks' multiple is well below the broader S&P 500's forward price/earnings ratio of 17. But the banks' discount to the broader market has been shrinking since before the election. Praveen sees a bigger multiple expansion for the banking sector than for the S&P as a whole as more defensive sectors like utilities or consumer staples that are sensitive to interest rate hikes will likely not enjoy as much expansion. Among banks reporting in the coming week Morgan Stanley is expected to post results Tuesday followed by Citibank on Wednesday. BB&T Corp , KeyCorp and Bank of New York Mellon Corp all report on Thursday. Fred Cannon, director of research at KBW in New York, said banks' expanded valuations make them a "show-me" story but as long as earnings estimates are rising they should stay popular. “Until we see the blue skies get cloudy it will probably still be a sector in favor,” he said. Some investors are more cautious going into earnings. For instance traders in Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund options have moved to protect post-election gains. Open contracts on the fund's shares are now the most defensive in about four weeks, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. "The banks' stocks are likely to chop along in sideways volatility through earnings season," said Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities for Standard Life Investments in Boston, who doesn't see earnings as a big catalyst at a time when there is still uncertainty about whether Trump will be able to enact policies expected to help banks and accelerate economic growth. While his firm has increased the weighting of bank stocks in its $360 billion assets under management since the election it is "not in the strong bull camp for bank stocks," Morris said. He warned that bank stocks could come under pressure if there is no clear path toward regulatory relief or an acceleration of economic growth coming into the third quarter.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump lives up to his campaign promises.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 2:50 PM, January 14, 2017 Updated: 8:30 PM, January 14, 2017 NEW YORK - U.S. bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Wells Fargo & Co. <WFC.N>, JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and Bank of America <BAC.N> kicked off the earnings season on a positive note on Friday, sending the S&P 500's banking sub-sector <.SPXBK> up as much as 2.3 percent to its highest since February 2008 before paring gains. It closed trading up 0.8 percent compared with a 0.2 percent gain for the broader S&P 500 <.SPX>. The banks' top executives expressed optimism on Friday about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 8. The bank index rose 24.8 percent between Nov. 8 and Dec. 9 then traded sideways for a month as bond yields fell. Investors were waiting for earnings and for concrete plans from Trump who has said he supports lower taxes, fiscal stimulus and lighter regulation, which would all help banks. Results and guidance from the big banks scheduled to report in the week ahead could boost the sector, according to John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. "Results are likely to be good and the outlook is going to be positive so there's room for further gains," said Praveen. The S&P banks index has traded recently at 13.6 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compared with its five-year average multiple of about 11 but in line with the 10-year average of 13.1, including the 2008 financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters data. The banks' multiple is well below the broader S&P 500's forward price/earnings ratio of 17. But the banks' discount to the broader market has been shrinking since before the election. Praveen sees a bigger multiple expansion for the banking sector than for the S&P as a whole as more defensive sectors like utilities or consumer staples that are sensitive to interest rate hikes will likely not enjoy as much expansion. Among banks reporting in the coming week Morgan Stanley <MS.N> is expected to post results Tuesday followed by Citibank <C.N> on Wednesday. BB&T Corp <BBT.N>, KeyCorp <KEY.N> and Bank of New York Mellon Corp <BK.N> all report on Thursday. Fred Cannon, director of research at KBW in New York, said banks' expanded valuations make them a "show-me" story but as long as earnings estimates are rising they should stay popular. “Until we see the blue skies get cloudy it will probably still be a sector in favor,” he said. Some investors are more cautious going into earnings. For instance traders in Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund <XLF.P> options have moved to protect post-election gains. Open contracts on the fund's shares are now the most defensive in about four weeks, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. "The banks' stocks are likely to chop along in sideways volatility through earnings season," said Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities for Standard Life Investments in Boston, who doesn't see earnings as a big catalyst at a time when there is still uncertainty about whether Trump will be able to enact policies expected to help banks and accelerate economic growth. While his firm has increased the weighting of bank stocks in its $360 billion assets under management since the election it is "not in the strong bull camp for bank stocks," Morris said. He warned that bank stocks could come under pressure if there is no clear path toward regulatory relief or an acceleration of economic growth coming into the third quarter.

Several major financial institutions reported earnings before the US market open. On balance, the news was good, easily beating estimates in several cases. And although Wells Fargo missed forecasts, its shares still surged on the open. JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, PNC Financial, and BlackRock all reported earnings that were better than consensus estimates. While earnings season has started on a very positive footing, however, banks and other financial companies were already expected to shine more than others due to rising interest rate expectations. As non-financial companies begin to report in the coming weeks, though, the current Trump Rally will undergo a more extensive test of its staying power. Despite a good showing for the start of earnings season, US equity indexes continue to meander within a relatively tight range near their recent all-time highs, as has been the case for the past month. This could just represent a consolidation before the next potential leg up. Or, it could be showing a loss of upside momentum as the markets become more cautious amid continuing uncertainties surrounding the incoming Trump Administration. For the S&P 500, the trading range within the past month has been roughly contained between 2280 to the upside and 2240 to the downside. Meanwhile, the much anticipated 20,000 mark has continued to elude the Dow, despite valiant efforts. Besides the barrage of earnings reports that will likely test the markets in the weeks ahead, next week brings one event that markets have been most eagerly anticipating. Friday, January 20th is the day that Donald Trump will be inaugurated and formally takes office as President of the United States. From that day forward, the many growth-inducing promises that Donald Trump has made, which have helped buoy the markets to new record highs in the past two months, will begin to matter much less than the actual actions taken to fulfill those promises. Markets are typically prone to rise on lofty expectations and fall on less-than-lofty realities. If the reality under President Trump fails to match expectations with regard to fiscal spending, lower taxes, financial deregulation, or other market-related issues, investors could potentially be in for somewhat of a rude awakening. This week, we received a bite-sized taste of what could come to be when Trump spoke at his first formal press conference since his election victory. Instead of making any mention of stimulus, taxes, or deregulation, the president-elect was much more concerned with discussing plans to address his conflicts-of-interest, criticizing the media for reporting "fake news," and condemning pharmaceutical companies for their pricing practices. Market indexes initially dropped as a result, due in part to the hit on the health care sector, but quickly bounced back as broader optimism was not substantially deterred. As markets navigate through earnings season and the launch of a new US government in the coming weeks, it would be prudent to realize that real risks for the markets continue to loom, despite the fact that these risks are largely being disregarded at the moment. While Inauguration Day in itself is not likely to cause any major market breakouts, the weeks ahead are very likely to bring significantly increased volatility as the incoming administration eases into its new and unfamiliar role. The bar of expectations is high and the challenges to fulfilling those expectations will abound.   About the Author Forex.com DISCLAIMER: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase of sale of any currency.

Home Mail Search News Cricket Movies Lifestyle Celebrity Flickr Mobile Answers More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us YEAR IN REVIEW 2016 National World Finance Cricket Lifestyle Sports Good News Videos Autos Europe shares up, Nasdaq hits record high; U.S. yields up By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss Reuters14 January 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share FILE PHOTO: A trader looks at computer screens during a Spanish bond auction in Madrid November 8, 2012. REUTERS/Andrea Comas/FilesMore By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK (Reuters) - European stocks advanced on Friday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose in line with gains in U.S. Treasury yields, as investors were encouraged by upbeat bank earnings and positive U.S. economic data. Investors largely shrugged off the biggest fall in Chinese exports since 2009 to focus on U.S. data that suggested stronger growth. Market participants largely resumed buying across equity markets based on higher growth expectations that had tailed off this week, with bank shares leading the way. Top U.S. bank executives, in their first public comments about quarterly earnings, expressed optimism about the outlook for this year as leading financial institutions recorded profits for the fourth quarter. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, for instance, reported a 47-percent rise in fourth-quarter profit, while JP Morgan Chase also reported strong earnings, with a 24-percent rise in profit. U.S. economic data have also boosted the market, as retail sales rose in December given strong demand for automobiles and furniture. Producer prices expanded as well. "Our medium-term view is still positive on the stock market," said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. "Donald Trump is seen as a positive factor for stocks in the longer term as he begins to execute on his plans of reducing taxes and rebuilding U.S. infrastructure." The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. The dollar, meanwhile, was down 0.16 percent against a basket of major currencies at 101.19, but was off a five-week low hit this week. The greenback was down 0.2 percent at 114.54 yen. The dollar index, though, posted its worst weekly performance in more than two months. "Markets, overall, have stabilized following the post-Trump press conference shake-up," said Action Economics in its latest blog. "Some consolidation is expected now (in dollar/yen), though should data continue to strengthen, keeping Fedspeak leaning to the hawkish side, dollar/yen upside can be expected to resume." The 'reflation trade' that had sent the dollar to a 14-year high last month was based on Trump's campaign promises of increased fiscal spending, lower taxes, and deregulation, all of which are inflationary and would likely drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than its normal pace. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board, bolstered by Friday's better-than-expected data, led by U.S. retail sales, producer prices, as well as the big rise in U.S. inflation expectations as shown in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment report. Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields fell 10/32 in price, yielding 2.4 percent, up from Thursday's 2.361 percent. German 10-year bond yields were also higher, up at 0.264 percent, from 0.234 percent late on Thursday. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 1 percent to 1,447.22. Germany's DAX rose 0.94 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.62 percent, its 14th consecutive daily gain. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent after rising to its highest since late October the previous session. It was up 1.8 percent for the week. Japan's Nikkei stock index finished up 0.8 percent, though it still ended the week down 0.9 percent. Brent crude was down 0.8 percent at $55.59 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 0.9 percent at $52.53. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,197.90 an ounce, having risen overnight to a seven-week high above $1,200.

Investors largely shrugged off figures that showed Chinese exports fell the most last year since 2009, and will look to earnings reports from US banks JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo later in the day for direction. "The banking sector will be the major focus," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK. "With rising interest rates and hopes of more friendly regulation, the shares of these banks have a lot of upside in the coming days." Bank stocks led the charge in European trading, rising 1% to lift the FTSEuroFirst 300 0.5%. The broader index was still down slightly on the week though, its first weekly fall in six. Shares in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles rose 6%, recouping some of the previous session’s 16% slump triggered by the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) accusations that the car maker illegally masked excess diesel emissions. Germany’s DAX was up 0.5% and Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.4%, on course for its 12th record high close and 14th consecutive daily gain. US futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Wall Street. Thursday’s slip into the red marked yet another failed attempt to lift the Dow Jones through the magical 20,000-point barrier. Wall Street was chilled by president-elect Donald Trump’s failure to address economic policy plans at his first news conference since winning the November 8 election, and the growing fear that his proposed protectionist trade policies will choke global trade. Chinese trade data on Friday poured oil onto those flames. December exports fell by 6.1% from a year earlier, meaning the overall fall in exports last year was the biggest since the depths of the crisis in 2009. As the world’s largest trading nation, China could come under pressure from protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on his campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on the country’s imports. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1%, after rising to its highest levels since late October in the previous session. It was up 1.8% for the week. Japan’s Nikkei stock index finished up 0.8%, though it still ended the week down 0.9%. Bond yield retracement The symbiotic dance between the dollar and US treasury bond yields held firm on Friday. Both headed lower to end a week in which the dollar has fallen almost 1% and yields have extended their longest downturn since last northern summer. The 10-year yield was flat at 2.36%, recovering from a six-week low hit on Thursday. But it’s down more than five basis points on the week and about 30 basis points since the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in mid-December. The dollar wallowed around five-week lows against a currency basket at 101.29, and down 0.9% for the week. The euro rose 0.2% to $1.0635, well above last week’s 14-year low of $1.0340 and poised to gain 0.9% for the week, while the dollar was steady against the yen at 114.75 yen. The dollar index had scaled 14-year peaks in January, on the speculation that Trump’s policies would spur growth and inflation, and prompt the Fed to raise interest rates at a faster pace than previously expected. But doubts have crept in. "Bond markets continue to retrace from the yield highs set in the middle of last month," RBC Capital markets rates strategists wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "The latest move [is] seen as a typical ‘buy-the-rumour-sell-the-fact’ reaction as Donald Trump’s pre-inauguration press conference proved to be a disappointment in terms of forthcoming growth boosting policies," they said. The overnight rise in crude oil prices, bolstered by the weaker dollar as well as news that Saudi Arabia has cut oil output to its lowest in almost two years and plans further reductions, fizzled out in early European trading. Brent crude was down 0.1% at $55.95 a barrel, while US crude was also down 0.1% at $52.97. Spot gold held steady at $1,195.87/oz, as investors locked in gains on its overnight surge to seven-week highs above $1,200. Reuters Please login or register to comment.

Investors largely shrugged off the biggest fall in Chinese exports since 2009 to focus on U.S. data that suggested stronger growth. Market participants largely resumed buying across equity markets based on higher growth expectations that had tailed off this week, with bank shares leading the way. Top U.S. bank executives, in their first public comments about quarterly earnings, expressed optimism about the outlook for this year as leading financial institutions recorded profits for the fourth quarter. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, for instance, reported a 47-percent rise in fourth-quarter profit, while JP Morgan Chase also reported strong earnings, with a 24-percent rise in profit. U.S. economic data have also boosted the market, as retail sales rose in December given strong demand for automobiles and furniture. Producer prices expanded as well. "Our medium-term view is still positive on the stock market," said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. "Donald Trump is seen as a positive factor for stocks in the longer term as he begins to execute on his plans of reducing taxes and rebuilding U.S. infrastructure." The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. The dollar, meanwhile, was down 0.16 percent against a basket of major currencies at 101.19, but was off a five-week low hit this week. The greenback was down 0.2 percent at 114.54 yen. The dollar index, though, posted its worst weekly performance in more than two months. "Markets, overall, have stabilized following the post-Trump press conference shake-up," said Action Economics in its latest blog. "Some consolidation is expected now (in dollar/yen), though should data continue to strengthen, keeping Fedspeak leaning to the hawkish side, dollar/yen upside can be expected to resume." The 'reflation trade' that had sent the dollar to a 14-year high last month was based on Trump's campaign promises of increased fiscal spending, lower taxes, and deregulation, all of which are inflationary and would likely drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than its normal pace. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board, bolstered by Friday's better-than-expected data, led by U.S. retail sales, producer prices, as well as the big rise in U.S. inflation expectations as shown in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment report. Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields fell 10/32 in price, yielding 2.4 percent, up from Thursday's 2.361 percent. German 10-year bond yields were also higher, up at 0.264 percent, from 0.234 percent late on Thursday. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 1 percent to 1,447.22.

(Photo: Elise Amendola/AP) Earnings season is in full force as big banks were front and center on Friday. Here is a rundown of what some of the country’s largest banks reported in their Q4 earnings report. JPMorgan Chase earned $1.71 per share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $23.4 billion. Wells Fargo earned $0.96 per share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $21.58 billion. Bank of America earned $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $20.0 billion. PNC Financial earned $1.97 per share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $3.9 billion. Each of these stocks closed in the green on Friday. “Overall, a quiet week in the markets,” said Joel Elconin, co-host of Benzinga’s “PreMarket Prep” show. “The most notable price action was the sharp rebound in the markets on Thursday, erasing nearly all of its substantial intra-day decline. The big banks got the Q4 earnings season to a good start. An impressive beat by JPMorgan sent the issue to a new all-time high.” Elconin noted that high-beta stocks such as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix led the Nasdaq to a new all-time high. Beta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market and measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market. The Nasdaq ended the week at 5,574.12. With the Dow constantly coming close to hitting the 20,000 milestone, some might wonder why Nasdaq trading at all-time highs doesn’t warrant the same attention. The reason is pretty simple: Dow is one of the oldest exchanges and is synonymous with market movement. Since its creation in 1896, the Dow is the most widely followed index by investors, as well as the general public, to gauge the U.S. stock market. The Nasdaq predominantly consists of technology stocks and growth stocks and includes some companies that aren’t based in the U.S. Another factor that acts against Nasdaq is it includes many speculative companies with small market capitalization. As such, its movement also indicates performance of speculative stocks. Though critics call the undue importance given the Dow “outdated” in today’s technology-driven market, its connection with the U.S. economy is profound and cannot be ignored. Earnings season picks up next week with reports from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and General Electric. 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2jGMpMp

CNN Money China fears protectionist Trump may thwart its exports China's customs agency said on Friday U.S. President Donald Trump may limit the growth of China's exports by imposing greater trade protectionist measures. According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost a fraction, the S&P 500 gained 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite wafted up 0.5% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.8%. Treasury bonds were weaker, the dollar fell for the third straight session, gold was weaker and oil fell to end a two-day rally down 1.2% despite a drop in U.S. drilling rig counts. Bank of America (BAC) gained 0.4% after reporting weaker-than-expected core earnings on soft net interest income and fees. Fixed income, currency and commodities trading was also light, but offset somewhat by lower expenses. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gained 0.5% on an earnings beat from lower taxes despite light net interest income. Wells Fargo (WFC) gained 1.5% despite missing expectations on lower free income and weak mortgage business. © Provided by InvestorPlace 011317-Dow-Jones Overall, financial stocks led the way with a 0.6% gain while REITs were the laggards, down 0.3%.

And Facebook (FB) gained 1.4% on an upgrade from Raymond James citing attractive valuation. On the downside, GameStop (GME) lost 8.1% after reporting a 18.7% drop in holiday comp-store sales citing aggressive console promotions at other retailers. Retail sales came in at a weaker than expected 0.6% month-over-month growth in December, just below the 0.7% gain expected. Overall, sales were up 3.3% for 2016 vs. a 2.3% advance in 2015. Separately, the National Retail Federation said holiday shopping sales were up 4.3% from last year — ahead of the 3.6% expected. Online sales were up nearly 13%. © Provided by InvestorPlace 011317-USO Producer price inflation rose 0.3% in December following a 0.4% gain in November. That pushed the year-over-year rate to 1.6%, the highest since September. And finally, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment readers was largely unchanged from the cyclical peak hit in December. Overall, the Dow failed once again to take the 20,000 threshold — despite five weeks of trying — as technical indicators continue to flash overbought warnings signals amid narrowing breadth.

REUTERS/Andrea Comas/FilesMore By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK (Reuters) - European stocks advanced on Friday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose in line with gains in U.S. Treasury yields, as investors were encouraged by upbeat bank earnings and positive U.S. economic data. Investors largely shrugged off the biggest fall in Chinese exports since 2009 to focus on U.S. data that suggested stronger growth. Market participants largely resumed buying across equity markets based on higher growth expectations that had tailed off this week, with bank shares leading the way. Top U.S. bank executives, in their first public comments about quarterly earnings, expressed optimism about the outlook for this year as leading financial institutions recorded profits for the fourth quarter. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, for instance, reported a 47-percent rise in fourth-quarter profit, while JP Morgan Chase also reported strong earnings, with a 24-percent rise in profit. U.S. economic data have also boosted the market, as retail sales rose in December given strong demand for automobiles and furniture. Producer prices expanded as well. "Our medium-term view is still positive on the stock market," said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. "Donald Trump is seen as a positive factor for stocks in the longer term as he begins to execute on his plans of reducing taxes and rebuilding U.S. infrastructure." The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. The dollar, meanwhile, was down 0.16 percent against a basket of major currencies at 101.19, but was off a five-week low hit this week. The greenback was down 0.2 percent at 114.54 yen. The dollar index, though, posted its worst weekly performance in more than two months. "Markets, overall, have stabilized following the post-Trump press conference shake-up," said Action Economics in its latest blog. "Some consolidation is expected now (in dollar/yen), though should data continue to strengthen, keeping Fedspeak leaning to the hawkish side, dollar/yen upside can be expected to resume." The 'reflation trade' that had sent the dollar to a 14-year high last month was based on Trump's campaign promises of increased fiscal spending, lower taxes, and deregulation, all of which are inflationary and would likely drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than its normal pace. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board, bolstered by Friday's better-than-expected data, led by U.S. retail sales, producer prices, as well as the big rise in U.S. inflation expectations as shown in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment report. Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields fell 10/32 in price, yielding 2.4 percent, up from Thursday's 2.361 percent. German 10-year bond yields were also higher, up at 0.264 percent, from 0.234 percent late on Thursday. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 1 percent to 1,447.22. Germany's DAX rose 0.94 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.62 percent, its 14th consecutive daily gain. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent after rising to its highest since late October the previous session. It was up 1.8 percent for the week. Japan's Nikkei stock index finished up 0.8 percent, though it still ended the week down 0.9 percent. Brent crude was down 0.8 percent at $55.59 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 0.9 percent at $52.53. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,197.90 an ounce, having risen overnight to a seven-week high above $1,200.

Home Industry Vishal Sikka led Infosys cuts revenue outlook again even as net profit rises to $547 mn Vishal Sikka led Infosys cuts revenue outlook again even as net profit rises to $547 mn Infosys on Friday tweaked revenue guidance for FY17 yet again although it beat market expectations with a 1.5% sequential rise in net profits to $547 million for the October-December period. By: FE Bureau | Bengaluru | Updated: January 14, 2017 8:11 AM Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka in Bengaluru on Friday. Infosys on Friday tweaked revenue guidance for FY17 yet again although it beat market expectations with a 1.5% sequential rise in net profits to $547 million for the October-December period. The software major trimmed its revenue growth guidance for the third time in a row, signalling caution on the demand environment and causing the stock price to fall to Rs 975.15, a dip of 2.49%. The fresh forecast is for a 8.4-8.8% in constant currency as against the earlier projection of 8-9%. Infosys had commenced FY17 with guidance in the band of 11.5-13.5%. The company crossed the $10-billion landmark in revenues for calendar year 2016 even as volumes moderated to 0.2% from 4% in the previous quarter. Sequentially, revenues dipped by 1.4% in dollar terms, given the long holidays during the period and the impact of a contract cancelled by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). The revenues at the end of the quarter stood at $2.55 billion. Operating profit margin (OPM) rose by 0.2% to 25.1% despite the firm taking a 1.1% hit due to cross-currency movements.   Market leader Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Thursday had delivered a performance in line with market expectations with a 0.3% growth in revenues in dollars terms and a net profit increase of 1.5%.TCS continued to maintain its margins at the 26% while the volume growth during the third quarter was 1%. JPMorgan in its note on Infosys’ results said the company’s 3QFY17 print was in line with satisfactory margin performance in a quarter. “EBIT margin increased 20 bps quarter to quarter to 25.1%, materially ahead of our expectations,” the brokerage wrote. Morgan Stanley noted that Infosys had delivered in-line to better numbers for the third quarter, but said the tweaked guidance indicated a muted growth outlook for the fourth quarter. Commenting on the performance, Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka said, “Taking into account seasonal and other additional headwinds for the quarter, our Q3 revenue performance was broadly in line with our expectations. Beyond the quarterly numbers, we continue to focus sharply on the execution of our strategy, as reflected in the growing embrace of AI-based automation, growth in our new software-led business, delivering innovation, both incremental & breakthrough and fostering a learning-led culture.” As Infosys steps into 2017, there is a big overhang of the likely change in the visa policy of the new US administration led by president-elect Donald Trump. There are strong indications that H-1B visa policy is likely to be tweaked to put more stringent conditions on the Indian IT companies, which could either increase the costs or make it more complex to execute their businesses. Sikka said, “There can be an impact from the H-1B policies and we are watching it closely.” However, he added that Trump’s policies are expected to be business-friendly. TCS too had said that it is well prepared to meet the challenges related to visas in the US. Infosys CFO MD Ranganath said, “Our ongoing focus on operational efficiencies has enabled us to keep year to date (YTD) operating margins at similar levels as the same period last year.” The company has set an OPM range of 24-25% for the medium term. You may also like to watch this video Almost all its geographies recorded a decline in growth including North America, Europe, India and Rest of the World. Verticals like BFSI, manufacturing, retail, healthcare, etc, showed a dip in growth. JPMorgan noted, “What we didn’t like about the quarter is that just financial services grew (despite the contract loss) while all other verticals declined sequentially.” Attrition rate during the third quarter stood at 18.4% on consolidated basis as compared to 20% in the second quarter. However, its overall employee strength actually declined by 66 to end at 1,99,763. Infosys chief operating officer UB Pravin Rao said, “Our continued efforts to improve employee engagement and experience has resulted in a reduction in attrition.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America kicked off the earnings season on a positive note today, sending the S&P 500’s banking sub-sector up as much as 2.3 per cent to its highest since February 2008 before paring gains. It closed trading up 0.8 percent compared with a 0.2 per cent gain for the broader S&P 500. The banks’ top executives expressed optimism on Friday about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the presidential election on November 8. The bank index rose 24.8 per cent between November 8 and December 9 then traded sideways for a month as bond yields fell. Investors were waiting for earnings and for concrete plans from Trump who has said he supports lower taxes, fiscal stimulus and lighter regulation, which would all help banks. Results and guidance from the big banks scheduled to report in the week ahead could boost the sector, according to John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. “Results are likely to be good and the outlook is going to be positive so there’s room for further gains,” said Praveen. The S&P banks index has traded recently at 13.6 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compared with its five-year average multiple of about 11 but in line with the 10-year average of 13.1, including the 2008 financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters data. The banks’ multiple is well below the broader S&P 500’s forward price/earnings ratio of 17. But the banks’ discount to the broader market has been shrinking since before the election. Praveen sees a bigger multiple expansion for the banking sector than for the S&P as a whole as more defensive sectors like utilities or consumer staples that are sensitive to interest rate hikes will likely not enjoy as much expansion. Among banks reporting in the coming week Morgan Stanley is expected to post results Tuesday followed by Citibank on Wednesday. BB&T Corp, KeyCorp and Bank of New York Mellon Corp all report on Thursday. Fred Cannon, director of research at KBW in New York, said banks’ expanded valuations make them a “show-me” story but as long as earnings estimates are rising they should stay popular. “Until we see the blue skies get cloudy it will probably still be a sector in favour,” he said. Some investors are more cautious going into earnings. For instance traders in Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund options have moved to protect post-election gains. Open contracts on the fund’s shares are now the most defensive in about four weeks, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. “The banks’ stocks are likely to chop along in sideways volatility through earnings season,” said Jeff Morris, head of US equities for Standard Life Investments in Boston, who doesn’t see earnings as a big catalyst at a time when there is still uncertainty about whether Trump will be able to enact policies expected to help banks and accelerate economic growth. While his firm has increased the weighting of bank stocks in its $360 billion assets under management since the election it is “not in the strong bull camp for bank stocks,” Morris said. He warned that bank stocks could come under pressure if there is no clear path toward regulatory relief or an acceleration of economic growth coming into the third quarter. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Job cuts, fewer flights?

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which will lead to higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. “We all thought financials would do well,” said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. “Now how about the other areas of the economy?” The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. Energy prices were mixed. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626.

Litvak’s greed was on display in an electronic chat in which a JPMorgan Chase & Co. employee tried to cheer him up after a rough day by reminding him of his financial success, and Litvak’s response was, "But I want more money," Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis said Friday in his closing statement. "Jesse Litvak worked in a sophisticated market, but what he did was simple -- he lied so he could make more money," Francis said in federal court in New Haven, Connecticut. "He wasn’t happy with the amount of profit he was making, so he lied to increase those profits. That’s not a negotiating tactic; it’s a crime and it’s called securities fraud." Defense attorney Dane Butswinkas told jurors that the government "was not even close" to proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Litvak’s lies had significantly altered the total mix of information customers used to decide on bond transactions.  On the contrary, he said, the government’s own witnesses couldn’t recall under questioning how much weight they gave to Litvak’s quoted prices when they made their decisions. Many testified they would have made the purchases at the same price even "if you took the lie out of the equation," he said. The jury began deliberating Friday afternoon. Price Revelations Litvak, who was allegedly caught lying when a customer obtained a spreadsheet that revealed misleading bond pricing, was found guilty of fraud in 2014 before an appeals court tossed out his conviction because expert witnesses hadn’t been allowed to testify for the defense. During the retrial, Litvak again argued that he dealt with professionals who conduct their own research and know the value of the bonds they buy and sell, while prosecutors accused him of making up buyers and prices to get his customers to overpay or sell too cheap. Francis on Friday went through trade after trade for jurors, displaying on a screen Litvak’s electronic communications purporting to show how he would offer to arrange the purchase for a relatively small share of the price, even though he’d already boosted his profit well beyond that amount. “The only way he gets away with that is by lying,” Francis said. In one message, Litvak told a client, “Believe me, I’m working for you, bro,” insisting he was giving the client “full disclosure.” In fact, the prosecutor said, Litvak was merely taking advantage of the wall between buyers and sellers. “When it came to negotiating bond prices, Jesse Litvak knew everything," Francis said. "He took advantage of the secrecy to lie to victims who he thought would never be able to catch him." Evaluating Evidence Butswinkas at times mocked what he called the government’s lack of hard evidence in the case. He said corporate policy guidelines used by Litvak’s customers and phone calls between witnesses were never described at trial, even though they would have added context.  Such evidence would have shown that Litvak’s role in the transactions wasn’t as significant as the U.S. claimed, Butswinkas said, and that the trader’s clients’ buying-and-selling decisions were made on a range of other data, including quantitative forecasting and proprietary research. Butswinkas also told jurors the government had misled them into believing that Litvak and his clients were supposed to be on the same side of negotiations when in reality all the parties knew they were vying against each other for financial gain. "They wanted you to believe that Jesse and these giant investment companies were sitting side by side instead of across the table," Butswinkas said. "Mr. Litvak was not an agent of the buyers or sellers." The case is U.S. v. Litvak, 13-cr-00019, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut (New Haven).

Embree Group of Cos. of Georgetown, Texas, built the Alzheimer's care center about a year ago and leased it to Memory Care America of Nashville, Tenn., Mike Gould, chief executive officer of Memory Care, said Friday. Embree sold the facility last month to Mainstreet Holdings of Carmel, Ind., which includes a real estate investment trust. Memory Care of Little Rock at Good Shepherd, at 2501 Aldersgate Road, is a branch of Memory Care America. When the facility opened a year ago, Memory Care dedicated a wing of the facility to Glen Campbell, a country music star and Arkansas native who has Alzheimer's. Campbell has been a patient at a Memory Care facility in Nashville. -- David Smith Expert: Banks' filings point to loan growth Earnings posted this week by several big U.S. banks point to trends that financial investors can expect to see in banks as fourth-quarter earnings reports are released, Matt Olney, a banking analyst with Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, said in a report Friday. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and PNC Financial Services are among banks that have released their fourth-quarter earnings. Based on those reports and others, investors should expect publicly traded banks to show steady loan growth that will accelerate later in the first quarter on seasonally strong mortgage production, Olney said. Three Arkansas banks -- Bank of the Ozarks, Simmons First National Corp. and Home BancShares -- are scheduled to release their fourth-quarter earnings next week. -- David Smith 15 state stocks rise, drive index up 3.89 The Arkansas Index, a price-weighted index that tracks the largest public companies based in the state, rose 3.89 to 360.72 Friday.

Record Chinese crude imports of 8.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in December helped to buoy prices somewhat, traders said, but they could not hide underlying fears over the overall health of the world’s second-biggest economy. Despite China’s oil thirst, overall exports — the country’s economic backbone — declined by 7.7 percent last year in what was the second annual decline in a row and the worst since the depths of the global crisis in 2009. Brent crude futures were trading 31 cents lower at $55.70 a barrel by 10:28 a.m. EST (1528) GMT and were on track for a weekly loss of 2.5 percent. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell by 41 cents to $52.60, set for a weekly drop of 2.6 percent. Exports of Chinese refined oil products last month rose nearly 25 percent year-on-year to a record 5.4 million tons, well above November’s previous record of 4.9 million tons. “China right now seems more interested in keeping capital in the country than focusing on growth overall,” Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago said. “We have to watch this situation develop because this is one threat to what is an otherwise wildly bullish scenario for oil in the coming year.” On the supply side, there was some market support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said that its output had fallen below 10 million bpd to levels last seen in February 2015 and that it expects to make even deeper cuts next month. However, hard evidence of export reductions has yet to emerge, two weeks into the month in which the cuts by the OPEC and other producers, such as Russia, were supposed to start. Many analysts expect compliance of 50 percent to 80 percent at best. “As the Saudis hint at even deeper reductions in February, assumptions are rife that its enthusiastic approach to output cuts is an admission that cheating is expected on the part of other producers,” said Stephen Brennock of oil brokerage PVM. The US Energy Information Administration said in its January outlook that it expects Brent and WTI to average $53 and $52 a barrel respectively in 2017. Even if OPEC cuts its output as agreed, traders said that rising US shale output and increasing supply from OPEC members Nigeria and Libya, which were exempt from the pact, might offset any reductions. The market also awaited US drilling rig count data from energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc. at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT), the indicator future US production. US stocks gain US stocks advanced on Friday, on track to close the week on a firmer note, while the dollar recovered as investors were encouraged by upbeat bank earnings and positive US economic data. Investors largely shrugged off the biggest fall in Chinese exports since 2009 to focus on US data that suggested stronger growth. Market participants largely resumed buying across equity markets based on higher growth expectations that had tailed off this week, with auto and bank shares leading the way. Bank of America Merrill Lynch kicked off the US bank-earning season, reporting a 47 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit thanks to an upswing in market activity following the election of Donald Trump as US president on Nov. 8. JP Morgan Chase also reported strong earnings, with a 24 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits. In late morning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1 percent to 19,907.7, while the S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 2,276.72. The Nasdaq Composite, on the other hand, added 0.57 percent to 5,579.15. The dollar, meanwhile, rebounded from losses against a basket of major currencies the previous day to trade slightly higher at 101.390, while it rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 115.07 yen. In the bond market, US Treasury yields rose across the board bolstered by Friday’s better-than-expected data such as the big rise in US inflation expectations as shown in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment report. Gold slips The price of gold eased on Friday from a seven-week high touched in the previous session, as strong US retail sales drove the dollar and US bond yields higher, but was still on track for a third straight weekly gain. Spot gold was down 0.1 percent at $1,194.62 an ounce by 1538 GMT, having fallen as low as $1,188.04 after the US data was published. It was still up 1.9 percent on the week. US gold futures were down 0.4 percent at $1,194.80. The gold price has risen 6.5 percent since a mid-December low, and touched $1,206.98 on Thursday to reach its highest level since Nov. 23, after Trump failed to elaborate on his plans to cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending.

Jeanne Yurman reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Friday the 13th wasn't too scary for the markets. The Dow was down fractionally. The S&P and Nasdaq finished with mild gains. For the week stocks closed mixed. The Dow and the S&P lost ground but the Nasdaq rose 1 percent. After a big run up in stocks in the past six weeks, there needs to be more clarity to move higher says Tim Anderson, managing Director at TJM Investments. TIMOTHY ANDERSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TJM INVESTMENTS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Now what we really need to see is some more details n the tax reform plan, the infrastructure spending plan and exactly what regulatory relief might tae place and what the business community's reaction might be to that." Japanese auto parts maker Takata pled guilty to criminal wrongdoing and agreed to a billion dollar settlement with the U.S. government for its handling of faulty airbags. And a grand jury charged three Takata executives as part of a criminal investigation. Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase all reported quarterly profit results that beat forecasts. Lockheed Martin says it is close to forging a deal to cut the price of its F-35 aircraft. This after its CEO met with President-elect Trump. U.S. retail sales were up in December amid strong demand for autos and furniture. And prices at the wholesale level rose for a second straight month. In Europe, stocks moved higher helped by bank shares.

Jeanne Yurman reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Friday the 13th wasn't too scary for the markets. The Dow was down fractionally. The S&P and Nasdaq finished with mild gains. For the week stocks closed mixed. The Dow and the S&P lost ground but the Nasdaq rose 1 percent. After a big run up in stocks in the past six weeks, there needs to be more clarity to move higher says Tim Anderson, managing Director at TJM Investments. TIMOTHY ANDERSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TJM INVESTMENTS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Now what we really need to see is some more details n the tax reform plan, the infrastructure spending plan and exactly what regulatory relief might tae place and what the business community's reaction might be to that." Japanese auto parts maker Takata pled guilty to criminal wrongdoing and agreed to a billion dollar settlement with the U.S. government for its handling of faulty airbags. And a grand jury charged three Takata executives as part of a criminal investigation. Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase all reported quarterly profit results that beat forecasts. Lockheed Martin says it is close to forging a deal to cut the price of its F-35 aircraft. This after its CEO met with President-elect Trump. U.S. retail sales were up in December amid strong demand for autos and furniture. And prices at the wholesale level rose for a second straight month. In Europe, stocks moved higher helped by bank shares.

The Ftse has enjoyed the longest winning run — 14 straight days — since its inception in 1984. Picture: Lauren Hurley In Dublin, the Iseq index ended at 6,640.10 points, up 0.5% on the day, helped by gains for Bank of Ireland.  The index has now climbed 20% from its 12-month low on June 24, the day after the UK voted to quit the EU. After touching an all-time record high of 7,338.49 points, the Ftse ended the session at a record closing level of 7,337.81 points, up 0.6% on the day. READ NEXT Citywest fails in bid to expand venue “There are people who want to say this is the moment it’s going to turn around, but each day they get proven wrong,” said IG market analyst Josh Mahony. He said a likely further devaluation of the pound in the next few months would support the index higher. “But the gains are not exuberant.” Brokers pushed broadcaster ITV towards the top of the Ftse winners. Goldman Sachs added the broadcaster’s stock to its “conviction list”, saying it is a likely target for mergers and acquisition activity.  The broadcaster was also one of JP Morgan’s top picks in the European media sector. House-builders also helped the Ftse rally, with house improvement retailer Kingfisher marking its best daily gain since September. Barratt Development led sectoral gains, while Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey also gained 1.4% and almost 1%, respectively. “If you want to sleep at night, you’d probably buy a Persimmon or Taylor Wimpey. If you want a bit more rock and roll, you might buy a Redrow or a Bovis [Homes],” said Jefferies analyst Anthony Coding. Pharmaceuticals were buoying the index, rebounding after being weighed down earlier this week by US president-elect Donald Trump’s criticism of high drug prices in the US, and after a meeting of executives of companies to discuss caps on price increases. Shares in pharmaceutical maker Shire were up 2.3%, and peers AstraZeneca and Hikma also gained, up 2% and 1.2%.  Rolls Royce dragged on the index, down more than 2%, while precious metals miners Randgold Resources and Polymetal International fell around 1.4%, tracking the price of gold, which was down from a 7-week high. Building materials supplier SIG surged to the top of the mid-cap index, up over 16% after it reported higher full-year sales.  Its shares marked their biggest one-day gain since March 2009. Blue chip Travis Perkins was up 3% and peer Grafton surged by 8.4%. Reuters and Irish Examiner staff.

Jeanne Yurman reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Friday the 13th wasn't too scary for the markets. The Dow was down fractionally. The S&P and Nasdaq finished with mild gains. For the week stocks closed mixed. The Dow and the S&P lost ground but the Nasdaq rose 1 percent. After a big run up in stocks in the past six weeks, there needs to be more clarity to move higher says Tim Anderson, managing Director at TJM Investments. TIMOTHY ANDERSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TJM INVESTMENTS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Now what we really need to see is some more details n the tax reform plan, the infrastructure spending plan and exactly what regulatory relief might tae place and what the business community's reaction might be to that." Japanese auto parts maker Takata pled guilty to criminal wrongdoing and agreed to a billion dollar settlement with the U.S. government for its handling of faulty airbags. And a grand jury charged three Takata executives as part of a criminal investigation. Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase all reported quarterly profit results that beat forecasts. Lockheed Martin says it is close to forging a deal to cut the price of its F-35 aircraft. This after its CEO met with President-elect Trump. U.S. retail sales were up in December amid strong demand for autos and furniture. And prices at the wholesale level rose for a second straight month. In Europe, stocks moved higher helped by bank shares.

Jeanne Yurman reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Friday the 13th wasn't too scary for the markets. The Dow was down fractionally. The S&P and Nasdaq finished with mild gains. For the week stocks closed mixed. The Dow and the S&P lost ground but the Nasdaq rose 1 percent. After a big run up in stocks in the past six weeks, there needs to be more clarity to move higher says Tim Anderson, managing Director at TJM Investments. TIMOTHY ANDERSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TJM INVESTMENTS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Now what we really need to see is some more details n the tax reform plan, the infrastructure spending plan and exactly what regulatory relief might tae place and what the business community's reaction might be to that." Japanese auto parts maker Takata pled guilty to criminal wrongdoing and agreed to a billion dollar settlement with the U.S. government for its handling of faulty airbags. And a grand jury charged three Takata executives as part of a criminal investigation. Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase all reported quarterly profit results that beat forecasts. Lockheed Martin says it is close to forging a deal to cut the price of its F-35 aircraft. This after its CEO met with President-elect Trump. U.S. retail sales were up in December amid strong demand for autos and furniture. And prices at the wholesale level rose for a second straight month. In Europe, stocks moved higher helped by bank shares.

Jeanne Yurman reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Friday the 13th wasn't too scary for the markets. The Dow was down fractionally. The S&P and Nasdaq finished with mild gains. For the week stocks closed mixed. The Dow and the S&P lost ground but the Nasdaq rose 1 percent. After a big run up in stocks in the past six weeks, there needs to be more clarity to move higher says Tim Anderson, managing Director at TJM Investments. TIMOTHY ANDERSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TJM INVESTMENTS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Now what we really need to see is some more details n the tax reform plan, the infrastructure spending plan and exactly what regulatory relief might tae place and what the business community's reaction might be to that." Japanese auto parts maker Takata pled guilty to criminal wrongdoing and agreed to a billion dollar settlement with the U.S. government for its handling of faulty airbags. And a grand jury charged three Takata executives as part of a criminal investigation. Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase all reported quarterly profit results that beat forecasts. Lockheed Martin says it is close to forging a deal to cut the price of its F-35 aircraft. This after its CEO met with President-elect Trump. U.S. retail sales were up in December amid strong demand for autos and furniture. And prices at the wholesale level rose for a second straight month. In Europe, stocks moved higher helped by bank shares.

Amazon Related: Alexa is the Word as Amazon's AI Comes to More Devices The offering is another way to add "even more value to Prime," Max Bardon, a vice president at Amazon, said in a statement. Prime customers who already have an Amazon rewards card will be upgraded to the new card, said Amazon. The new card, named the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card, is issued by JPMorgan Chase.
