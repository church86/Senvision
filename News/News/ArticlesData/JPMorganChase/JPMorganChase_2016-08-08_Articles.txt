LU WANG Bloomberg News Published Tuesday, Aug. 09, 2016 5:04PM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Aug. 09, 2016 7:36PM EDT Comments AA As earnings stagnate, U.S. companies looking to charge up their stock returns with repurchases are turning to debt markets like no time since the dot-com bubble. Led by Apple Inc. and CBS Corp., S&P 500 constituents have rushed to sell bonds to finance the repurchases of their own stock. The proportion of buybacks funded by debt rose above 30 per cent in June for the first time since 2001, data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bloomberg show. The willingness to borrow shows how loath chief executives are to give up what has been the most consistent source of demand for equities the last few years. Though more company cash flow is used on capital investments than investors probably think, the data highlight one of the many hazards for bulls should the earnings recession lengthen or borrowing costs rise. “It tells a lot of things about how cheap capital is and where the investment opportunities are,” said Matthew McGeary, a Stowe, Vermont-based fund manager with Eagle Asset Management, which oversees about $31-billion (U.S.). “Companies are still struggling to find growth and buying back shares is a good way to grow per-share earnings. But you should think about the sustainability of this strategy.” Using proceeds from debt sales to send cash to stockholders is getting more popular as five quarters of profit declines contributed to a financing deficit that JPMorgan analysts say will last for the rest of the year. Should the U.S. Federal Reserve raise interest rates for a second time, stock repurchases may become the first casualty as borrowing costs go up. Buybacks are already slowing amid the worst profit slump since the global financial crisis and as the S&P 500 sits near a record high. After snapping up trillions of dollars of their own stock in a five-year shopping binge that dwarfed every other buyer in the equity market, companies such as IBM Corp. have put on the brakes, with total announced repurchases falling 18 per cent in 2016 from the average pace in the last three years. Bucking the trend of deceleration, debt-funded buybacks are on the rise. About $157-billion of repurchases were backed by new debt issuance in the 12 months through June, 8 per cent higher from a year earlier. Last month, Apple sold $7-billion in bonds in its third undertaking this year to add debt for shareholder return and CBS raised $700-million from a debt offering with part of the proceeds intended for buybacks. One reason it’s happening is that cash flow from operations isn’t enough to cover outlays from plant upgrades to acquisitions. While $425-billion of internal funds were generated in the second quarter, that was about $35-billion short of what was needed for things such as capital spending and dividends, data compiled by JPMorgan show. At $151-billion, fixed investment remained the largest use of funds. The rush to borrow amid falling bond yields have pushed debt to 32 per cent of total assets at non-financial firms in the S&P 500, the highest level since 2008. The increase in leverage means further cuts in buybacks are likely should rates go higher, according to Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, an equity strategist with JPMorgan. Unlike dividends that tend to be consistent, companies are less reluctant to put buybacks on hold. The influence of corporate buybacks on share performance has shown signs of waning. Since peaking in February, 2015, an S&P 500 index of companies repurchasing the most shares has lost 5.6 per cent, compared with a 1.4-per-cent gain in the equal-weight index of the benchmark gauge. “Companies have massively loaded balance sheet. When higher rates start kicking in, that’s basically going to be additional headwinds,” Mr. Lakos-Bujas said by phone. “Buybacks have supported equity prices a lot in this cycle and could be less of a tailwind.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail What will the new S&P Buyback Index tell us?

 A hot finance startup led by a former JPMorgan high-flier has put together a dream team of hires Tina Wadhwa Aug. 2, 2016, 11:48 AM 9,642 facebook linkedin twitter email print Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters on stage at Money2020. Business Insider/Oscar Williams-Grut Digital Asset Holdings, the buzzy blockchain startup run by former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters, has assembled a dream team of new hires. The firm is building out its senior team with eight high-profile hires spread across New York, London, and Frankfurt. Among the new hires are: Carol Mathis has joined as CFO. She previously served as COO and CFO at RBS. Josh Varsano joined as chief human resources officer. He previously worked as the global head of human of resources for Point72 Asset Management and as HR managing director at JPMorgan Chase. Kelly Mathieson was hired as product manager. She is a former head of JPMorgan's global collateral management and securities clearing business. Andrew Pisano, who previously built out blockchain strategy at CME Group's Digitization Group, joined as business development director. Gavin Wells, who will be based in London, also joined the DAH team as head of Europe. Wells spent 15 years as a managing director at Citi and most recently delivered the first clearing service for foreign exchange at LCH Clearnet. Gordon Weir has joined as head of delivery. He previously served as head of development transformation across global technology and operations at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Martin Korbmacher has been hired as strategic advisor to help scale Digital Asset Holding's growth and service across European markets. Korbmacher was the former head of investment banking for Germany and Austria at Credit Suisse and will be based in Frankfurt. Digital Asset Holdings aims to use blockchain technology to make the settlement of transactions quicker. Blockchain has the potential to allow a digital asset to be securely and seamlessly transferred from one party to another, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries and shortening settlement time to seconds. This could greatly reduce costs and risk, and create new revenue opportunities by making markets more efficient. Masters joined the startup in March 2015 as CEO. She had previously worked at JPMorgan, where she held several senior positions including head of global commodities, CFO of JPMorgan's investment bank, and head of global credit portfolio and credit policy and strategy. Earlier this year, Digital Asset Holdings announced that it was opening a London office to support its clients and increase its presence in the UK and European markets. The startup is also building out an Australia office following the selection by the Australia Securities Exchange to help replace its existing clearing and settlement system with a blockchain solution. The ASX will decide whether to go through with the change by mid-2017. NOW WATCH: Here's how much $100 is worth in every state Loading video...

Think tanks are non-profit policy research establishments with tax-exempt status, as they are assumed to be doing work to advance the public good, not cater to private interests. Traditional lobbying of the federal government is likewise regulated to promote transparency. When the rules become too onerous, or the public image of a corporation is stained by its overt solicitations for policy change, think tanks become a useful corporate device, the New York Times has found, in a Sunday report jointly researched with the New England Center for Investigative Reporting (NECIR). In one instance, drone manufacturer and military contractor General Atomics sought the services of the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). With the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in a slump in 2013, fewer drones were being sold to the US military. The California-based maker of Predator drones needed to find customers abroad, but weapons trade restrictions at the time prohibited their export. Following a donation of tens of thousands of dollars to CSIS – a small sum compared to other donors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the Times reported – the think tank not only completed a study on drone policy and export in 2014, but actually arranged secret meetings in its office headquarters with officials from the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and the State Department as well as the secretary of defense. General Atomics now had prime access to policymakers in the think tank space to advance its business goals. The State Department then released new trade rules in February 2015, encouraging fewer limits on the export of drones, leading to a deal between General Atomics and the United Arab Emirates. The sale of unarmed drones to a non-NATO country was the first of its kind, according to the Times. The Brookings Institution, a left-leaning powerhouse in Washington, had “thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence,” with for-profit businesses, including JPMorgan Chase, the biggest of the big US banks, the Times-NECIR report said. Offering “donation benefits” in its memos, Brookings appeared to “blur the lines” between offering neutral research and corporate public relations, according to the report. Called a “university without students,” Brookings was named “Top think tank in the world” in a 2015 report by the University of Pennsylvania. Founded in 1916, the think tank operates on an average annual income of $107.5 million, according to TheBestSchools.org, which lists it as number 7 of the 50 most influential think tanks in the US. The Times-NECIR report said that dollar figure represents a doubling in the tank’s budget in the last decade. According to the report, JPMorgan made a tax-deductible donation of $15.5 million 2011 to Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program, the largest sum of money ever received by the institution from a private company. However, what came out of that gift was a brand new project dubbed the Global Cities Initiative. It even had a logo including the line “joint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase,” a corporate rebranding tactic some argue. The project encouraged both local economic growth and international trade, of which JPMorgan would have a major stake in through its business loan programs. “Bottom line: Growing metro economies is good for the nation and for JPMC; also, many U.S. cities are JPMC clients — motivation to support them and their clients,” a July 2011 internal Brookings document read, according to the Times-NECIR report. The appearance of quid-pro-quo was not lost on those at Brookings. “No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,” read a 2013 Brookings memo referring to a dinner with JPMorgan executives, the Times reported. “We need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.” Based on the documents obtained via an open records request, the report appears to reflect an open secret on Capitol Hill. In September 2015, Brookings lost Robert Litan as a senior fellow economist, after he was accused of withholding information showing a conflict of interest in his own research against financial reform related to retirement advising, the International Business Times reported. The pressure came came from Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who called Litan “an industry player seeking a specific conclusion.” Warren spoke to the New York Times for its recent report, regarding the consequences of special interested-peddled research when it reaches congressional chambers. “[Corporations] take a lot of money, because they got plenty of money to spend. They put it into a think tank, with a few strings attached, and the think tank comes up with the research that just so happens to advance the interests of the corporation,” Warren said, adding, “That then means, right here in the Senate, we can make bad decisions … not decisions that favor the American people.” Brookings executive vice president Martin S. Indyk denies the implied allegations. “We do not compromise our integrity,” Indyk told the New York Times. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact,” adding that Brookings recently disallowed any corporation or corporate-supported entity from contributing anonymously.

It can still take days for a check to go through, a relative eternity that banking regulators worry is impeding commerce and economic growth. The slowness has led many to new mobile services, like PayPal’s Venmo or Square Cash, which make it possible to pay a friend instantly with just a phone. Now, the banks are catching up.  Wells Fargo has joined JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and US Bank in allowing customers to send money in seconds to one another’s bank accounts using just a phone number or email address. Customers of the biggest banks can now use their mobile phones, say, to send money instantly to a child in college who needs cash. “We pay attention to what customers are asking for, and we are doing all the things we need to stay competitive,’’ said Brett Pitts, who leads digital initiatives at Wells Fargo. The stakes are high: Banks are under broad pressure both from the Federal Reserve, which has a “faster payments committee” aimed at requiring immediate improvements, and from tech companies like PayPal and Apple, whose Apple Pay service was a bright spot in its earnings recent report. American bank executives fear that they could lose ground to plucky payment companies like Venmo, a popular choice among millennials who want to pay each other, and send emoji-filled messages to their friends. The banks worry that if they do not respond with their own instant payment offerings, they will be relegated to performing less-profitable back-office functions for hip new payment companies, which make their money primarily by charging small fees to customers who pay by credit card rather than directly from a bank account. The person-to-person payment market is valuable because it allows financial companies to gain the first point of contact with a consumer and then try to sell them other products like loans. Analysts predict that the new payments network could be extended to connect consumers with merchants, providing a potentially lucrative source of fees for banks. “It’s like owning a toll road: You are going to get paid by everybody that uses it,” said Gareth Lodge, a payments analyst at Celent, a financial consulting firm. MasterCard and Visa, which have a tight grip on payments made with credit and debit cards, are also trying to gain a foothold in these new networks. Last month, MasterCard acquired a majority stake in VocaLink, the company that operates a mobile and internet payment network in the United Kingdom and is helping to develop a broader system in the U.S. Visa recently announced a broad partnership with PayPal that will make both of their offerings more instantaneous. Instant person-to-person payment is something people in many other countries have been able to do for years, and the absence of the service in the United States has been a marker of the relative backwardness of American banks. The banks began developing the system being introduced this year in 2011, when Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo created a network called clearXchange. That system has allowed bank customers to send each other money using just an email address or cellphone number, but transactions were not instant until this year. In addition to payments technology the nation’s largest banks are rolling out this summer, banks in an industry group called the Clearing House are developing a broader network that will allow businesses and governments to make large instant payments. A fast and efficient payment network also has implications for the economy. Federal officials and analysts say the current lag time between when a payment is sent and when the money is cleared to spend can hinder businesses from balancing their books and managing their supplies. The lag also puts the United States at a disadvantage compared with, say, Europe, where banks are far ahead in making payments instantaneous. The banks now face a challenge to make their real-time technology easy enough to lure customers away from startups like Venmo. With Venmo, a user can send money to anyone simply by tapping into the app and entering a phone number or email address. By contrast, customers of JPMorgan Chase, for example, must log into their Chase app using their password, then navigate through a series of somewhat clunky tabs to initiate a transaction with QuickPay.  © 2016 El Paso Inc..

 TOP IPO BANKER: We have 'a pretty broad swath of deals ready for launch' Portia Crowe Aug. 8, 2016, 4:29 PM 3,806 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan's Liz Myers. Screenshot/Bloomberg TV It's been a slow year for the initial public offering, or IPO, market — but things could start to really pick up soon. That's what JPMorgan's global head of equity capital markets, Liz Myers, expects. She said in a recent Bloomberg TV interview that JPMorgan has more than 20 IPOs slated for launch globally in September, and a "full pipeline" for 2017. "It's a pretty broad swath of deals ready for launch," Myers said. She also noted that the firm expects to see more than a dozen tech IPOs before the end of the year. Those will mainly be smaller deals in software, Myers said, although we'll start to see larger tech IPOs in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, she added, we can expect to see activity in the virtual-reality, artificial-intelligence, and robotics spaces. She also said that Asia will see some larger IPOs toward the end of 2016 and into 2017. The largest tech IPO this year was the Japanese messaging app Line, which raised about $1 billion in its July debut on the Tokyo and New York stock exchanges. In addition to the tech sector, Myers said to expect more deals in the financial-services, healthcare, and consumer-retail sectors. She said that investors right now are not overly worried about the outcome of the US presidential election in November, nor are they overly cautious about the activities of the Federal Reserve. "Right now the reception [to IPOs] has been pretty good across a multitude of sectors," Myers said.

Retake All-Time Highs? JPM is close to record highs, but where it goes beyond that is a tough call By Dan Burrows, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Aug 9, 2016, 11:32 am EST     Popular Posts: The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 The 10 Best S&P 500 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Hit Another Bump in the Road Recent Posts: Twitter Inc. (TWTR) Stock Set to End 2016 with a Whimper Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock’s Rebound Underscores the Buy Case General Electric Company (GE) Stock Hasn’t Looked This Healthy in a While View All Posts Shares in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) jumped on last week’s blowout jobs report and now investors have to feel good about JPM stock’s chance to reclaim record levels soon. At $66 and change, JPM stock isn’t that far off its all-time closing high. Nine months ago, it was knocking on the door of $69 a share. That represents less than 5% in additional upside after Friday’s move of 2.7%. The technicals are favorable, the market is setting new records session after session and the news flow continues to support a Federal Reserve rate hike sooner than later. But beyond that milestone, JPM could very well be priced to disappoint. A number of Wall Street analysts certainly think so. Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz on Monday cut his rating on JPMorgan to neutral. The market will enjoy a September rate hike if it does indeed come to pass, but the analyst says it’s going to take more than that. The 7 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy Now After all, banks need a sustained cycle of tightening that creates a steeper yield curve. A one-off rate hike isn’t going to cut it. Horowitz has a target price of $65 on JPMorgan stock, which implies there’s downside ahead. Overestimating JPM Stock? A neutral view on JPM stock isn’t exactly a popular view, Horowitz acknowledges. From his note to clients: “JPMorgan is probably one of the most consensus longs on the buy side and sell side (76% of the 38 analyst ratings are Buy), which we believe is reflective of a strong management team that has been able to weather the tough macro and regulatory environment better than peers. So in the context of a group that we view as fairly valued at 10.3% cost of equity… and our view that JPMorgan forward EPS estimates are about 2% too high for 2017 and 2018, we no longer see significant near term upside (15% over one year) to warrant a Buy.” But it is wise for investors in bank stocks to curb their enthusiasm about the next Fed rate increase. Yes, this will begin to relieve some pressure on banks’ net interest margins, but short-term rates are still going to be sitting at pitiful levels. The central bank is hardly opening the spigot. After the immediate celebratory upside of a rate hike, JPM stock will face fundamentals that haven’t changed all that much. Whether that sets it up for underperformance remains to be seen, but there are other big bank stocks offering better bets. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

I’m here to help you manage your money, find a job and pay off student loans — all the real-world stuff no one taught us how to do in college. Send your questions about postgrad life to askbrianna@nerdwallet.com. This week’s question: “I need money and I’m thinking about driving for Lyft or Uber, or working for another app that lets me set my own hours. Is that a good idea?” With the release of every cheekily named on-demand app comes a new way for 20- and 30-somethings to make money on the side. Got a car? Drive for Lyft or Uber. Got a couple of hours to kill? Deliver cookies or cold medicine for Postmates. Got a knack for assembling furniture? Make money doing it with TaskRabbit. (Also, there’s an Ikea wardrobe in my apartment with your name on it.) The explosion of the “gig economy” — the collection of online platforms that let workers sell their services directly to consumers on their own schedules — has lowered the barrier to entry for workers who need money quickly. The flexibility a gig affords can help you make extra money to pay off your student loans early, for instance, or to pay bills during gaps between jobs. That’s how most workers use online platforms now. But the larger story of the move toward temporary work worries me. I’m not cool with the idea that my generation must cobble together multiple jobs at odd hours without enjoying a 401(k) match or paid sick time. Gigs aren’t replacements for full-time jobs with benefits, and it’s worth considering what we give up if, increasingly, they’re our only options. Gigs small but growing Today, the gig economy isn’t all that big. Between 2012 and 2015, just 0.4% of adults earned income consistently each month using online labor platforms like Uber, the JPMorgan Chase Institute found. Most gig workers supplemented lost income during periods of low earnings or when they were between jobs. As of September 2015, more than 80 percent of workers who used online labor platforms made less than 25% of their total income from that work. But over the three years JPMorgan Chase performed its study, the percentage of adults who earned money regularly from online gigs grew tenfold. And the growth of gigs extends beyond online platforms. In March, researchers at Harvard and Princeton found that from 2005 to 2015, the percentage of workers in “alternative work arrangements,” defined as online and offline temporary, on-call, freelance and contract work, went up 50%, to 15.8% of all workers. That accounts for all the net employment growth in the U.S. economy in that time. More flexibility, less money The problem is that temporary, contract and other “contingent workers” earn less overall than employees in standard work arrangements, the Government Accountability Office reported last year. They’re more likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance. They’re two-thirds less likely to have a retirement plan at work. Olivia West, a singer-songwriter and mother of two based in Nashville, Tennessee, drives for Lyft to help pay the bills. She says she makes $250 to $450, before taxes, driving 25 to 50 hours a week between shows. “Per hour I make a lot more singing than I do driving, but those gigs are harder to find,” she says. “The driving app is always there, filling the need.” She used to clean houses to make extra money, but that paid less and was more physically demanding than driving for Lyft. She only just started a savings account for emergencies, and car maintenance and gas eat into her earnings. She’s not saving for retirement. Do-it-yourself benefits When you work for yourself, it’s up to you to find health care (made easier by the Affordable Care Act) and save for retirement beyond what Social Security will provide. In addition, you don’t have access to unemployment insurance if you’re laid off. “These are things you’re going to have to kind of hack yourself when you’re working as your own boss,” says Katie Bryan, communications director for America Saves, a campaign run by the Consumer Federation of America. That means setting up automatic transfers each month to a savings account for emergencies — aim to save $500 to start — and for the taxes you might be on the hook for. Save for retirement now in an individual account like a Roth IRA to take advantage of compound earnings over time, or set up a free myRA starter account, newly available through the U.S. Department of the Treasury. You can transfer your money to a higher-earning account later. In the meantime, lawsuits continue over whether gig economy participants should be classified as employees or as independent contractors. Some proposals, like this one from the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project, argue they should be considered an entirely separate class of worker so they get certain traditional benefits. “I would like to see workers who are involved in the gig economy receive some of the same protections that traditional employees receive and coverage under some of the same laws,” says Alan Krueger, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and co-author of the Hamilton Project proposal. Until that happens, set up an online savings account; there’s no paid sick time if you need some of that Postmates cold medicine for yourself. Brianna McGurran is a staff writer at NerdWallet.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Cucinella went after Sean Stewart on cross-examination, repeatedly asking about lies as she sought to discredit the Yale University-educated 35-year-old, who was making nearly $1 million annually before his arrest last year. She wanted to know if Stewart lied to JPMorgan Chase & Co., where he was a vice president, when the company confronted him in 2011 over stock trades carried out by his father before two public companies merged. He said he did. She wanted to know if he persuaded his brother to lie about his nightlife so his wife wouldn't get angry at him. He said he did. She asked if his father lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission. He said he did. VIDEOS TOP JOBS And she wanted to know if he lied when he promised to obey his bail conditions rather than drain money from an account put up as collateral. He said he did. "I was shocked at the time," Stewart said. "I had done nothing wrong." Later, Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah McCallum took her turn during closing arguments to dissect Stewart's claims that he had no idea his father would trade on information he divulged as part of his tight relationship with his parents. She noted that Stewart's father frequently bought stock or options in companies involved in five mergers or acquisitions soon after communicating with him and often after a major development in the deals. "Five times the defendant handed his father tomorrow's news today," McCallum said, explaining how advanced knowledge of a merger would allow an investor to score a 20 percent gain or more on the day the deal is announced. The prosecutor said his testimony over two days revealed "a story totally at odds with the evidence in this case." She added: "The problem is the defendant's story is false." As an example, she described Stewart's lies to protect himself and his father when JPMorgan lawyers asked if his father learned about a merger from anything he said. "The defendant told this forest of lies, and the devil was in the details," she told jurors. A month after the interview, Stewart went to work for Perella Weinberg Partners LP, turning down a promotion JPMorgan had offered for him to stay. During a closing argument, defense lawyer Martin Cohen repeated the defense assertion that Stewart's father, Robert Stewart, who has pleaded guilty and been sentenced to a year of home detention, was to blame. "What he did is so horrible it's hard to understand," Cohen said. When Sean Stewart testified earlier Monday, he blamed his father, saying he'd "made some terrible mistakes" and his actions had "resulted in the loss of my career and reputation."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Salt Lake City police cancel Amber Alert for 3-year-old girl who is found safe in Hawaii BYU football: RB coach Reno Mahe's daughter clings to life after hanging accident After unusual election, lawmakers draft pile of bills seeking to make changes BYU basketball: Title belt at stake as Cougs get rematch with Valparaiso Ed Kimball, who wrote warts-and-all biographies of his father, Mormon leader Spencer Kimball, dies | ELEVATE During National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month the Focus is Keeping Caregivers Healthy   Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Stewart, 35, is charged with passing tips on five health-care mergers to his father, Bob Stewart, from 2011 to 2014. He testified Monday in his insider-trading trial that he lied when he told lawyers that he hadn’t given his father any information about Kendle International Inc. Instead, Stewart testified, he often talked about work with his father and other family members, never thinking the information would be used to make trades. “I did not want to get in trouble,” he said on cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Cucinella. “I did not want my father to get in trouble.” “You lied to the people that were sitting right across from you, right?” Cucinella asked. “I did,” Stewart said. He testified that he was questioned by the compliance staff after his father’s name showed up on a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority list of people who traded in Kendle stock around the time the acquisition by INC Research LLC was announced. At an August 2011 meeting at the Yale Club in Manhattan, Sean said, he confronted his father about the trades. Risky Move Stewart was questioned in Manhattan federal court for an hour and a half Monday, his second day on the witness stand. He testified in a risky move to convince jurors that he was unaware his father was using information gleaned from discussions about work, the family and other matters.  “My dad made some terrible mistakes,” Sean Stewart testified. “He used me.” Sean Stewart left JPMorgan Chase for Perella Weinberg Partners LP in October 2011, where he continued providing tips to his father, according to prosecutors. Sean testified that the elder Stewart had promised never again to trade on information his son acquired at work. Claudia Stewart, Sean’s mother and the wife of Bob Stewart for 39 years, told jurors that she, Sean’s brother Ryan and their wives were almost always present when Sean and Bob Stewart were together. She said she never noticed them speaking privately. “I would say, ‘What’s going on, what’s the issue?’” if she had seen them talking one-on-one, she said. “I’d probably think they were talking about me, because that’s how I am.” Before the trial began, Sean’s lawyers tried to force Bob Stewart to testify as a defense witness. At a hearing, Bob pleaded his Fifth Amendment right against incriminating himself. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain agreed with Bob’s lawyers that he couldn’t be forced to take the witness stand. Father’s Gain Prosecutors said that Sean Stewart benefited from his father’s insider trades when Bob Stewart used $10,055 to pay for the photographer at his son’s June 2011 wedding. Claudia Stewart testified that the couple also paid a $7,200 photographer’s bill for the wedding of Sean’s brother the following month. Start your day with what’s moving markets.

She and Sean both became tearful when his lawyer, Martin Cohen, showed jurors photos of what she called “happy family times,” including Sean with Bob in the pool, on the Little League team coached by Bob, and at a party for Ryan’s high school graduation. The relationship with his father is “damaged, perhaps permanently damaged,” Sean said at the conclusion of questioning by his attorney.  “He is my father, and he raised me,” Sean said. “And I love him, and I always will.” Both sides delivered closing arguments after Sean and Claudia Stewart’s testimony. "Five times, the defendant handed his father tomorrow’s news today, so he could make some fast cash on stolen information," Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Eddy McCallum told jurors. ‘Foolish Man’ McCallum told jurors that if Sean Stewart, a Yale University graduate and successful investment banker, told the truth about not knowing his father was trading on the details of the deals they discussed, he would have to be "a naïve, foolish man." McCallum called the idea "ridiculous," telling jurors Sean is instead "remarkably polished." Martin Cohen, a lawyer for Stewart, told jurors that his client was victimized by his father. "How could a father do what Robert Stewart did here to Sean Stewart?" he asked. "He never intended his father would take that information and trade on it." Cohen said the father merely picked up company names from conversations with Sean, knowing that his son specialized in healthcare mergers. Cohen said the government’s star witness, Bob’s friend and trading partner, Richard Cunniffe, lied when he implicated Sean Stewart in the insider-trading conspiracy. Swain said jurors will begin deliberating tomorrow after she instructs them on the law that applies to the case. The case is U.S. v. Stewart, 15-cr-00287, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Morgan Chase's stock extends gains despite downgrade at Citigroup By Tomi Kilgore Published: Aug 8, 2016 9:44 a.m. ET Share By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s stock JPM, +0.55% was downgraded Monday by Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz, who said he was no longer bullish at current levels as he believes investors and analysts are a bit too optimistic. He downgraded the stock to neutral, after being at buy since April 2014. Horowitz believes the banking giant is one of the most favored among buy side and sell side analysts, with more than three quarters of analysts rating it the equivalent of a buy. As a result, he said he believes 2017 and 2018 earnings estimates are about 2% too high. "In this environment, you want to rent not buy the banks," Horowitz wrote in a note to clients. "In a prolonged low rate-growth environment, we believe the banks are more trading range stocks and we believe the time to add to positions is when sentiment is negative." The stock was up 0.2% in morning trade. It has run up 7.4% over the past month to close Friday in positive territory for the year for the first time. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.23% has gained 6.6% year to date.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Researchers or lobbyists? Think tanks blur the line print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2605356 false Greg Kahn / The New York Times The Brookings Institution, which operates on a $100 million annual budget, twice what it was a decade ago, is located in Washington, D.C. Think tanks are seen as independent, but their scholars often push donors’ agendas, amplifying a culture of corporate influence in Washington. Click here to enlarge images 2605364 false T.J. Kirkpatrick / The New York Times Martin Indyk, the Brookings Institution’s executive vice president, speaks during a panel discussion at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C. in December. Indyk said the think tank’s collaboration with Lennar Corp. to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco reflected a shared goal to revitalize cities. Click here to enlarge images Researchers or lobbyists? Think tanks blur the line By Eric Lipton and Brooke Williams / New York Times News Service Published Aug 8, 2016 at 12:02AM WASHINGTON — As Lennar Corp., one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, pushed ahead with an $8 billion plan to revitalize a barren swath of San Francisco, it found a trusted voice to vouch for its work: the Brookings Institution, the most prestigious think tank in the world. “This can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,” Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar’s different divisions. The think tank began to aggressively promote the project, San Francisco’s biggest redevelopment effort since its recovery from the 1906 earthquake and later offered to help Lennar “engage with national media to develop stories that highlight Lennar’s innovative approach.” And Brookings went further. It named Kofi Bonner, the Lennar executive in charge of the San Francisco development, as a senior fellow — an enviable credential he used to advance the company’s efforts. Think tanks, which position themselves as “universities without students,” have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status. Thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence between Brookings and other donors — like JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank; KKR, the global investment firm; Microsoft, the software giant; and Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate — show financial support often came with assurances from Brookings that it would provide “donation benefits,” including setting up events featuring corporate executives with government officials, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. “This is about giant corporations who figured out that by spending, hey, a few tens of millions of dollars, if they can influence outcomes here in Washington, they can make billions of dollars,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a frequent critic of undisclosed Wall Street donations to think tanks. Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development. “We do not compromise our integrity,” said Martin Indyk, Brookings’ executive vice president. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact.” But he acknowledged the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the “appearance of a conflict of interest.” Buying influence? At think tanks like Brookings, the majority of reports and events, with titles like “Five Evils: Multidimensional Poverty and Race in America” or “India at the Global High Table,” have no obvious link to corporate donors. Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions. The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution’s history. Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services. “People think of think tanks as do-gooders, uncompromised and not bought like others in the political class,” said Bill Goodfellow, the executive director of the Center for International Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. “But it’s absurd to suggest that donors don’t have influence. The danger is we in the think tank world are being corrupted in the same way as the political world. And all of us should be worried about it.” Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure their reports are based on scholars’ independent conclusions. Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank’s work benefits the public good, not a company’s bottom line. But two lawyers who specialize in nonprofit law — Miranda Perry Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, and Clifford Perlman, a partner at a New York-based firm — said Brookings’ agreements raised questions. “Tax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,” Fleischer said. “And the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.” Indyk said that opinion was “totally unfounded,” noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems. “Brookings’s conclusion that all of these activities it engaged in with these donors primarily benefited the public rather than the donors is consistent with the applicable federal tax standards,” Douglas Varley, one of the lawyers for Brookings, said in a statement. Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas. FedEx teamed up with the Atlantic Council — a think tank that focuses on international relations, with annual revenue that has surged to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade — to build support for a free-trade agreement the company hoped would increase business. Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool. “The impact and reach of the report would be maximized by a rollout event” including a “public report launch with member(s) of Congress from one of the relevant committees,” said a two-page summary drafted by the Atlantic Council months before the study had been completed. When the report came out in late 2014, its conclusions mirrored arguments FedEx had been aggressively pushing on Capitol Hill, including recommending a reduction in trans-Atlantic tariffs and allowing more duty-free shipments. Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research. “There is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,” Kempe said. 14697002 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 August 2016 Monte dei Paschi woes add to huge investment fees LONDON: Italy’s troubled lenders are offering lucrative opportunities for investment banks, with Monte dei Paschi di Siena set to pay some of the highest fees in Europe this year to arrange its high stakes rescue plan. The emergency deal, orchestrated by Mediobanca and JPMorgan, to save the 544-year-old bank, will incur about 250 million euros (US$278.43mil) in underwriting fees for a proposed 5 billion euro capital hike, according to three sources involved in the deal. That comes on top of nearly 400 million euros the bank has paid in the past two years for other capital hikes. There is no certainty the proposed rescue plan will proceed, but if it is carried out successfully, investment banks working with Monte dei Paschi will have generated a payday of close to 1 billion euros over the past three years, though the bank’s market value currently stands at 747 million euros. “The scale of fees that potentially are there in the Italian banking market – from restructurings and consolidation – are substantial,” said Peter Hahn, professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking & Finance. Monte dei Paschi emerged as the worst performer in European stress tests on July 29 and Italy’s largest lender, UniCredit, was also among the banks which fared badly. Monte dei Paschi’s poor showing in the tests – which predicted its capital would be wiped out if there was a severe economic downturn – came despite it tapping investors for cash twice since 2014. Last year the bank paid 130 million euros to a pool of banks for a 3 billion euro cash call. In 2014 it spent more than any other company in Europe on investment banking fees, paying advisers nearly US$304mil for its 5 billion euro capital hike, according to Thomson Reuters data. By contrast Deutsche Bank paid about 119 million euros (US$133.18mil) in 2014 to underwriters for its 8 billion euro capital hike, according to the prospectus for its rights issue. A spokeswoman for Monte dei Paschi declined to comment for this story. If successful, the bank’s rescue plan will see even higher fees as it involves the creation of a special purpose vehicle to hoover up Monte dei Paschi’s bad loans. That part of the plan could net banks up to 300 million euros, sources said, pointing to the need for a 6 billion euro syndicated bridge loan to provide financing to the special purpose vehicle to begin buying up the debt. A bridge loan – which Monte dei Paschi said in its turnaround plan is a possibility – is seen by sources as inevitable since the timetable to split the Tuscan lender into a good and bad bank and simultaneously raise cash is too tight. Monte dei Paschi and its global coordinators JPMorgan and Mediobanca aim to carry out the cash call by the end of the year, most likely in November, the sources said. JPMorgan and Mediobanca declined to comment for this article. The large bill reflects the risk that the deal will not happen because investors are reluctant to sign up to the capital increase due to Monte dei Paschi’s history of failed turnaround plans, uncertain market conditions and fear of increased exposure to the euro zone’s third largest economy. “It is way more expensive than any other equity capital markets (ECM) deal in Europe because of the risk profile of the transaction,” said a London-based analyst who stressed the “country risk” adds to the operational complexity of the transaction. The bank has said it would plug capital shortfalls and restore its health by splitting into a good and bad bank. The plan envisages the sale of 9.2 billion euros in bad loans and a 5 billion-euro capital increase. But none of the dozens of banks contacted by the troubled lender in recent weeks to form an underwriting consortium have made firm commitments to guarantee its proposed 5 billion euro cap hike, sources said. Mediobanca chief executive Alberto Nagel said on Friday “this is a pre-underwriting agreement which by definition is not a hard underwriting and is not a commitment.” The lack of commitment means the plan can still fall apart. Any failure of the world’s oldest bank would damage the entire Italian banking system and could spark contagion across Europe so Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s government has pressured Italian and international investment banks to make the rescue work, sources said. A spokesman for the Italian government, however, told Reuters he was not aware of any pressure on banks. The government does not want to mount its own rescue because European rules say this would mean imposing losses on bondholders and depositors above 100,000 euros. – Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , italy Related Stories Will Italy leave the EU? ‘Aye’ for Italy’s third largest bank Renzi’s gamble gets real for investors Banca Ifis may buy US$2.2bil bad loans Mortgages show how difficult it is to rescue Italian banks You May Be Interested Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex Property Related advertisement Latest News Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Industrials lift Dow to record, techs drag S&P and Nasdaq (Update 1) Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Most Viewed in Business Fraud in Felda Global Ventures M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Malakoff seeks RM785mil compensation from EPCC contractors of Tg Bin plant Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM Ringgit opens easier on weak sentiment With US$3b port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore's pie Bank Negara keeps OPR unchanged at 3% advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Setting the tone for markets, the U.S. non-farm payroll report released Friday showed the U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, beating expectations for 180,000. Good news on the jobs front may spur the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates sooner than the market had expected. Other factors may also spur volatility in markets. "Seasonal September quarter weakness along with risks around Italian banks, the Fed and global growth generally could still see more volatility in shares in the short term," said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital in a note to clients. Health-check for China There are several important data releases in China this week, including trade, inflation, industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investments. "In July, we expect that overall economic growth momentum remained largely stable," said economists Helen Qiao, Xiaojia Zhi and Sylia Sheng at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The economists said they expected the on-year growth of real industrial production and nominal fixed asset investment to have gone up last month, supported by the "resilience in infrastructure construction demand and favorable base effects." They expected industrial production growth to edge up to 6.3 percent on-year, up from 6.2 percent in June. JPMorgan analysts wrote in a separate note that the slowing fixed investment growth was "partly driven by weak private investment." "From the industry perspective, it appears investment in the traditional industries, such as mining and metals, have underperformed significantly, while investment in the new and services industries ... [have] outperformed notably," the JPMorgan analysts said. But both sets of market watchers agreed that the recent floods in southern China could throw a wrench in the works as they likely disrupted "real activities," which meant the data print could come in lower than expected. Central bank watch in the region After the Bank of Japan increased its purchase of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to a new record low, markets will be looking at central banks in India, New Zealand and South Korea, all due to meet this week, to see if they also followed up with additional easing. The Reserve Bank of India's outgoing Governor Raghuram Rajan will present his final bi-monthly policy review on Tuesday before stepping down in September. Moody's Analytics said in a note Friday it expects the India central bank to keep the repo rate at 6.5 percent and that the RBI is unlikely to cut until the "monsoon season finishes in September." In New Zealand, the central bank will meet on Thursday and some market watchers expected interest rates could be slashed further. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said in its latest economic update released in July that prospects for growth in the global economy had diminished despite "very stimulatory monetary policy and low oil prices," and that financial volatility had increased following the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. Kate Hickie and Paul Dales from Capital Economics said they expected the RBNZ to cut interest rates from 2.25 percent to 2 percent and to "confirm that it is willing to reduce rates further." They said a "stubbornly high exchange rate, low inflation expectations and subdued wage growth" could likely see an additional rate cut below 2 percent. Earnings season Down Under After a handful of companies, including miner Rio Tinto, released quarterly earnings last week, several big names were set to release their results this week, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Telstra and News Corp. Economic conditions have somewhat improved since the beginning of the year, after oil and other resource prices stabilized and China's economy found its footing again. AMP Capital's Oliver said sectors likely to see good profits included discretionary retail, industrials, gaming and healthcare. "Expect disappointers to be punished severely with sharp share price falls," he warned.

(Shehan Peruma / CC 2.0) Are think tanks “blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists”? Eric Lipton and Brooke Williams of The New York Times certainly think so. In a long report published Sunday, Lipton and Williams come to the conclusion that some of the world’s most renowned think tanks “have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns.” Think tanks, many of which are nonprofit organizations, are research institutions that study policy and are generally viewed as financially independent. The Brookings Institution, one of the most acclaimed think tanks in the country, is the main target of The New York Times piece. Lipton and Williams, in partnership with the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, cite internal memos and emails to build their case against Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program, which studies policy initiatives related to the economy. Lipton and Williams write: The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution’s history. Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services. Specifically, the authors cite a Brookings spreadsheet that they claim “highlighted Brookings’s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions.” This, Lipton and Williams argue, brings up questions regarding Brookings’ nonprofit status. “Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank’s work benefits the public good, not a company’s bottom line,” they write, before citing two nonprofit lawyers who believe Brookings’ arrangements “raised questions.” Brookings posted a public response on Medium, stating that the piece “fundamentally misrepresents our mission and distorts how we operate, particularly in our relationship with corporate funders.” It continues: The reporters’ attempt to buttress their thesis with cherry-picked phrases lifted from thousands of pages of internal — often informal or draft — documents, using them out of context. They also ignore a large body of evidence we made available to them demonstrating that the projects in question were developed in ways that hewed to our institutional standards of scholarly independence. Brookings responds in several points to Lipton and Williams’ critique of the Metropolitan Policy Program. “In the coming days,” the statement concludes, “we will provide point-by-point rebuttals of the reporters’ allegations made in these articles.” Lipton and Williams’ report includes assertions against many other think tanks as well, such as the Atlantic Council, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Hudson Institute. The Hudson Insitute also issued a statement in response to the assertions against it, clarifying “two key matters about its own work that the Times has either obscured or misstated.” It also notes that it has a four-star rating from Transparify, which gives global ratings to “the financial transparency of major think tanks.” The Brookings Institution also received four stars, a “broadly transparent” rating. Sunday’s report by Lipton and Williams was the first in a series called “Think Tanks Inc.” Part two in the series was published Monday. Co-written by Lipton, Williams and Nicholas Confessore, the second article questions the objectivity of researchers within think tanks. “An examination of 75 think tanks found an array of researchers who had simultaneously worked as registered lobbyists, members of corporate boards or outside consultants in litigation and regulatory disputes, with only intermittent disclosure of their dual roles,” the piece states. “Many think tanks also readily confer ‘nonresident scholar’ status on lobbyists, former government officials and others who earn their primary living working for private clients, with few restrictions on such outside work.” Lipton, Williams and Confessore have criticized think tanks, particularly Brookings, before. In a 2014 Times article, they wrote that many think tanks accept huge donations from foreign governments, giving these foreign interests more lobbying power in Washington.
