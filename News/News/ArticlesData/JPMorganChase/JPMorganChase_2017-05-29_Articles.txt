However, with innovative entrepreneurs making moves and an economy that is ready to reclaim its former glory, the Motor City is poised for an impressive resurgence. And if you need some convincing, JPMorgan Chase as 150 million reasons to believe in this Michigan gem. In tandem with Detroit Startup Week powered by Chase for Business, JPMorgan Chase has announced they will be increasing their initial investment in the economic recovery of Detroit to $150 million by 2019. This announcement comes after the original $100 million, five-year investment turned out to be two years ahead of schedule. Pretty impressive for a place once known as the largest US city to ever declare of bankruptcy. “Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase, in a press release. “This collaboration allowed us to speed up our investment and extend our commitment over the next two years. Going forward, I hope business, government and nonprofit leaders will see Detroit’s comeback as a shining example of how to put aside differences and work to find meaningful and innovative solutions to our most pressing economic problems.” The goal of this investment is to build upon the city’s progress, create livable, inclusive, and sustainable neighborhoods, arm residents with the skills needed for high-quality, well-paying careers, and provide small businesses with the capital they need to succeed. JPMorgan Chase has invested $107 million in loans and grants in Detroit’s economic recovery, including $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small business expansion, and $6.9 million in additional transformative investments. “JPMorgan Chase has been a true partner in our work to restore economic growth and opportunity in Detroit,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. “The firm’s investments have enabled thousands of Detroiters to receive training, created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and revitalized neighborhoods. There is more work to do, and I hope our continued partnership will build a thriving economy for all Detroiters.” Economic challenges are no stranger to Detroit. But this investment, along with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Motor City, is another step in the right direction. It will utilize everything in Chase’s arsenal to strengthen underlying organizations and create system-wide changes that will improve citywide workforce development strategy. Before you know it, this Michigan city will be the thriving economy we all know and love.

Speaking to journalists on Monday, François Villeroy de Galhau, who is also a governing council member of the European Central Bank, said: “We are having discrete but numerous and serious contacts” with banks in the UK about relocations. He said that “Paris has every chance” of attracting banks. Read more JPMorgan confirms hundreds of UK jobs to move to EU because of Brexit Earlier this month, JPMorgan said it would move hundreds of London jobs to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg in preparation for Brexit. Daniel Pinto, the firm’s head of investment banking, said at the time that JPMorgan cannot afford to wait for confirmation on how the industry will be regulated after the UK leaves the EU. The sector is crucial to the UK economy and contributed about £71bn to the Exchequer last year, according to professional services firm PwC. Many banks have indicated that they will be forced to move at least some staff and are making contingency plans for a number of potential Brexit outcomes.

Goldman Sachs’ Europe chief executive, Richard Gnodde, confirmed in March that the bank would relocate hundreds of staff out of London before any Brexit deal is struck and said it had already begun implementing those plans. Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, said in January that about 1,000 of the bank’s 5,000 jobs in London could be at risk.

Everything from star traders to fast computers to unique analysis can give a big hedge fund an advantage over competitors. The latest battleground is data. Investors are vying for new data sets that their competitors don't have, or haven't thought of using. These can range from the basic credit-card sales information to satellite data that tracks shipping routes, and parsing this kind of data for trading signals has been called "the future of investing." The industry providing this to the funds has sprung up amid an explosion in obtainable data over the past decade. The bad news for the regular investor: the cost of data, and the complexity associated with turning it into investment insights, means it will probably only be available to the biggest and most sophisticated funds.  At JPMorgan's macro quantitative and derivatives conference on May 19, the bank surveyed 237 investors, and asked them about Big Data and Machine Learning. It found that 70% thought that the importance of these tools will gradually grow for all investors. A further 23% said they expected a revolution, with rapid changes to the investment landscape.  Screen Shot 2017 05 26 at 11.23.36 AMMore (JPMorgan) "There was widespread agreement that Big Data and Machine Learning is transforming the investment landscape across different trading frequencies, with more than 80% of participants expecting a reduction in relevance of traditional data sources," JPMorgan said in a note.  To be specific, 52% of investors felt big data was already rendering traditional data sources (like financial statements and economic releases) ineffective. In other words, the quarterly reports that many regular investors rely on are already becoming less relevant.  Screen Shot 2017 05 26 at 12.43.42 PMMore (JPMorgan) The rise of so-called alternative data has created a cottage industry of firms that source, process and consult on various data sources. The market for this data is expected to double in the next five years in the US, from $200 million today to $400 million, according to a recent TABB Group report. More than half (51%) of investors surveyed said they expected to buy semi-processed data, while 29% said they wanted to fully process in-house by consuming raw data.  Respondents to the survey were particularly interested in credit card and transactional data. Investors are able to use anonymous data gleaned from credit card statements, and the rise of online shopping, and the digital receipts we get in our email, is also a boon. That's because emailed receipts are usually itemized, giving investors greater detail into what people are buying. Screen Shot 2017 05 26 at 12.43.54 PMMore (JPMorgan) The biggest impediment? Cost. While a lack of expertise and management buy-in were cited by respondents as challenges, the most frequently cited impediment was high-fixed costs. That finding is striking, given JPMorgan's event attracted big money investors like BlackRock and AQR, with sizeable budgets to spend on the data, expertise and processing power. If they find it expensive, the regular investor has no chance.  NOW WATCH: Crocs has a new comeback plan — here's why it could actually work More From Business Insider Wall Street's workforce is slowly and relentlessly shrinking A definitive breakdown of the gloomy state on Wall Street A consumer-protection rule that had been delayed by Trump is set to go through Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

Sun-Sentinel A stranded traveler checks flight information May 9 at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport, where Spirit had canceled flights due to a labor dispute. Repeated cancellations by Spirit led to a melee among travelers this month. JOE CAVARETTA (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) Sun-Sentinel Business May 29, 2017 9:55 PM Discomfort in the air? It starts on Wall Street By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When an unlucky passenger was violently dragged off a full United Airlines flight in Chicago in April, setting off a public-relations nightmare for the company, the blame naturally fell on the cabin crew, police and eventually airline executives. But ultimately, the episode was set in motion elsewhere – on Wall Street. Relentless pressure on corporate America is creating an increasingly Dickensian experience for many consumers as companies focus on maximizing profit. And nowhere is the trend as stark as in the airline industry, whose service is delivered in an aluminum tube packed with up to four different classes, cheek by jowl, 35,000 feet in the air. “There’s always been pressure from Wall Street,” said Robert L. Dilenschneider, a veteran public relations executive who advises companies and chief executives on strategic communications. “But I’ve been watching this for 30 years, and it’s never been as intense as it is today.” Rich bonus packages for top executives are now largely tied to short-term income targets and fatter profit margins instead of customer service. Of course, bolstering profits – and in turn, stock prices – has always been a big part of management’s responsibility to shareholders, but making it virtually the only criterion for executive pay is new. Five years ago, American Airlines factored in on-time arrivals, lost baggage and consumer complaints to help calculate annual incentive payments for top management. Today, these bonuses are based exclusively on the company’s pretax income and cost savings. United has also scaled back bonuses linked to reliability and customer satisfaction for senior executives in recent years. But in the wake of what happened in April, bonuses “will be made more comprehensively subject to progress in 2017 on significant improvement in the customer experience,” the company said in a financial filing. “Fifteen years ago, airlines competed with each other over who could buy the most planes or have the most routes,” said Jamie Baker, a top airline industry analyst at JPMorgan Chase. “Executives are just as competitive today, but it’s about who can achieve an investment-grade rating first, who can be a component in the S&P 500, and who has better returns for investors.” These new incentives also partly explain why airlines are packing seats more densely and squeezing more passengers into the back of the plane. “Densification is driven by the desire to sweat the assets and generate revenues without having to commit capital to building new planes,” Baker said. Such a shift isn’t unique to the airline industry. “As in other industries, like manufacturing or consumer goods, the focus is on more traditional financial metrics like pretax income, margins, return on capital and total shareholder return,” said Andrew Goldstein, head of the executive compensation practice in North America for Willis Towers Watson. “Airlines haven’t abandoned operational and customer-service metrics, but they are putting less emphasis on those factors.” With the economy growing at a rate of only 2 percent while the stock market rallies on promises of soaring earnings, something must give so profit margins can grow. In the case of United or Spirit Airlines, whose repeated cancellations led to a melee among travelers this month at a terminal in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, it was customer service. At other companies, like Ford and Alcoa, it was the head of the chief executive that was served up when profits failed to meet expectations. Mature industries – where double-digit annual profit growth is a reach in the best of times – are especially vulnerable to activist investors’ demands for board seats, bigger stock repurchases and other short-term financial rewards. The pressure is especially brutal in the airline industry because the key expense, fuel, is for the most part beyond management control. Yet airline executives have largely convinced Wall Street that the bad old days of bankruptcies and fare wars are over, replaced by the kind of predictable annual profits more common among industrial companies. That’s among the reasons fees have popped up in recent years for everything from checking bags to securing an assigned seat before boarding. Known on Wall Street as ancillary revenue, this stream of income is especially favored by investors because it doesn’t swing sharply the way fares do. And so far, despite occasional bouts of air rage and frequent consumer complaints, Wall Street has been getting what it wants. United’s stock has surged to more than $80 per share from $25 per share five years ago, with profit margins rising to 13.6 percent from 3.7 percent over the same period. Overall industry margins hit 16.3 percent, up from 5.2 percent in 2012. Spirit’s operating margins are among the highest in the industry, topping 20 percent in 2015 and 2016. But Paul Berry, a company spokesman, said Spirit had pivoted to focus more on customer service in the last year, even as some larger rivals keep cutting costs to compete. Despite rewarding top executives strictly according to financial targets, American said it, too, was committed to improving the passenger experience. “Every single person at American knows we succeed or fail based on how well we serve customers,” said Joshua Freed, a company spokesman. “We will only meet those financial goals if we keep our customers happy.” Still, the promise of steady profit growth has prompted even Warren E. Buffett to take a fresh look at airline stocks. He once famously called the industry a money-losing “death trap,” but reversed course late last year, with his company, Berkshire Hathaway, acquiring stakes in several airlines. “In the past, airline stocks were seen as hazardous to one’s wealth,” said Baker, the JPMorgan analyst. “They were trading vehicles, and potential destroyers of capital.” To be sure, some industry veterans insist it is a mistake to simply blame investors or hedge-fund managers for fostering a race to the bottom in customer service. “The response isn’t to Wall Street. It’s to customer behavior,” said Alex Dichter, a senior partner at McKinsey who works with major airlines. “About 35 percent of customers are choosing on price, and price alone, and another 35 percent choose mostly on price.” Dichter noted that when American added 2-4 inches of legroom in coach in the early 2000s, “as far as I know, the airline didn’t see one bit of improvement in market share or pricing.” “The great irony is that most CEOs would love to compete on product and experience,” he added. “It’s much more fun. The problem is that customers aren’t paying attention to that.” LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 7 days ago Growing Fresca Mexican Foods to expand with Caldwell plant 0:35 7 days ago Growing Fresca Mexican Foods to expand with Caldwell plant 2:37 10 days ago 'I didn't want to ever have to report bad news to somebody's family' 1:29 10 days ago Construction workers lack safety gear while building Boise townhomes View More Video Business Czech court to open hearing on Russian hacker extradition Maine's capital endeavors to create public art for city French president flexes diplomatic muscles in Putin meeting Portland mayor aims to nix free-speech rally, fears 'hatred' 2017 looks to be a record sweet cherry crop Business Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-Edition (Digital Replica) Home Delivery Vacation Hold Newsletters Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store Archive Search Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Instagram Advertising Information Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping Place an Obituary Today's Circulars More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Senior management of SABB and Alawwal held talks with advisers on Sunday to discuss the principle of the merger and time frame for its completion, one of the sources said. SABB has selected another, undisclosed adviser for the transaction, the sources added. Nobody was available to comment at Alawwal, while SABB and JPMorgan declined to comment. SABB and Alawwal said on April 25 they had agreed to start talks on a merger that could create the kingdom’s third biggest bank with assets of nearly $80 billion. British banks are the biggest shareholders in both lenders. RBS acquired a 40 per cent stake in Alawwal when it bought ABN AMRO in 2007. RBS has been trying sell the stake for a number of years as it retreats from international operations. HSBC Holdings owns 40 per cent of SABB, which is the kingdom’s sixth largest bank by assets. Although the time frame for the merger has yet to be agreed, one of the sources said the accounts of the two banks could be consolidated by the end of 2017, but the merger would take longer.

Senior management of SABB and Alawwal held talks with advisers on Sunday to discuss the principle of the merger and timeframe for its completion, one of the sources said. SABB has selected another, undisclosed adviser for the transaction, the sources added. Nobody was available to comment at Alawwal, while SABB and JPMorgan declined to comment. SABB and Alawwal said on April 25 they had agreed to start talks on a merger that could create the kingdom's third biggest bank with assets of nearly $80 billion. British banks are the biggest shareholders in both lenders. RBS acquired a 40 per cent stake in Alawwal when it bought ABN Amro in 2007. RBS has been trying sell the stake for a number of years as it retreats from international operations. HSBC Holdings owns 40 per cent of SABB, which is the kingdom's sixth largest bank by assets. Although the timeframe for the merger has yet to be agreed, one of the sources said the accounts of the two banks could be consolidated by the end of 2017, but the merger would take longer. Mergers and acquisitions are relatively rare in Saudi Arabia's banking sector, where 12 local commercial lenders operate. Reuters reported in March, quoting sources, that French bank Credit Agricole had picked JPMorgan to advise it on a potential sale of its 31 per cent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi, valued at nearly $2.4 billion. < Previous PageNext Page > STAY UPDATED Subscribe to our newsletter and be the first to know all the latest news Sign Up More in Business Saudi foreign assets fell in April amid heavy overseas borrowing Oman shares decline on listless trading Meethaq Sukuk issue closes in 3 days, gets strong response Gallery Recommended for you Oil slips as more US drilling outweighs Opec-led cuts Oman’s first large-scale wind farm to start operations in 2020 PREVIOUS ARTICLE Bullish trend continues NEXT ARTICLE Saudi to impose tobacco, sugary drinks tax on June 10 Oman #OmanPride Ramadan World Sports Opinion Business Technology Lifestyle Entertainment Advertising RSS Feeds Subscription TOO Apps Classifieds E Paper About us Blog Jobs Contact us Request a Quote Copyright © 2017 Muscat Media Group.

Advertisement Home Equities Article financial services Saudi's Alawwal Bank picks JPMorgan to advise on merger -sources 29 May, 2017 Workers are reflected in the windows of the Canary Wharf offices of JP Morgan in London September 19, 2013. REUTERS/Neil Hall By Tom Arnold and Saeed Azhar DUBAI, May 29 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian lender Alawwal Bank, 40 percent owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, has picked JPMorgan to advise it on a proposed merger with Saudi British Bank (SABB), sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. Senior management of SABB and Alawwal held talks with advisers on Sunday to discuss the principle of the merger and timeframe for its completion, one of the sources said. SABB has selected another, undisclosed adviser for the transaction, the sources added. Nobody was available to comment at Alawwal, while SABB and JPMorgan declined to comment. SABB and Alawwal said on April 25 they had agreed to start talks on a merger that could create the kingdom's third biggest bank with assets of nearly $80 billion. Advertisement British banks are the biggest shareholders in both lenders. RBS acquired a 40 percent stake in Alawwal when it bought ABN AMRO in 2007. RBS has been trying sell the stake for a number of years as it retreats from international operations. HSBC Holdings owns 40 percent of SABB, which is the kingdom's sixth largest bank by assets. Although the timeframe for the merger has yet to be agreed, one of the sources said the accounts of the two banks could be consolidated by the end of 2017, but the merger would take longer. Mergers and acquisitions are relatively rare in Saudi Arabia's banking sector, where 12 local commercial lenders operate. Reuters reported in March, quoting sources, that French bank Credit Agricole had picked JPMorgan to advise it on a potential sale of its 31 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi , valued at nearly $2.4 billion.

But his view that not all is well on the ASX is not. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link In April average cash holdings overtook consumer discretionary stocks as the largest active position held by fund managers across any ASX sector. Photo: AFR While none have so far followed his lead in publicly quitting the market, many in Australia's professional investment community appear to be quietly preparing for a downturn.  According to the JPMorgan Fund Manager Radar, which assesses the public disclosures of major fund managers to deduce common themes, average cash holdings surged to 370 basis points in April, overtaking consumer discretionary stocks as the largest active position held by fund managers across any ASX sector. This follows several months of increasing cash allocations. "We do see the appeal [of cash] in a market where opportunities look increasingly constrained due to extended valuations (healthcare, industrials), structural concerns (banks, resources, retail) and style/franking limitations (REITS)," wrote JPMorgan equity strategist Jason Steed, adding he believed cash allocations could rise further. Advertisement Mr Parker, a 30-year veteran of funds management, said he was cashing out and returning "hundreds of millions" in client money because he believed the overheated east-coast property market, a Chinese debt bubble and overvalued equity markets would combine to spell "calamity" for Australian equity investors. "We think that there is too much risk in this market at the moment, we think it's crazy," he said. "Giving up management and performance fees and handing back cash from investments managed by us is a seminal decision, however, preserving clients' assets is what all fund managers should always put before their own interests." Veteran fund manager Geoff Wilson, of Wilson's Asset Management, didn't quibble with Mr Parker's assessment that the market was heading for some kind of downturn.  On the ASX – which has suffered a bad month, with the S&P/ASX 200 down more than 4 per cent and the big four banks on track for the worst May in 44 years – Wilson said: "It's going to be a tough period. And that's with the backdrop of the biggest global market in the very mature stages of a bull market," he added, referring to Wall Street's record-breaking run. Bennelong Australian Equity Partners' investment director Julian Beaumont was more sanguine, saying while the increasing allocation to cash holdings shows concern is building among fund managers, the level of systemic risk is being overstated. "The risks aren't that bad," he said. "We've always had these risks. [Mr Parker] talks to getting out of equities from the point of view that property looks over-bought. But what's the real relevance of that? A company like Woolworths, or CSL, or Telstra, isn't reliant on the property market. You should still be able to find opportunities. "Since the GFC, the worse the economy has looked, the more quantitative easing was required, the more the market has gone up ... it's not always the case that stockmarket returns will correlate with the economic picture. "We do believe there are some real risks in a large part of the economy, and we're positioning to avoid them." Defensive stance But both fund managers, assessments of risk aside, believed a falling market was no reason to give up on making returns for their investors.  BAEP is favouring sectors that are growing defensively, such as healthcare or everyday consumer products, plus Australian companies whose products are doing well overseas.  As for May's underperformance, "it's the top end that's really suffered", Mr Beaumont said, with the ASX 20 by far the worst performer. "We're certainly not throwing our hands up. We're actually finding some good opportunities. In fact, valuations look quite attractive in certain parts of the market, especially outside the large caps." Mr Wilson, whose main large-cap equity fund is holding 30 per cent cash, believed even if things did worsen as drastically as Mr Parker expected, any downturn would provide an "exciting" opportunity to make some serious money. "People deciding to get their money back, well, that's their choice. But as a professional fund manager, everyone at Wilson spends all day trying to make money. That's the case in cheap markets and in expensive markets."  Mr Wilson added it was his belief that times when equities looked stretched were the best for fund managers to raise money. That's because a crash, when it comes, offers fantastic opportunities to buy companies trading at steep discounts. "Significant market adjustments – whether it's the 1987 crash, the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 or the global financial crisis – they create phenomenal opportunities for astute investors. "Those three events were to me once-in-a-lifetime events where we could buy companies at, say, 50 per cent discounts to their cash backing." Anyway, he added, if you're going to sell out, knowing when to do so is a fraught business. "The thing is, you can never pick the top or the bottom of the market," he said, before wryly noting the market's tendency to confound expectations. "The fact that everyone's negative means it'll probably keep going up in the short term." Advertisement HuffPost Australia Labor, Unions Slam George Christensen's ...

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 30 May 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Peer-to-peer payment apps grow – no cash, no check by marco santana Paying a landlord rent, splitting a dinner check with friends and buying concert tickets with a group have all become easier: Open the app, ask your friend's username, and a few taps on the screen will instantly send them money. — AFP Relaxnews Devin Meineke considers himself lucky if he has US$10 (RM43) cash in his pockets at any given time. So it's a good thing he has a cellphone.  Peer-to-peer payment apps that allow easy money transfers are growing in popularity.  A growing number of people – particularly millennials – are using peer-to-peer mobile-payment apps including Cash, Square and Venmo.  "This is really about convenience," said Meineke, a 23-year-old tax accountant in Orlando. "People my age don't really have cash anymore."  Paying a landlord rent, splitting a dinner check with friends and buying concert tickets with a group have all become easier: Open the app, ask your friend's username, and a few taps on the screen will instantly send them money.  A Bank of America study released this month shows that 62% of consumers 18 to 34 years old use peer-to-peer, or P2P, apps regularly. That rate outpaces the general public's rate of 36% for adopting P2P payments.  "There was decent penetration, up and down," said Bernard Hampton, head of consumer banking for Bank of America's Southeast division. "But clearly, as you think of the younger generation's interest, the momentum will only increase."  In the bank's study, nearly 50% of those who do not use P2P apps say they will likely do so in the future.  Traditional banks have reacted to the apps' success by establishing ClearXchange, a platform that lets customers of eight financial institutions – including giants JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America – send money from their account to others.  "Time continues to be important to people, and consumers continue to have access to more information," Hampton said. "When I think about their banking relationship, it's 'How do we support that and give them that access?'"  Tech might not be the only hurdle banks face with some customers, said Matt Schulz, an Austin, Texas-based analyst with CreditCards.com.  "You can't underestimate the banks' ability to be a player in this space and just how hard it will be to disrupt them," Schulz said. "But the truth is, most data you read shows that younger folks are less trusting of banks and more trusting of technology companies. That creates a challenge for them."  It's an environment that is not helped by the banking industry's slow rate of change, Schulz said.  "It's been a desire on the banks' part to step their game up here, but things can move a little bit glacially in that industry," he said.  Google, Apple and Microsoft have jumped into the mobile-wallet industry as well.  PayPal has been doing it since 2002, when it was bought by eBay – and has since bought Venmo. Last year, in a 135% jump from the previous year, Venmo handled transactions worth US$17.6bil (RM75.25bil).  Venmo handled US$6.8bil (RM29.07bil) in transactions in the first quarter of this year alone.  Venmo, which Meineke uses, offers two options. Users can establish a balance from which to withdraw money by moving money from a credit card, debit card or bank account. Or users can load their Venmo account with banking and card information so that money can be withdrawn directly as needed. Some other apps might only allow one of those options.  "We are in a time where money is more digital and [younger people] are more comfortable with their finances being digital," Venmo spokesman Josh Criscoe said. "We are also more comfortable sharing information."  Venmo has embraced the social aspect of sending money – the app allows for a note to be written to accompany the payment notification. Emojis can be included: A recent study found Venmo's most-used emoji was pizza.  "The social element makes it fun," Criscoe said. "It changes a payment into an opportunity to remember the experience."  That's one of the reasons Meineke likes to use Venmo. Though initially sceptical, he downloaded it when he owed an out-of-town friend money.  He says he now uses it at least once a week, picking up checks at a restaurant and having friends pay him back through the app.  "It has become the thing everyone is doing," he said. — The Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Watching technology reach tipping points BA must now repair damaged reputation Spotify agrees to fund to settle copyright suits Facebook quietly adds piracy devices to list of banned sale items 5 ways to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Indonesian Islamist leader named suspect in porn case Vieirinha strike saves Wolfsburg from the drop AirAsia warns of ticket scams advertisement Latest News UK looking to increase pressure on Internet firms over extremist material EU agrees to fund free WiFi for European towns with no Internet coverage Western Digital may join Japan–KKR group for Toshiba chip unit bid UK says making progress with tech companies on getting encrypted militant messages Google’s AlphaGo retires on top after humbling world No 1 Most Viewed in Tech iPhone 8 testing allegedly going badly: reports Video leak shows bezel-less 6.3in Galaxy Note 8 screen Google’s AlphaGo retires on top after humbling world No 1 Western Digital may join Japan-KKR group for Toshiba chip unit bid US decision on expanded laptop ban not imminent: Homeland Security Moto G5 Plus available for pre-order Spotify agrees to fund to settle copyright suits UK says making progress with tech companies on getting encrypted militant messages China’s slam dunk ‘sharing economy’ booms, but can it last?

Fusion vehicles sit on display at the Sutton Ford Lincoln car dealership in Matteson, Illinois, U.S., on Monday, April 3, 2017. Ward's Automotive Group released U.S. monthly total and domestic auto sales figures on April 3. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Big banks are throttling back from the $1.2tn US car loan market, fearing that consumers have taken on more debt than they can handle. Quotes in the article Citizens Financial Group Inc CFG ▲ 34.64 +0.07 +0.20% Capital One Financial Corp COF ▲ 79.79 +0.28 +0.35% Ally Financial Inc ALLY = 19.11 0.00 0.00% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▼ 52.41 -0.37 -0.70% Lenders piled into the sector in the years after the financial crisis, as low defaults and an improving economy encouraged them to focus on a market that performed relatively well as mortgages soured. Total loans across the industry rose to $1.17tn at the end of the first quarter, according to the New York Federal Reserve, up almost 70 per cent from a trough in 2010. But data released last week by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed the first sequential drop in car loans outstanding at commercial banks in at least six years. The total slipped $1.6bn to $440bn from the fourth quarter of last year to the first of this, suggesting that banks — wary of repeating the mistakes of the subprime mortgage crisis — have been spooked by rising delinquencies and the threat of litigation. One of the banks pulling back is Citizens Financial Group, the US’s ninth largest by assets. Bruce van Saun, chief executive, told the Financial Times he would rather steer resources into areas such as student loans. “We ran up auto for a while when there was not much else going on. Now we have growth in other areas which offer better risk-adjusted returns.” Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, the two biggest banks in the sector, saw first-quarter originations drop by double digits from the same period a year earlier. Even relatively aggressive specialists such as Capital One — which added a net $2bn to its $50bn car loan book over the first quarter — are toning down their outlook. “We’re certainly one more notch cautious,” said Richard Scott Blackley, chief financial officer, noting bigger-than-expected falls in used car prices in the first quarter. “We think that by pulling back a little bit, we’re going to . . . maximise price over volume,” he said. Analysts expect the car loan market to keep growing, fanned by specialist non-bank lenders which focus on borrowers with lower credit scores. But the caution of the big banks — which claim more than 30 per cent of the market — shows that many are now worrying about the consequences of looser underwriting, which has seen them stretch out terms for borrowers while pushing up loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratios, in an echo of the subprime crisis. Load Error Last last year the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency warned of rising credit risk in car loan portfolios, while airing concerns over violations of fair-lending standards. Several subprime-focused lenders have disclosed in public filings that regulators and state and federal authorities are investigating them for possible abuses. Shares in Santander Consumer USA, the subprime car loan arm of the Spanish bank, have dropped about a fifth since the beginning of March. Ally Financial, too, has fallen almost a fifth over that period, as losses on its loans bundled into securities have been higher than expected. Analysts expect losses to keep rising if used-car prices, already down about 8 per cent this year, continue to fall. Lower prices normally mean higher gross charge-offs, as customers default on loans that exceed the value of the car, and smaller recoveries for the lender forced to sell the vehicle. The consequences of an car sector meltdown are unlikely to be as severe as in mortgages, a market about eight times bigger, but “there will be fallout”, said Joseph Cioffi, chair of the insolvency and creditors’ rights practice at Davis & Gilbert, a law firm. “Just because something doesn’t kill you, doesn’t mean it’s good for you.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Popular, with a balance sheet still groaning under the weight of toxic property assets, is a throwback to the boom-to-bust cycle that forced Spain to seek a bailout for its banking industry in 2012. A potential sale of Popular would hand its competitors the chance to buy a bank with a strong franchise in lending to small and medium-sized businesses. It also would allow the government to claim that Spain’s banking clean-up is finally complete. 1. Why is Popular so unpopular? Short answer: real estate. Popular’s woes stem from the loans it made in the years before a housing crash pitched the economy into a five-year slump starting in 2008. Founded in 1926, Popular had prided itself on efficient management that made it one of the world’s most profitable banks. That story started to sour in 2007 as confidence in Spanish real estate ebbed away; Popular’s shares began a long slide from their peak to lose 98 percent of their value. Popular shunned the chance to take state aid in 2012, when a stress test uncovered a capital shortfall. Instead, it embarked on a series of share sales that so far have raised 5.5 billion euros. Angel Ron, who had run Popular as chairman since 2004, left the bank earlier this year to make way for Emilio Saracho, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. vice-chairman charged with stemming losses and fixing its balance sheet. 2. Is a sale the likely next step? Nobody knows for sure. Saracho told shareholders in April that the bank would need to raise more capital, with another option being a corporate transaction. Popular said earlier this month that some banks had expressed interest in combining businesses and that it had asked competitors to say whether they’d be interested in buying it. The bank says no final decision has been made about a sale versus other ways to raise money. 3. Who could buy Popular? Banco Santander SA has hired Citigroup Inc. to analyse a purchase, people familiar with the plans said this month, while Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA is working with Rothschild to analyze the deal, according to newspaper Expansion. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos has said that Bankia SA, which is state-owned after being bailed out in 2012, is also looking. 4. What obstacles are there to a sale? The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Despite years of taking charges to cover real-estate losses, the lender’s attempts to mop up all the soured assets are far from complete. It still has 37 billion euros of non-performing assets, booked a 3.6 billion-euro loss in 2016 and a further 137 million euros loss in the first quarter. Any bank that buys Popular would itself have to raise a lot of capital to absorb it. Societe Generale SA said in a report that Santander would need 12.5 billion euros, BBVA 9.3 billion euros and CaixaBank SA 7.5 billion euros. At 7.33 percent, Popular’s fully-loaded CET1 ratio, a measure of solvency, is one of the weakest in Western Europe. 5. Is there any urgency? There could be. The bank said its first-quarter results, published May 5, showed only a modest 1 percent drop in customer deposits. Even so, Popular’s plight has generated plenty of headlines in the Spanish press since then, perhaps unnerving customers. The bank and its advisers may want to try to resolve its future before Spain’s long August break. A coupon payment on Popular’s riskiest bonds due in July is another focus of attention for investors. The bank has said it will make the payment as scheduled. It will cost about 30 million euros, based on Bloomberg data. 6. What’s attractive about Popular? It has about 34 billion euros of performing loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, a high-margin business based on carefully crafted personal relationships. And who doesn’t like a bank with a bit of mystery to it? Popular is well-known in Spain for having close links to the Roman Catholic organization Opus Dei. The bank itself doesn’t say much on the subject. However, when Luis Valls, a former co-chairman Popular died in 2006, the lender said he had been a member. The Reference Shelf A Bloomberg story on Banco Popular’s uncertain fate.

Let's say you live near Spalding University and want to run a few errands in the NuLu neighborhood this Saturday. Rather than driving your car and spending money on gas and parking, you can now rent a bicycle from a LouVelo station located on Breckenridge St. between Third and Fourth streets and enjoy a short ride to your destination. Your bicycle is a solid frame, three speed — decked out with fenders, a bell, puncture resistant tires, an adjustable seat, storage basket and a lock to keep your bike safe while you drop in at Revelry Gallery Boutique or grab a coffee at Please and Thank You. You've managed to run all your errands and get some fresh air — for $3.50. How? A network of nearly 30 LouVelo bicycle sharing stations are now operational and placed strategically throughout downtown Louisville, NuLu, Old Louisville and Butchertown, to make your riding dreams come true. The program — five years in the making — was officially launched during a Thursday morning press conference with Mayor Greg Fischer. Much of the delay in getting a bike sharing program to Louisville was due to trouble finding sponsors to finance the program. Fischer previously told The Courier-Journal that nine local entities will provide $10,000 to $20,000 apiece for each of the next three years — Norton Healthcare, JP Morgan Chase, UPS, Genscape, the Brown Hotel, KentuckyOne Health, Atria Senior Living, The Eye Care Institute and a group called Clay & Main. Annual operations are expected to cost the city about $50,000 a year. That is the base sum it has contracted to pay a Florida-based consultant, CycleHop, to manage the program. But what will it cost you? First, you need a credit card to rent a bicycle and participate in any of the daily, monthly or annual bike pass rental programs. Pricing is $3.50 per 30-minute trip or $15 per month for unlimited 60-minute trips. Annually, the LouVelo program cost is $10 a month with unlimited 60-minutes rides. So what's the keep people from just riding off with a bike? If a bike isn't returned in a certain amount of time, your credit card will get whacked for over $1,000. Definitely not worth it, so make sure you get that bike back to a docking station before you wander off. (A green light on the station illuminates when your bicycle has been securely returned.) The time constraints also keep the bicycles in play for everyone to enjoy. If you keep the bike longer than the allotted time allowed by your rental package, your credit card is charged $3.50 for each additional 30 minutes. Just like renting a movie from Redbox, you are under no obligation to return your bike back to the same kiosk where it was originally rented. Bikes can be picked up and returned to any of the 27 docking stations in the city. And don't worry about riding at night. There are front and back lights built into each bicycle, which are powered as you pedal. LouVelo stations will have bikes available 24/7. The bikes are equipped with passive GPS, so you can follow your routes, track your average speed and keep track of your calories burned through your account on the LouVelo website. "We're going to see more people have more options for transportation that wasn't there before," said Matthew Glaser, LouVelo general manager. Of the 305 green and black bicycles designed specifically for Louisville, five bikes are red — a tribute to Louisville's own Muhammad Ali. The story goes, that as a young boy his red bicycle was stolen and he wanted to learn to box to get that bike back. Dave Nelson, CycleHop's chief operating officer, previously told The Courier-Journal that Louisville is one of about 100 North American cities and at least 1,000 communities worldwide that have bike-sharing programs. The program will reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion, introduce a popular alternative form of transportation and promote healthy living, he said. CycleHop runs bike-sharing programs in about 15 cities, from Florida to California and Canada. In total, the Louisville program has 28 stations and 305 bicycles. One station remains in storage as a backup and 27 stations are ready for public use. To see a full list of stations, visit www.LouVelo.com. "For me, I think one of the best advantages is being able to park your car and keep it there, but still bike out for errands and lunch," Glaser said Wednesday as he removed a shipping sticker from one of the new bikes being placed in a docking station. "Bikeshare and local business seem to go hand-in-hand, so I think it fits our local culture and dedication to keeping Louisville unique." Ready to ride? Customers can purchase rides at kiosks at the 27 docking stations or online at www.LouVelo.com.

Let's say you live near Spalding University and want to run a few errands in the NuLu neighborhood this Saturday. Rather than driving your car and spending money on gas and parking, you can now rent a bicycle from a LouVelo station located on Breckenridge St. between Third and Fourth streets and enjoy a short ride to your destination. Your bicycle is a solid frame, three speed — decked out with fenders, a bell, puncture resistant tires, an adjustable seat, storage basket and a lock to keep your bike safe while you drop in at Revelry Gallery Boutique or grab a coffee at Please and Thank You. You've managed to run all your errands and get some fresh air — for $3.50. How? A network of nearly 30 LouVelo bicycle sharing stations are now operational and placed strategically throughout downtown Louisville, NuLu, Old Louisville and Butchertown, to make your riding dreams come true. The program — five years in the making — was officially launched during a Thursday morning press conference with Mayor Greg Fischer. Much of the delay in getting a bike sharing program to Louisville was due to trouble finding sponsors to finance the program. Fischer previously told The Courier-Journal that nine local entities will provide $10,000 to $20,000 apiece for each of the next three years — Norton Healthcare, JP Morgan Chase, UPS, Genscape, the Brown Hotel, KentuckyOne Health, Atria Senior Living, The Eye Care Institute and a group called Clay & Main. Annual operations are expected to cost the city about $50,000 a year. That is the base sum it has contracted to pay a Florida-based consultant, CycleHop, to manage the program. But what will it cost you? First, you need a credit card to rent a bicycle and participate in any of the daily, monthly or annual bike pass rental programs. Pricing is $3.50 per 30-minute trip or $15 per month for unlimited 60-minute trips. Annually, the LouVelo program cost is $10 a month with unlimited 60-minutes rides. So what's the keep people from just riding off with a bike? If a bike isn't returned in a certain amount of time, your credit card will get whacked for over $1,000. Definitely not worth it, so make sure you get that bike back to a docking station before you wander off. (A green light on the station illuminates when your bicycle has been securely returned.) The time constraints also keep the bicycles in play for everyone to enjoy. If you keep the bike longer than the allotted time allowed by your rental package, your credit card is charged $3.50 for each additional 30 minutes. Just like renting a movie from Redbox, you are under no obligation to return your bike back to the same kiosk where it was originally rented. Bikes can be picked up and returned to any of the 27 docking stations in the city. And don't worry about riding at night. There are front and back lights built into each bicycle, which are powered as you pedal. LouVelo stations will have bikes available 24/7. The bikes are equipped with passive GPS, so you can follow your routes, track your average speed and keep track of your calories burned through your account on the LouVelo website. "We're going to see more people have more options for transportation that wasn't there before," said Matthew Glaser, LouVelo general manager. Of the 305 green and black bicycles designed specifically for Louisville, five bikes are red — a tribute to Louisville's own Muhammad Ali. The story goes, that as a young boy his red bicycle was stolen and he wanted to learn to box to get that bike back. Dave Nelson, CycleHop's chief operating officer, previously told The Courier-Journal that Louisville is one of about 100 North American cities and at least 1,000 communities worldwide that have bike-sharing programs. The program will reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion, introduce a popular alternative form of transportation and promote healthy living, he said. CycleHop runs bike-sharing programs in about 15 cities, from Florida to California and Canada. In total, the Louisville program has 28 stations and 305 bicycles. One station remains in storage as a backup and 27 stations are ready for public use. To see a full list of stations, visit www.LouVelo.com. "For me, I think one of the best advantages is being able to park your car and keep it there, but still bike out for errands and lunch," Glaser said Wednesday as he removed a shipping sticker from one of the new bikes being placed in a docking station. "Bikeshare and local business seem to go hand-in-hand, so I think it fits our local culture and dedication to keeping Louisville unique." Ready to ride? Customers can purchase rides at kiosks at the 27 docking stations or online at www.LouVelo.com. You can also book your trip on the Transit App. Once you've paid, unlock the bike with a code or membership card and away you go.

The seller of the property is Waterton, which purchased the asset in 2012 from JP Morgan Asset Management for $61.3 million. Located on a 22.3-acre site at 15801 S. 48th St., Andante offers one-bedroom and two-bedroom units with high ceilings, high-speed internet and full-size washer/dryers. The community encompasses 32 three-story buildings. Amenities include a fitness center, clubhouse, three swimming pools and a spa. Additionally, the asset built in 1999 features full covered parking, semi-private entries, outside storage, fire sprinklers and private balcony/patios in selected units. Andante Apartments, Phoenix The community is situated in close proximity to Interstate 10 and State Route 202, the suburb’s location at the foothills of the South Mountain Park providing a convenient escape to more than 50 miles of hiking, biking and horseback riding trails. Andante offers easy access to multiple retail centers, including Lakeside Plaza, which is one mile west, as well as the Ahwatukee Foothill Towne Center. Ahwatukee is home to the largest concentration of technology jobs in Arizona, the corridor including approximately 25,000 jobs at companies such as Intel, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PayPal and Microchip. Intel recently announced the opening of a state-of-the-art semiconductor production facility at its Ocotillo Campus, which is expected to add more than 3,000 new jobs, the location being approximately 12 minutes southeast of Andante. The new owner plans to renovate the clubhouse to offer top of the market amenities. Interiors updates will include new hard surface countertops, appliances, flooring, painting, lighting fixtures and plumbing fixtures. The renovated units will still be priced materially below new construction rents. Madrona Ridge Residential, an affiliate of Security Properties, will hold the management services. Currently, Andante has an occupancy rate of 92.5 percent.  “Ahwatukee has been a target submarket for us for years. With excellent schools and demographics, plus proximity to high-paying jobs, all of the fundamentals were in place at Andante for us to implement our value-add reposition program,” said Davis Vaughn, director at Security Properties, in a prepared statement.

Bloomberg iStock Citigroup Inc. doesn’t think its richer customers will drop their high-priced money managers in favour of automated investing, but Betterment LLC is betting it can prove the big bank wrong. The robo-advisor—the largest among independent digital advice startups that popped up after the 2008 financial collapse—has overhauled its entire brand. The shift in marketing and advertising strategy is aimed at attracting more affluent customers just now becoming aware of the option. It’s also not a coincidence that Betterment’s pivot comes as more traditional players such as Vanguard Group Inc., Charles Schwab Corp., and even JPMorgan Chase & Co. are starting to use more technology when offering investment advice. In other words, the robo-advisor pie is about to expand, and Betterment wants to make sure it gets a bigger piece. “These are fundamental decisions about who we are as a company,” founder and chief executive officer Jon Stein said in an interview.  “We’re attracting a lot of affluent customers already, but I think our voice—as we speak to that person—has to show we are established,” he said. Late last year, Citigroup, which has invested in Betterment through its venture capital arm, sent clients a research report voicing scepticism about just how large assets under management could grow for robo-advisors when it comes to wealthier individuals. “Higher net-worth or more sophisticated investors will, in our view, always demand face-to-face advice,” wrote Citi analysts led by Ronit Ghose. But Betterment says that’s not the case, explaining it already has a number of customers with more than $10 million under management each. On top of its redesign, the firm is thinking about adding access to more exclusive products. “People do want access to alternatives, and that’s something we see demand for among the mass affluent,” Stein said. Betterment doesn’t disclose how many of its accounts are held by accredited investors (who would be allowed by regulators to participate in complex investments such as hedge funds, venture capital, or private equity) but said it’s well more than 25,000 of its 250,000 customers. Some on Wall Street are already moving to stake a claim. Although JPMorgan chief executive officer Jamie Dimon didn’t say last year how much money the bank has put into building its robo-advisor, he did say roughly $600 million was devoted to “emerging fintech solutions” and that technology is an extremely important part of the company’s future strategies. For Betterment, this is the second big change in 2017. Earlier this year it introduced a new fee structure and added more certified advisers, also in an attempt to draw in wealthy customers as well as younger individuals who will have major financial decisions to make in the next 5 to 10 years, such as buying a home. While affluent individuals are a big part of this new push, the firm said its mission is still to attract people spanning the financial spectrum, and that was a part of the research process that went into the redesign. “We looked at people across the range in age and income,” said Elyssa Gray, vice president in charge of brand at Betterment. “Regardless of the level of experience or the amount of money they had, there were a number of common denominators when it comes to financial services.” A big part of that was taking out financial jargon which, the firm said, irked some customers. “We heard over and over again: ‘Start talking to us like a person,’” said Sarah Kaufman, director of brand and content. “It’s really about how we are telling this story, too, not just the design.” Bloomberg Topics: Wall Street fund manager investing HNI More From Livemint READ MORE Review: Xiaomi Mi Router 3C redefines performance, but skips some features Yogi Adityanath meets L.K.

Senior management of SABB and Alawwal held talks with advisers on Sunday to discuss the principle of the merger and timeframe for its completion, one of the sources said. SABB has selected another, undisclosed adviser for the transaction, the sources added. Nobody was available to comment at Alawwal, while SABB and JPMorgan declined to comment. SABB and Alawwal said on April 25 they had agreed to start talks on a merger that could create the kingdom's third biggest bank with assets of nearly $80 billion. British banks are the biggest shareholders in both lenders. RBS acquired a 40 percent stake in Alawwal when it bought ABN AMRO in 2007. RBS has been trying sell the stake for a number of years as it retreats from international operations. HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) owns 40 percent of SABB, which is the kingdom's sixth largest bank by assets. Although the timeframe for the merger has yet to be agreed, one of the sources said the accounts of the two banks could be consolidated by the end of 2017, but the merger would take longer. Mergers and acquisitions are relatively rare in Saudi Arabia's banking sector, where 12 local commercial lenders operate. Reuters reported in March, quoting sources, that French bank Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) had picked JPMorgan to advise it on a potential sale of its 31 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi 1050.SE, valued at nearly $2.4 billion.

Moneycontrol News Tech Mahindra lost nearly 17 percent intraday on Monday as investors reacted negatively to the company’s results. The stock was at its 43-month low The IT services major posted a consolidated net profit for the March quarter at Rs 589.7 crore, a fall of 30.2 percent against Rs 845 crore quarter on quarter. A poll of analysts by CNBC-TV18 had pegged the net profit at Rs 788 crore. The company’s consolidated rupee revenue came in around a percent lower at Rs 7,495 crore against Rs 7,557.5 crore QoQ. Meanwhile, its dollar revenue came in higher by over a percent at USD 1,131.2 million against USD 1,116.1 million posted during the previous quarter. The stock has shown weak movements, falling 15 percent in the past one month, while its three-day loss was seen at 13 percent. At 09:19 hrs Tech Mahindra was quoting at Rs 364.20, down Rs 65.15, or 15.17 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week low of Rs 363.10. Brokerages too had a negative outlook on the stock. A look at what top analysts are talking about the stock. Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 410 JPMorgan said that the company’s near term outlook on margins seems uncertain and any sign of improvement in it will be evident only in second half of this fiscal. Further, it added that there is a need to see how the firm plans to address its profitability. Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Equalweight | Target: Rs 455The global investment bank believes that a margin miss in the fourth quarter is driving the sharp cut in earnings per share (EPS) estimates. In fact, a recovery in margin is likely to be only gradual. On the estimates, it feels that steep cut in estimates would be reflected in the stock price. A sharp correction in the stock may offer opportunity for long-term investors, the brokerage added. tags #Buzzing Stocks #Tech Mahindra Related news Business Buy Motherson Sumi, HDFC; sell Reliance Power: Ashwani Gujral May 30, 2017 10:02 AM Business Buy Tech Mahindra; target of Rs 490: ICICI Direct May 29, 2017 05:21 PM Business Buy Tech Mahindra; target of Rs 563: Edelweiss May 29, 2017 03:57 PM Business Precision Camshafts soars 5% as co bags Rs 550 crore order from Ford May 29, 2017 03:34 PM Business Tech Mahindra can see lower levels, says Prakash Gaba May 29, 2017 03:19 PM Business Six in Sixty: Stocks you should keep on your radar May 29, 2017 02:50 PM Business Strides Shasun falls over 4% after US FDA issues observations at B’lore plant May 29, 2017 12:33 PM Business Sustainable margins for Tech Mahindra will be 12-14%: Elara's Ravi Menon May 29, 2017 11:56 AM Business Glenmark falls 3% on sectoral weakness, ANDA nod to drug fails to impress investors May 29, 2017 10:30 AM News Most Popular Top News Early rains to shower hope for Sensex; top 10 stocks to chase this monsoon Tata Motors cuts up to 1,500 managerial jobs Mid & smallcap stocks crack; 10 stocks which can give up to 50% return This smallcap could pump more profits as it now starts to leverage its assets Top 5 stocks which could turn out to be multibaggers in the next 2-3 years More than 100 stocks have slipped up to 30% from record highs hit in April Market Live: Nifty holds 9600 amid consolidation; NTPC soars 4%, BHEL tanks 10% As monsoon hits Kerala, here's why we keep calm and pray for rain every year see more Video of the day Don't expect major changes in P-Notes participation from investors: Ambit Capital Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Game Changers Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch PowerYourTrade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info feedback@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | FAQs | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

The vice chairman at one of India’s largest technology services companies warned that U.S. President Donald Trump’s visa policies will damage the industry as his company reported weak earnings and his stock fell the most in almost two years. Tech Mahindra Ltd. said net income was 5.9 billion rupees ($91 million) in the fourth quarter, compared with the average analyst estimate of 7.8 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares fell as much as 17 percent and traded 12 percent lower at 1:18 p.m. local time, the largest intraday decline since May 2015. The U.S. is tightening the criteria for visa programs that Tech Mahindra and other outsourcing companies use to bring skilled foreign workers into the country. Trump and other politicians have criticized the programs for hurting American workers and allowing companies to use cheaper employees from abroad. “Trump’s America First agenda and focus on curbing the immigration, especially around H-1B visa policies, will hurt the IT sector,” Vice Chairman Vineet Nayyar said on a conference call. “The norms propose a radical shift in policies related to visa quotas and allotment, thereby, leading to a tougher application procedure and higher cost of Indian IT companies looking to bring talent to the United States.” Trump, Tech Clash Over Visas for Skilled Immigrants: QuickTake Several analysts cut their ratings and price targets for Tech Mahindra after it reported results, including those at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley. Vibhor Singhal of Phillip Securities Pte reduced shares to a sell rating and slashed the price target to 380 rupees. Tech services companies, including Cognizant Technology Solutions, have been cutting positions in India. Some workers have blamed Trump for prompting the job losses and exacerbating problems in the industry. Workers have begun debating whether to form the first industrywide IT union. Trade unions are common in India in manufacturing and transportation, but they never had much success in information technology because pay and benefits had historically been good. “These are unsettling times in both in – on politics and economics of both Europe and U.S.,” said Nayyar. “However, the demand for technological services continues unabated. We do believe that as always, given our resilience, we will be able to see through – see our way through this current fog.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: Donald TrumpTech Mahindra Ltd.

Jadhav giving crucial intel: Pak (Bloomberg) -- The vice chairman at one of India’s largest technology services companies warned that U.S. President Donald Trump’s visa policies will damage the industry as his company reported weak earnings and his stock fell the most in almost two years. Tech Mahindra Ltd. said net income was 5.9 billion rupees ($91 million) in the fourth quarter, compared with the average analyst estimate of 7.8 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares fell as much as 17 percent and traded 12 percent lower at 1:18 p.m. local time, the largest intraday decline since May 2015. Complete coverage on India's IT crisis The U.S. is tightening the criteria for visa programs that Tech Mahindra and other outsourcing companies use to bring skilled foreign workers into the country. Trump and other politicians have criticized the programs for hurting American workers and allowing companies to use cheaper employees from abroad. Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO (Video provided by Times of India) “Trump’s America First agenda and focus on curbing the immigration, especially around H-1B visa policies, will hurt the IT sector,” Vice Chairman Vineet Nayyar said on a conference call. “The norms propose a radical shift in policies related to visa quotas and allotment, thereby, leading to a tougher application procedure and higher cost of Indian IT companies looking to bring talent to the United States.” ALSO ON MSN: The world’s fastest-growing and shrinking economies will surprise you The world’s fastest-growing and shrinking economies will surprise you (Slideshow provided by Lovemoney) Several analysts cut their ratings and price targets for Tech Mahindra after it reported results, including those at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley. Vibhor Singhal of Phillip Securities Pte reduced shares to a sell rating and slashed the price target to 380 rupees. Tech services companies, including Cognizant Technology Solutions, have been cutting positions in India. Some workers have blamed Trump for prompting the job losses and exacerbating problems in the industry. Workers have begun debating whether to form the first industrywide IT union. Trade unions are common in India in manufacturing and transportation, but they never had much success in information technology because pay and benefits had historically been good.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was denounced by the head of Venezuela’s legislature over a report that the bank bought $2.8 billion of bonds from that country, potentially helping President Nicolas Maduro’s administration amid accusations of human-rights violations. The investment bank’s asset management arm paid about $865 million, or 31 cents on the dollar, for bonds issued in 2014 by state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing five unidentified people familiar with last week’s transaction. A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment. Spokesmen for the central bank, which had held the notes, didn’t respond to messages. “It is apparent Goldman Sachs decided to make a quick buck off the suffering of the Venezuelan people,” Julio Borges, the opposition lawmaker who heads the National Assembly, wrote in a letter to Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and seen by Bloomberg. Congress will investigate the deal, he said. “I also intend to recommend to any future democratic government of Venezuela not to recognize or pay on these bonds.” Venezuela’s opposition has been urging Wall Street banks not to throw a financial lifeline to Maduro, who’s faced almost two months of public protests while cutting imports of food and medicine to conserve cash and continue bond payments. The nation’s dollar shortage, exacerbated by a collapse in oil prices, has left investors trying to gauge the likelihood that the government can keep servicing its debt. Last month, lawmakers reached out to big Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, asking them not to help the country monetize its $7.7 billion in gold reserves. In an editorial on Friday, Harvard University economist Ricardo Hausmann -- a former planning minister in Venezuela and long-time critic of the current government -- called on JPMorgan Chase & Co. to remove Venezuela from its bond indexes so investors tracking the gauges aren’t compelled to buy those notes. In his letter, Borges said Goldman Sachs’s deal violates the bank’s own code of conduct and its statement on human rights. A copy of that statement on the firm’s website said its respect for human rights is “fundamental to and informs our business,” and that the firm places a “high priority” on identifying potential issues when deciding whether to do business with a client. Goldman didn’t negotiate the bond purchase with Venezuela’s government, the Journal said, citing three of the people. The asset management division instead bought the debt through an unnamed broker, the newspaper said. Still, Borges said, the transaction helps Maduro. It’s “a financial lifeline to his authoritarian regime that is systematically violating the human rights of Venezuelans,” the lawmaker wrote in his letter to Blankfein. The “irregular nature” and “absurd financial terms involved” are “to the detriment of Venezuela and its people,” Borges said. Fintech Advisory Inc., a New York-based investment fund, previously agreed to buy $1.3 billion of PDVSA bonds in a repo transaction providing at least $300 million of cash, Reuters reported in early April. Goldman Sachs was the seventh-largest holder of PDVSA bonds as of March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Venezuela’s international reserves rebounded from near the lowest since 2002 last week, gaining more than $700 million to $10.86 billion as of May 25. © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

But now that entrepreneurs are taking up the mantle, the city is beginning to reemerge as a potential powerhouse for innovation. But it starts with bridging the digital gap for small businesses, which is exactly what Hajj Flemings’ project Rebrand Detroit is trying to do. .@ConorCawley with @HajjFlemings, founder of @BrandCampU, speaking about the work @rebranddetroit is committed to do in the city. #DETSW17 pic.twitter.com/TJRVfKPr8i — Chase for Business (@ChaseforBiz) May 22, 2017 LinkedIn: Not Sure for Job Seekers Once you have a job, there’s no point in using LinkedIn, right?

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 30 May 2017 Short just gets worse for Evergrande bears HONG KONG: China Evergrande Group’s astonishing share rally has resulted in the world’s most painful short trade this year. To add insult to injury, bearish investors are paying higher fees to get crushed. Fees to borrow shares of the Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer for shorting have surged by more than five times since January to about 10% and have doubled since Evergrande started buying back shares in late March, according to Simon Colvin, a London-based analyst at IHS Markit Ltd. Evergrande shares available for lending have “nearly all been spoken for,” Colvin wrote in an email, resulting in higher borrowing costs. Evergrande shares have more than tripled this year, hurting short-sellers and baffling even some of the most bullish stock analysts. Part of the sharp rally can be explained by Evergrande’s plan to raise money from strategic investors ahead of a planned backdoor listing on the mainland and speculation that the developer will benefit from rising home sales in smaller Chinese cities. A buy-back spree has also propelled a 123% jump since late March -- when short interest started climbing from a low point. “I wouldn’t recommend investors to short Evergrande because of the strong momentum. It’s too risky,” Raymond Cheng, Hong Kong-based analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd, said by phone. “The momentum will remain strong until the backdoor listing is completed and after that there might be some share price correction.” Evergrande soared as much as 27% to an all-time high yesterday, while peers such as Country Garden Holdings Co and Sunac China Holdings Ltd advanced more than 10%. The acceleration in gains is raising questions, with JPMorgan Chase & Co saying in a note received on Friday that Evergrande’s business model isn’t sustainable. The pressures on short-sellers are mounting as investors are covering their bearish positions, said Citigroup Inc analyst Oscar Choi, which could be contributing to higher demand for Evergrande shares. In a typical short sale, investors borrow shares and sell them with the expectation that the price will decline. In a successful trade, the investors later buy the shares back at a lower price to return to the lender, or cover the short, so they can pocket the difference. After yesterday’s rally, Evergrande’s share price increase is the biggest among major short targets worldwide, which include companies with a market value of at least US$1bil and short interest tracked by Markit of at least 10%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The only other wager that has inflicted pain of a similar magnitude is a bearish trade on Applied Optoelectronics Inc, whose shares advanced 205 % this year, the data show. Evergrande trades at a record 36 times reported earnings, more than double the valuations of Country Garden and Sunac, while Monday’s gain alone added US$5.3bil to its market value. Bearish bets accounted for 20.7% of its free float on May 25, according to IHS Market data, while its share price is 118% higher than consensus analyst estimates for the next 12 months. Some analysts are still optimistic. Morgan Stanley analyst John Lam, one of the most bullish analysts on Evergrande with an overweight rating on the shares, has a street high price target of HK$12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lam cited moves by Evergrande’s management to raise its second-round strategic investment target to 30 billion yuan from 15 billion yuan. Lam expects Evergrande to lower its net gearing to 237% by the end of this year, from 432% at the end of 2016, according to a May 23 note. Evergrande’s six-month financial results, which will be released in August, is another potential catalyst for the share price, according to Morgan Stanley.— Bloomberg   Tags / Keywords: Evergrande , shares , fees , investors Related Stories Related Stories AirAsia shares tumble S&P says Noble Group’s debt-load is unsustainable World’s most indebted developer battles short-sellers again Vietnam bank aims to fetch US$700mil Anzo shares plummet after tie-up announcement You May Be Interested QL Resources core net income forecast to dip by 5% in FY18-20 GentingM, CIMB, Maybank push KLCI into the red Breakfast briefing: Tuesday, May 30 (Update) Shortage of parts hampers BMW production in China, South Africa 5 ways to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Emkay-NPNG win Super Division title US decision on expanded laptop ban not imminent: Homeland Security South Korea's Jeju Air says China approves flights in sign of easing tension Property Related advertisement Latest News Barakah Offshore posts Q1 pre-tax loss of RM3.15m Celcom sets aside RM1.5b as capex to expand network EPF says Q1 investment income up 74% to RM11.8b Mclean seeks RM1.26m from Decor after profit shortfall TRC to tender for MRT, LRT projects this year Most Viewed in Business Singapore’s MAS completes 2yr review of banks in 1MDB deals GentingM, CIMB, Maybank push KLCI into the red Geely's tie-up will free Proton from perpetual govt subsidy, says MP TRC to tender for MRT, LRT projects this year Greece, Italy tensions hit euro, Asian stocks, lift yen, gold Supermax posts Q3 earnings of nearly RM20m Sunway posts RM108m profit EPF says Q1 investment income up 74% to RM11.8b Bank Negara kicks off fintech sandbox AirAsia warns of free ticket scam advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

They will do so with soldiers patrolling outside Parliament in London, authorities warning that another attack is imminent and Prime Minister Theresa May cutting short her participation in the Group of Seven meeting in Sicily. With exactly two weeks to go until the June 8 election, it’s likely to be a different style of campaign. Attention will also soon be forced back toward the Brexit negotiations, now less than a month away. The good news? Bloomberg’s Ian Wishart sees signs of compromise emerging even after the harsh rhetoric of recent weeks. Some EU officials share that optimism. There are indications of flexibility from the EU over the bill it wants the UK to pay. Meanwhile, the British are implying a willingness to give ground on the financial settlement as well as on immigration and the power of EU judges. The question is whether enough common ground can be found. “Both sides will have to make some compromises – but we shouldn’t fool ourselves into thinking that it won’t mainly have to be the UK,” said Agata Gostynska-Jakubowska, research fellow at the Centre for European Reform in London. Security warning One area where there will need to be cooperation, especially after this week’s attack, is security, according to the official charged with overseeing Brexit for the Czech Republic. “Perhaps this is one of the events, no matter how tragic it is, that shows that Brexit is an unfortunate thing,” Jan Kral, acting secretary of state for EU affairs, said in an interview in Prague. “I’m convinced if not by goodwill then by necessity we will be forced to cooperate even more closely.” Failure to agree on security ties by the time of Brexit would risk the UK spinning out of Europol, which helps police fight crime across borders, and the European Arrest Warrant system, under which EU members transfer people sought by another.

Reliance on London The European Central Bank is pushing back against the idea that euro-area companies need the City of London to survive Brexit intact. In a new report, the central bank estimated that UK-domiciled banks supply just 1 per cent to 2 per cent of the euro-area private sector’s external financing. Launching the report, ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said Brexit won’t “harm significantly” the euro area’s economic expansion and would prove “much less meaningful” than for the UK Bloomberg’s Brexit Barometer suggests the British have a reason to worry, with the indicator of economics health staying in “windy” territory for the first time since November. No deal not credible A collapse in the Brexit talks would be much more damaging for the UK economy than British officials suggest when they claim “no deal is better than a bad deal,” according to JPMorgan Chase economist Malcolm Barr. “The key to this is to understand that UK-based activity has adapted to the framework for trade facilitation that the EU has provided, and that the sudden removal of that framework without provision of a functioning replacement would be enormously disruptive to activity in the short run,” Barr told clients in a report this week. How big the shock would be to output is hard to estimate, he said. He noted a 2014 analysis that estimated a 20-day closure of West coast ports in the U.S. would cut 0.3 per cent off gross domestic product. “The impact of Brexit without an agreement would be orders of magnitude larger than these estimates,” Barr said, prompting him to question the credibility of the threat to walk away from the negotiations. Brexit round-up Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary says the UK could be locked out of EU air travel for six months without a deal   If May meets her goal of reducing immigration to the tens of thousands it could shrink the economy by as much as 3 per cent, the Centre for Economics and Business Research says The price of wine could rise by about a quarter after Brexit, according to the UK Trade Policy Observatory  The Lawyers for Britain group say they have “failed to find a credible legal argument” for a Brexit bill Britons are still hitting the shops but there is no guarantee they will keep doing so, writes Bloomberg Gadfly’s Andrea Felsted On the markets Currency traders see the pound emerging unscathed from the upcoming election even if May manages just a modest increase in her parliamentary majority.  While some betting markets and models have predicted that the Tories could land as many as 180 seats more than its rivals combined, even a 50-seat cushion may help sterling hold steady, analysts say. And finally… British academics specializing in archeology stand to lose the most from Brexit given they get 38 per cent of their funding from the EU, according to a report commissioned by the UK’s four national academies. Information technology, software engineering, media studies and the law are other fields which receive more than a quarter of their funding from EU research grants, the report found. Overall, 12 per cent of UK research money comes from the bloc, all of which will be at risk once Brexit occurs. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week 1MDB probe: MAS fines Credit Suisse, UOB, seeks more trading bans (VIDEO) Ringgit continues downtrend due to soft demand KL shares turn mixed at mid-morning Tokyo shares slip, Trump-Russia probe in focus Oil rises second day as Opec cuts seen bringing stockpiles lower Singapore court fines ex-broker for corruption in 1MDB probe Chinese automaker Geely takes 49.9pc stake in Proton Ringgit jumps on Opec, yuan at three-month high, other Asian currencies drift Meet Li Shufu, the man who dared buy Proton Chinese carmaker Geely to acquire Malaysia’s Proton, sources say Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Bloomberg Video: Singapore fines Credit Suisse, UOB over 1MDB Reuters Video: Tiger Woods arrested for driving under the influence Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Ryanair accelerates expansion in Europe with new Boeing jets Asian currencies fall against firm dollar; won down for third session KL shares end morning session lower as cautious sentiment persisted Oil rises second day as Opec cuts seen bringing stockpiles lower KL shares turn mixed at mid-morning Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Thanks for reading and your comments.        See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 4:38pm For those more graphically minded, here is a nice visual wrap of the day's ASX results:   4:34pm Shares have enjoyed a solid turnaround, with the ASX rallying steadily from early losses to end the session in the black. The top 200 index enjoyed a 40-point rebound to end the session up 10 points, or 0.2 per cent, higher at 5718. The rally was powered by the big banks as investors showed they were prepared to step in and buy at the tail end of a dreadful May for the sector. CBA ended 0.7 per cent higher, ANZ was up 0.8 per cent, Westpac 1 per cent, and NAB 1.6 per cent. Macquarie climbed 0.8 per cent. Miners also enjoyed a change in fortunes: BHP added 0.7 per cent, Rio 1 per cent and Fortescue 1.9 per cent. Gold miners also gained, while energy lagged as Woodside dropped 1 per cent. Outside of miners and banks there was less joy to be had. Big names such as CSL, Wesfarmers and Telstra all dragged as they fell in the vicinity of 0.8 per cent. Metcash dropped 2 per cent as a number of consumer stocks felt the pinch: Retail Food Group was the day's worst with a 3 per cent fall, while carsales.com lost 2 per cent. Among the day's losers were also listed property names: Mirvac, Vicinity Centres and Stockland all dragged on the market. Winners and losers in the ASX 200 today. Photo: Bloomberg 3:56pm Consumers are paying the price for the significant disruption to the Australian gas market as exporters scramble to meet their export commitments, the national energy regulator has warned. In its annual review of energy markets, the Australian Energy Regulator noted that newly completed export projects in Queensland had been expected to insulate the Victorian, and to a lesser extent, NSW markets. But it found that shortages faced by the Santos-backed Gladstone gas project had changed that. Victoria's gas producers, for example, are also selling gas into the export projects, shipping the gas north costs at around $3.50-$4 a gigajoule, with the high cost traditionally creating a buffer in favour of domestic gas users in the southern markets. "But this buffer has been weakened by the Cooper Basin producers (particularly Santos) committing significant volumes of gas to the LNG projects," the report warned. "Those producers historically played a critical role in competing with the Gippsland Basin producers for market share in the southern states. "Weakening this competitive constraint potentially exposes gas buyers in Victoria to prices equivalent to the Queensland price plus transportation costs from Queensland. These dynamics are evident in significant disruption to the established gas flows in southern Australia." The warning came as prices in the wholesale gas market in Victoria hit $9 a gigajoule Tuesday, well above recent levels of around $6, in the wake of cool weather which also pushed the price in NSW to top $11 a gigajoule.

The scramble to export gas has hurt domestic consumers.  3:39pm The federal government has delayed the date of the first payment of the $6.2 billion bank tax by three months and excluded some liabilities from the levy, according to proposed legislation released today. The legislation did not include any sunset clause, which had been sought by the banks given the government had justified the tax as being necessary to help bring the federal budget back into a surplus by the financial year ending June 30, 2021. The six basis points levy on bank liabilities is designed to raise about $1.5 billion a year from the five biggest banks - CBA, Westpac, ANZ, NAB and Macquarie Group - over the next four years. "This represents a fair contribution by the banking sector to the Australian community and contributes to a long-term balanced budget," Treasurer Scott Morrison said in a speech to parliament. The first payment covering the half-year ending December 31 will now be due in March to give the banks a transitional period. The banks have said the cost of the tax will be borne by their customers and their shareholders. Australian Bankers' Association chief executive Anna Bligh said the banks welcomed concessions that excluded derivatives and money held with the RBA, but they still felt the tax was "poorly-designed". "There needs to be further consideration of a sunset clause to limit this tax on the banks to the time where the budget repair job needs to be done," she told reporters. The S&P/ASX 200 Financials index, which includes the major banks and represents 31 per cent of the benchmark index, has fallen by 4.8 per cent since the tax was announced on May 9. Treasurer Scott Morrison introduces the Major Bank Levy Bill at Parliament House. Photo: Andrew Meares Back to top 3:11pm Altair Asset Management Philip Parker's bold decision to liquidate his Australian shares funds and return the money to investors is highly contrarian. But his view that not all is well on the ASX is not. While no-one has so far followed his lead in publicly quitting the market entirely, many in Australia's professional investment community appear to be quietly preparing for a downturn.  According to the JPMorgan Fund Manager Radar, which assesses the public disclosures of major fund managers to deduce common themes, average cash holdings surged to 370 basis points in April, overtaking consumer discretionary stocks as the largest active position held by fund managers across any ASX sector in April. This follows several months of increasing cash allocations. "We do see the appeal [of cash] in a market where opportunities look increasingly constrained due to extended valuations (healthcare, industrials), structural concerns (banks, resources, retail) and style/franking limitations (REITS)," wrote JP Morgan equity strategist Jason Steed. The increasing allocation to cash holdings shows concern is building among fund managers, said Bennelong Australian Equity Partners' investment director Julian Beaumont.  Similarly, veteran fund manager Geoff Wilson, of Wilson's Asset Management, didn't quibble with Parker's assessment that the market was headed for some kind of downturn.  On the ASX - which has suffered a bad month with the S&P/ASX200 down more than 4 per cent and the big four banks on track to the worst May in 44 years - Wilson said "it's going to be a tough period". "And that's with the backdrop of the biggest global market in the very mature stages of a bull market," he added, referring to Wall Street's record-breaking run. But neither of those fund managers are exiting the field. Here's more Poll Would you like to vote? You will need Cookies enabled to use our Voting Feature. Would you like to vote?

"We saw a continuation of yesterday's sell-off this morning, but we also saw a shift in sentiment after the release of April's building approval numbers, which beat expectations," said Gary Huxtable, client adviser at wealth management firm Atlantic Pacific Securities. "There's definitely a lot of bargain-hunting today," he said. The financial index, which on Monday saw its biggest loss since December, is up 0.7 per cent, helped by monthly improvement in housing starts. The big four plus Macquarie are enjoying gains of around 1 per cent. Miners have recovered from a rout on Monday after tensions over potential iron-ore tax on mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP by the Western Australia state government eased. Rio Tinto and BHP shares are also both up about 1 per cent each, while iron-ore miner Fortescue has added 1.9 per cent. Energy stocks are among the biggest drags despite a moderate recovery in oil prices, as investors seek more clarity on the direction of OPEC-led production curbs. Telstra is down 0.9 per cent. 2:00pm The jobs market is improving in most developed countries - except for Australia, in another sign of growing economic divergence. The unemployment rate is going nowhere and, more worryingly, underemployment is near a 20-year high - as opposed to the US, Europe and Japan, where underutilisation is finally trending lower. "This labour market slack has been continuing to add downward pressure to wages growth," UBS economist Scott Haslem says. While quarterly wage price growth has steadied around 0.5 per cent, the annual pace continues to edge lower, slipping to a 19-year low of 1.9 per cent in the first quarter. Recent jobs data for Australia suggests some easing of this downward pressure on wages over the coming year, thanks to a strong pick-up in jobs growth, to a 3.5 per cent annualised pace over the past three months, Haslem says. "In addition to improving leading indicators of hiring intentions, this suggests wages growth in Australia should soon stabilise, and may even drift higher over the next couple of years." Still, UBS expects the RBA to get successively out-hiked by the US Fed over the coming year, predicting a Fed funds rate of 2.00-2.25 per cent for end-18, above the RBA cash rate forecast of 1.75 per cent. 1:40pm Treasurer Scott Morison has hailed a drop in the number of new interest-only home loans in the March quarter as a sign that a crackdown on speculative property investment is working. Morrison tweeted that the number of interest-only loans had fallen for the first time since 2009 and that in dollar terms the share of the loans was 10 percentage points below the peak level four years ago. Official data shows 1st fall in number of interest-only loans since 2009. Interest-only share of loan approvals 10ppts below peak (APRA)— Scott Morrison (@ScottMorrisonMP) May 30, 2017 Only 1,685 new interest only loans were made by banks in the March quarter, according to Australian Prudential Regulation Authority data, down slightly from 1,692 previously. APRA considers interest-only loans to be specially risky. By value interest-only loans grew to $583 million from $575 million previously. From today's APRA tweet. Record low cash rates & a near doubling in 5 years. Hope the sensitivity is recognised. pic.twitter.com/AKZ3MNHgi2— Peter Morgan (@psimpsonmorgan) May 30, 2017 But in a key indicator for APRA, interest-only loans accounted for 36.2 per cent of total home loans by value in the March quarter down from 37.5 per cent previously.  APRA issued rules at the end of March which required that banks cut interest-only loans to 30 percent of new residential lending.  The latest fall takes the share of interest-only loans back down to the level in the March quarter last year before cuts in official interest rates ignited a boom in house prices and speculative investor lending.  This is not the first time that the value of loans has fallen but as Morrison pointed out the share of interest-only loans in dollar terms is now 10 percentage points below its peak in June 2015. There's been a small reduction, but still plenty of demand for interest-only loans. Photo: Getty Images 1:22pm The euro, which appeared set for parity with the US dollar less than six months ago, is poised to extend its year-to-date rally, bolstered by upbeat economic data and cautious optimism from ECB chief Mario Draghi. The single currency held steady overnight, albeit in thin trade, after the president of the European Central Bank told EU lawmakers in Brussels that the "economic upswing is becoming increasingly solid and continues to broaden across sectors and countries", and "downside risks to the growth outlook are further diminishing". Still, Draghi isn't signalling any rethink just yet: "We remain firmly convinced that an extraordinary amount of monetary policy support, including through our forward guidance, is still necessary." His comments come amid a heightening debate within the ECB, including from Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, about planning for a return to more normal policy as inflation turns more positive. The eurozone's May CPI estimate is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, and that is seen as the next key trading data point for the single currency. The euro was fetching $US1.1129 on Tuesday, about 1 cent off recent nine-month highs. The currency has traded between $US1.11 and $US1.12 for most of the last two weeks, lifting its year-to-date advance to more than 6 per cent with an increasing number of forecasters seeing $US1.15 within reach and perhaps even $US1.20 over the next two years. The euro also has recovered against the Australian dollar; the Aussie is trading near 66.64 euro cents - a 2.7 per cent year-to-date decline. Forecasters see losses widening, perhaps to a sub 60 euro cents level, reflecting a divergence in overall monetary policy stances and interest rates in particular. "Looking ahead we think the euro still has a fair bit of upside, but our sense is that the (euro/$US) pair is likely to do a bit of work around the 1.11/12 (level) before it heads higher again," said NAB currency strategist Rodrigo Catril. "Our forecast is for the euro to end the year at 1.15, but given the pair's swift appreciation of late, the risk is that we get there sooner rather than later." "As for our AUD/EUR view,  we think the pair is likely to be face strong downward pressures, both from the USD and EUR arguments mentioned above," Catril said. "Putting our AUD/USD and EUR/USD views together leads to our forecast for AUD/EUR dropping to 62 euro cents by year end and then sub 60 next year." Among the reasons for the return of positive sentiment on the euro is that the eurozone economy is expanding at its fastest pace in six years. The IHS Markit Eurozone PMI held steady at 56.8 in May, according to data released last week, unchanged on April's six-year high, according to the preliminary flash estimate. ECB chief Mario Draghi is more optimistic about the eurozone recovery, but is reluctant to flag monetary tightening. Photo: ALEX KRAUS Back to top 12:57pm Shareholders in Vocus have stepped up their pressure on the board of the company to dump its chief executive Geoff Horth and make changes to the board. In the past two weeks shareholders owning more than 20 per cent of the issued capital of the voice and data network operator have separately put demands to chairman David Spence. The implicit threat was that if Spence did not act then shareholders would use their votes at the next annual meeting to force changes. Spence, who is in Perth for a board meeting, told the AFR's Chanticleer column that he was fully aware of the concerns of shareholders. "There is no doubt given the recent profit downgrade that there is a lot of pressure on us as a board and management at the moment," Spence said. "I have had a lot of shareholders talk to me over the last couple of weeks. There is pressure on us to make changes. "I have a list of a whole lot of things that shareholders want. But we need to do this in an orderly manner." Shares are down 0.8 per cent to $2.965. Vocus investors are critical of CEO Geoff Horth, Photo: NIC_WALKER 12:38pm  A rally for Chinese property stocks added a combined $US5.4 billion to the fortunes of three tycoons - in just one day. None fared better than Hui Ka Yan, the richest of them all, whose China Evergrande Group has built him a net worth of nearly $US21 billion. His wealth surged nearly $US4 million on Monday. Among the others, Yang Huiyan of Country Garden Holdings added $US1.3 billion, while Wu Yajun of Longfor Properties tacked on $US400 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index.  The rally has been confounding analysts focusing particularly on Evergrande, which trades at about 36 times reported earnings, more than double the valuations of Country Garden. Evergrande shares jumped 23 per cent yesterday and have more than tripled this year, hurting short-sellers and baffling even some of the most bullish stock analysts. Part of the sharp rally can be explained by Evergrande's plan to raise money from strategic investors ahead of a planned backdoor listing on the mainland and speculation that the developer will benefit from rising home sales in smaller Chinese cities. A buyback spree has also propelled a 123 per cent jump since late March - when short interest started climbing from a low point. Its astonishing share rally has resulted in the world's most painful short trade this year. To add insult to injury, bearish investors are paying higher fees to get crushed. Fees to borrow shares of the Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer for shorting have surged by more than five times since January to about 10 per cent and have doubled since Evergrande started buying back shares in late March, according to Simon Colvin, an analyst at IHS Markit. Evergrande shares available for lending have "nearly all been spoken for," resulting in higher borrowing costs, Colvin said. Hui Ka Yan's wealth surged by nearly $US4 billion yesterday. Photo: Brent Lewin 12:19pm Home values in Sydney and Melbourne fell in May from April, pushing a national index of dwelling values down 1.1 per cent over the month to date, CoreLogic said. In a preview of full-month figures the data provider will release on Thursday, it gave no indication of whether the monthly fall in the two largest cities related to apartments, houses or both.  The actual fall in prices seen over the month was unlikely to be as great as the initial index suggested, however, as seasonal factors mitigated the decline, CoreLogic research head Tim Lawless said.  "Importantly, the trend rate of growth shows the pace of capital gains has moderated from recent highs; this slowdown is occurring against a backdrop of rising mortgage rates, softer auction results, rising advertised stock levels, lower housing market sentiment and slowing investment activity," Lawless said in a statement. While the figures back the notion of slowdown in price growth, due to tighter credit policies pushed by banking regulator APRA, the signals are mixed - investor lending rose in March for the first time in more than a year, official figures earlier this month showed. However, the figures did not take into account the second round of credit restrictions imposed at the end of that month by banking regulator APRA and these are likely to show in coming months. Sydney and Melbourne housing markets seem to have cooled slightly in May. Photo: Jessica Shapiro 11:57am Was Altair CIO Phil Parker's decision to completely sell out of Aussie stocks a principled and brave decision, a cop-out, or something else altogether? Pat Commins asks: It's as big a statement you can make about how you see the market. That is, if it really was about the market, and not something else. As Parker told me: "We didn't want to be the guys to go back to the clients in three, four months or however long it takes, and say, 'You know what? The last three to four years where we've made these big performance fees and charged you a big fat 1 per cent management fee, well, oops we saw it coming but we didn't warn you because we thought we'd just collect our fees'." That sounds all good and proper, and I have no reason to believe he is not telling the truth. Still, the cynic has to ask - is there something else going on? So ok at least he's leaving with okish numbers - Altair pic.twitter.com/6u2cpQesRh— Con Michalakis (@MichalakisCon) May 30, 2017 The most obvious recent comparison is Peter Hall's surprise decision to quit Hunter Hall on Christmas Eve of last year. That decision came after a tough period for the fund, which had been positioned for a downturn that never came. Of particularly weight were the heavy losses from Hall's outsized exposure to biotech stock Sirtex. The thought of making up those losses seemed to weigh on Hall. Parker is a former colleague of Peter Hall and describes him as a friend. So the link goes beyond mere circumstance. Perhaps they were schooled in the same high conviction style of investing. But Parker says the only problem stocks they have had in their portfolios was an exposure to Brambles, which copped a sharp downgrade earlier this year, and Estia Health, the aged care operator that almost halved in value in quick order in August last year. In that case Parker says the fund got out early, after the shares had dropped a still hefty - but not disastrous - 15 per cent. In other words, the funds have been performing OK over the past year, and have beat their benchmarks since they started in 2013. There have been no massive outflows that threatened the viability of the business, Parker says. No personal pressures. Here's more Poll Would you like to vote?

The ASX-listed retail centre operator says it will pay LaSalle Investment Management $336 million for Home Hub Castle Hill, and $100 million for Home Hub Marsden Park, confirming an earlier report (see post at 9.49am). Founded by billionaire Brett Blundy, Aventus says the remainder of the cost will be met from a $300 million increase in its existing debt facility.

Building approvals have been on a decline since last August, with the once-booming apartment sector the biggest hit. Data published on today shows a better-than-expected gain of 4.4 per cent in April, but it follows a hefty loss of 10.3 per cent in March. Latest @ABSStats shows modest increase in national building approvals, rising by 4.4% in April 2017. See our state breakdown below. pic.twitter.com/slBes822l8— Property Council (@propertycouncil) May 30, 2017 Multi-unit approvals rose 9.6 per cent in April from March when they slumped more than 18 per cent. Apartment approvals are still down an annual 26.5 per cent over the year. Analysts say the data indicates Australia's biggest-ever construction boom is slowly unwinding. "While the monthly update was more positive than expected the slowdown theme remains clear," said Matthew Hassan, senior economist at Westpac. "New dwelling investment is expected to enter a decline from late this year, becoming a material drag on growth." 11:24am Retailers David Jones and Myer are slashing prices on autumn/winter apparel by as much as 50 per cent after pulling the trigger on mid-year clearance sales following the weakest retail trading in five years. David Jones' clearance sale kicked off today, just as the first cold snap for the season sent Sydneysiders scurrying for winter coats and scarves, while Myer's clearance starts on Thursday, in line with last year's mid-year stocktake sale but at least two weeks earlier than that in 2014. David Jones is discounting prices on clothing and accessories by as much as 50 per cent and homewares by as much as 40 per cent, while Myer will take 40 per cent off selected women's clothing, 60 per cent off small appliances and 50 per cent off selected manchester. Once again, Myer and David Jones have arrived late to the party, as specialty retailers such as Country Road, Cue, Witchery and Portmans have been discounting regularly since April to clear slow-moving autumn-winter stock after another balmy autumn. Retailers need to clear autumn/winter stock over the next two months - squeezing gross margins - to make way for spring-summer stock which traditionally arrives in August. The clearance sales follow the worst retail trading conditions since 2012 as cash-strapped consumers cut back on discretionary spending in the face of soaring living costs, stagnant wages growth, record household debt, stalling house prices and looming job losses. Clearance sales are kicking off before winter has even officially started. Photo: Jeff Darmanin 11:09am The acceleration of electric vehicles could be driving Big Oil towards a crash. Fitch says it isn't taking a red pen to oil ratings just yet but warns that an "investor death spiral" looms for companies that fail to evolve. Bloomberg New Energy Finance pinpoints 2028 as the year of reckoning. Over half of global oil demand is driven by transport, with motor vehicles playing a meaningful part. The analysis says electric vehicles could begin cutting into oil demand by 2023, gradually building a fresh supply glut of 2 million barrels of oil a day, on a par with the overhang that triggered the 2014 collapse. Barclays Capital places D-Day only a couple of years later, at 2030, but disagrees that it's a mortal threat. It estimates a hit of 1.8m barrels a day, but says that even with this impact, demand could increase given the growth in the overall number of cars on the road. By the end of the next decade, demand may be 600,000 barrel of oil a day higher than it is today. BP and Royal Dutch Shell will be hoping the investment bank is right. Both oil majors have played down the potential of electric cars in dampening demand in the past, but cracks are showing in their defiance. Earlier this year BP made a radical revision to its expectations. Its annual World Energy Outlook doubled the number of electric vehicles it expects on the world's roads in 2035 from 57m in last year's report to 100m. Here's more  Oil giants like the Emirates National Oil Company are under threat. Photo: Bloomberg 10:43am Another blow for nib shareholders: the competition watchdog has alleged the heath insurer engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct when it failed to tell members in advance of its decision to remove some eye procedures from a program that protected customers from out-of-pocket costs. Shares have dropped 2.8 per cent to $5.24, taking the slide since mid-May to nearly 20 per cent.  The ACCC says NIB failed to warn customers in advance that it had removed ceratin procedures from its MediGap Scheme, which covers the "gap" between health insurance rebates and Medicare rebates, so members would not face out-of-pocket expenses.  The ACCC alleges that between June 2011 and October 2016, NIB told members that "several of its policies covered eye procedures and members would not pay any out-of-pocket expenses, when in fact members could incur out-of-pocket costs". The Commission says NIB was unconscionable in that the insurer identified 400 members who it "probably ought to proactively communicate" with over the MediGap changes. The ACCC also alleges the insurer warned a doctor who told his own NIB clients of the change not to communicate with NIB members or the media about the MediGap Change.  Analysts have been downbeat on the stock, and the sector, with both Credit Suisse as well as Shaw and Partners downgrading NIB this month. Although profit across the private health insurance sector rose 18.2 per cent to $1.3 billion over the year to April, net margins in the sector have fallen from 5.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent over the period, according to data released by APRA in May. 10:27am The sharemarket has dropped to a two-month low in early trade, amid more selling in retailers and health-care stocks, but there is some cautious buying in the oversold banks. The ASX has slipped 0.2 per cent to 5697.5, dropping below the 5700-mark for the first time since March. Investors are lacking overseas guidance, with both the US and UK markets closed for public holidays.  Leading the falls among blue chips is CSL, which has dropped 0.7 per cent, followed by Wesfarmers, down 0.5 per cent. Domino's is the worst performer among the top 200 stocks, falling 2.8 per cent after it was downgraded by several analysts yesterday. The big banks are mostly higher, led by a 0.4 per cent rise in NAB. "Although bank stocks have now fallen to valuations that are at or below average levels for recent years, they are still well above 'bargain basement levels'," CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner says. "This means there is not yet an obvious case for bargain hunters to step in, given the degree of political risk faced by shareholders in this industry and concerns about the potential for a downturn in the housing market."

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    After a stint of frugality, Americans have returned to their borrowing ways. But are they getting into the kinds of debt trouble that lead to recessions? U.S. consumers now owe roughly $12.73 trillion to banks and other lenders for mortgages, car loans and credit card spending, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That exceeds even the total before the last financial crisis. Economists generally say people's willingness to borrow is a good thing, because it shows they're more confident about their financial futures. And the economy is in far better shape than a decade ago, when economists called the debt unsustainable and the housing market crashed. That's not the concern now. "Some of us are worried that consumers are going back into old habits, but the U.S. consumer is in a much different position before the financial crisis and even before in the late 1990s," said Ryan Sweet, an economist with Moody's Analytics who is not related to the AP reporter. Gone are the worries about second homes financed with no-money down mortgages. The stress points now are in three main categories: auto loans, credit cards and — to a greater extent but for different reasons — student loans. "If it's not a tool you can use to build stability and long-term net worth, debt leads to more problems than it can solve," said Todd Christensen, a credit counselor with the nonprofit organization Debt Reduction Services. STUDENT LOANS Not all debt is considered equal, and both mortgages and student loans have typically been considered ways for people to leverage themselves into a better life. A home loan historically has been a way for middle-class Americans to build wealth, while student loans helped people get better-paying jobs. Student loans have become a source of concern, though, as they become a greater proportion of the debt Americans owe — and those debts are not being paid back. In 2007, student loan debt was less than 5 percent of the debt Americans owned. That figure has more than doubled in 10 years to nearly 11 percent. As college costs have risen and student loans get larger, the amounts that are delinquent have been increasing. Americans currently have $1.34 trillion in student loan debt, of which 10.98 percent is 90 or more days past due. That's up from 6.85 percent of loans 10 years ago. "Student loans are a place to keep an eye on," Sweet said as a potential long-term problem for the U.S. economy. Delinquent student loans can hurt a person's credit score, and affect the ability for a first-time buyer to qualify for a mortgage. That could become a bigger problem as millennials enter their prime years to become a homeowner. Dallas resident Taylor Green, 29, is using debt strategically. Green, who works in finance, recently opened a credit card to help him and his fiancé pay for their wedding. He hopes to use the points he earns from that to then help cover the cost of a trip to Europe. "We both have good, stable jobs with decent security, so we are a more comfortable taking on the debt," Green said. "But we want to pay this debt down as fast as we can once the wedding is over." Green says he also has significant student loan debt, which is in forbearance, that he plans to tackle aggressively once the wedding is over. CAR LOANS Americans have been on a car-buying binge, as automakers sold a record 17.6 million cars last year to beat the level set a year earlier. People are also borrowing more money to buy their cars and are financing them for longer periods of time. The average length of a new car loan is around 62 months, compared to 55 months before the Great Recession, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve. And delinquencies in auto loans have been inching higher as well. The percent of auto loans 90 or more past due has climbed for 13 straight months, to 2.30 percent of all loans. Five years ago, that figure was 1.63 percent. Most of the delinquencies in auto loans have been concentrated around subprime borrowing, which has become more accessible to consumers in recent years. Americans with credit scores of less than 620, which is typically considered subprime or deep subprime, owe roughly $280 billion in auto loans — exceeding their pre-recession peak set in 2007, according to the New York Federal Reserve. But economists don't believe that if those loans go bad that it would pose a risk to the U.S. economy, like subprime mortgages did in 2007. The entire auto loan industry is $1.17 trillion, compared with the $8.63 trillion mortgage market. CREDIT CARDS Of the three worry spots, credit cards are often seen as the most toxic of debts. They're easy to accumulate, generally used to buy non-wealth generating consumer goods and often have the highest interest rates. Americans are carrying less credit card debt then they did before the Great Recession, but have re-embraced using them. Credit card debt has risen from $659 billion in 2014 to $746 billion last year, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, after years of trending lower, Federal Reserve data shows credit card delinquencies have reversed course and are climbing again — albeit still from relatively low levels. Banks are seeing the same trend. JPMorgan Chase, one of the nation's biggest credit card issuers, had to set aside slightly more money to cover bad credit card debts in the most recent quarter. American Express, which historically has some of the lowest default rates because its customers tend to be well-off, also saw those rates rise slightly in its U.S. card business last quarter. "It's worrisome, but at the same time, it was also inevitable," said Matt Schultz, senior industry analyst with Creditcards.com, a division of Bankrate.com. "There's only so much credit card debt Americans can hold before they get into trouble." Another specter over those who are carrying higher credit card balances: interest rates. With the economy in good shape, the Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates. But unlike mortgages, most auto loans and student loans, credit card rates are variable, and can move higher as the prime rate does. So that 15 percent rate on a credit card balance has moved up to 16 percent. How much small changes will affect people's ability to pay isn't clear, but Schultz is watching closely. "Delinquencies will rise as interest rates rise. I don't know what the tipping point will be for the consumer is, but it's going to be fascinating to watch," he said. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The investment bank’s asset management arm paid about $865 million, or 31 cents on the dollar, for bonds issued in 2014 by state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing five unidentified people familiar with last week’s transaction. Spokesmen for the central bank, which had held the notes, didn’t respond to messages. Julio Borges Photographer: Wil Riera/Bloomberg “It is apparent Goldman Sachs decided to make a quick buck off the suffering of the Venezuelan people,” Julio Borges, the opposition lawmaker who heads the National Assembly, wrote in a letter to Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and seen by Bloomberg. Congress will investigate the deal, he said. “I also intend to recommend to any future democratic government of Venezuela not to recognize or pay on these bonds.” Venezuela’s opposition has been urging Wall Street banks not to throw a financial lifeline to Maduro, who’s faced almost two months of public protests while cutting imports of food and medicine to conserve cash and continue bond payments. The nation’s dollar shortage, exacerbated by a collapse in oil prices, has left investors trying to gauge the likelihood that the government can keep servicing its debt. "We recognize that the situation is complex and evolving and that Venezuela is in crisis," Goldman Sachs said in an emailed response. "We agree that life there has to get better. We made the investment in part because we believe it will." The investment bank added that it bought the bonds on the secondary market, stressing that it’s not alone in investing in the country. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Last month, lawmakers reached out to big Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, asking them not to help the country monetize its $7.7 billion in gold reserves. In an editorial on Friday, Harvard University economist Ricardo Hausmann -- a former planning minister in Venezuela and long-time critic of the current government -- called on JPMorgan Chase & Co. to remove Venezuela from its bond indexes so investors tracking the gauges aren’t compelled to buy those notes. Read more: Venezuela lawmakers ask Wall Street to stop aiding Maduro In his letter, Borges said Goldman Sachs’s deal violates the bank’s own code of conduct and its statement on human rights. A copy of that statement on the firm’s website said its respect for human rights is “fundamental to and informs our business,” and that the firm places a “high priority” on identifying potential issues when deciding whether to do business with a client. Still, Borges said, the transaction helps Maduro. It’s “a financial lifeline to his authoritarian regime that is systematically violating the human rights of Venezuelans,” the lawmaker wrote in his letter to Blankfein. The “irregular nature” and “absurd financial terms involved” are “to the detriment of Venezuela and its people,” Borges said. Fintech Advisory Inc., a New York-based investment fund, previously agreed to buy $1.3 billion of PDVSA bonds in a repo transaction providing at least $300 million of cash, Reuters reported in early April. Goldman Sachs was the seventh-largest holder of PDVSA bonds as of March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Venezuela’s international reserves rebounded from near the lowest since 2002 last week, gaining more than $700 million to $10.86 billion as of May 25.

(AP Photo/David Goldman, File) Posted: Monday, May 29, 2017 4:05 am As Americans take on more debt, some pockets of concern Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — After a stint of frugality, Americans have returned to their borrowing ways. But are they getting into the kinds of debt trouble that lead to recessions? U.S. consumers now owe roughly $12.73 trillion to banks and other lenders for mortgages, car loans and credit card spending, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That exceeds even the total before the last financial crisis. Economists generally say people's willingness to borrow is a good thing, because it shows they're more confident about their financial futures. And the economy is in far better shape than a decade ago, when economists called the debt unsustainable and the housing market crashed. That's not the concern now. "Some of us are worried that consumers are going back into old habits, but the U.S. consumer is in a much different position before the financial crisis and even before in the late 1990s," said Ryan Sweet, an economist with Moody's Analytics who is not related to the AP reporter. Gone are the worries about second homes financed with no-money down mortgages. The stress points now are in three main categories: auto loans, credit cards and — to a greater extent but for different reasons — student loans. "If it's not a tool you can use to build stability and long-term net worth, debt leads to more problems than it can solve," said Todd Christensen, a credit counselor with the nonprofit organization Debt Reduction Services. STUDENT LOANS Not all debt is considered equal, and both mortgages and student loans have typically been considered ways for people to leverage themselves into a better life. A home loan historically has been a way for middle-class Americans to build wealth, while student loans helped people get better-paying jobs. Student loans have become a source of concern, though, as they become a greater proportion of the debt Americans owe — and those debts are not being paid back. In 2007, student loan debt was less than 5 percent of the debt Americans owned. That figure has more than doubled in 10 years to nearly 11 percent. As college costs have risen and student loans get larger, the amounts that are delinquent have been increasing. Americans currently have $1.34 trillion in student loan debt, of which 10.98 percent is 90 or more days past due. That's up from 6.85 percent of loans 10 years ago. "Student loans are a place to keep an eye on," Sweet said as a potential long-term problem for the U.S. economy. Delinquent student loans can hurt a person's credit score, and affect the ability for a first-time buyer to qualify for a mortgage. That could become a bigger problem as millennials enter their prime years to become a homeowner. Dallas resident Taylor Green, 29, is using debt strategically. Green, who works in finance, recently opened a credit card to help him and his fiancé pay for their wedding. He hopes to use the points he earns from that to then help cover the cost of a trip to Europe. "We both have good, stable jobs with decent security, so we are a more comfortable taking on the debt," Green said. "But we want to pay this debt down as fast as we can once the wedding is over." Green says he also has significant student loan debt, which is in forbearance, that he plans to tackle aggressively once the wedding is over. CAR LOANS Americans have been on a car-buying binge, as automakers sold a record 17.6 million cars last year to beat the level set a year earlier. People are also borrowing more money to buy their cars and are financing them for longer periods of time. The average length of a new car loan is around 62 months, compared to 55 months before the Great Recession, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve. And delinquencies in auto loans have been inching higher as well. The percent of auto loans 90 or more past due has climbed for 13 straight months, to 2.30 percent of all loans. Five years ago, that figure was 1.63 percent. Most of the delinquencies in auto loans have been concentrated around subprime borrowing, which has become more accessible to consumers in recent years. Americans with credit scores of less than 620, which is typically considered subprime or deep subprime, owe roughly $280 billion in auto loans — exceeding their pre-recession peak set in 2007, according to the New York Federal Reserve. But economists don't believe that if those loans go bad that it would pose a risk to the U.S. economy, like subprime mortgages did in 2007. The entire auto loan industry is $1.17 trillion, compared with the $8.63 trillion mortgage market. CREDIT CARDS Of the three worry spots, credit cards are often seen as the most toxic of debts. They're easy to accumulate, generally used to buy non-wealth generating consumer goods and often have the highest interest rates. Americans are carrying less credit card debt then they did before the Great Recession, but have re-embraced using them. Credit card debt has risen from $659 billion in 2014 to $746 billion last year, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, after years of trending lower, Federal Reserve data shows credit card delinquencies have reversed course and are climbing again — albeit still from relatively low levels. Banks are seeing the same trend. JPMorgan Chase, one of the nation's biggest credit card issuers, had to set aside slightly more money to cover bad credit card debts in the most recent quarter. American Express, which historically has some of the lowest default rates because its customers tend to be well-off, also saw those rates rise slightly in its U.S. card business last quarter. "It's worrisome, but at the same time, it was also inevitable," said Matt Schultz, senior industry analyst with Creditcards.com, a division of Bankrate.com. "There's only so much credit card debt Americans can hold before they get into trouble." Another specter over those who are carrying higher credit card balances: interest rates. With the economy in good shape, the Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates. But unlike mortgages, most auto loans and student loans, credit card rates are variable, and can move higher as the prime rate does. So that 15 percent rate on a credit card balance has moved up to 16 percent. How much small changes will affect people's ability to pay isn't clear, but Schultz is watching closely. "Delinquencies will rise as interest rates rise. I don't know what the tipping point will be for the consumer is, but it's going to be fascinating to watch," he said. ___ Ken Sweet covers banking and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.
