John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 4, 2016 at 12:40PM Image source: Wikimedia Commons. If you're thinking about investing in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), then you'll want to know a few things about the New York City-based bank. The three points below are a good place to start. 1. JPMorgan Chase is massive The first thing investors should know about JPMorgan Chase is that it's huge. The $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet ranks it first among banks in the United States in terms of size. JPM Total Assets (Quarterly) data by YCharts. And the assets on JPMorgan's balance sheet tell only half the story. It also exercises control over $24 trillion worth of its clients' assets. Most of these are assets under custody, held for corporate and institutional investor clients. The remainder, $2.5 trillion, are assets under management or held by wealthy people in various types of accounts, such as brokerage accounts. The reason it's important to know about JPMorgan Chase's size is because it weighs directly on the bank's performance. Thanks to new laws and regulations passed since the financial crisis, the nation's biggest banks must hold more capital than their smaller, simpler peers. This reduces a bank's leverage, which weighs on profitability. In JPMorgan Chase's case, it has to hold 3.5% more capital relative to its assets than your standard regional bank. This, combined with other regulations that apply specifically to the biggest banks, puts JPMorgan Chase and other multitrillion lenders at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors in the regional banking space. 2. It's a universal bank Another central point that investors should know about JPMorgan Chase is that it's a universal bank. This means that it operates both an investment and commercial bank. Holding all else equal, this makes JPMorgan Chase riskier than a bank that focuses on collecting deposits and making loans, as a traditional commercial bank does. The risk comes from an investment bank's trading operations. This was on display four years ago, when JPMorgan Chase lost $6 billion from a wrong way bet on the value of derivatives tied to the health of American corporations. The incident, known as the London Whale, cost chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon his 2012 bonus and nearly his job as well. Investment banks with trading businesses must allocate a larger share of their asset portfolios to safe and highly liquid assets, such as government bonds, as opposed to higher-yielding consumer and commercial loans. Regulators require this to offset the risk that incidents like the London Whale scandal present. The downside is that it drives down the yield on a bank's asset portfolio, as government bonds are less profitable than loans. 3. It's run by a very good banker The last thing that investors in JPMorgan Chase should know is that it's run by one of the best bankers of the current generation. Dimon cut his teeth working for the mastermind behind Citigroup, formed in 1998 when financier Sanford Weill initiated a merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group, which has since spun off on its own once again. Soon after the merger, Dimon was fired by Weill for refusing to promote Weill's daughter. Dimon was then hired to turnaround Ohio-based Bank One, the sixth biggest bank in the country at the time, which later merged with JPMorgan Chase. That's how Dimon found his way to the $2.5 trillion bank. Things could always change, but for the time being JPMorgan Chase investors can rest easy knowing that the 60-year-old executive is at the helm and doesn't seem intent on going anywhere anytime soon.

The Zurich-based bank, which has a securities and equities business in the country, is in talks with the central bank for an onshore licence, Iqbal Khan, head of the bank’s international wealth-management business, said in an interview in Dubai. About a dozen international lenders, including Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co, currently hold the licence, which allows banks to operate branches and take deposits in local currency. “Our ambition is to have a full Sama licence and we are working towards that,” said Khan, responsible for Credit Suisse’s wealth management business in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “The Middle East is going through a trough in the short term but we’re bullish in the long term,” he said. Samais the abbreviated name of the country’s central bank, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency. The number of high-net-worth individuals in the Middle East rose 0.1 per cent last year, while their combined wealth rose 0.9 per cent to $2.3 trillion, according to the Capgemini and Merrill Lynch 2016 World Wealth Report. Credit Suisse expects the number of millionaires in the region will rise to 500,000 from about 330,000 in 2015 and hired 45 relationship managers across the Middle East last year, Khan said. Thiam’s Strategy Under a strategy designed by Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam after he took the job in July 2015, the bank wants to focus on services for entrepreneurs and personal fortunes as it vies with competitors such as UBS Group AG and JPMorgan Chase to advise the ultra-wealthy. The Swiss bank is betting that it can attract affluent customers by offering individual clients loans as it pivots from investment banking to wealth management. The number of super wealthy individuals is growing even as countries like Saudi Arabia impose measures to offset the financial strain of lower oil. The government is cutting subsidies for citizens on basics like electricity while trying to increase tax revenue and create jobs. In September, it cancelled bonuses for state employees long taken for granted. Credit Suisse manages about 70 billion Swiss francs ($72 billion) of private banking assets in the region, with assets growing “double digits” in the first half, Khan said. “We see this as a very interesting wealth management market,” he said, pointing to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait as the most promising markets. “While in the short term there are challenges, there are also opportunities.” International wealth management raised about 11 billion Swiss francs in net new assets during the first half, an annualised growth rate of about 7 to 8 per cent, and extended more than 3 billion francs of new loans, Khan said.

The index is called the JPM GBI aggregate diversified fund and is made up of both investment grade and high yield bonds, with an allocation of 80 percent developed market and 20 percent emerging market bonds. Global bond indexes typically only comprise about 2 to 4 percent emerging market bonds because certain countries are excluded based on credit ratings. JPMorgan said the new index is 94 percent comprised of investment grade credits with an average index rating of Aa3/AA-/AA- by Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, respectively. "This split is a better reflection of both outstanding debt stock in the global investable landscape and the increasing economic contribution of EM countries to global GDP," said Gloria Kim, head of J.P. Morgan Global Index Research Group, in a statement. The allocation to the G3 currencies - the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - totals only 57 percent of the fund, as compared to 85 percent to 90 percent in traditional global government bond indices, analysts said. The index has a weighted average yield of 1.35 percent, Kim said in the statement, and managers at JPMorgan see it as one of their "flagship" indeces for the coming years. The index does not exclude countries based on credit ratings but does exclude countries with capital controls. JPMorgan offers around 20 benchmark indices. Its other flagship products include the JPMorgan EMBI index and GBI-emerging markets index.

JPMorgan Chase's chief executive pushed back at the Democratic presidential candidate after she criticized the U.S. banking culture amid Wells Fargo's fake account scandal. "It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law," Clinton said on Monday. In response, Dimon said: "When people blanket a whole class of people...that's just unfair." Wells Fargo opened credit card, checking and savings account without customers' permission and fired thousands of employees over the course of several years for the deceptive sales practices, without fixing the problem. Banks have been under a microscope both in the U.S. and abroad. Concerns are enduring about Deutsche Bank, which faces an expected multi-billion dollar fine from the U.S. government for activities prior to the mortgage crisis. Financial markets across the globe were sent into flux last week, amid reports of hedge funds reducing their exposure to Deutsche Bank as well as talks of a possible settlement. Getty Images JPMorgan Chase and Co. chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Still, amid market worries that Deutsche is facing a capital squeeze, Dimon said he believes the German lender is going to be fine. "There is no reason that Deutsche Bank shouldn't get over its problems," the head of the largest U.S. bank by assets said of the fourth-largest European bank by assets. Deutsche shares have gotten pounded as investors worry that it has a weak capital position that is in even more danger due to a looming settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice involving the firm's mortgage-backed securities operations. The banks American Depositary Receipts are down about 47 percent in 2016 and nearly 53 percent over the past 12 months. "They have plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity," Dimon said during an telephone interview on CNBC's "Power Lunch." "We want all these banks to get through because it's better for everybody." Shares of Germany's largest bank ended Monday trading near $13, a decline of less than 1 percent. Wells Fargo shares fell 1.02 percent. —CNBC's Jeff Cox and Ted Kemp contributed to this report.

The sale process will test the possible interest of beverage companies including Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc in buying upstart beverage brands, as the soft drinks industry grapples with increasingly health-conscious consumers. Bai has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co to run an auction and reach out to potential buyers, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Bai and JPMorgan declined to comment. Bai, which means "pure" in Mandarin Chinese, sweetens its drinks with plant-based ingredients and infuses them with antioxidants from coffee fruit and white tea. It was founded in 2009 by entrepreneur Ben Weiss, who still owns a majority of the company. The Princeton, New Jersey-based company has focused on expanding distribution and advertising, premiering its first Super Bowl commercial earlier this year. Last year, drinks company Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc bought a minority stake in Bai, after signing an earlier distribution deal with the company. Like most major soda companies, Dr Pepper is known to make small investments as it seeks to spot the next brand to capture the attention of consumers. For its part, Coca-Cola has invested in organic juice maker Suja, Honest Tea and Zico Coconut Water. In the case of Honest Tea and Zico, these investments eventually led to an outright acquisition. PepsiCo bought a 90 percent stake in tea drink SoBe in 1999 before buying the entire company a year later. Still, it is not clear Dr. Pepper will follow in Coke's footsteps. In its conference call after releasing second-quarter 2015 results, Dr. Pepper's CFO, Marty Ellen, voiced wariness of an outright acquisition of Bai. "To acquire them would be just too expensive, and we are not sure the right thing to do in terms of the amount of money it would actually take to own all these businesses," Ellen said. One of the largest acquisitions of an upstart beverage brand was Coke's $4.1 billion purchase of Vitaminwater-maker Glaceau in 2007. Though lauded by analysts at the time as a way for Coke to expand its portfolio of health products, Coke last year agreed to change the wording on labels amid claims the drinks had overstated health benefits.

Amid market worries that Deutsche is facing a capital squeeze, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said he believes the German lender is going to be fine. "There is no reason that Deutsche Bank shouldn't get over its problems," the head of the largest U.S. bank by assets said of the fourth-largest European bank by assets. Deutsche shares have gotten pounded as investors worry that it has a weak capital position that is in even more danger due to a looming settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice involving the firm's mortgage-backed securities operations. The banks American Depositary Receipts are down about 47 percent in 2016 and nearly 53 percent over the past 12 months. "They have plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity," Dimon said during an telephone interview on CNBC's "Power Lunch" program.

 Here's what Space-X and a high-speed trading firm have in common Kevin McPartland, Greenwich Associates Oct. 3, 2016, 9:58 AM 1,736 facebook linkedin twitter email print SpaceX Over the last decade we've seen the talent pool for trading and space exploration become increasingly overlapped. Science-based PhDs can now either send a man to Mars or help make markets in US Government Bonds. But that's not actually the story here. NASA's bread and butter is sending rockets into space.  Bank trading desks similarly are the epicenter of bond trading.  Greenwich Associates research shows that in 2016 58% of US Treasury trading by institutional investors was handled by the top five dealers.  But the last few years have seen both NASA and the world's largest bond dealers start to outsource parts of those core functions. Whereas NASA has increasingly looked to SpaceX and other private sector companies to send rockets into space, JPMorgan, one of those top five bond dealers I just mentioned, tapped Virtu to supply its US Treasury trading infrastructure.  If you had asked anyone in the known a decade ago if either of those events seemed realistic in the future, the answer would have been a resounding no. But the more you think about it the more this and potential similar partnerships make sense.  In this case, both realized that if they partnered with someone else that could do it better, they could focus on more critical parts of their missions.  Now space exploration isn't my thing (unfortunately) so I'll leave NASA's decision alone, but the tie up between JPMorgan and Virtu is a bold one, and demonstrates the market's increasing willingness (and need) to start doing things differently. Getty/Andrew Burton When I first saw the headline about the tie up I was stunned.  How could JPMorgan, one of the most successful banks in the post-crisis era, outsource anything to a firm that for years has worked to bolster its position as a new and improved source of liquidity?  But after a few minutes it hit me - why should JPMorgan continue to build and maintain a trading infrastructure, when it can buy one for less that will perform better?  Now to be fair, JPMorgan is only replacing technology for a slice of their bond business, but the gesture is notable none the less. Interestingly Virtu isn't a particularly big volume player in the Treasury market.  They don't show up on Brokertec's top 10 list, and fixed income doesn't even get its own line in the profit section of their annual report (it is lumped together with options and "other securities").   But their reputation in other asset classes and as a technology innovator, not to mention their willingness to partner, closed the deal.  I'm sure the integration will cause pain and cost money for JPMorgan in the short term, but in the long run the now barely profitable business of trading US Treasuries will be able to operate with a lower cost base and as such a higher margin, but without hurting performance. From Virtu's perspective, and ultimately the perspective of all principle trading firms, the deal is even sweeter. Firms like GTS, KCG, Sun Trading and Virtu have spent years perfecting their ability to trade liquid instruments in a low risk, high profit way.  These firms and others like them could certainly continue on as is making money from their bread and butter business - trading.  But the last few years, capped off by the JPMorgan/Virtu deal, have shown us that some PTFs are smartly looking for new ways to capitalize on the assets they've built up over the past decade - there people, their technology and increasingly their brands. Traders work on the floor of the NYSE in New York City Thomson Reuters In 2016 the mood is dramatically different.  Speaking to the press, presenting at conferences, hiring sales people to interact with clients and selling what was in the past the secret sauce all on the table. Virtu and JPMorgan are unique in their own rights, so we won't see another deal with the exact same look and feel. And many PTFs after careful consideration will continue to stick to their knitting, not seeing the new opportunities as worth the investment or risk.   Nevertheless, we will see more partnerships between PTFs and the Street, some very close and some at arm’s length, as banks increasingly need the trading efficiencies those PTFs have spent years working to perfect.

Public portions of so-called living wills refiled by eight of the largest U.S. lenders were released by the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Tuesday, detailing what companies have done to fix shortcomings flagged earlier this year. Updates were due Oct. 1 from five banks that failed to produce sufficient plans and three others required to address deficiencies in preparation for the next round of annual filings in July. JPMorgan -- one of the five that failed in April -- said it has set up an intermediate holding company and has begun transferring assets to it. The new entity will “stand ready to make capital and liquidity contributions” to other units in a failure and has a contractual obligation to ensure resources are quickly channeled to the right places if the lender collapses. The bank also said it’s added “significantly” to its easy-to-sell assets and has stashed extra liquidity at each of its major units. Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and State Street Corp. also were ordered to refile their resolution plans, with the understanding that another failure could lead to government intervention and new capital demands. JPMorgan said the bank’s revised plan “responds fully to all deficiencies, substantially addresses the shortcomings identified in the agencies’ feedback and also addresses new requirements,” and other banks said they also are weighing similar intermediate holding companies. Living wills were mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act to lay out how complex banks could go through bankruptcy without roiling the financial system. If the Fed and FDIC decide a bank’s plan isn’t credible, they can force changes to its operation. Most of the 2015 submissions were rejected, and future failures would trigger a lengthy process that could -- in the worst case -- lead to a bank being forced to break up. JPMorgan also said it created a strategy for selling off as many as 16 independent pieces of the company that it called “highly attractive businesses.” The plan described the entities as “global leaders and top competitors in the products and markets in which they have chosen to compete” and said they would have a diverse array of potential buyers. Wells Fargo, which was criticized by regulators for “material errors” in its rejected 2015 plan, said it shed some of its non-core businesses to make the company easier to handle in a failure. The bank also said it has been “increasing both the liquid assets available to meet its needs in a time of stress and the amount of capital available to absorb potential losses.” Bank of America’s repairs included assuring regulators that it could better figure out where resources should be stockpiled in key units and how much might be needed. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. also had public portions of their refiled plans released by regulators on Tuesday. The plans address how they’re fixing individual shortcomings before the next annual submissions due July 1. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Chase, the biggest bank in the area by deposits, has 1,913 ATMs in the Chicago area, including Northwest Indiana. Of those, 442 are in Walgreens stores and are part of Chase's national sale of ATMs housed in drugstores and certain other nonbank locations to Cardtronics, the largest nonbank owner of ATMs in the world. Once the transfer to Houston-based Cardtronics occurs in early 2017, Chase will have 1,471 ATMs in the area. Until the transfer occurs, Chase customers won't have to pay fees to get cash at Walgreen ATMs, but they will after that. Chase has 372 area branches, by far the most of any bank here but down from 428 five years ago. Cutting ties with Walgreens, which has been aligned with Chase for 11 years, is the latest move by Chase to reduce its reach via relationships with other Chicago-area retailers. The demise of Dominick's Finer Foods in late 2013 led to the closure of nearly 50 Chase branches housed in the grocery stores. As the nation's largest bank and one of the biggest in the world, Chase's appeal to retail customers lies predominantly in convenience and technology. It can boast more branches and ATMs than any other bank in Chicago, giving customers fee-free access to their cash almost anywhere they are in the area. In a statement, Chase said that 11 years ago it was looking to fill gaps where it didn't have ATMs or branches. After Chase's 2008 acquisition of Seattle-based Washington Mutual, which had a significant branch network in Chicago, there were far fewer of those service gaps. “We are simplifying our business and found that our customers were using these ATMs less frequently, possibly because they want more from the ATM than just dispensing cash,” the company said. “Our customers can find a Chase ATM—usually one that takes deposits—within five minutes of most of the ATMs we are selling.” J.

Chairman Roger Altman said. “Keep in mind Deutsche Bank is small,” Altman said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. He compared the roughly $18 billion market value of Deutsche Bank to that of JPMorgan, which is over $240 billion. “One of the things going on here is that Deutsche Bank’s under pressure for a number of reasons, but one of which is it’s so small.” Deutsche Bank shares have plunged more than 47 percent this year amid concern the firm will have to raise capital to pay legal costs. The largest German lender may face fines linked to a U.S. Department of Justice probe into residential mortgage-backed securities, and an additional expense tied to a money-laundering investigation at its Russian operation. The charges tied to the home loans may amount to $5.6 billion, lower than the $14 billion initially requested by the government, according to an estimate by Autonomous Research LLP. Balance Sheet Autonomous said last week that the bank has ample funds to weather more than two months of severe stress, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Deutsche Bank can also access backstops from the European Central Bank. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer John Cryan said the balance sheet is safer than at any point in the past two decades. “The immediate reaction was, and is, well they can’t pay $14 billion,” Altman said. “That wouldn’t be the reaction against one of the big-cap U.S. banks.” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC Tuesday that there’s “ no reason” Deutsche Bank can’t resolve its issues, including settlement talks with the government. Altman, whose New York-based investment bank specializes in mergers and acquisitions, said the problems at Deutsche Bank aren’t likely to spread to other European banks such as UBS Group AG and Barclays Plc, because those firms are in better shape after changing their strategies. “These institutions when you study them are really quite different,” Altman said. “It’s more specific to Deutsche Bank than otherwise.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

the GOES satellite at 1620 UTC, shows Hurricane Matthew in the Caribbean Sea heading toward Jamacia, Haiti and Cuba on October 3, 2016. JPMorgan on Tuesday increased earnings estimates for a group of insurance stocks, advising clients to get behind the sector once hurricane Matthew passes. "Despite potential for a solid 3Q [third quarter], the P&C [property and casualty] (re)insurance stocks could sell off this week as Hurricane Matthew (currently a Category 4 hurricane in Caribbean) approaches the U.S.," wrote equity analyst Sarah DeWitt in a research note. The analyst predicts that earnings in the third quarter for the insurance group could come in ahead of expectations due to "moderate global catastrophe losses," with companies in the reinsurance space seeing the lowest impact. However, Hurricane Matthew presents a threat.

Saudi Capital Market Authority Chairman Mohammad Al Jadaan and Tadawul stock exchange Chief Executive Officer Khalid Al Hussan are among officials attending the two-day event organised by JPMorgan Chase & Co., the bank said in an e-mailed statement on Monday. Senior representatives of the kingdom’s economy ministry and central bank will also be present. The meetings come at a difficult moment for the Arab world’s largest economy. The US Senate last week voted to override President Barack Obama’s veto of a bill allowing Saudi Arabia to be sued for its alleged links to the September 11 attacks, which people familiar with the matter said might delay the country’s first dollar-bond issuance. Meanwhile, the benchmark stock gauge entered its second bear market this year after a series of cuts to government salaries and bonuses triggered a selloff. “I’m sure they will discuss the implications of the 9/11 bill and try to get rid of the uncertainties around it,” said Robert Hahm, an investment manager at Mashreq Capital DIFC Ltd. in Dubai, which has $1.5 billion of assets under management. “We still don’t know if or how it’ll affect investment in Saudi Arabia and sentiment toward the kingdom.” Saudi Arabia plans to sell debt and attract foreign investors to its local market as it seeks to plug an estimated shortfall of about $100 billion in its budget this year and fund an economic transformation plan to wean itself off oil revenue. The Tadawul, which is trading near the lowest level in since 2011, is the worst performer in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council this year, down about 21 per cent. JPMorgan is one of the coordinators of the planned bond sale, which people with knowledge of the matter said in May could raise at least $10 billion.

Speculation was rife over the weekend that the bank was aiming to lower the $14 billion penalty which relates to a number of investigations related to mortgage securities. Shares of the firm rallied on Friday afternoon on rumors of a deal. See how European markets are trading right now Following a national holiday on Monday, shares rose higher at the open on the German DAX but soon pared gains. By the close of European markets, they had risen to clock gains of nearly 1.5 percent. "With no updates so far on the case, expect the stock to remain on a roller coaster," FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed said in a note on Tuesday morning. Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. HSBC cut its price target on the German lender from 14 euros to 12 euros in a research note published Tuesday. But earlier it had also got a strong vote of confidence Monday from another major rival. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC that he believed the German lender was going to be fine. "There is no reason that Deutsche Bank shouldn't get over its problems," he said. The perception is that Deutsche Bank needs to raise capital following the proposed settlement from the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ. The bank has repeatedly defended itself over recent weeks, however, telling CNBC that there is "no reason to worry" and that the bank had a "comfortable cushion."

The euro moved in its narrowest range ever versus the dollar during the quarter just past. It’s a prime example of the biggest challenge faced by dealers: the volatility they exploit for profit is falling throughout the $5.1 trillion-a-day market, sending an index of top funds’ returns tumbling for a seventh month in September. The torpor is mainly due to central banks. The divergence trade that was supposed to see a rate-hiking Federal Reserve split from its peers and spur the dollar higher is sputtering, with a lackluster U.S. economy forcing officials to hold off on tightening policy. The euro has stagnated as investors judge that the European Central Bank is running out of ammunition to expand the money supply. The malaise is even spreading to the yen, this year’s best-performing developed-market currency, as dealers weigh the Bank of Japan’s latest policy twist. “Most of these managers did fairly well in jumping in on dollar longs in 2014 and 2015, but now that there’s no trend they’ve been struggling,” said Ugo Lancioni, a money manager in London at Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which oversees about $246 billion. “There’s no point in implementing momentum strategies if fundamentals don’t support the story.” A long position is a wager that a currency will appreciate. Staying Neutral A growing number of investors and traders say the euro-dollar rate is moving so little that it isn’t worth bothering about, while forecasts in a Bloomberg survey suggest it will remain within about a cent of its $1.0952-$1.1366 third-quarter range until 2018. That’s the narrowest range for a quarter since the single currency’s 1999 inception. “We’re not active in the euro-dollar space one way or the other,” said Roger Hallam, London-based chief investment officer for currencies at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees $1.7 trillion. “The market is beginning to consider the limits of monetary policy. There’s no real impulse for the euro to be trading significantly weaker from here.” A JPMorgan Chase & Co. volatility measure just posted its first back-to-back quarterly drop in more than two years as the impact of the Brexit referendum faded, dropping to 9.9 percent, from more than 12 percent in June. The Parker Global Index of returns is also falling, extending its decline this year to 3.5 percent, the most since 2011. The seven-month losing streak is the longest in data going back to 2003. Momentum trading, or following trends such as the anticipated dollar surge, has fallen since early July, according to a Deutsche Bank AG index. It’s up 2.4 percent this year, set for the worst performance since 2012, while the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has fallen 3.4 percent, headed for its first annual slide in four years. Since hurting investors with an unexpected gain in the first half of the year, the yen has paused its ascent amid speculation it strengthened too fast and after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Sept. 21 the central bank would target its bond purchases to boost inflation more effectively. On the same day, the Fed held its key rate unchanged and emphasized a gradual path toward tighter policy. Draghi refrained from boosting the ECB’s bond-purchase plan at its most recent meeting almost a month ago, even as the institution cut its 2018 economic growth forecasts. Carry Thrives One beneficiary of the drop in global volatility is the carry trade, where the profit from borrowing cheaply in one currency and investing where rates are higher can be wiped out by price swings. A Deutsche Bank index tracking this strategy has risen 7.5 percent in 2016 amid a rally in emerging-market currencies and as the Fed holds off raising rates for a second time since the financial crisis. For the market as a whole, though, the floundering of major central banks is making it difficult to take decisions. Ulf Lindahl, chief executive officer of A.G. Bisset Associates LLC, said it would take a surge in the euro for the currency manager to buy back into the single currency. It’s only a matter of time before that happens, though, he said; the euro has been flat for too long. “We are neutral on the euro against the dollar and have been since Aug. 1,” said the 35-year market veteran, who manages more than $1 billion from Norwalk, Connecticut. “But we’re prepared to buy it should it move higher.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

JPMorgan Chase's chief executive pushed back at the Democratic presidential candidate after she criticized the U.S. banking culture amid Wells Fargo's fake account scandal. "It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law," Clinton said on Monday. In response, Dimon said: "When people blanket a whole class of people...that's just unfair." Wells Fargo opened credit card, checking and savings account without customers' permission and fired thousands of employees over the course of several years for the deceptive sales practices, without fixing the problem. Banks have been under a microscope both in the U.S. and abroad. In Germany, concerns that banking giant Deutsche Bank will not be able to pay a $14 billion fine levied by the U.S. government. Financial markets across the globe were sent into flux last week, amid reports of hedge funds reducing their exposure to Deutsche Bank as well as talks of a possible settlement. Still, amid market worries that Deutsche is facing a capital squeeze, Dimon said he believes the German lender is going to be fine. "There is no reason that Deutsche Bank shouldn't get over its problems," the head of the largest U.S. bank by assets said of the fourth-largest European bank by assets. Deutsche shares have gotten pounded as investors worry that it has a weak capital position that is in even more danger due to a looming settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice involving the firm's mortgage-backed securities operations. The banks American Depositary Receipts are down about 47 percent in 2016 and nearly 53 percent over the past 12 months. "They have plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity," Dimon said during an telephone interview on CNBC's " Power Lunch. " "We want all these banks to get through because it's better for everybody." Shares of Germany's largest bank ended Monday trading near $13, a decline of less than 1 percent. Wells Fargo shares fell 1.02 percent. —CNBC's Jeff Cox and Ted Kemp contributed to this report.

Singapore's extremely-high-end properties are now cheap compared with similar luxury properties in other major capital cities, according to Brandon Lee, a property analyst at JPMorgan in Singapore. After a 15-25 percent drop in prime and luxury residential prices since the market peak in 2011, Singapore's properties now represent a good deal for ultra-high-net-worth investors who were comparison shopping between capitals, Lee said. Luxury housing in London, Hong Kong and New York was changing hands at prices as much as 165 percent higher than in Singapore, Lee noted. That "very attractive" gap was drawing interest from private equity and global property funds keen to buy multiple apartments from developers in "block" deals, Lee said. Family offices and rich individuals were also increasingly interested in making purchases, he noted. Despite often needing to offer additional discounts to do those bulk deals, developers have a big motivation: Singapore's government does not allow developers to sit on unsold units while waiting for buyers to return to the market. Any units unsold two years after a project's completion face an "extension charge" of 8 percent of the proportional land cost for the first year, rising to 16 percent in the second year and 24 percent in the third. show chapters <p>Singapore&#039;s home prices may take cues from car loans</p> <p>Looser car loan restrictions could indicate that Singapore&#039;s central bank may soon ease measures for the property sector.</p> Singapore's home prices may take cues from car loans    Tuesday, 14 Jun 2016 | 7:04 AM ET | 00:39 Some experts told CNBC the recovery in Singapore's ultra-high-end property was overdue. "Values in the market are a joke in comparison to some markets," such as London, Hong Kong and Monaco, said property investor Alexander Karolik Shlaen, an economist and CEO of Panache Management, a luxury brands and investment adviser. He noted that Singapore's freehold luxury property prices were running at about $2,000 a square foot, which he said in London wouldn't be considered a luxury price. Shlaen expected that purchasers who weren't subject to Singapore's Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rule would also be motivated to buy. In a bid to rein in its housing market's sharp price rises, from 2011 Singapore's government imposed a series of cooling measures, including the ABSD, which adds much as an additional 15 percent to the purchase price for foreign buyers and Singaporeans with more than one property. While the additional cost may not seem terribly onerous for buyers at the high end, it appears to have successfully dampened interest in luxury properties in the city-state. But due to tax treaties, buyers from some countries, including the U.S., Switzerland and Lichtenstein, are exempt. JPMorgan's Lee noted that in an unusual development, Americans became the second-most frequent buyers of high-end Singapore homes in the second quarter. Individuals from Malaysia, Indonesia and China usually dominate the list, Lee said. "It could reflect that prices have fallen enough to look at the space," Lee said. But he was quick to note that he only saw Singapore's high-end as having bottomed out; the mainstream housing market still had room to drop, he cautioned. Munshi Ahmed | Bloomberg | Getty Images "If you look at unsold inventory, it's at a record low" for the high end, Lee said, but he added that wasn't true of the mass-market segment, which he said would see further supply growth even amid vacancy rates that were already as high as 15 percent. That segment also hadn't seen too much in the way of price declines yet, he said. "The only reason why we've not seen a lot of distressed properties out there is interest rates are still very low. Owners of properties have strong holding power and they're not willing to take a haircut," he said. Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority released a flash estimate on Monday that showed the city-state's private home prices fell at the fastest pace in seven years in the third quarter. The private residential property index fell 1.5 percent to 137.9 in the July-September quarter, according to the URA, after falling 0.4 percent in the previous quarter. The latest drop was the largest quarterly decline since home prices slid 4.7 percent in the second quarter of 2009, when fallout from the global financial crisis slammed into Asia and pushed Singapore's economy into contraction. - Reuters contributed to this report.

MIC currently expects the closing of the senior secured credit facilities and the refinancing to occur prior to the middle of October, subject to customary closing conditions. The new five-year credit agreement is expected to consist of a $400 million term loan, all of which is to be drawn at closing, and an up to $350 million revolving credit facility, of which approximately $200 million, excluding usage for undrawn letters of credit, is to be drawn at closing. Under the proposed terms, the facility would bear interest at LIBOR (with a 0.0% floor) plus a margin of between 1.5% and 2.25%, depending on Atlantic Aviation’s leverage ratio. The all-in cost could be higher if MIC elects to hedge all or a portion of the LIBOR component using either interest rate swap or cap agreements. “While not an immediate need, by seeking to refinance Atlantic Aviation’s debt today we are attempting to take advantage of what we believe is an attractive credit market,” said James Hooke, chief executive officer of MIC. The implementation of the new credit facility could generate as much as 2.00%, or approximately $12.0 million per year, in interest expense savings versus the current facility. The existing Atlantic Aviation senior secured credit agreement consists of a $595.9 million term loan maturing in 2020 and a $70 million revolving credit facility (currently undrawn) maturing in 2018. The facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a current margin of 2.5% and includes a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. Including the effect of interest rate swap agreements, the all-in cost of the current facility is 4.63%. MIC subsidiary Atlantic Aviation FBO Holdings, LLC would serve as guarantor on behalf of the borrower, Atlantic Aviation FBO Inc., together with substantially all of the borrower’s material domestic subsidiaries.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:40 AM, October 4, 2016 NEW YORK - A decade after JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> said with great fanfare that it would make life easier for customers by putting its cash machines into Duane Reade drug stores in New York City and Walgreens stores in Florida, the big bank is retreating. Customers who use the ATMs marked with Chase's blue octagon logo in those drug stores are beginning to be met with a message: “Soon this machine will no longer be a Chase ATM.” The new message is the public start of a withdrawal that stems from an agreement the largest U.S. bank by assets made in April to sell 2,586 cash machines - primarily in Walgreens and Duane Reade drug stores, and other retailers - to ATM operator Cardtronics <CATM.O> for an undisclosed amount. The exact timing depends on how quickly the machines can be converted for use under the brand name of another financial institution. The deal includes ATMs in Walgreens in nine states in total, including stores in Arizona and the Chicago area. Chase spokesman Mike Fusco said the bank is logging off of the ATMs because it will save money and because customers use these particular machines less. "It really came down to simplifying the business," said Fusco. "Our customers are using those ATMs less frequently given that our ATM presence has expanded significantly over the last 11 years." When Chase disconnects, it will have about 15,500 ATMs, primarily in its branches. That is more than twice as many as in 2005 when the bank turned to drug stores to quickly place cash dispensers. It also has ATMs at some airports, train stations and sports arenas. Fusco said Chase has ATMs within five minutes of the "vast majority" of discontinued machines because of expansions since it made the drug store deals. For example, in 2008, two years after turning to Walgreens for more Florida locations, JPMorgan picked up 260 branches in its financial crisis purchase of Washington Mutual. Chase ATMs in branches accept deposits while the store machines it is giving up only dispense cash and show account balances. Cardtronics is talking to other financial institutions about putting their brands on the machines and it expects to announce new arrangements "later this year," Cardtronics spokesman Nick Pappathopoulos said in an email. A spokeswoman for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, <WBA.O> which owns Walgreens and Duane Reade, had no immediate comment.

The sale process will test the possible interest of beverage companies including Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc in buying upstart beverage brands, as the soft drinks industry grapples with increasingly health-conscious consumers. Bai has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co to run an auction and reach out to potential buyers, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Bai and JPMorgan declined to comment. Bai, which means "pure" in Mandarin Chinese, sweetens its drinks with plant-based ingredients and infuses them with antioxidants from coffee fruit and white tea. It was founded in 2009 by entrepreneur Ben Weiss, who still owns a majority of the company. The Princeton, New Jersey-based company has focused on expanding distribution and advertising, premiering its first Super Bowl commercial earlier this year. Last year, drinks company Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc bought a minority stake in Bai, after signing an earlier distribution deal with the company. Like most major soda companies, Dr Pepper is known to make small investments as it seeks to spot the next brand to capture the attention of consumers. For its part, Coca-Cola has invested in organic juice maker Suja, Honest Tea and Zico Coconut Water. In the case of Honest Tea and Zico, these investments eventually led to an outright acquisition. PepsiCo bought a 90 percent stake in tea drink SoBe in 1999 before buying the entire company a year later. Still, it is not clear Dr. Pepper will follow in Coke's footsteps. In its conference call after releasing second-quarter 2015 results, Dr. Pepper's CFO, Marty Ellen, voiced wariness of an outright acquisition of Bai. "To acquire them would be just too expensive, and we are not sure the right thing to do in terms of the amount of money it would actually take to own all these businesses," Ellen said. One of the largest acquisitions of an upstart beverage brand was Coke's $4.1 billion purchase of Vitaminwater-maker Glaceau in 2007. Though lauded by analysts at the time as a way for Coke to expand its portfolio of health products, Coke last year agreed to change the wording on labels amid claims the drinks had overstated health benefits.

REUTERS/Mike Segar JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) on Monday said it was launching a global government bond index that will offer fund managers higher potential yields by including a larger percentage of emerging market bonds than traditional global bond indexes. The index is called the JPM GBI aggregate diversified fund and is made up of both investment grade and high yield bonds, with an allocation of 80 percent developed market and 20 percent emerging market bonds. Global bond indexes typically only comprise about 2 to 4 percent emerging market bonds because certain countries are excluded based on credit ratings. JPMorgan said the new index is 94 percent comprised of investment grade credits with an average index rating of Aa3/AA-/AA- by Moody’s, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, respectively. "This split is a better reflection of both outstanding debt stock in the global investable landscape and the increasing economic contribution of EM countries to global GDP," said Gloria Kim, head of J.P. Morgan Global Index Research Group, in a statement. The allocation to the G3 currencies - the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - totals only 57 percent of the fund, as compared to 85 percent to 90 percent in traditional global government bond indices, analysts said. The index has a weighted average yield of 1.35 percent, Kim said in the statement, and managers at JPMorgan see it as one of their "flagship" indices for the coming years. The index does not exclude countries based on credit ratings but does exclude countries with capital controls. JPMorgan offers around 20 benchmark indices. Its other flagship products include the JPMorgan EMBI index and GBI-emerging markets index. (Reporting by Dion Rabouin; Editing by Andrew Hay) Next In Business News Can Trump make coal great again?

Good morning! We’re here today to reflect and build on five years of a project that many of you in this room know well: the Global Cities Initiative. We at Brookings, and many of you, have burned a lot of airplane miles—maybe earned some elite airline statuses—as a result of your participation in GCI.  So, I want to thank you for coming here to Washington. It’s the first time we are bringing together leaders from across the Global Cities network. Nearly 40 U.S. and international cities are here today as well as other fellow travelers who have participated in this important work. I have to admit: I’m simply humbled by the sea of change that has occurred as a result of GCI. Brookings scholars brought you research, roundtables, advice, and peer-to-peer learning opportunities. In turn, you have changed the field of urban practice. When we started more than five years ago, no metropolitan area had a comprehensive trade and investment strategy. Now, more than two dozen cities are implementing one. When we started, city leaders, firms and institutions were hyper-insular – at least in the U.S. – just focusing on doing business within our domestic borders. Today, global trade has become an essential part of regional economic development’s DNA. And when we started, cities and suburbs competed for jobs, luring firms away from their neighbors next door. Today… well, that’s a work in progress. But cities and their surrounding counties are working together, emphasizing helping existing businesses grow through new markets. The irony now is that all this energy and progress comes amidst a new environment: growing skepticism about global trade, concerns about immigrants and refugees, and pessimism about a slow-growing world economy. So this summit comes at an important inflection point. How can cities deepen their efforts to be globally engaged and competitive while addressing head on the disparities and negative consequences that come with greater global integration? To set the conversation, we released a new book and two new reports. (We’re a think tank, after all!) The book, “Global Cities: A Short History,” is written by Brookings expert and tireless globetrotter Greg Clark. It explores the origins of world cities in history and discusses their challenges today. “The Making of Global Cities,” a new paper which I have co-authored with Rachel Barker and Marek Gootman, shares stories about how cities within the GCI network have adopted new approaches to become more global. And “Redefining Global Cities,” which is authored by my colleagues Jesus Trujillo and Joe Parilla, introduces a new typology of global cities based on extensive quantitative analysis of the largest metropolitan economies in the world. This morning, I’m going to talk about three things, building off of this body of work. First, I’ll discuss Brookings’ journey to understanding what it means to be a global city. Second, I’ll outline seven types of global cities that reflect the different paths to achieving global prosperity. Third, I’ll describe how our new typology of cities can inform future strategies to improve global growth and opportunity.  My presentation will be followed by two panel discussions that will further explore what’s next for global cities. To begin, what makes a global city? Global cities are not a new concept. Greg’s book traces the roots of global cities back to the beginnings of civilization. He finds that trade is a defining feature of global cities: for millennia, cities have been focal points for exchange of goods, ideas, capital, and people. But our story, as it relates to global cities, is a lot shorter than Greg’s Short History. Brookings Metro began studying global cities during the Great Recession. By 2009, the U.S. economy was in free fall, losing nearly seven and a half million jobs in just two years. Consumer demand and business spending were down. What was going to be the source of economic growth going forward? The answer was not to repeat the mistakes of the past – an economy driven by debt, consumption, and real estate. With the rise of the global middle class, we at Brookings realized that it was time for cities to embrace exports as an important ingredient for long-term, high-quality economic growth. Get daily updates from Brookings Enter Email Brookings began by examining the role that exports played in U.S. metropolitan economies. Our report, Export Nation, provided first-ever metro-level data on exports. Around the same time, President Obama introduced the National Export Initiative, a challenge to double America’s exports by 2014. Shortly thereafter, we created what we called the Metropolitan Export Initiative, which sought to tackle the President’s challenge from the bottom-up. Through MEI, we worked with leaders in four cities – Los Angeles, Portland, Syracuse, and Minneapolis-St. Paul – to apply our new research and pilot new strategies for metro-led export growth. Their experiences led to our report, 10 Steps to Delivering a Successful Metro Export Plan, to guide export planning in other cities. We were then pleased to find a partner in JPMorgan Chase who understood the power of cities to spur national economic recovery. With the support of JPMorgan Chase, we launched the Global Cities Initiative, which took this nascent idea to scale, broadening its reach to dozens of cities in the US and across the world. Author Amy Liu Vice President and Director - Metropolitan Policy Program Twitter amy_liuw Over the past five years, the Global Cities Initiative has convened leaders across six continents. From Jacksonville to Johannesburg, Santiago to Stockholm, Barcelona to Baltimore, we helped cities raise awareness about the importance of global trade and design strategies to bolster global competitiveness. In time, we realized that being a global city wasn’t simply about exports or FDI: to trade, cities needed innovation to create world-class products and services, a skilled workforce to deliver those solutions, and modern infrastructure to connect business travelers and goods to markets across the globe. Today, the work to deliver global growth and opportunity remains urgent.  Since 2009, jobs and productivity have grown, surpassing their pre-recession levels, but that growth remains sluggish. Meanwhile, wages have eroded for most Americans. Furthermore, the three forces that gave rise to global cities are also challenging cities’ path to inclusive growth. The first is urbanization. Cities are increasingly the places where global growth and economic opportunity reside. In 1950, fewer than 30 percent of the world’s residents lived in cities. By 2014, more than half of the world’s population lived in urban areas, and that share is expected to grow in the decades to come. Urbanization has led to the rise of the global middle class, connected rural workers to jobs, and raised living standards worldwide. However, how we manage urbanization will shape our ability to create opportunity for all. Urban infrastructure and housing supply often struggle to keep up with the influx of new migrants. 880 million people—or 30 percent of all urban residents in developing countries—live in informal housing. In the developed world, skyrocketing housing costs burden low- and middle-income urban residents. Globalization continues to move full speed ahead. It’s true that the growth of global trade has slowed in the past couple of years. But over the longer run, cross-border flows of goods, capital, and services have exploded and now amount to 39 percent of global GDP. International trade benefits consumers worldwide by lowering the costs of goods and services and increasing the availability of new products. It also opens new markets for firms, allowing companies to grow and pay higher wages. But, as this election cycle has reminded us, not all people and places share equally in the benefits of global trade. David Autor at MIT estimates that 2.4 million jobs, including 1 million manufacturing jobs, were lost in the United States in recent years due to import competition from China. Cities must explicitly help impacted communities and industries adjust and succeed. The third force is technology. In recent decades, technology has spurred the formation of global supply chains and connected businesses to each other and to consumers worldwide. Today, explosive new technologies, from cloud computing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and the internet of things, are generating massive new value in industries and creating good jobs in cities. But new technologies can also destroy firms and displace workers. As a recent McKinsey report found, 60 percent of all occupations are at risk of partial or complete automation. Meanwhile, the rise of the gig economy is complicating the definition of stable, full-time employment. What makes a global city? Ultimately, being a global city means being a globally competitive city. The Global Cities Initiative is no longer just a response to the Great Recession but a recognition that our cities must constantly adapt their policies and institutions in the face of rapid change to create growth and opportunity for our citizenry. To adapt effectively, cities must embrace the core drivers and enablers of competitiveness. Traded sectors are one driver of competitiveness: every metro area relies on a set of distinctive industries, especially advanced industries, that grow through trade, bringing wealth and income into a region. Another is innovation, such as applied research capabilities, new technologies, and a culture of entrepreneurship, which allows traded sectors to grow. The last is talent: metropolitan areas also need communities that steadily produce, attract, and retain workers with the skills to power those key sectors. Modern infrastructure and good governance enable competitive regional economies. They connect workers, suppliers, and customers together and create a climate of transparency and trust that fosters civic problem-solving. This brings me to my second point: All cities are global, but not in the same way. Our new report defines seven types of global cities based on how they perform on these core drivers and enablers of global competitiveness. To create this typology, we studied the world’s 123 largest metropolitan economies, nearly all of which have GDP exceeding $100 billion. These cities are economically significant: home to just 13 percent of the world’s population, they generate one-third of the world’s economic output. We then assessed how these cities performed on three categories of indicators: their economic characteristics, including the size of the economy, their industry mix, and their competitiveness factors. That assessment ultimately revealed seven types of global cities, each with their own distinctive roles in the global economy and pathways to future growth and prosperity. Let’s look at each of these seven city types in turn. First is Global Giants – including London, Paris, and Tokyo – represent the traditional notion of a global city.  These are large, highly sophisticated financial hubs of the world economy. Global Giants are set apart by the massive size of their economies, and their extensive global connectivity. New York, with a GDP of nearly $1.5 trillion and 192 million air travelers annually, is truly at the center of the world economy. Second, Asian Anchors – including Hong Kong, Beijing, and Seoul – serve as leading economic centers for the fastest-growing continent in the world. What makes this type most distinct is that they outpace all other cities on foreign investment.  With stable governance and the world’s most modern infrastructure systems, Asian Anchors are where international businesses go to establish operations in Asia. Singapore is a good example of an Asian Anchor: this city-state captured nearly $82 billion of foreign direct investment in 2015, the most among all global metros, and has the fastest internet download speeds in the world. Next up are Emerging Gateways – including Mumbai, Rio, and Santiago – which offer entry points to their nation’s economies. These 28 financial and political capitals have traded sectors that are on average four times more productive than their nation’s average. Yet compared to other global cities, they often fall behind on innovation. Mexico City is an Emerging Gateway: it has a very productive traded sector, but only 6.2 percent of its research papers are frequently cited, ranking just 105th out of the 123 global cities. Fourth, Factory China – including Chengdu, Nantong, and Wenzhou – represent China’s major manufacturing hubs. These cities are the fastest-growing economies in the world. But they are heavily dependent on production and have limited talent pools and innovative assets. Hefei is emblematic of a Factory China metro: its economy has grown nearly 15 percent each year since 2000, ranking first among all global cities. Yet only 12 percent of its adult population holds a college degree, placing the city near the bottom of global city rankings. Fifth, Knowledge Capitals – including Boston, San Francisco, and Stockholm – are economies bolstered by elite research institutions and industries which together create cutting-edge products and services. These cities often have an extremely well-educated and productive workforce, and boast some of the highest rates of scientific research, patents, and venture capital in the world. San Diego is a Knowledge Capital: its output per worker is 11th highest across the 123 metros, and it produces an average of over 5 patents per 1,000 persons each year, second-best among all cities. Next, American Middleweights – including Charlotte, Phoenix, and Kansas City – are mid-sized American metro areas, many of which have participated in the Global Cities Initiative. These cities are still trying to find their footing in the global economy. But they have valuable economic assets: each maintains at least one globally-relevant export industry, and many have elite research institutions that attract talent and contribute to innovation. Indianapolis is a good example of an American Middleweight. The metro area’s traded sectors are less productive than the U.S. average, ranking 109th out of 123 global cities. But over 14 percent of research papers coming out of Indy’s universities are among the most cited in their field, which is 42nd best among all global cities. Finally, International Middleweights – including Munich, Melbourne, and Montreal – are economies that, like their American counterparts, are seeking to leverage distinctive economic assets. These metros serve as gateways to smaller developed economies, and therefore have high rates of foreign investment. Unfortunately, many of them also have a growth challenge. Barcelona is an example of an International Middleweight. Its economy has grown only 1.2 percent annually since 2000, ranking 106th out of 123 global metros. But the city is also a destination not just for foreign travelers, but for foreign capital. With $3,400 of foreign investment per person in 2015, Barcelona ranks 8th among all global cities. There are of course many other cities beyond these 123, including cities represented by people in this room. We believe this typology helps all cities better understand how they fit into the global economy. So, what should a local leader takeaway from this typology?  First, all cities are globalizing. The world economy is hyper-connected because the firms and industries in cities are increasingly global. So the implication for metropolitan leaders is that their policies and strategies must embrace—not reject—this economic reality. Second, cities occupy distinctive niches in the global economy. Some cities are innovation hubs; others are centers of manufacturing. Some anchor the world’s largest economies, others are gateways to developing countries.  Cities can use this typology to find true peer groups for learning and economic exchange, and put global rankings in context.  Third, cities must continuously adapt to be globally competitive and inclusive.  Metro strategies must improve a region’s value-add in global supply chains while increasing the participation of people and communities in that growth. This brings me to the final section: how can cities increase their global competitiveness and create shared prosperity? Our new report compares each city type on key indicators of economic growth and their competitiveness assets. These data frame general strengths and challenges facing each type of global city, based on how they perform on each indicator. Let’s take a look at a few metros in the Global Cities network that are actively adapting to the unique global challenges they face. Global giants retain multiple advantages that have been built up over decades, even centuries. Yet, even Global Giants like London understand that no advantage lasts forever in a hyper-competitive global marketplace. Many Global Giants recognize that they need to continuously upgrade the competitiveness of their traded sectors, which are often middling in growth because of their size. For instance, London has been seeking to diversify its economy beyond its world-leading financial industry. Now in the wake of Brexit, that objective is even more urgent. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has an International Business Programme that provides mentoring and support to fast-growing London companies in technology, life sciences, and urban infrastructure to help them export and expand. Emerging Gateways are rapidly reaching middle-income status in their developing countries. But on a global scale, these cities still lag their more developed peers on key measures of innovation, such as scientific research and patents. Santiago exemplifies this dynamic. The city is trying to make the transition from an economy reliant on natural resources to one that generates value through knowledge and innovation. There has been a concerted effort of both the private and the public sector to support entrepreneurship, from Startup Chile to Ideas Factory —a unique combination of makers’ space, incubator, accelerator, and shared workspace. Santiago also recognizes the need to improve access to quality education, which, if left unaddressed, will perpetuate inequalities. American Middleweights, as I mentioned before, are wealthy by global standards, but continue to seek a new identity to break out on the global stage – and doing so requires strengthening their tradable sectors. In Columbus, Ohio, Columbus 2020, the region’s economic development organization—in coordination with the Mayor’s office and the business community—has launched a global trade and investment strategy. With a diverse economy, the metro’s leaders are boosting their existing specializations by helping each become more trade-intensive. They are re-orienting economic development away from business attraction and towards a stronger relationship with existing firms. Their efforts have led to a more strategic and demand-driven approach to workforce development, export sales abroad, and inbound foreign investment. Let me close with this quote from Nobel Prize economist Joseph Stiglitz: “The problem is not globalization, but how the process of globalization is being managed.” The leaders we have had the pleasure to work with are better prepared than ever to manage this process. Rather than be bystanders to global change, many of you are proactively shaping it. You know the needs of your leading industries. You know how global forces are putting pressure on them to digitize and innovate, and how that translates to demand for different kinds of skills. You may have learned about new industry opportunities that inspired you to bring different firms and sectors together to co-create new products.  This newfound global awareness is empowering you to solve problems, collaborate, and create the local conditions for firms and workers to be part of global success. Indeed, there is more work we must to do ensure that global competitiveness results in opportunities for all. But if the last five years are any indication, cities will rise to the challenge and lead the way. Thank you for a tremendous journey, and we look forward to more collaboration with you in the months and years to come.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search JPMorgan Analyst Says Fed Might Need to Buy Stocks Next October 3, 2016 6:29am NYSE:DIA NYSE:SPY ShareTweet From Tyler Durden: Just a few days after Janet Yellen and Larry Summers advocated for the Federal Reserve to buy equities, now a prominent JPMorgan analyst has joined the short but growing list of people in favor of nationalizing the stock market. During her latest testimony in Congress, when asked by rep Mick Mulvaney if the Fed has considered buying equities, Janet Yellen had a cryptic, yet open to interpretation answer: “the Federal Reserve is not permitted to purchase equities. We can only purchase U.S. treasuries and agency securities. I did mention in a speech in Jackson Hole, though, where I discussed longer term issues and difficulties we could have in providing adequate monetary policy. Accommodation may be somewhere in the future, down the line that this is the kind of thing that Congress might consider.” Then, the very next day, during a video conference Q&A, Yellen once again unexpectedly latched on to the topic of the Fed buying stocks, saying that “the idea of expanding into areas like equities might be “good thing to think about,” noting that (for now) The Fed is more restricted in which assets it can purchase than other central banks. If we found, I think as other countries did, that they could reach the limits in terms of purchasing safe assets like longer-term government bonds, it could be useful to be able to intervene directly in assets where the prices have a more direct link to spending decisions.” Assets such as equities. Then, jumping on to the idea of nationalizing the stock market, none other than the world’s most farcical former econopundit, Larry Summers, who has plunged to such recent depths he has to retweet himself on Twitter to get page views for his blog, “floated the idea of continuous purchases of stocks as a potential ingredient in a recipe for the developed world to strengthen economies struggling with subdued growth and inflation.” Cited by Bloomberg, Summer said that among the proposals that deserve “serious reflection” is the purchase of a “wider range of assets on a sustained and continuing basis,” Summers said in a lecture at a Bank of Japan conference in Tokyo Friday. “I’m not prepared to make a policy recommendation at this point,” he told reporters later. It got even funnier when Summers said that “there are obviously important political and economic questions associated with government ownership of companies,” adding that “some critics could term such a policy as “socialism, while others could highlight that governments already buy stocks in other ways, such as in the U.S. for federal employee pension funds.” Still others could term such a policy as utter idiocy, because once a price-indiscriminate entity is unleashed on stocks directly and legally (as opposed to the current framework whereby the Fed merely intervenes by way of its HFT proxy, Citadel, at key inflection points to break selling momentum), it is game over for price discovery and for the concept of capitalism. However, one would not find JPM among the “others.” In a note released on Friday, the otherwise serious commentator Nick Panigirtzoglou, author of the closely followed “Flows and Liquidity” weekly publication, when discussing the limits of QE – a topic prominently touched upon by Bridgewater this past week, said the following: How big are the QE capacity constraints facing central banks? One of the arguments put forward by some in explaining the BoJ’s shift away from QE to yield targeting is for the BoJ to avoid finding itself in the same position as the ECB is currently: i.e. facing a QE cliff at a not too distant point in the future. We believe that QE constraints are rather artificial. One of the channels via which QE operates is via bolstering the capacity of debt capital markets. Indeed, this year’s big increase in spread product supply coincided with more QE by the ECB and the BoJ relative to the previous year. More bond issuance not only implies more credit creation, helping the economy, but also more QE capacity allowing central banks to purchase more assets in the future. But QE need not be confined to bond instruments in our mind. By limiting themselves to bonds, central banks are indeed deemed to face quantitative constraints given declining government bond issuance even as spread product issuance has increased. This year’s purchases by the ECB, BoJ and the BoE account for 75% of total net bond issuance globally excluding EM local debt. And there you have it: first, a central banker, then a still somewhat prominent (if recently discredited) economist, and now a respected sell-side analyst, have all jumped on the “Fed should buy equities” bandwagon. We point this out just because it increasingly appears that the Fed is launching trial balloons at what its next, emergency policy may be at a time when the US central bank should, according to experts, be getting ready to hike rates. Which is why, something tells us that the market’s 59% odds of a December rate hike as of December will be, as usually, dramatically wrong.

But few are as reliant on this business - be it swapping currencies, selling bonds or structuring derivatives - as Deutsche Bank, the giant lender that has made its name not as a home for German savers but as a place for hedge funds and other risk-loving investors to put on some of their boldest financial bets.

And that is why its swooning stock price last week set off alarm bells in finance ministries, central bank suites and trading floors from Hong Kong to New York. More than eight years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent shock waves around the world, the fear is whether Deutsche Bank and its highly leveraged balance sheet of €1.6 trillion ($2.3 trillion) might teeter and set off another bout of financial contagion. Related Content It's not just Deutsche. European banking is utterly broken Deutsche Bank settlement could help Australian stocks Those worries calmed down somewhat late last week as Deutsche Bank's shares rose after reports that the bank may be close to cutting a deal with the US Justice Department regarding the fine it must pay for selling toxic mortgages during the financial crisis. 'Strong fundamentals' There has also been a growing realisation that Deutsche Bank, even with its thin cushion of cash, is in much better financial shape than Lehman Brothers was. In a letter to employees on Friday, Deutsche's chief executive, John Cryan, highlighted the "strong fundamentals" of the bank. Advertisement It has €220 billion ($323 billion) in ready liquidity, compared with $US45 billion ($59 billion) for Lehman in 2007, and the bank can also tap central banks in the United States and in Europe for a financial lifeline if need be. That does not mean, however, that traders and regulators will stop fretting about, among other things, the €42 trillion of derivatives that sit on its books, an amount about the size of the German economy. The market value of that figure, €18 billion, is a lot lower, but as a headline sum it still scares. In a letter to employees on Friday, Deutsche's chief executive, John Cryan, highlighted the "strong fundamentals" of the bank. Photo: AP More than all other universal banks - those institutions that collect deposits and also have investment banking businesses - Deutsche Bank has cultivated bankers with an expertise in conceiving of, promoting and trading some of the most cutting-edge financial instruments around. Its past leader, Anshu Jain, came to the firm in the 1990s from Merrill Lynch and rose to the top through his success in selling derivatives to hedge funds. Long before he became co-chief executive in 2012, Jain and a loyal cadre of like-minded bankers and traders consolidated power in London (the bank's headquarters are in Frankfurt), where they established the bank as a behemoth in the markets. 'Fragile equation' Deutsche Bank became one of the few banks large and aggressive enough to put its capital at risk by trading and housing derivatives, securitised mortgages and credit default swaps for those who wanted to deal in them. "What makes Deutsche Bank systemic is their sheer size combined with the leverage that is required to stay in the flow and be an intermediary," said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr, an expert in the structure of financial markets at TABB Group, a consulting firm. "But as capital becomes more scarce, this becomes a fragile equation." A simple calculation bears this out. Deutsche Bank has €67 billion in equity that supports assets of €1.6 trillion, which mean it is levered at a ratio of 25 to 1. By comparison, JPMorgan has $US224 billion in cash backing $US2.4 trillion in assets, which produces a far healthier ratio of 9 to 1. Making Deutsche Bank's ratio more troubling is that many of these assets are of the most illiquid variety, called Level 3 securities, for which establishing a price is guesswork and finding a buyer near impossible. According to the last annual report, Level 3 assets stood at €32 billion - about half the amount of the bank's equity buffer, although that figure has come down sharply in recent years. To get a better sense of how these types of assets ended up on its balance sheet, it is worth taking a closer look at the professional make-up of Deutsche Bank's investment bank. In good times this unit of the bank drove its profits. It was also the investment bank that was largely responsible for the $US7.5 billion in losses that Deutsche Bank showed last year. Because of new European Union regulations, Deutsche Bank is required to disclose the number of those who take significant risks with the bank's capital and how much they are paid. Risk takers Last year, the bank reported that its investment bank employed 1871 so-called material risk takers, or MRTs as they have come to be known in European regulatory circles, who were paid €1.7 billion. That was down from a year earlier, when 2057 MRTs took home €2 billion. Stuart Graham, a banking analyst with Autonomous Research in London, says Deutsche Bank has more high-paid risk takers than any other bank - including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse. Barclays, a long-time Deutsche rival, is also a deposit-taking bank that relies on traders to increase revenues. But the British bank reports having just 842 maximum risk takers in its investment bank. While this culture of making big bets with the bank's cash may have worked in a previous era, in today's market, where a premium is placed on managing risk as opposed to taking it, such an aptitude becomes a liability. So, even though Deutsche Bank may have a €220 billion cash cushion, it is this unknown liability that is causing some investors to play it safe and ask for their money back. "If you are a counterparty, you have to trim back exposure as fast as you can," said David Hendler, a credit analyst with Viola Risk Advisors. Capital raising Most analysts believe Deutsche Bank needs to raise an extra €5 billion to €7 billion from investors in order to calm concerns about its financial health, especially in light of the fact that the Justice Department may require the firm to pay a penalty of at least this amount. But there are a few who think that for Deutsche Bank to be able to survive a crisis-like atmosphere, it needs a lot more money than that. Robert Engle, an economist at New York University who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on volatility and capital markets, has designed a model that ranks financial institutions in terms of their systemic risk. The barometer takes into consideration leverage, the bank's stock price and its equity base, and as such it represents a real-time measure of the dangers a bank poses to the financial system at a given moment in time. Global regulators use it as well to complement their own internal models. Risk ranking As of now, Deutsche Bank is ranked top among European banks in terms of risk, requiring close to €100 billion in fresh cash to ensure that it could survive a sustained sell-off in the markets. Other European banks, like BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, rank closely behind Deutsche Bank in this regard. What sets Deutsche Bank apart from its European and American peers is its reliance on debt, the NYU model shows. Since September, the bank's risk, calculated on the basis of its leverage, has increased sharply relative to other comparable institutions, according to the NYU gauge. "There is just a lot of risk for Deutsche Bank right now," Engle said. "We have been worried about European banks for quite a while."

REUTERS/David Gray/File PhotoMore WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leading U.S. banks on Tuesday submitted updated "living wills" to regulators who must decide whether Wall Street firms can be unwound without taxpayer help or should be broken up. Eight of the largest banks handed in paperwork on how they would be dissolved in a crisis to the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp before those regulators pass judgment in the months ahead. The eventual ruling from regulators could be definitive for Wall Street, said John Simonson, a former FDIC supervisor. "This is an existential matter for leading banks," said Simonson, now with PricewaterhouseCoopers. "The issue has the attention at the highest level of these banks." In April, five banks were told that their living wills fell short. JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N>, Bank of America Corp <BAC.N>, State Street Corp <STT.N> and Bank of New York Mellon Corp<BK.N> were given until this month to revise their plans. The Fed and FDIC may issue a grade for those banks before the end of the year, Simonson said, though the entire banking sector will hear from regulators next summer. Any leading bank that cannot present a living will faces costly penalties and could be set on a course for a breakup within two years. In documents released on Tuesday, banks detailed how they planned to remedy problems regulators had identified earlier this year. For instance, JPMorgan said it had "meaningfully simplified" the way it funds entities within the company, especially those based in the U.K. Funding foreign subsidiaries during a time of crisis became an important issue after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, whose U.K. trading business created funding problems. Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> said it had increased staff devoted to resolution planning. The bank also put a senior executive in charge of that office, which now reports directly to the chief financial officer.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, State Street, and Bank of New York Mellon were required by regulators to submit revised “living wills” after their plans were rejected in April. The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation made public portions of the resolution plans but have not yet made any decisions on whether to accept the new living wills. ADVERTISEMENT “Neither the confidential nor the public portions of the resolution plans have yet been reviewed by the agencies, which will now begin initiating their process for review,” they said. The regulators also published documents from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup, whose plans were accepted in April but needed updates showing how to improve weaknesses. The living wills are part of the sweeping rules put in place after the financial crisis under the Dodd-Frank Act. The plans are aimed at preventing government bailouts like those seen in 2008. If the Fed and the FDIC determine that a resolution plan isn't credible or wouldn't facilitate an orderly wind down of operations, they can subject a bank to additional capital requirements. In its revised plan, JPMorgan said it has taken steps to show how it would be able to wind down its derivatives and trading portfolios by providing the regulators with a detailed analysis. In its new living will, Wells Fargo said it addressed certain concerns from the regulators by ramping up executive and senior management oversight of the resolution planning process.

Published on October 04, 2016. Advertising Age Player Paperless banking might be easy, but that doesn't mean everyone knows how to do it. In an effort to woo consumers to the digital side, JPMorgan Chase has tapped the Holderness family, which is known for a bevy of social media videos dating back to a "Christmas Jammies" digital card in 2013 that went viral. The family has signed on with Chase for a total of 10 how-to videos to promote the ease of mobile or online banking. "These videos are hilarious and people will have fun watching them, but they also help us solve a business problem," said Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer at Chase, in a statement. Though more Chase customers are using mobile technology than a year ago, the bank found that many customers are still visiting a brick-and-mortar branch or phoning customer service for help. The new video series, four of which debuted Tuesday, include a 75-second overview as well as tackle more specific issues, like paying bills or depositing checks. "We knew we had to do something different to show people how [to do things themselves]," said Ms. Lemkau. "We didn't want to do a boring animation." In the spot, Mr. Holderness raps about the hardship of going to a Chase branch and missing out on family time. "Didn't need to drive here, could be home with cold beer. I should have 'apped' it, now I'm stuck in traffic," he laments. Chase will release three more videos in two weeks before unveiling the final three at the end of October. This is the first time the brand, which produced the series internally without any agency involvement, has used social media stars on such a scale, said a spokesman. Chase will promote the effort via its social channels.

To foster transparency, the agencies required all of the firms to file a public portion of their targeted submissions. In April of this year, the agencies jointly determined that each of the 2015 resolution plans of Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, State Street, and Wells Fargo was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the standard established in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As such, the agencies issued joint letters to these firms detailing the deficiencies in their plans and the actions the firms must take to address them. The agencies required these five firms to remediate their deficiencies by October 1, 2016, and file a targeted submission to the agencies detailing the remediation. If a firm has not remediated the identified deficiencies, it may be subject to more stringent prudential requirements. The agencies jointly identified weaknesses in the 2015 resolution plans of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup that the firms must address in their 2017 plans. These firms were also required to file a targeted submission by October 1, 2016, detailing the efforts taken to improve their weaknesses. The Dodd-Frank Act requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) for supervision by the Federal Reserve to periodically submit resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and FDIC. Each plan must describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company. Under the authority granted to the agencies in Section 165(d), if any of the five firms that received a joint notice of deficiencies did not adequately remediate those deficiencies, the agencies, acting jointly, may impose more stringent prudential requirements on the firm until it remediates them. The prudential requirements may include more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, as well as restrictions on growth, activities, or operations of the firm, or its subsidiaries. If, following a two-year period beginning on the date of the imposition of such requirements, a firm still has failed to adequately remediate any deficiencies, the agencies, in consultation with the FSOC, may jointly require the firm to divest certain assets or operations to facilitate an orderly resolution of the firm in bankruptcy. The agencies are posting the public portions of the targeted submissions, as provided by the firms, on the FDIC and Board websites. Neither the confidential nor the public portions of the resolution plans have yet been reviewed by the agencies, which will now be initiating their process for review.

Belvedere | @Matt_Belvedere Tuesday, 4 Oct 2016 | 3:51 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Spencer Platt | Getty Images U.S. stocks are not all that cheap at these levels, Samantha Azzarello, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds, told CNBC on Tuesday. "If the market retrenches 5 to 10 percent, we would think of that as the market being on sale, because longer run we still like equities," Azzarello said on "Squawk on the Street." She added it looks like the earnings recession bottomed in the first quarter. "[But] the need to be selective is more relevant than ever," Azzarello said, warning market leadership appears to be ready to shift from defensive stocks to cyclicals, as the Federal Reserve prepares to hike interest rates. She believes the Fed will increase rates before the end of the year for the second time in the past decade. Another reason for short-term caution, according to Azzarello, is "volatility." She also sees "sub-trend growth" as a "big scare" for investors to watch for down the road. "Central banks, for everything they try, can't change weak aggregate demand and subdued business confidence [and] low commodity prices. Not even fiscal stimulus can fix that. That's more of a wait and see, and that's a little bit scarier," she explained. Fiscal stimulus looks like it's on the way, Azzarello said. "Both candidates look like they're making the case." "But at the same time, if you look at debt levels, there is not room to do a lot of fiscal stimulus," she said. "I don't think it would be enough to make the market happy compared to what central banks were able to do." Matthew J.

This month, historically, has earned a formidable reputation of providing dismal returns ahead of elections, while concerns about Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (DB) have rattled the financial markets. Meanwhile, uncertainties surrounding the Fed rate hike coupled with high valuations are expected to aggravate concerns. To overcome the market adversities, it will be judicious to invest in stocks that boast strong fundamentals and are less volatile than the broader markets. Election to Spur Volatility Elections traditionally lead to stock market volatility and it won’t be any different this time around. According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac, which dates back to 1950, the S&P 500 averages a decline of 0.7% and the Dow industrials averages a 0.8% drop. The performance of the more-volatile indices like the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 is worse, with an average setback of over 2%. The head-to-head between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is quite a close one. Ahead of the first U.S. presidential debate, Trump took a two-point lead over Clinton, but it was Clinton who held an edge over Trump in the first presidential debate by displaying a better degree of preparedness on matters concerning public policy, defense and tax reform (read more: 3 Stocks to Watch after Hillary Clinton’s Debate Performance). VIX to Rise The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, has always risen from the month of September to October, except for 1996, when Bill Clinton handily won the re-elections. Thanks to such increasing uncertainty, some of the imminent strategists had already expressed their concerns.  Here are some of their comments: From JPMorgan Chase strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas: “2016 election will likely be a source of heightened volatility in the weeks ahead of November 8th.” From David Kostin and colleagues at Goldman Sachs: “Equity market uncertainty typically rises in the month immediately ahead of presidential elections, and we believe the current below-average level of uncertainty is unlikely to persist.” From Mandy Xu and colleagues at Credit Suisse: “Historically, we find that elections have been a meaningful driver of equity volatility.” Deutsche Bank Adds to Woes More uncertainty looms large this month as Deutsche Bank’s woes continue to spook investors.  The German lender endured questions like whether it was losing the confidence of investors after a handful of hedge funds that clear derivatives through the bank withdrew excess cash and positions. Shares of Deutsche Bank tanked to fresh lows, only to rebound on September  30 and end the week at a gain of 1.4%. Reports continued to circulate that the bank may be able to negotiate a less-onerous settlement with the Justice Department than the $14-billion figure being discussed earlier. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had already refused to offer state aid to the giant lender. 7 Stock Charts to Watch in October Nonetheless, shares of the lender plunged more than 50% this year as investors remain worried about the institution’s thin capital cushion. Such a decline affected other European banks, already plagued by Eurozone’s weak economy and negative interest rates. Fed Rate Hike Dilemma, Stretched Valuations September jobs data is due on Oct 7. The outcome can also help shape market perception in the coming weeks. A December rate hike is more likely, but, if the jobs data turn out to be mediocre like the August one, it might indicate that the domestic economy is in a tight spot. Lest we forget, a slew of discouraging retail sales reports, pending home sales and manufacturing numbers seem to hint at sluggish growth. The market is already in a precarious situation, as most analysts warn that stock market valuations are at elevated levels. This makes the market more vulnerable to a volatile sell-off. The S&P 500’s forward 12-month P/E ratio is currently at around 16.6, way above the 5-year average of over 14.8. It is also worth noting that earnings are not just lackluster, they are negative. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be down 2.8% in the third quarter from the same quarter last year (read more: Q3 Earnings Season Preview). Torrid Times Ahead? 5 Solid Picks Amid such uncertainties, it seems sensible to buy stocks that are fundamentally strong and will continue to do business even in the worst of times. Investors should also build a strategy on low risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing so is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. We have selected five such stocks that boast of a VGM score of ‘A’. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. Such stocks also have a beta that ranges from 0 to 1. Also, these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
