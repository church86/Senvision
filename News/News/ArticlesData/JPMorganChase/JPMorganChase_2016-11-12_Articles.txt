In recent years, bank stocks have been held back by heavy regulation and historically low interest rates which have sapped the earnings potential of their massive cash holdings. But optimism about the sector’s outlook is growing. Interest rates are rising and investors are betting that Trump will follow through on his campaign promise to review the increased number of regulations put on the banking system after it nearly keeled over in the 2008 financial crisis. The S&P 500 bank subsector rose 10.2 per cent in the three days following Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. This was the index’s best three-day performance since August 2009. In those three days, Wells Fargo Co shares rose 13.6 per cent, JPMorgan Chase & Co climbed 9.5 per cent and Bank of America gained 11.9 per cent. Some investors and analysts watching banks say the stocks are likely not near the end of their run. “They are not close to being expensive yet,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. The S&P 500 banks are currently trading at about 11.2 times forward earnings estimates as a group, up from about nine times in February, when the index hit its lowest since May 2013. Valuation is still well off peak levels of over 33 times earnings estimates in May of 2009, though it trades near levels seen between 2002 and 2008, before many current regulations were put in place. If rates continue to rise and the Trump administration gives some clarity on how regulations will change, then bank valuations “certainly can move higher,” Piper Jaffray analyst Kevin Baker said. Baker stopped short of giving a specific P/E estimate but he pointed to the higher valuations of banks that are not designated as systemically important financial institutions, commonly referred to as “too big to fail”. Today, the minimum asset threshold for too-big-to-fail designated banks is US$50 billion (RM219.5 billion). If this threshold is lifted to US$250 billion in a regulatory overhaul it would give a lot more flexibility that could likely boost valuations of banks operating in that range, Baker said. Valuations for too-big-to-fail designated banks are at around 12.5 times forward earnings compared with multiples of 13 to 15 for banks outside of this category, according to Baker. Ed Keon, managing director and portfolio manager of QMA, a multi-asset manager owned by Prudential Financial, said he has been buying into the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, the ETF that tracks the S&P financial sector, in the last couple of weeks. He is betting on higher interest rates and a pick-up in economic growth. The potential for lighter regulation added to his enthusiasm for the sector. “Of course, no one yet knows exactly what policy changes will occur and exactly how much they will help profits, but I think the benefit might be solid enough that I am maintaining my overweight holdings in the sector,” Keon said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles Wall Street week ahead eyes Alphabet possibly toppling Apple from its perch Jobs report may test Wall St complacency Don’t leave small-cap stocks for dead Wall Street week ahead: Spring fever brings hope for US earnings Stocks face earnings blues after tech slide Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Ken Sweet Leave a comment 28 reads THASUNDA DUCKETT             NEW YORK (AP)— Thasunda Duckett became the CEO of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer banking division in late September, becoming the first African American to hold that job at the nation’s largest bank by assets. Duckett, a mother of four, spoke to The Associated Press about how she started her career and what role she tries to fill as a mentor and how she tries to balance work and personal life in her new job. Q: How’d you get your start in banking? I got into banking through a program called Inroads. It’s a program that prepares minorities for corporate and community leadership. Honestly, when I think about where I am today, I would say that being a part of Inroads was and still is one of the most impactful professional moments in my life. If you talk to successful minorities, specifically African Americans, you’ll be surprised how many are Inroads alums. It really is a special program. My career started at Fannie Mae, which Inroads helped me get. I grew up in the company and really believed in the mission of making home ownership affordable and accessible but I wanted to be closer to the customer. I joined JPMorgan in 2004 doing a lot of work around affordable lending and minority home ownership programs. Q: As an African American woman, what advice would you give to young women, particularly young African American women, who are just starting their careers? For me, I understand that I am on the shoulders of giants. To whom much is given, much is required. It is humbling to be in the position I’m in. But I go back to things that my parents instilled in me when I was younger: I knew there is no challenge I can’t overcome. I want everyone to be proud of themselves. I think it’s beautiful to be me, to be a woman, to be Black, to be born in New York and raised in Texas because that is who I am. I tell women or other minorities to be confident in who you are and know that you do belong. I also tell a lot of the people I speak to: don’t own someone else’s bias and negativity. Don’t subscribe to that. That’s not who you are. Q: What does your typical day look like? There is no typical day, but I would say one of my constants is I work hard to make sure I see my kids before I leave in the morning. One of my special mommy moments, if you will, is my daughter Madison will make my coffee and she will write me a little note on my coffee for me to read on my way to work on the train. That is really special to me. At work, my days are like any other executive. But I try to talk to as many employees as possible to know the business from all levels. When I was made CEO of Auto, one of the first things I did was meet with the guys in the mailroom. I don’t think they’ve ever had a CEO in the mailroom. The reason why I did that is, one, to say thank you and help them understand the role that they play in delivering customer experience. If a customer puts the wrong address on an envelope and it doesn’t post on time that creates a bad customer experience. I wanted them to know how important their job was. I do also spend a lot of time mentoring people. People that want to see how great of a company this is and what type of career mobility there is here. Q: You recently created a charity. Can you tell us about it? It’s called the Otis and Rosie Brown Foundation, named after my parents. What we do is we give scholarships based on character and often seed local organizations or individuals that are making an impact. Think about those unsung heroes in our community and to be able to shine that light on them and say “thank you.’’ The website is extraordinaryis.org.   Like us at https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Pittsburgh-Courier/143866755628836?ref=hl Follow @NewPghCourier on Twitter  https://twitter.com/NewPghCourier     Also On New Pittsburgh Courier: Red Carpet Rundown: 2016 Oscars 22 photos Launch gallery Red Carpet Rundown: 2016 Oscars 1.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Who thinks President-Elect Trump will be good for U.S. stocks? Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and the JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist known as 'Gandalf,' to name one high-profile pair. A Goldman team led by Equity Strategist Benjamin Snider highlighted the potential for corporate tax reform as a major tailwind for the financial performance of Corporate America. “Each percentage point change in the effective U.S. corporate tax rate is worth about $1.50 of 2017 S&P 500 earnings per share [EPS],” the team writes. “A change in the effective tax rate to 20 percent from the current 26 percent would boost our EPS forecast by 8 percent to $125." This would represent year-over-year growth of 20 percent, or double their current expectation. Appetite for U.S. stocks has been immense since the election. Two-day inflows into the SPDR S&P 500 exchange traded fund, the largest ETF by assets, hit their highest level in over a year on Thursday. After slumping as the election results started to roll in, the front-month S&P 500 futures contract jumped nearly 7 percent from trough to peak on Wednesday. Another benefit to U.S. stocks that Goldman sees is an increase in buybacks, also linked to changing tax policy under Trump. Historically, when there is a repatriation tax holiday like the one Trump discussed on the campaign trail, firms have used cash brought back from oversees for share repurchases, which has been a huge source of net demand for stocks throughout this bull market. JPM Global Head of Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy Marko Kolanovic, meanwhile, has long disagreed with the overwhelming consensus that a Trump victory would be negative for markets. But the extent of investor enthusiasm since the election has caught the strategist off guard. "The previously quoted (though often overblown) risks of Trump's presidency are now likely higher, not lower," writes Kolanovic, who was likened to the Lord of the Rings wizard after his prescient calls on related to the Chinese devaluation of 2015. "While we think that Trump’s win is medium-term positive for equities, we are not fully out of the woods yet."  At this point, the markets appear to have been more fixated on the aspects of a Trump presidency that could be positive for growth, like new infrastructure spending and tax reform, than the potentially detrimental aspects, like limits on immigration and trade protectionism. "As we advocated in our previously published research: emerging market assets, Commodities, Gold and Value stocks should outperform, and USD, Bond proxies and Quality should underperform," writes Kolanovic. "This long term trend, which is reinforced by Trump’s win, is ‘cautiously optimistic reflation,' rather than a ‘full risk on’ and ‘hawkish Fed’ trade." Goldman's team added that the bond market selloff could limit the extent to which stocks rise due to the regime change. “Historically low rates lifted U.S. equity valuations to near-record highs, and if risk-free rates continue to rise they may result in lower equity valuations,” concludes Snider.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

BUSINESS COMPANY TOWN Film financier and Wall Street executive Steven Mnuchin a leading candidate for Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin is a leading candidate for Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, 53, served as national finance chairman of Trump's campaign. Steven Mnuchin, 53, served as national finance chairman of Trump's campaign. Daniel Miller and James Rufus Koren Much of liberal Hollywood may be lamenting the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, but one prominent industry player could wind up getting a high-profile position in the new administration. Steven Mnuchin, 53, a wealthy Wall Street executive and successful film financier who served as the national finance chairman of Trump’s campaign, is widely considered one of the leading contenders to become the next Treasury secretary, along with Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), head of the House Committee on Financial Services, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Mnuchin, chief executive of New York-based hedge fund Dune Capital Management, spent 17 years early in his career at Goldman Sachs, where he was a partner and eventually chief information officer, before leaving in 2002. He then started an investment fund with billionaire investor George Soros, a prominent Hillary Clinton supporter, before co-founding Dune. Mnuchin, along with other investors, made a windfall after purchasing the failed bank IndyMac in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, and selling it for a substantial profit in 2015. In addition, Mnuchin has long been a financial backer of high-profile movies, most recently the August hit “Suicide Squad,” a dark comic book film from Warner Bros. that grossed nearly $750 million worldwide. Via Dune, Mnuchin has cut slate financing deals with 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. over the years, leading to his executive producing credits on several critical and commercial hits, including “American Sniper” and “Mad Max: Fury Road.”  But some of his business associations have been controversial, including dealings with the once high-flying film and TV studio Relativity Media and OneWest Bank, which he and others created out of the assets of IndyMac. Mnuchin, a divorced father of three children, owns a $26.5 million mansion in Bel Air and previously lived at New York’s 740 Park Avenue, a tony cooperative apartment building, according to public records and news reports. In 2011, the lawn of his 22,000-square-foot L.A. residence was the site of demonstrations by dozens of “Make Banks Pay” activists, including a foreclosed homeowner whose loan was serviced by OneWest, which had drawn scrutiny for its eviction tactics.

As president, he could quickly reshape it Jim Puzzanghera and Don Lee Donald Trump leveled unprecedented criticism at the Federal Reserve during the campaign.

As president, he could get to quickly reshape it — and the economic conditions that central bank policymakers will be facing. Trump will have the opportunity to appoint as many as five new members to the seven-person... (Jim Puzzanghera and Don Lee) Mnuchin, who was named Friday to Trump’s Presidential Transition Team, did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to requests for comment. Few people in the entertainment industry whose business has intersected with Mnuchin were willing to speak about him after Tuesday’s election. Those that would talk about Mnuchin described him as smart, savvy and serious.  Jon Landau, who produced Fox’s “Avatar,” got to know Mnuchin during the making of the blockbuster 2009 film, which the businessman helped finance. Typical of a financier, Mnuchin did not have a hands-on role in the making of the movie, Landau said. But in their limited dealings Mnuchin was a “smart, personable guy.”   “He has certainly proven himself in the business world,” said Landau, who has attended Los Angeles Lakers games with Mnuchin over the years. Entertainment industry attorney Peter Dekom, who had a preliminary meeting about a prospective film financing pact with Mnuchin earlier this year, said he “understands the finance side of Hollywood as well as anyone.” But unlike many in Hollywood, Mnuchin is said to avoid the limelight. Lionel Chetwynd, a filmmaker who co-founded Friends of Abe, a group for Hollywood conservatives, called Mnuchin “a very sober individual.” He said he’d met the financier at black-tie functions over the years. “He’s not Mark Cuban,” said Chetwynd, referring to the flamboyant billionaire investor. “There are people who operate in Hollywood but who do so in a very pristine manner, who don’t show up every night at the right restaurants, and he would be one of those. Not flashy people, but very solid business people whose interests stretch very far beyond movies and movie stars.” Mnuchin has East Coast pedigree. The Yale University graduate grew up in a powerful New York family: He is the son of Robert Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who became a prominent Manhattan art gallerist, and the late Elaine Cooper, a former vice president of the International Directors Council of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. And Mnuchin’s brother, Alan, worked at Goldman Sachs and Lehman Bros. before founding his own investment advisory firm, AGM Partners. Despite Mnuchin’s New York business credentials, one of his most notable financial bonanzas came via a regional commercial bank based in sleepy Pasadena. Mnuchin and other wealthy investors, including Michael Dell and a hedge fund run by Soros, bought failed IndyMac in March 2009, putting up about $1.6 billion in cash and renaming it OneWest Bank. Investors bought the bank’s assets at a bargain price, and also arranged a deal whereby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which had seized the savings and loan in mid-2008, agreed to cover as much as 75% of the losses from IndyMac’s already discounted loan portfolio. The FDIC often agrees to such deals when trying to sell a failed lender, but bank analyst Bert Ely said the insurer gave Mnuchin’s group a particularly sweet deal. “It was certainly richer than average,” he said of the arrangement, describing it as a combination of good deal-making by Mnuchin and bad decision-making by the FDIC. The insurer, Ely said, seemed keen on keeping IndyMac an independent institution and did not want to sell it to another big bank. “I’m certainly not going to be critical of Mnuchin,” Ely added. “He took advantage of what I think was a bad policy decision by the FDIC. The deal was as sweet as it was because the FDIC limited the field of potential acquirers.” Mnuchin and other investors sold OneWest to New Jersey lender CIT Group last year for $3.4 billion. The deal was delayed — and nearly derailed — by complaints about OneWest’s foreclosure practices. As part of its arrangement with the FDIC, Mnuchin’s group had agreed to participate in a mortgage-modification program, but community groups charged that the bank was aggressive when it came to foreclosing on homeowners. The California Reinvestment Coalition, which pushes banks to offer fair and equal access to credit, claimed that the bulk of OneWest’s estimated 35,000 foreclosures took place in minority communities and that the bank was notoriously difficult when dealing with homeowners and housing counselors. It was alleged practices like those that drew the ire of the “Make Banks Pay” protesters who visited Mnuchin’s home. Regulators, too, went after OneWest’s foreclosure practices. In 2011, two years after Mnuchin’s group came in, the Office of Thrift Supervision hit the bank with a regulatory order saying it had failed to follow various procedures when foreclosing on homeowners. CIT Group did not respond to requests for comment. OneWest and Mnuchin also were embroiled in the saga of Relativity Media, the studio co-founded by flashy Hollywood executive Ryan Kavanaugh. Mnuchin had invested in the studio via Dune, and served as nonexecutive co-chairman of the board from October 2014 to May 2015, exiting just ahead of the company’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to documents from Relativity’s bankruptcy proceedings, OneWest, a lender to the studio, was repaid $50 million it lent to the company just before it filed for bankruptcy protection. A July 2015 filing by Relativity’s financial adviser at Blackstone Group, which was hired to advise the studio before its bankruptcy, said that this repayment exacerbated its “already problematic liquidity situation.” Adviser Timothy Coleman of Blackstone wrote in the filing that this caused Relativity to “largely have to stop paying many vendor bills, to postpone production of certain film projects, and to postpone the release of certain completed films.” Typically, bankruptcy courts look askance at large payments to one creditor shortly before filing for Chapter 11, because companies aren’t supposed to favor one creditor over another. Nonetheless, Relativity’s plan to reorganize its business was approved by a New York bankruptcy court judge in March, wiping hundreds of million of dollars of debt from its balance sheet.

Memoli) But the issue of the $50 million repayment also surfaced in a civil lawsuit filed by RKA Film Financing, an investor in Relativity, against Kavanaugh, Mnuchin and others. The case, which was filed in New York County Supreme Court and included allegations of fraud, claimed that money RKA lent to Relativity was used for purposes other than those it was earmarked for. The lawsuit alleged that at least some of RKA’s money was likely included in the funds paid to OneWest. The complaint, which was first filed last year and amended in March, claimed that Mnuchin “was in a unique position, affording him knowledge of both Relativity’s precarious financial position and the ability to ensure certain creditors — namely, OneWest Bank — were able to siphon away funds that had been commingled with RKA’s [money].” In separate June court filings, Kavanaugh and Mnuchin asked the court to throw out the case. It was dismissed Oct. 11 by Judge Charles Ramos, according to court documents. Ramos has given RKA, which sought damages of more than $110 million, the chance to replead the case. Mnuchin’s attorney, Robert Sacks, said that claims made about Mnuchin in the lawsuit were “preposterous.” He said that the contract between RKA and Relativity was entered into before Mnuchin invested in the studio, adding that RKA has “no basis whatsoever to assert a claim against Steve Mnuchin and they’ve articulated none.” Sacks dismissed RKA’s claim that Mnuchin’s connection to OneWest and Relativity uniquely situated him to ensure the bank was repaid ahead others. “The bank had whatever rights the bank had based on [having] provided funds to Relativity,” Sacks said. "Steve Mnuchin did not have a dual role with regard to that.” In a statement, Beverly Hills-based Relativity said it was pleased with Ramos’ Oct. 11 decision. But the dispute may not be over. Attorney Benjamin Naftalis, who represents RKA, said his client plans to soon file an amended complaint. “RKA has and will allege a fraud claim,” Naftalis said. “And Steve Mnuchin played an integral role in executing that fraud and misappropriating RKA’s investment to his and others’ benefit.” Mnuchin would be an out-of-the box choice for Treasury secretary, having neither served in government nor risen to the top ranks of corporate America. Treasury secretaries appointed by Barack Obama and George W. Bush all worked for the federal government at some point in their careers.  And the three secretaries appointed by Bush were all chief executives of major corporations. Henry Paulson, for example, worked in the Defense Department in the 1970s and was chief executive of Goldman Sachs before being named Treasury secretary.

Finance Search Mon, Nov 21, 2016, 5:44 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 4 hrs 16 mins Bank post-poll rally may be just appetizerAAP – Mon, Nov 14, 2016 9:51 AM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print The US banking sector's dramatic rally post election day is likely just a taste of bigger gains to come, as investors expect banks to reap huge benefits from rising interest rates and lighter regulation under a Donald Trump presidency. In recent years, bank stocks have been held back by heavy regulation and historically low interest rates which have sapped the earnings potential of their massive cash holdings. But optimism about the sector's outlook is growing. Interest rates are rising and investors are betting that Trump will follow through on his campaign promise to review the increased number of regulations put on the banking system after it nearly keeled over in the 2008 financial crisis. The S&P 500 bank subsector rose 10.2 per cent in the three days following Trump's victory in the US presidential election. This was the index's best three-day performance since August 2009. In those three days, Wells Fargo Co shares rose 13.6 per cent, JPMorgan Chase & Co climbed 9.5 per cent and Bank of America gained 11.9 per cent. Some investors and analysts watching banks say the stocks are likely not near the end of their run. "They are not close to being expensive yet," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. The S&P 500 banks are currently trading at about 11.2 times forward earnings estimates as a group, up from about nine times in February, when the index hit its lowest since May 2013. Valuation is still well off peak levels of over 33 times earnings estimates in May of 2009, though it trades near levels seen between 2002 and 2008, before many current regulations were put in place. If rates continue to rise and the Trump administration gives some clarity on how regulations will change, then bank valuations "certainly can move higher," Piper Jaffray analyst Kevin Baker said. Baker stopped short of giving a specific P/E estimate but he pointed to the higher valuations of banks that are not designated as systemically important financial institutions, commonly referred to as "too big to fail". Today, the minimum asset threshold for too-big-to-fail designated banks is $US50 billion. If this threshold is lifted to $US250 billion in a regulatory overhaul it would give a lot more flexibility that could likely boost valuations of banks operating in that range, Baker said. Valuations for too-big-to-fail designated banks are at around 12.5 times forward earnings compared with multiples of 13 to 15 for banks outside of this category, according to Baker. Ed Keon, managing director and portfolio manager of QMA, a multi-asset manager owned by Prudential Financial, said he has been buying into the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, the ETF that tracks the S&P financial sector, in the last couple of weeks. He is betting on higher interest rates and a pick-up in economic growth. The potential for lighter regulation added to his enthusiasm for the sector. "Of course, no one yet knows exactly what policy changes will occur and exactly how much they will help profits, but I think the benefit might be solid enough that I am maintaining my overweight holdings in the sector," Keon said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » China's Fosun to become biggest shareholder in Portuguese bank BCPAFP Chinese conglomerate Fosun will become the biggest shareholder in the ailing BCP, Portugal's biggest private bank, … Asia-Pacific leaders defend trade against Trump tideAFP Trump tipped to meet QueenAAP PM coy on parental leave compromiseAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7327 -0.0089 -1.19% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5931 -0.0038 -0.64% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6901 -0.0076 -1.09% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Adelaide Accommodation Four Nations Final Mobile phone Ivanka Trump iPad Kanye West Avis Volkswagen Cheap international flights Nicole Kidman Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 13, 2016 2:59pm   Comments Share: This weekend's Barron's takes a look at the expected winners and losers following Donald Trump's election victory. The prospects for a leading biotechnology product development company and a prominent financial services company are also examined. Other featured stories offer where Jeffrey Gundlach sees bond yields going and more on what to expect in the Trump era. "Trump Win Creates Winners, Losers" by Andrew Bary says that Wall Street quickly decided that Trump's surprise election victory was good for business. See why Barron's thinks JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) are among the winners, while the likes of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) are not. In "For-Profit Colleges Could Prosper Under Trump," Bill Alpert points out that investors have bid up shares of DeVry Education Group Inc (NYSE: DV), Capella Education Company (NYSE: CPLA) and others, on hopes for reduced regulations. See why the industry, a longtime underperformer, is giving high marks to a Trump presidency. Jack Hough's "Thermo Fisher Has 30% Upside" examines why, even though this biotechnology product development company has beaten earnings for 20 quarters in a row, its shares are valued no higher than other serial disappointers. Find out why Barron's believes Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO) is likely to grow its earnings per share at a double-digit clip for years to come. If Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) can grow its loan book just a little bit faster, the shares could offer a 12 percent return within the next year, according to "Discover: A Credit-Card Stock With a Rewards Program for Investors" by Robin Goldwyn Blumenthal. And if interest rates rise, says the article, Discover looks even more like a winner going forward. In Jack Hough's "10 Stocks Set to Win Big With Trump Tax Cuts," takes a look at companies that have gotten clobbered by taxes, such as Altria Group Inc (NYSE: MO), CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: CSX). If rates slide, says Barron's, the earnings of these companies and more could soar and their shares could rally. Also in this week's Barron's: Where Jeffrey Gundlach sees bond yields in five years The prospects for a American Vanguard Corp. (NYSE: AVD) comeback Why one analyst prefers Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ: WFM) to Kroger Co (NYSE: KR) The epidemic of financial abuse of the elderly Whether real assets will bounce back after Trump win The good and the bad of Trumponomics Whether Trump will declare war on technology companies Where to research Trump-era stocks A Fitbit for funds Whether infrastructure stocks are overheated Why top-yielding stocks are not the top bets anymore Keep up with all the latest breaking news and trading ideas by following Benzinga on Twitter.

(BENJAMIN NORMAN/NYT) Not only did they not foresee a win by Donald Trump, they predicted that if it occurred the market would take a bath. In the short term, investors have disagreed. Share story By James B. Stewart The New York Times To the long list of pundits who called the election all wrong — as well as its likely consequences — add Wall Street analysts. As the presidential election approached, they were falling all over themselves to predict a Hillary Clinton victory and, afterward, a modest stock-market rally. The prospect of a win by Donald Trump was so remote as to be deemed a “black swan,” an event that was only distantly possible but would have potentially dire consequences for financial markets. Among the many predicting a drop in equity markets in the unlikely event of a Trump victory were analysts at Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Keith Parker, head of cross-asset strategy research at Barclays, forecast a drop of 11 to 13 percent in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. The hedge fund Bridgewater Associates went even further, warning clients that the Dow Jones industrial average would fall 2,000 points.

But then, not only did Trump win, but U.S. stocks rose sharply. With benefit of hindsight, what’s extraordinary is how few professional investors saw it coming. Trump was derided as the candidate of “uncertainty,” which markets abhor, and many of his stated policies are vague, incoherent or inconsistent. But there was nothing uncertain about his overall pro-growth, pro-business and America-first tendencies, now backed by the firepower of a Republican House and Senate. “We see tremendous opportunity for economic growth,” said John Engler, a former governor of Michigan who is now president of the Business Roundtable, an influential group of chief executives often at odds with Trump during the campaign, especially over trade and immigration. Silver lining Now that the results are in, though, Engler sees a silver lining. “The Republicans understand,” he said, “that they’re on the spot to produce results.” Simon Lack, founder of SL Advisors, an investment-advisory firm and operator of a mutual fund that focuses on energy, carried the theme further. “Trump’s win is unambiguously positive” for many sectors of the economy, “especially energy infrastructure,” he said. The doomsayers also ignored a century of market reactions to presidential elections. “We’ve done extensive research that suggests presidential elections don’t affect markets,” said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. “The reality is that the market is influenced to the greatest extent by economic factors and monetary policy.” “In almost all technical and macro aspects, this is still a bull market,” Stack said, and Trump’s election does not change that. Markets generally rally the day after a presidential election, said Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Traders Almanac, because elections, whatever their outcome, eliminate a measure of uncertainty. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a Republican or Democrat.” Returns tend to be higher when an incumbent president is replaced or the party in power changes. And previous instances of the election of both a Republican president and Republican Congress have been followed, on average, by a first-year performance of 14 percent. There are more specific reasons as well that investors applauded Trump’s victory During the campaign, Trump said he wanted to “build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports and airports.” If he can get his Republican Congress to go along, that could easily surpass President Obama’s stimulus plan in the depths of the recession. Trump has not put a price tag on his proposals, but suggested it could easily top $500 billion. Economists generally agree that government spending can act as a broad economic stimulus as well as a boon for construction companies. The Congressional Budget office estimated that Obama’s stimulus plan saved 2.1 million jobs in the last quarter of 2009, bolstering the economy by up to 3.5 percent and lowering the unemployment rate by as much as 2.1 percent. Construction-company stocks rallied Wednesday. Shares in Caterpillar, which makes the heavy equipment used in most infrastructure construction, jumped more than 8 percent. With Republicans in charge, the kind of sweeping tax overhaul and tax cuts long sought by investors seem likely. In many instances, Trump’s proposed tax cuts go even further than those advanced by House Republicans. He wants to cut the top rate on individuals to 33 percent and cut the corporate rate and taxes on so-called pass-through entities like limited-liability companies and partnerships to 15 percent. Economic stimulua Whatever their ultimate effect on deficits and interest rates — not to mention worsening income inequality — tax cuts are another form of economic stimulus. “Tax modernization is our top priority,” said Engler, of the Business Roundtable, arguing that it would substantially lift the economy a full percentage point beyond the growth rate of roughly 2 percent a year that it has been stuck in. “We’ve said that if you want to grow gross domestic product by 1 percent, get tax legislation done. The House Republican plan is a great blueprint. One percent growth over 10 years would be $3 trillion.” Investors and business leaders cheered the likely rollback of a host of time-consuming and costly regulatory measures: crucial parts of the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul legislation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, environmental regulations and labor protections. “Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,” Trump said during the campaign. Needless to say, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a Wall Street nemesis whom Trump mocked as “Pocahontas,” will not have a starring role in a Trump administration. Some of the biggest beneficiaries of deregulation are likely to be banks, drug companies and oil and gas pipelines. On Wednesday, shares in JPMorgan Chase rose 4.6 percent, biotech concern Biogen jumped more than 8 percent and pipeline operator Kinder Morgan rose 4.5 percent. Whether the “Trump rally” persists is another question. In their rush to buy stocks, investors seemed all too willing to ignore Trump’s hostile stands on immigration and free trade, as well as his seeming indifference to the federal deficit and the increased likelihood of higher interest rates. All those have the capacity to dampen growth or even tip the economy into recession. Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, was among those surprised by the strong market rally. “If we get a large stimulus on top of a full-employment economy,” he said, “it may give you some juice in the near term, but longer term, it’s going to hurt” by driving up interest rates and squeezing out other investments. “I was a strong advocate of deficit spending and tax cuts when unemployment was at 10 percent,” he said. “It doesn’t make sense at 5 percent.” Parker, of Barclays, said he had expected a sell-off initially, but also called for a recovery by year-end once investors absorbed signals from key economic policymakers. “What we thought would play out over weeks played out over hours,” he said, pointing to Trump’s victory speech, which made no mention of trade or immigration, as one catalyst. Like many, Parker now sees more gains for stocks if a Trump administration stays focused on a tax overhaul and fiscal policy, if real interest rates stay low and if inflation picks up. “The backdrop was and still is generally supportive of risk,” he said.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... @MedicineHatNews Follow Us By Alex Veiga, The Associated Press on November 10, 2016. Money traders watch a news program reporting the U.S. presidential election results at a foreign exchange brokerage in Tokyo, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi) 00000 Banks and other financial companies led U.S. stocks mostly higher in early trading Thursday, building on a strong rally the day before in the wake of the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. Health care and industrial stocks were also big gainers, while safe-haven assets like utilities and phone companies slumped. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 122 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 18,712 as of 10:24 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 2 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,165. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 27 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,223. TRUMP BOUNCE: The upcoming Trump presidency, which will commence on Jan. 20, put many investors in a buying mood, giving many global stock indexes a lift early Thursday. Traders were focusing on Trump’s promises to boost U.S. economic growth through infrastructure spending and by cutting red tape, rather than uncertainties such as what he might do with trade agreements. Before the election, markets had been worried about a Trump presidency because his campaign promises carried few policy details, making him an unknown quantity compared with rival Hillary Clinton. BANKS SURGE: Several big banks were moving higher amid speculation that a Trump presidency could result in higher interest rates and less government regulation, which tend to benefit banks and other financial stocks. JPMorgan Chase climbed $3.10, or 4.3 per cent, to $76.38, the highest gainer in the Dow. Goldman Sachs rose $4.13, or 2.1 per cent, to $196.73. BETTER QUARTER: Macy’s rose 3.7 per cent after the department store chain raised its sale outlook for the year, citing improved business in the third quarter. The stock gained $1.42 to $39.80. BONDS: The sell-off in bonds continued, sending bond prices lower and kicking up the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 2.12 per cent from 2.06 per cent late Wednesday. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages. Traders have been selling bonds more aggressively to hedge against the possibility that interest rates, which have been ultra-low for years, could rise steadily again under Trump’s administration. MARKETS OVERSEAS: In Europe, Germany’s DAX was up 0.2 per cent, while the CAC-40 in France was 0.3 per cent higher. Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.7 per cent. Russia was one of the biggest gainers in Europe amid optimism there that Trump’s election will improve relations. The Micex index in Moscow was up 3.4 per cent. In Asia, shares posted hefty gains as they responded to the optimism recorded in Europe and the U.S. the day before. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index was the standout performer, rocketing 6.7 per cent after sliding more than 5 per cent the day before. South Korea’s Kospi advanced 2.3 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.9 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 surged 3.3 per cent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude was down 66 cents, or 1.5 per cent, at $44.61 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was down 31 cents, or 0.7 per cent, at $46.05 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar has been fairly solid since Trump’s victory. The U.S. currency rose to 106.81 yen from 105.84 on Wednesday. The euro was down to $1.0878 from $1.0930. The Mexican peso recouped some losses after plunging against the dollar Wednesday. The dollar weakened to 20.59 Mexican pesos from 19.87 pesos, which was still near its lowest level in decades. The Mexican currency has been in a slump as traders look ahead to potential problems under a Trump presidency. He has repeatedly said he wants a wall built to keep illegal Mexican immigrants out of the United States and has threatened to tear up a North American trade agreement. 00000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Black Money Should Go In Black Banks. November 12, 2016 by Staff   Filed under Business, Money, News, Opinion, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) If 1 million [Black] people start a $100 account with any Black-owned bank. The result: it gives these small banks the ability to give out small home and business loans for areas that are being gentrified, so Black families don’t get pushed out and their businesses can thrive. _ Killer Mike The Top Largest and oldest running banks in the United Stated are: JPMorgan Chase Bank of America Wells Fargo Citigroup Goldman Sachs Wells Fargo is number one in the world and Chase is number 3. How many of us have any financial assets in the banks listed here? Most of us! Not one of them is Black owned! You always hear people talking about investing in the community and letting money circulate as a way to strengthen neighborhoods but did you know that doing this isn’t actually that hard? It turns out that there are already over 35 African-American owned banks and credit unions in the United States where you can put your money if you find these type of efforts for financial stability and reinvestment in the black community important. Currently African American owned banks have assets totaling over $4 billion or approximately 0.43 percent of African America’s $1.1 trillion in buying power. Historically, Black-owned banks were important institutions in the African-American community that provided loans and services to Blacks when white institutions refused. Black banks allowed African-Americans to progress economically by allowing them to obtain loans to purchase homes and start businesses. Today, these banks remain relevant for many of the same reasons, but have been edged out by fierce competition from corporate rivals and economic losses brought on by the recession. Here are four imperative reasons why Black Banks are relevant:   Jobs – Creates more jobs for African-Americans. We need black financial planners and bankers who can understand our needs and help our people in making smarter financial decisions. Growth of Black Business – Doing business with black banks keeps black businesses alive. With more black banks opened more loans can be issued to fund black businesses. Accountability – Creates financial accountability and awareness. We need to utilize one another in regards to saving and spending habits. Generational Wealth – It helps build wealth in the community.   Despite the challenges facing Black financial institutions, there is room for growth, which makes the future for Black banks optimistic. Teri Williams, CEO of OneUnited, the largest Black owned bank in the U.S states, “As a community we need to invest in technology, which OneUnited has done, and the importance of technology is not just a Black bank issue, it is a community bank issue. Integration became an issue for Black banks 20 years ago. Today it is a different issue. There are opportunities and challenges today. OneUnited is attracting black customers from across the country. You can open an account with us anywhere in the 50 states. We have customers all over, because we have the technology where you can open an account wherever you are. You can even pay people by text,” the bank president noted. “Really for us what is happening today is fueling our growth, but if you are a small bank and you don’t have that technology–and that’s Black or white–then you’re losing business. Black people just happen to have more of those small banks.” For a list of Black Banks owed in your area click the link http://blackoutcoalition.org/black-u-s-banks/ Staff Writer; Amber Ogden One may also view more of her work over at; AmberOgden.com.

What Is Early Warning Services?Find out who EWS protects and what to do if you've been flagged. By Andrew Lisa November 12, 2016 Crispy Fish Images / Shutterstock.com More than 1 billion non-cash financial transactions are executed every single day, according to Banking Technology. Businesses, financial institutions and government organizations face the daunting task of protecting themselves and their customers from mistakes and fraud. Enter Early Warning Services: a system designed to help banks and other institutions authenticate their customers’ identities and avoid fraud, counterfeiting, forgery and other account abuse. For you, the consumer, the system translates into yet another massive organization compiling your financial data into reports for banks. Find Out: What’s the Difference Between TeleCheck, ChexSystems and EWS? What Is EWS? EWS has been around for more than 25 years and serves more than 2,300 organizations, including payment companies, government entities and banks. The company’s system uses technology and consumer reporting to spot potentially criminal and illegal transactions. It also helps financial institutions expedite availability of payments and funds. EWS isn’t the only company that provides this service, but it stands out because it’s owned by some of the biggest financial institutions in the world: Wells Fargo, BB&T, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Capital One. These banks — as well as the others that subscribe to its services — use EWS to weed out questionable account holders who have a history of shady dealings with banks, including writing bad checks and misrepresenting their finances, histories or identities. Although EWS provides a valuable service to the banks it serves by providing them with regulatory, payment and authentication solutions, sometimes innocent people can get swept up in its dragnet. A few honest mistakes or a simple clerical error can lead to a spotty EWS report, which can make it difficult to open a bank account or get a loan. EWS, TeleCheck and ChexSystems Like EWS, TeleCheck and ChexSystems provide financial risk mitigation, fraud prevention and identity verification services to banks and other organizations. TeleCheck, which has been in business for 50 years, deals specifically with check processing and acceptance. The company works to protect its customers’ businesses from check fraud by leveraging vast data sets to analyze risk-based decision-making and debt verification. ChexSystems, on the other hand, is a specialty consumer reporting agency. It deals specifically with financial institutions and other organizations that are governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The FCRA is consumer-protection legislation designed to ensure that organizations share consumer information in a fair, accurate way that protects consumers’ rights. ChexSystems works to prevent bank fraud by creating and distributing reports regarding closed bank accounts. The organization delivers those reports only to entities with a legitimate reason for requesting them. Consumers have the right to request their reports and challenge any information they think is erroneous. Disputing Your EWS Report EWS also acts in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act by giving consumers the opportunity to request reports and challenge incomplete or inaccurate information. Both the report and the challenging process are free for consumers. To request an EWS report, you can contact EWS Consumer Services at 800-325-7775, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mountain Standard Time. EWS also provides consumers with information on avoiding debt collection scams, credit repair scams and online identity theft. Protect Yourself Organizations like EWS, TeleCheck and ChexSystems compile information to help financial institutions verify identities and prevent fraud. These companies, however, sometimes mistake innocent consumers for wrongdoers. Banks rely on these reports to avoid scams and fraud, so it’s important that you’re vigilant about getting your own reports and checking them for and disputing any errors.

While Donald Trump's election win was a shock, it might actually be positive for the economy Credit: Reuters Sam Brodbeck 12 November 2016 • 7:33am As markets adjust to the idea of Donald Trump as president, a once unthought-of notion is taking hold: his election victory might be the catalyst for the return to “financial normality”. That would mean the resumption of higher interest rates and inflation, a fall in the price of bonds and a resulting rise in their yields, and – most welcome of all – a gradual tilting of the odds back in favour of savers rather than borrowers. Investors have been living in an abnormal world since 2008, when the financial crisis triggered unprecedented intervention by governments and central banks. Their actions turned the rules of saving and investment on their head, with rates plunging so far that, in celebrated cases, some Swedish mortgage borrowers were actually paid interest – while cash-rich savers elsewhere had to pay banks for the privilege of handing over their deposits. These extreme distortions meant investors seeking returns have been pushed into riskier assets – from cash, to bonds, to shares – in their “hunt for yield”. That has made shares expensive, particularly in America, but in Britain and other developed markets too. “We have to seriously consider that we are at some kind of inflection point,” said David Stubbs, a global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. “Populism is a runaway train through the developed world – and it’s very hard to stop.” Mr Trump’s brand of populism and campaign promises point to higher Government spending, lower taxation and support for domestic manufacturing. The danger lies in his threats to scrap international trade agreements and a steep rise in national debt as he abandons austerity and borrows. Extrapolating that, said Mr Stubbs, will fuel a rise in prices followed by higher economic growth and “therefore a higher inflation and interest rate world”. Hillary Clinton was ahead in the polls going into the US presidential election Credit: Jewel Samad Jim Leaviss, a bond fund manager at M&G and co-author of the Bond Vigilantes blog, went further. He said Mr Trump’s election was driven by public anger at pitiful wage growth experienced over a decade. Established politicians are increasingly ineffective at solving this, he said, and will either have to abandon the policies that have prevailed since the crisis or face ejection. “Could the vote trigger the end of global austerity?” he said. Contrary to dire predictions, there was no stock market panic following Mr Trump’s election. But bond yields rose –meaning their prices fell – in both Britain and the US, on the expectation that inflation will return. Trump pledges to be 'President for all Americans' Play! 01:26 While share prices might also fall in value to levels nearer their long-term norms relative to company earnings, bond prices are most at risk from a rise in inflation. This is because newer bonds are issued with higher coupons to keep pace with increasing prices. The yield on Treasury 10-year bonds, the benchmark of the American bond market, rose after the election, while the British equivalent, 10-year gilts, have seen increasing yields since the summer. Rising yields have two welcome consequences. Firstly, they “finally tip the scales back in favour of savers”, said Mark Burgess, chief investment officer at Columbia Threadneedle, the fund management firm. Donald Trump wins: what it means for Europe Play! 01:17 Even when the official Bank Rate was stuck at 0.5pc between March 2009 and August 2016, the interest rates banks paid customers continued to fall. Higher bond yields would help company pension schemes, which are crippled by their need to generate income to pay retirees. Another outcome would be higher annuity rates for other pensioners. But the seismic shift could see borrowers paying more for mortgages as rates lift across the board. The early signs of this are already apparent in the capital markets. The rates at which banks raise finance to lend as mortgages, known as “swap” rates, are climbing – and have been doing so for some weeks. The two-year swap, for instance, which reflects loosely the future cost of two-year fixed-rate mortgages, has doubled since August. Several mortgage brokers now suggest that a rise in rates is finally nearing.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 9:20 AM, November 12, 2016 Updated: 11:10 AM, November 13, 2016 NEW YORK - The U.S. banking sector's dramatic rally post Election Day is likely just a taste of bigger gains to come, as investors expect banks to reap huge benefits from rising interest rates and lighter regulation under a Donald Trump presidency. In recent years, bank stocks have been held back by heavy regulation and historically low interest rates which have sapped the earnings potential of their massive cash holdings. But optimism about the sector's outlook is growing. Interest rates are rising and investors are betting that Trump will follow through on his campaign promise to review the increased number of regulations put on the banking system after it nearly keeled over in the 2008 financial crisis. The S&P 500 bank subsector rose 10.2 percent in the three days following Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election. This was the index's best three-day performance since August 2009. In those three days, Wells Fargo Co shares rose 13.6 percent, JPMorgan Chase & Co climbed 9.5 percent and Bank of America gained 11.9 percent. Some investors and analysts watching banks say the stocks are likely not near the end of their run. "They are not close to being expensive yet," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. The S&P 500 banks are currently trading at about 11.2 times forward earnings estimates as a group, up from about nine times in February, when the index hit its lowest since May 2013. Valuation is still well off peak levels of over 33 times earnings estimates in May of 2009, though it trades near levels seen between 2002 and 2008, before many current regulations were put in place. If rates continue to rise and the Trump administration gives some clarity on how regulations will change, then bank valuations "certainly can move higher," Piper Jaffray analyst Kevin Baker said. Baker stopped short of giving a specific P/E estimate but he pointed to the higher valuations of banks that are not designated as systemically important financial institutions, commonly referred to as "too big to fail". Today, the minimum asset threshold for too-big-to-fail designated banks is $50 billion. If this threshold is lifted to $250 billion in a regulatory overhaul it would give a lot more flexibility that could likely boost valuations of banks operating in that range, Baker said. Valuations for too-big-to-fail designated banks are at around 12.5 times forward earnings compared with multiples of 13 to 15 for banks outside of this category, according to Baker. Ed Keon, managing director and portfolio manager of QMA, a multi-asset manager owned by Prudential Financial, said he has been buying into the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, the ETF that tracks the S&P financial sector, in the last couple of weeks. He is betting on higher interest rates and a pick-up in economic growth. The potential for lighter regulation added to his enthusiasm for the sector. "Of course, no one yet knows exactly what policy changes will occur and exactly how much they will help profits, but I think the benefit might be solid enough that I am maintaining my overweight holdings in the sector,” Keon said.

Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Nov 11, 2016 at 6:45PM The stock market finished the week Friday on a mixed note, with the Dow and Nasdaq gaining ground even as the S&P 500 fell slightly. The ambiguous results of the day reflected the ongoing effort among investors to predict economic conditions beyond January 20, when the new president-elect will take office. Some stocks performed quite badly, however, and Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM), Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), and Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH) were among the worst decliners on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Image source: Newmont Mining. Newmont Mining deals with a plunging gold market Newmont Mining finished the day down 9%, reflecting further declines in the gold market. Gold bullion prices fell another $32 per ounce Friday, finishing the week at $1,226 per ounce and brining its losses just since early Wednesday morning to nearly $115 per ounce. Even with the drop, Newmont is taking smart steps to shore up its business, with a tender offer to buy back debt helping to improve its balance sheet. Moreover, today's announcement that the first gold from the company's Long Canyon project got poured earlier in the week points to the potential for higher production from Newmont in the future. By having taken dramatic steps to improve efficiency, Newmont expects all-in cash costs for the mine to be between $500 and $600 per ounce, leaving plenty of profit even if gold prices don't behave well in the near future. ADM deals with political fears Archer-Daniels-Midland dropped 8% after the food processing specialist received a downgrade from analysts at JPMorgan. Already, the results of the presidential election have led to dramatic uncertainty about the future of relations between the U.S. and the rest of the world, and a stronger U.S. dollar against Latin American currencies could make competing countries in South America more attractive to buyers seeking exports than the U.S. markets that Archer-Daniels-Midland serves. As a result, analysts downgraded the stock to underweight, and as future policy becomes clearer, Archer-Daniels-Midland could remain exposed to even greater risks ahead. Molina Healthcare feels a bit ill Finally, Molina Healthcare lost about 6%. The Medicaid-heavy health insurance plan provider has had a tough week, with losses totaling nearly 20% since Tuesday as the future of the Affordable Care Act is under serious threat from the president-elect's imminent policy moves early next year. If new healthcare reform de-emphasizes the role of state Medicaid plans in providing health insurance coverage to Americans, then Molina will have to look closely at its business model to see if it needs to shift away from its focus on government programs and toward greater provision of private healthcare coverage. It's too early to tell exactly what health insurance will look like in 2017 and beyond, but investors in Molina aren't happy with the uncertainty at this point.

PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 14, 2016 5:50 AM STOCK-MARKET bulls applauded the election of Donald Trump, driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new record high amid bets that Mr Trump's pro-business goals rather than the more sinister aspects of his campaign would come to define his administration. But Wall Street strategists warn that longer term, Mr Trump's trade and domestic policies may not be so stock market-friendly. In the weeks ahead, volatility looks set to continue. Shares of drug makers, biotech companies, energy companies, miners and banks all soared for a simple reason: President-elect Trump will almost certainly cut regulatory fetters and tax bills for all of these companies. Shares of Silicon Valley giants Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix, Google (or Alphabet, as it's now known) - the quartet known as FANG - declined, however. These companies had thrived in the 21st century economic order, where America is only one of many important markets. Mr Trump has promised his followers to turn back the economic clock to the 1950s when the US reigned in the global economy, even if that means sacrificing free trade for domestic prosperity. Investors are piling into shares of copper miners and construction-machinery builders in the belief that he can make the rust belt great again - at least for a couple of years. Investors are also betting that Mr Trump, who, among his many boasts, advertises himself as the ultimate negotiator, will compromise on his most extreme positions. "There are still lots of checks and balances in there that would hopefully negate a lot of the bombastic things he said," said Ryan Detrick, senior investment strategist at brokerage LPL Financial. Few educated people would debate the dangerous nature of Mr Trump's promises or the danger they pose to the US economy - not to mention the society itself. The idea that optimists are harbouring, however, is that Mr Trump, the president, will be completely different from Mr Trump, the candidate. The fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote could inspire some humility in Mr Trump, some of these optimists say. "Most of Trump's more troubling policies (on immigration, protectionism) are likely to be toned down, and some of his policies can be seen as positive for equities (more fiscal spending and a cut in the corporate tax rate)," said analysts at brokerage Credit Suisse. Certainly, Mr Trump's acceptance speech sounded like it came from a different person than the bilious demagogue heard on the campaign trail. In victory, Mr Trump focused on his pledges to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Market strategists, such as Mr Detrick, predict this will be the first order of business for a Trump administration. That's one of the reasons copper prices and shares of heavy industry companies soared. Companies throughout the US could also benefit from a cut in the corporate tax rate, which will bring the nation from among the highest tax domiciles in the world to among the lowest, according to analysts at brokerage Goldman Sachs. The other reason for the rally was what Tom Elliott, international investment strategist at deVere Group, called "lightening the load of regulations on certain sectors". Regulation-trimming is very popular with Republicans and independents, and is set to be near the top of Mr Trump's agenda, too. A rally in financial stocks took banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to levels not seen since the financial crisis. Already, on the website set up by Mr Trump's transition team, greatagain.gov, the president-elect has promised to "dismantle" Dodd-Frank, the 2010 regulations designed to rein in Wall Street and prevent the kind of financial-system failures that brought on the Great Recession. Mr Trump's transition team later walked the pledge back, telling The Wall Street Journal only certain provisions of the law would be amended. What's clear, however, is that Mr Trump wants a Wall Street- friendly Treasury secretary. Any lightening of bank regulation could pay massive dividends (literally) for investors - and the employees on banks' trading desks - in the short term, but could very well sow the seeds for the next financial crisis. After all, it was the repeal of Glass-Steagall Act - the 1930s predecessor to Dodd-Frank, itself less than a decade old - that some people cite for the 2008 financial crisis. Healthcare stocks surged last week as traders expressed relief that Mrs Clinton won't get a chance to impose controls on the price hikes that she railed against on the campaign trail. Profits and share prices of biotech companies had risen steadily alongside prices of their products for a decade until Mrs Clinton and others drew attention to the subject. Now, brokerages such as Morgan Stanley say investors will pay premiums for promising biotech companies - and make healthcare rally again. It's Mr Trump's more controversial policies that could trip up the stock market eventually. "The economic impact of the election depends on whether Congress or the President dictates policy," said analysts at brokerage Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a research note. "The most bullish growth scenario combines a Trump policy (fiscal expansion) with a House Republican policy (free trade)." There are some signs that Mr Trump will govern in a more even-handed style than his bellicose campaign mode. So far, there is scant evidence that Mr Trump will "tone down" his approach to trade and immigration, however. Can Mr Trump revive Dwight Eisenhower or Ronald Reagan's America, like dusting off an old reality-show concept?

I learned the meditation technique taking over Wall Street and now I get why traders are willing to set aside 40 minutes a day Richard Feloni Nov. 13, 2016, 1:20 PM 153,027 facebook linkedin twitter email print That's me.Sarah Jacobs As I sat on a waiting room sofa in the David Lynch Foundation's office in September, it felt like a scene from one of Lynch's surrealist films. I was waiting for my first Transcendental Meditation lesson. My teacher Mario Orsatti, a man in his 60s with a penchant for big smiles and unwavering eye contact, took my offering of two apples, a kiwi, and purple irises I'd picked up at a bodega 20 minutes earlier as instructed, and ushered me into a plain, dark room. In front of an illustration of an Indian guru in an orange robe, sitting cross-legged with a golden aura, Mario handed me one of the irises and began solemnly reciting what I assumed to be a Sanskrit prayer. He proceeded to light candles and arrange the fruit and other items before him. Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio had helped popularize Transcendental Meditation (TM) on Wall Street when he proclaimed it "the single biggest influence in his life" a few years ago, but Dalio is widely known for his eccentricities. I wondered if other finance power players, like TM practitioners Third Point manager Dan Loeb and JPMorgan wealth management CEO Barry Sommers, were just following his lead. As for the celebrities who endorsed it — like Jerry Seinfeld, Martin Scorcese, Oprah Winfrey, and Dr. Oz — well, celebrities are often easy prey for this kind of stuff. I couldn't help but wonder: Was I being inducted into Wall Street's hot new cult? View As: One Page Slides The David Lynch Foundation's New York center is located on the 14th and 15th floors of a building in midtown, Manhattan. Sarah Jacobs Lynch, the acclaimed director ("Twin Peaks," "Mulholland Drive"), cofounded his foundation in 2005 with the intention of teaching TM for free to disadvantaged students, veterans with PTSD, and victims of domestic abuse. Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Through partnerships with middle and high schools in the US, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and shelters, the DLF has taught TM for free to 500,000 people. Sarah Jacobs Veterans can also take lessons at the DLF office, as one did during one of my trips. On my first visit, before my lessons began, I sat down with DLF teacher Mario Orsatti and DLF cofounder and executive director Bob Roth. Sarah Jacobs They're best friends of 40 years, and were fun to talk to — not at all the terrifying cult leaders I was afraid they might be. As they put it, TM is a simple but effective technique. The $960 fee offers lifetime access to all TM centers and teachers across the world, and it funds operations and the modest teacher salaries (roughly $40,000-$80,000) that allow them to teach people for free. If people seek out TM and cannot afford it, they can apply for scholarships. I returned for my introductory lesson two weeks later, on a pleasant fall Friday, late in the afternoon. Richard Feloni Roth and Orsatti offered me lessons with a fee waiver, as they had done with other journalists, so that I would have more context for my research.   I stopped off at the bodega down the street from the DLF office to buy some fruit and irises for the "traditional ceremony" I'd be participating in. I felt like I was about to step into one of Lynch's surrealist films. Orsatti had me take my shoes off and we walked into a darkened room. The materials for a puja ceremony to Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the teacher to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of Transcendental Meditation.Ermindo Armino/AP He led me to a corner, where there was a small altar with an illustration of Brahmananda Saraswati, also know as Guru Dev ("divine teacher"). Guru Dev was the teacher of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of TM, and we were there to honor him before learning the technique. Orsatti handed me one of the irises and began solemnly reciting what I assumed to be a Sanskrit prayer. He proceeded to light candles and arrange the fruit and other items before him. I found it interesting, but I wouldn't figure out what was actually happening until weeks later. I was a little skeptical. My teacher Mario Orsatti doesn't look like a cult leader ...Sarah Jacobs But I didn't let myself off the hook! I allowed for the possibility that I was about to learn a valuable meditation technique ... even if it did seem a little cult-like. At the end of the ceremony, Orsatti turned to me and declared a meaningless "vibration word" that I recognized as my mantra, and I repeated it back to him. We sat down in sofas at either side of the room and began meditating. Mike Nudelman/Business Insider The technique itself is simple, consisting of sitting upright in a chair, closing your eyes for 20 minutes, and repeating a mantra — a meaningless "vibration word" provided by your teacher — in your head at no particular rhythm. It is recommended that one practice this twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening. For most people, including myself, TM is easy to learn but takes a couple weeks to practice naturally. It's why your TM teacher checks in for a few followup lessons after the initial four-day introduction. My first meditation felt good. Sarah Jacobs This wasn't my first time meditating. Before this, I had spent eight months practicing mindfulness meditation (focusing on breathing and directing thoughts to certain images or ideas) for 10 minutes daily, through the app Headspace. It reminded me of my favorite aspects of meditations past, and I enjoyed the 20-minute duration, which was the longest I had ever meditated. The feeling of "transcendence" — which you get during especially good meditation sessions but not all — was familiar, and the feeling I had always gone for with other meditation techniques I had tried. As a side note: If you think meditating is like taking a nap from a seated position, you're doing it incorrectly. There is also years of peer-reviewed research that proves that the brain differentiates between sleep/dozing and meditation, and that meditation can quickly rid the body of stress-inducing hormones. I had three more days of training that week, to refine the technique. Headspace teacher Andy Puddicombe describes mindfulness using a highway metaphor.Headspace For example, I learned that if particularly stressful thoughts went through my head, it's helpful to stop repeating the mantra and let the thoughts float away before resuming it. There's a metaphor I learned from the creator of Headspace that applies to this type of meditation, as well. "Imagine yourself sitting by a busy highway," Headspace cofounder Andy Puddicombe says in one of his lessons. "Cars continue to pass by. You can choose to sit there and notice the cars without focusing on any of them, or you can follow a car down the road." It's the same with mindfulness meditation and TM. As you sit there with eyes closed, all kinds of thoughts may be flying through your mind. Instead of exerting energy to try to block them, which often backfires and makes the mind more cluttered, focus on breathing (mindfulness) or the mantra (TM), acknowledging that they exist without engaging them. I still had many questions about the organization behind TM. AP The best place to start finding answers was with the late Maharishi, the founder. In training classes, we were shown videos of the Maharishi (a title that means "seer"), a small man with long wispy hair, a scraggly beard, a high-pitched voice, and a penchant for giggling. As I learned more about him, my perception of him transformed from potential cult leader to one of several Indian philosophy teachers who introduced Westerners to their ancient traditions during an immigration wave in the early to mid-20th century. Born in India as Mahesh Prasad Varma in 1918, he renounced his name and familial ties in typical Hindu monk fashion after graduating from Allahabad University in 1942 with a physics degree and traveling to Jyotir Math in the Indian Himalayas to study under and serve Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the man he reverentially called Guru Dev. Saraswati was the leader of the city's monastery, a lofty position within the religion. When the Maharishi began his global tour of spreading TM in 1958, he made it clear that although he and his guru were Hindu monks and TM was rooted in the ancient Vedic scriptures, his practice was not tied to the Hindu faith. One of the exceptions he made, however, was that TM teachers would perform a puja to Guru Dev in front of their students before an introductory lesson — that same ceremony with the fruit that made me uncomfortable on my first day. After learning more about the ritual itself and the Maharishi's intention to honor his teacher out of tradition, I was willing to accept this remnant of religion in a deliberately secularized practice. I discussed this with Orsatti at one of our follow-up meetings, and he told me that the Maharishi wanted to share this insight without restraining it to religion in any way. The highest aim of TM, then, is to make people more able to connect with others by having them be more in touch with themselves. In mid-October, after nearly 10 months of meditating, I went for my annual physical. One of the most significant studies that inspired doctors to begin taking TM seriously was one conducted by University of California, Irvine researchers in 1978. They compared stress hormone levels between subjects practicing TM for 20 minutes against a control group of people sitting with eyes closes for 20 minutes.University of California, Irvine via the David Lynch Foundation I told my doctor that I had been meditating for almost a year, first with mindfulness meditation, and then with TM. She said that there was a solid chance that it was a reason why my blood pressure was normal rather than moderately high for the first time in five years. She also told me she and other doctors she knows have recommended TM to patients due to the research out there from organizations like the American Heart Association and the University of California, Irvine. I was still left with a major question. A sadhu prays as he sits on the banks of Sangam, the confluence of the holy rivers Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati, during the Maha Kumbh Mela on January 16, 2013 in Allahabad, IndiaDaniel Berehulak/Getty Images TM has spiritual roots but has also always been touted as a tool for healthy living. Were the two compatible, or was the TM organization being disingenuous? I discussed this dynamic with Suhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, and while she has separate gripes about the general lack of understanding many Americans have of Hinduism's affect on popular culture, she said promoting meditation as part of a healthy lifestyle is actually authentic to its roots. You can understand the Vedas, she told me, as "scientific experiments of the mind," and so analyzing an ancient technique with the lens of modern science isn't a deceptive dilution. I've decided to continue practicing TM every day, for the recommended 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes at night. Sarah Jacobs I'm fully aware that I received $960 of training for free, and therefore I'm unable to comment on whether I can recommend someone pay that, or at least apply for a scholarship. For what it's worth, Bob Roth of the David Lynch Foundation told me he's been working to get TM lessons covered by insurance plans, given the accumulation of research in its favor, and he's hopeful it'll happen. As for me, I'm going to continue practicing TM twice a day. I use the app Meditation Timer, which I've set to chime after 20 minutes have passed, and again after the recommended two-minute "rest period" elapses. The extra two minutes help me ease back into a normal state, especially after a deep meditation. I'm a naturally anxious person, and meditating for the past year has improved my mood enough that my family and friends have told me they've noticed. Mindfulness meditation can do the trick, but I've decided to continue practicing TM due to its simplicity.

REUTERS/Tony Gentile/File photoMore MILAN (Reuters) - The board of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena will meet on Monday to set the terms for a bond-to-equity conversion that is part of the lender's capital boosting plans, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday. Italy's third-biggest bank is planning to lay off a tenth of its staff, shut branches and sell assets to win investor backing for a 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) cash call, its third recapitalization in as many years. To help limit the size of the share sale it is studying a voluntary conversion of its subordinated debt. "The (conversion) operation will kick off after the shareholder meeting... and there will obviously be a premium offered to market price," the source said. The conversion plan will also include the Fresh hybrid instrument used to partly finance the costly acquisition of rival Antonveneta in 2007, the source said. Senior debt is not included in the plan.The bank - assisted by JP Morgan and Mediobanca - is due to hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting on Nov. 24 to approve the turnaround plan that also includes the sale of some 28 billion euros in bad loans at below book value. To underpin the cash call, management at the 544-year old lender has been on road shows to drum up support from potential anchor investors. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund has expressed a preliminary interest, sources said earlier this month. "Next week the road show will continue with a video call with U.S. and Asian investors," the source said. On Sunday, Il Sole 24 Ore said the bank was reaching out to Asian investors, especially Singapore wealth fund Temesek. According to the source, the board meeting on Monday will also take a decision on the sale of the lender's non-performing loans servicing platform known as Juliet. Last week Italian Information Solutions company Cerved said it had presented an offer for the platform.

We voted for Stein, or in some cases, chose not to vote (because not voting is the best way to rid elections of fraud.....or some argue) but we know that as proud as we are to have supported such an intelligent and honest person, that the media and public will hardly notice our votes. In 2012, I voted for Stein, who got her largest vote in my state Cali, but the next day, the media did not even report her vote totals. Our protest vote led to oblivion......in the media, but especially the young, who are being dealt out of the dying American dream, are looking for alternatives. Anonymous: the modern face of anarchism.. (Photo Page) (image by Pixabay: KlausHausmann)   License   DMCA I have voted for Stein again because we have reached a tipping point, of which the renewed interest in anti-establishment concepts like anarchism are looking attractive to many. The problem is that anararchism is a term so abused that it means, to one, a hippie commune and to another, bomb throwers. I try to define anarchism, provide a historical and philosophical context that places its evolution at the heart of the Left, which up until Bernie Sanders, was Left Out. And that is the condition of the Left today...it doesn't exist except among a minority of writers and other deviants. The Republican Party is totally taken over by the far right, going as far as to deny science, and the triangulated Democratic Party, which went center right under Bill Clinton (and Hillary is no different) as he joined with the Republicans to repeal Glass-Steagall. - Advertisement - Occupy graffiti: the beginning (Photo Page) (image by DrGarageland)   License   DMCA Glass-Steagall " was passed by Congress in 1933 and prohibits commercial banks from engaging in the investment business. It was enacted as an emergency response to the failure of nearly 5,000 banks during the Great Depression." In 1999 Congress passed the Gramm--Leach--Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, which repealed its key provisions of barring commercial banks from being investment/casino banks. Bill Clinton signed this bill, co-sponsored by 3 Republicans and with a Republican House and Senate, as it was veto proof. Today, both Democrat, Republicans, and the public want to re-instate the wall of separation, which prevents reckless gambling at the public's risk. - Advertisement - Wall Street bombing 1920 wreckage (Photo Page) (image by Wikipedia (commons.wikimedia.org))   License   DMCA Bombing on Wall St.......past protests were robust! Trump's first choice for Secretary of the Treasury, Jaimi Dimon, is the billionaire CEO of the largest bank, JPMorganChase, and he is strongly opposed to bring back the Glass-Steagall separation. f*ck everybody! Wall St. rules. Such attitudes are birthing a new interests in anarchism. And so our next President will be a pathological billionaire pretending to be a populist, whose singular talent is showmanship and whose moral compass is so damaged that he started his campaign by appealing to the declining white poorly educated, offering them a scapegoat for the suffering that oligarchs like Trump, who has outsourced 95% of his jobs to slave labor states, has actually caused. This is somewhat like Hitler pretending to be a "socialist" as he sent the socialists, trade union leaders, and Social Democrats to die at Dachau. Trump will give us peace by choosing the Bush war team, on record of wanting to "Bomb Iran (see John Bolton, possible Secy of State, in his NYTimes op ed from last year). And he will dismantle the oligarchy by having Wall St cut its own throat.

Part I establishes the WHY and WHEN. Part II will explore whether anarchism is just a reaction, a kind of philosophical escape by intellectuals, or a growing movement with actual political power: is it just a mood....or is it the harbinger of a left anti-establishment movement, the counterpart to the Right's move towards the Police State, or as NIxon and now Trump call it, Law and Order. Part II also explores the various meanings of anarchism, on the premise that if we don't define our terms, when anarchism is widely viewed as either bomb-throwing or hippie communes, we won't be talking the same language and agreement will be either impossible or impotently abstract. Undefined terms leads to rhetorical but empty and impotent agreement. What are the varieties of anarchism, and what common ground can the bomb throwers and hippies and all in between find to form not just a mood of rebellion (I will not vote!) but a political movement which can join with the Greens, progressives, and possibly libertarian to take power and.....Make American Great at Last!

So how could anarchists possibly be seeking "actual political power"? Behind all your cartloads of wikipaedia data you live in a fantasy world of imaginary "power" whitewashed with the word 'solidarity'. You don't speak for anarchists because you are not an anarchist. And it is a given among anarchists that no one really speaks for anyone else. You don't speak for anyone but Dale Ruff and that is exactly what drives you up the wall into power fantasy.

But business and banking corporations exercise more mundane and intrusive power over people's economic and financial livelihoods. We do not actually live in a "democratic" society. We live in a "capitalist" society. Capitalism -- like feudalism before it -- is rule by ownership of the economic and financial infrastructure. Corporations own the now-globalized industrial production and distribution systems. Banking corporations own the money issuance and allocation system. Look at your actual life. Everything you do costs money. Only about 3% of the money supply is government/central bank-issued cash money. 97% -- virtually all -- of the money supply is commercial bank credit/debt. Private corporations -- commercial banks -- create the money supply as "loans". Banks "own" the credit-money that they create and "lend". Debtors owe the money supply "back" to the banks that created it. The power to issue and allocate money is the power to financially govern the economic life of nations. Debtors are beholden to creditors. Commercial bankers are the creditors who create the money supply that debtors borrow and spend. Monetary reformers since the 1920s have argued that governments should issue at least some of the national money supply, rather than suffer the private bank monopoly over money. Even if anarchists succeed in instituting a people-serving "democratic" government, the government will have no power (except police/military) unless it captures the money-issuing power from the banks who presently wield it. Otherwise the government is limited to trying to tax money from some people to fund its spending on behalf of other people, which creates a political division between taxpayers and spending recipients. As long as we live in a global economy and enjoy all the hi-tech fruits of corporate production and distribution, a corporate oligarchy "owns" the economy. The device you are reading this on is made of materials sourced by global supply chains. The components were manufactured in several different nations, then shipped to the final assembly plant, then shipped out to ports in every nation on Earth, then shipped by train and truck to a retailer near you. You cannot "democratize" the interlinked globalized corporate-owned industrial production and distribution system. Most of the food that most people eat is produced by agri-corporations, not by local farmers. Without money you can't buy food. Without agri-corps there is no food to buy. Banks own the money system. Corporations own the food production and sales system; and corporations produce and sell most of the other economic necessities and luxuries that we use in our daily lives. "The people" do not directly produce their daily necessities of life. The people are economically ruled by the corporations who own the industries who produce all the stuff that is offered "for sale" in "the economy". The people are financially ruled by the banks who own the money issuance and allocation system. Governments are financially ruled by banks and by "the bond market" (the capital markets). Everybody is ruled by the neoliberal worldview that believes everything "should" be owned and operated by global corporate capitalists. Individuals and small businesses are left to 'compete' in their local and nartional marketplace against billionaire oligopolists with access to global cheap labor and global supply chains. "The people" vote for global oligopolists by shopping at Walmart rather than shopping at a local independent store. The people do this because Walmart is cheaper, and when banks own the money-issuance system, money is always in scarce supply. Who are anarchists revolting against? Governments who have almost no power to govern anything? Or corporations who own the money system and the economy and who exercise economic and financial government over the nations? The boot stamping on the human face is not worn by a politician. It is worn by a corporate oligopolist.

The concept of anarchism being no government has been advanced by its enemies to make it sound absurd. Self-government as in the Kurdish region, in Spain in the 30's, and in thousands of workers coops in the US all have non-hierarchical democratic self-governance. Mondragon in Spain has 90,000 members, all with an equal voice. It is lunatic to suggest they have no government. Famous American anarchists of the libertarian socialist strain have included Bookchin, whose self-government idea is being adopted by the Kurds, Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Gar Alperowitz, and Richard Wolfe. If you are not familiar with their form of anarchism, perhaps it's time to do some homework. Your concept of anarchism is the cartoon version; no serious anarchist movement or community has ever rejected self-government and chosen NO government, which is impossible, since all human cooperation involves decisions which effect the community and must be decided one way or the other, either through a hierarch (like a corporation) or through self-government. I buy my bread (Alvarez Bankery) from an anarchist group that formed in 1982 in Berkeley (where I lived and associated with many fellow anarchists), and they rule through democratic governance, voting on who should manage, what wages should be, etc etc. When a society has no government, no public way of managing affairs, either private parties take control or outsiders raid a community incapable of defending itself. Please allow that I, who have studied anarchism at UC Berkeley and Harvard Grad School of Government and been an anarchist of the lib soc variety for 55 years, am aware of the many varieties, including the right wing cartoon version you claim while denying what anarchists for centuries have written and practiced. You basic error is to confuse self-government with hierarchy: it is a total rejection of hierarchy, from the Diggers through the untopian socialist, the French Revolution (the Paris Commune had its own army, which of course required some form of management, through the libertarian socialist who clashed with the Marxists to the current crop like Bookchin and Chomsky. It is a rich and varied history and culture which you have reduced to an unworkable concept. This Part I is meant to say Why and When anarchism becomes attractive. I wish you would stay on topic. Part II will explore the many varieties, including yours....and you can comment there and present all your knowledge and sources to make your case. Divided we fall; you are rejecting 99% of anarchist history with the effect of a kind of radical purge of most anarchists, including Zinn, Chomsky, Wolf, etc etc. All philosophies of anarchism reject heirarchy (except if temporary and by democratic agreement) as with the need for self-defense, which clearly requires some form of organization. Please do not merely repeat your unsupported opinion, but share us your knowledge of history, philosophy, and practical experiences with anarchism. Anarchism is the rejection of all forms of tyranny and imposed hierarchy, seeking to embrace equality and self-government. This has been the case from the Diggers in the 17th Century to the libertarian socialist communities forming on the basis of Bookchins mutual aid society among some Kurds. Let's not fight; lets express our views, listen to others, and seek solidarity. Join....or die. Thank you for your comment....I hope to hear more when we get to the many varities of anarchism throughout history.

Proudhon, Bukunin, and Thoreau all made important contributions. Bukunin " Bakunin was a Russian revolutionary anarchist, and founder of collectivist anarchism. He is considered among the most influential figures of anarchism, and one of the principal founders of the social anarchist tradition." That is the libertarian socialist strain that I belong to these 55 years. Here is the moment when the libertarian socialist movement named itself and took on "the dictatorship of the proletariat: " The "Bakuninist" or anarcho-socialist trend rapidly expanded in influence, especially in Spain, which constituted the largest section of the International at the time. A showdown loomed with Marx, who was a key figure in the General Council of the International. The 1872 Hague Congress was dominated by a struggle between Marx and his followers, who argued for the use of the state to bring about socialism, and the Bakunin/anarchist faction, which argued instead for the replacement of the state by federations of self-governing workplaces and communes." What anarchist authors do you recommend? Was Bukunin a fake anarchist in your view; were the Spanish anarchists who ran part of Spain for a while fakes? Are Bookchin, Chomksy, Zinn , etc all fakes like me?

My goal is to let anarchists speak for themselves...so here is Proudhon's set of options, from Principles of Anarchism: Regime of Authority 1. Government of all by one - monarchy 2. Government of all by all - communism Regime of Liberty 1. Government of all by each - democracy 2. Government of each by each - anarchy or self-government Perhaps the most biting criticism of anarchism was Robert Michaels who wrote The Iron Law of Oligarchy: " The "iron law of oligarchy" states that all forms of organization, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually and inevitably develop oligarchictendencies, thus making true democracy practically and theoretically impossible, especially in large groups and complex organizations." This thesis led him eventually disown democracy and self-government and turn to fascism. Absolutists who reject all forms of government, including self-government, are the pain in the ass of the movement, as they represent not a process of transforming power into a democratic operation of equals but denounce all forms of self-government. Such absolutists have never once created a viable community. None the founders of modern anarchism were dogmatists but rejected the dogmatism of the Marxists, for instance, while sharing their common view of capitalism and the need for a new society based on equality. They differed on the means. Absolutism tends to The "iron law of oligarchy" states that all forms of organization, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually and inevitably develop oligarchictendencies, thus making true democracy practically and theoretically impossible, especially in large groups and complex organizations." Absolutists who claim the one true anarchism have never created a viable community (the world has tens of thousands of worker coops using self-government to manage affairs) and tend to purge anyone who disagrees with their absolute beliefs. All the great modern anarchists believed in a process of eliminating Authority and Hierarchy and replacing it with Self-government, which is how every one of those tens of thousands coops works.

I agree with much of what you say, but we cannot have a meaningful discussion to build a unified anarchist movement. In my view, corporations are totalitarian in nature as they govern most of our waking lives and even tell when we can sleep, have lunch, etc. They are unaccountable except where government has created worker's rights, such as the co-determination programs in Northern Europe, Germany, etc, where workers are on the Board of Directors of private corporations and have a voice in management. For instance, if a recession comes, most US corporations will lay off workers, sometimes by the tens of thousands...or just sent them off to slave labor nations (Trump's clothing is made by garment workers in Bangladesh who make $50 a month and work in unsafe conditions----as part of the race to the bottom in terms of labor and health and safety. In 2012, over 100 died in a garment sweatshop fire, and in February another fire injured many. In Germany, the workers would never vote to outsource their jobs, and if revenue fell, they would not fire 10% of the workers but rather likely vote to take a 10% reduction in pay with 10% fewer hours worked. It's still a capitalist system but state laws force the corporations to share power (and profits, thru workers voices) with labor. That is the best a restrained capitalism has done this far. I want to go further, to a system in which workers coops, ESOPS, and non-profits expand democracy into the workplace and economy. Credit unions are non-profits with 90 million members; they did not collapse during the Great REcession, since they did not mingle casino gambling with normal commercial banking operations. Also municipal and state banks, as in North Dakota (which has never failed in 80 yrs), can represent ordinary people rather than rich owners and investors. There are many ways to move beyond capitalism, and the youth have already done so, since a Gallup poll in 2011 found they favored socialism over capitalism, and this year, all the polls showed that in a matchup, Sanders, a lifelong socialists of the mild social democratic variety, beat Clinton handily and crushed Trump. The times, they are a changin......we are primed to win in 2020 with a progressive President to represent the American people, most of whom are progressive according to all polls and support for single payer, raising the minimum wage, universal background checks, etc etc. Our times has come, not a minute too soon, as I am 75. All we need is solidarity, and we will win. Thank you for your wide commentary.

Local-currency bonds fall the most since 2008 financial crisis Currency volatility and hedging costs show no sign of panic Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp The selloff in emerging markets after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election was intense. A closer look reveals that things aren’t as bad as they might seem. While local-currency bonds suffered their biggest losses last week since 2008 following the Republican’s surprise victory, a gauge of volatility in developing-market currencies remained 16 percent below the levels seen in February. The cost to hedge against foreign-exchange losses is 38 percent cheaper than it was in August 2015 when China’s yuan devaluation rattled global investors. In a global bond selloff fueled by expectations that Trump will increase government spending, emerging-market traders are by no means capitulating. While bracing for the risks of protectionist policies, they’re betting faster growth and narrowing current-account deficits will help most developing countries weather the rout. The recent declines have “created a great buying opportunity,” said Koon Chow, a strategist at Union Bancaire Privee Ubp SA in London. “We could get to the stage where, in one or two weeks time, U.S. Treasury yields stabilize, and if that happens, emerging markets will come back.” While it’s too early to call a bottom, Chow said domestic bonds in Brazil and Russia start to look attractive, together with the Colombian and Peruvian currencies. Asian exchange rates are likely to remain under pressure, he said. More than $1.2 trillion was wiped off the value of global bonds last week as Trump’s win bolstered the view that a government spending splurge may accelerate U.S. growth and inflation.  Emerging markets were among the hardest-hit as the real-estate mogul pledged on the campaign trail to pull America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, brand China a currency manipulator and build a wall along the border with Mexico. Restrained Selling Since the Nov. 8 election, developing-nation local-currency bonds have tumbled 7.3 percent through Nov. 11, the biggest three-day slump since October 2008. The decline cut the bonds’ return this year to 8.5 percent. Investors yanked a record $301 million from BlackRock Inc.’s $8.9 billion emerging-market fixed-income fund on Nov. 10. On Monday, U.S. 30-year yields rose to 3 percent for the first time since January. In the currency market, Mexico’s peso plunged 12 percent to a record while the Brazilian real and South Africa’s rand have lost more than 7.8 percent each. On Monday, the Malaysian ringgit sank to a nine-month low and South Korea’s won depreciated to the weakest since June. Still, there are indications that the selloff may be limited. While hedging costs in the currency market increased to a five-month high of 4.3 percent on Nov. 10, they were lower than those of 6.9 percent in August 2015, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. At 11.3 percent, JPMorgan’s gauge of currency volatility is below this year’s high of 13.4 percent set in February. Stronger Fundamentals One reason is that emerging-market countries are on a stronger footing now compared with three years ago during the so-called taper tantrum when then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s signal to reduce monetary stimulus sent a shock wave through global markets. Developing-nation local-currency bonds lost about 16 percent in less than four months. Economic growth is picking up this year for the first time since 2010, with Brazil and Russia digging themselves out of recessions, the International Monetary Fund estimates. The average shortfall of current accounts in South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, India and Indonesia, a group branded as the “fragile five” by Morgan Stanley in 2013, has shrunk to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, from a record 5 percent in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign reserves have increased in countries including Indonesia and India, providing them with ammunition to defend their currencies. “Fundamentals are much stronger than going into the taper tantrum.” said Paul McNamara, a money manager at GAM UK Ltd. The selloff “just strikes me as a little bit extreme,” he said. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. warn that the rout is likely to deepen. Trump’s protectionist overtures, if acted upon, would slow exports from and reduce investments to developing markets, they say. In addition, central banks in the U.S., Europe and Japan are either ready to raise borrowing costs or stop easing further, dragging Treasuries yields up and putting pressure on emerging markets, Citigroup’s analyst Dirk Willer wrote in a note Friday. Local debt in Mexico, Poland and Hungary are most vulnerable to rising U.S. yields, he said. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that investors are overweighting domestic bonds and have hedged between about 10 percent and 30 percent of their currency exposure in Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. If the selloff extends, investors may have to cut their holdings and increase their purchases of insurance, exacerbating the decline. For now, McNamara said he’s willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. He’s looking to buy the South African rand once there’s some clarity about the direction of the new U.S. government. “We just sit tight at the moment,” said McNamara, whose Julius Baer Local Emerging Bond Fund returned 13 percent this year. “All the negative is based on various assumptions. We’ve got very little hard evidence in terms of what the new administration is going to mean for emerging markets.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By Mark Williams The Columbus Dispatch  •  Saturday November 12, 2016 6:49 AM If you’re looking for a job as a truck driver, nurse or restaurant server, there are a plethora of help-wanted ads seeking your attention. But for others, the number of employment ads statewide shrank in September, continuing a trend seen all year. OhioMeansJobs, a state website that lists job openings, reported 174,755 job-opening ads in September, down 4,481 from August and down 35,333 from a year ago. The number of ads spiked to nearly 240,000 in December. The website combines job listings from websites, newspapers and other sources. At any one time, about 10 percent to 20 percent of the job ads are redundant or are several weeks old. The largest number of ads in the state are for truck drivers (8,033), followed by ads for registered nurses (4,920). Bob Evans Farms had the most job-opening ads in September of any individual company with 2,339. The number of job-opening ads in central Ohio also has been trending lower for much of the year. There were 38,270 ads in September, down 855 from August and down 6,119 from September 2015. The largest number sought truck drivers and retail salespeople. JPMorgan Chase & Co., central Ohio’s largest employer, was responsible for 671 ads. Bob Evans was second with 562. The trend toward fewer help-wanted ads is not a sign of trouble ahead, and the number of available positions is much the same as they have been for the past several years, economists say. The plateauing of job openings is being seen nationally, as well. The state and nation as a whole have been adding jobs for nearly seven years after the worst recession since the Great Depression, even though the economy has been growing only modestly for much of that period. “You can only expand so long at such a pace. You have to slow down eventually,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide. “We still have a very high number of job openings,” Mekael Teshome, a PNC Bank economist, said of the national report. “That’s a good sign. What we have in the past year is unsustainable. What we have is moderating, but still good.” The fact that there are still so many openings in Ohio and nationally suggest that employers still are having trouble finding people with the skills and experience they want. “There’s still a gap,” Teshome said. “That’s more of a longer-term policy issue where we have the challenge of businesspeople finding the right people for jobs they want to hire for.” mawilliams@ dispatch.com @BizMarkWilliams Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

The widely held view was that a victory by Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election would spur a dollar rout as investors anticipated uncertainty and financial-market volatility that would cause the Federal Reserve to delay interest-rate increases. Yet the real estate magnate’s upset win triggered the opposite reaction -- a bonanza for greenback bulls and one of the most stunning rallies since the financial crisis. Scott Petruska, a three-decade veteran of the foreign-exchange industry, counts himself among those who didn’t anticipate the Republican sweep of Congress that accompanied Trump’s triumph. Investors are betting the power of the executive and legislative branches combined will open the fiscal tap, boosting economic growth and spurring faster inflation. The net result of that scenario is that expectations are mounting for a higher Fed rate target, boosting the appeal of holding dollars. "It probably ranks as one of the biggest surprises in the currency market in the past 30 years," said Petruska, a Newton, Massachusetts-based senior adviser at SVB Financial Group. "We have a Republican president and a Republican Congress -- things may actually happen after eight years of gridlock in Washington." The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, surged almost 2.8 percent this week, the most since September 2011. Gains were steepest against emerging-market currencies, including a 9.6 percent appreciation against the Mexican peso. Consensus Defied The most accurate forecasters in a recent Bloomberg survey had predicted more than a 5 percent slump in the dollar against the yen should Trump win. On election night, the greenback tumbled as much as 3.8 percent, then soared as investors turned their focus to Trump policies seen as spurring growth and inflation. His pledges include spending from about $500 billion to $1 trillion over a decade on roads, bridges and airports. He said in his victory speech that he aims to make America’s infrastructure “second to none” while putting millions of people to work and doubling economic growth. Traders see an 84 percent chance the Fed will increase rates at its December meeting, up from 76 percent at the end of last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on futures. To JPMorgan Chase & Co., the world’s second-biggest currency trader, some of the president-elect’s policies may serve to drive the dollar even higher against emerging-market counterparts. He’s been relatively silent in recent days regarding the protectionist trade measures that helped him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton -- the kind of policy that may spur a trade war. Yet that reprieve may not last, according to John Normand, JPMorgan’s head of foreign-exchange, commodities and international rates research. Any souring in trade relations would boost the greenback against emerging-market peers on the prospect of a slowdown in business with developing nations. "Trade may be dormant for no more than a couple of months, and motivates our recommendations" to be bullish on the dollar against Asian currencies like the South Korean won, Normand said in a report Thursday.

It was perhaps the most surprising trade in a record-setting week on Wall Street: How quickly investors swapped presidential pre-election jitters for enthusiasm at Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. That enthusiasm — call it the Trump rally — ultimately propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to consecutive all-time highs this week and gave the Standard and Poor's 500 index its biggest weekly gain in two years. The rally lost some steam Friday, pulling the S&P 500 slightly lower. The Dow rose 39.78 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,847.66. The S&P 500 index fell 3.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,164.45. The Nasdaq composite index gained 28.32 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,237.11. For months, investors viewed Trump and his proposed agenda as a more risky bet for the economy and the markets than his rival, who had been widely perceived as the candidate most likely to keep the status quo in place. But then the billionaire won. And, more importantly, Republicans retained majorities in the House and Senate, ensuring that the president-elect's party will be in control when he takes office Jan. 20. “I don't think people planned on a straight Republican sweep,” said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. “All of a sudden you realize some of the things that the markets have been wishing for have a chance to be done. That's why we've rallied so much. This scenario was such a low probability, nobody was planning for it.” Investors are now betting that Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress will have a clear pathway to boost infrastructure spending, cut taxes and relax regulations that affect energy, finance and other businesses. That agenda flipped investors' priorities this week away from defensive assets like bonds, utilities and phone companies, which traders had favored for much of this year, to health care, industrial and financial stocks, which notched their best week since 2009. Health care stocks are perhaps the best example of how investors' mindset has changed in just a few days. The sector had been one of the worst performers this year in anticipation that Clinton would push to expand the government's role in health care and curb price increases by drugmakers. That began to turn around this week, as investors bid up shares in pharmaceutical companies. Banks were seen to be potentially hurt by a Clinton win. But this week they went from being a laggard to one of the biggest gainers. The sector is benefiting from the expectation that the Trump administration will remove some of the regulations imposed on banks following the 2008 financial crisis. “You're seeing strength in those sectors that are going to best be positioned for those changes,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “There's been a massive shift toward a pro-growth bias within portfolios.” Investors also are betting that Trump's policies will lead to higher interest rates, which benefits banks by making it more profitable to lend money. The anticipation of higher interest rates fueled the sell-off in bonds this week that sent bond prices lower and drove up the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to the highest level since January. On Monday it was 1.83 percent. It hit 2.14 percent as of late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday in observance of Veterans' Day. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages. The move away from bonds, utilities and other safe-play assets is likely to continue as long as investors believe that Trump's economic policies will lead to growth in the economy and usher in higher interest rates. “You've seen people rotating out of them this week because they don't feel the need for the straight safety play, they don't need necessarily the yield of the safe stocks longer-term if they believe that the interest rate market is going to continue higher,” Kinahan said. Despite the market's enthusiasm this week, there is still an element of uncertainty about the Trump administration. Kinahan worries about the impact on the economy should inflation rise quickly. “That's a major worry,” he said. Then there's the question of what steps Trump will take to clamp down on illegal immigration and to renegotiate trade deals with other countries. “What sounded great on the campaign trail may not be actually so great to a lot of businesses, particularly technology,” Kinahan said.

Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Nov 11, 2016 at 6:45PM The stock market finished the week Friday on a mixed note, with the Dow and Nasdaq gaining ground even as the S&P 500 fell slightly. The ambiguous results of the day reflected the ongoing effort among investors to predict economic conditions beyond January 20, when the new president-elect will take office. Some stocks performed quite badly, however, and Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM), Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), and Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH) were among the worst decliners on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Image source: Newmont Mining. Newmont Mining deals with a plunging gold market Newmont Mining finished the day down 9%, reflecting further declines in the gold market. Gold bullion prices fell another $32 per ounce Friday, finishing the week at $1,226 per ounce and brining its losses just since early Wednesday morning to nearly $115 per ounce. Even with the drop, Newmont is taking smart steps to shore up its business, with a tender offer to buy back debt helping to improve its balance sheet. Moreover, today's announcement that the first gold from the company's Long Canyon project got poured earlier in the week points to the potential for higher production from Newmont in the future. By having taken dramatic steps to improve efficiency, Newmont expects all-in cash costs for the mine to be between $500 and $600 per ounce, leaving plenty of profit even if gold prices don't behave well in the near future. ADM deals with political fears Archer-Daniels-Midland dropped 8% after the food processing specialist received a downgrade from analysts at JPMorgan. Already, the results of the presidential election have led to dramatic uncertainty about the future of relations between the U.S. and the rest of the world, and a stronger U.S. dollar against Latin American currencies could make competing countries in South America more attractive to buyers seeking exports than the U.S. markets that Archer-Daniels-Midland serves. As a result, analysts downgraded the stock to underweight, and as future policy becomes clearer, Archer-Daniels-Midland could remain exposed to even greater risks ahead. Molina Healthcare feels a bit ill Finally, Molina Healthcare lost about 6%. The Medicaid-heavy health insurance plan provider has had a tough week, with losses totaling nearly 20% since Tuesday as the future of the Affordable Care Act is under serious threat from the president-elect's imminent policy moves early next year. If new healthcare reform de-emphasizes the role of state Medicaid plans in providing health insurance coverage to Americans, then Molina will have to look closely at its business model to see if it needs to shift away from its focus on government programs and toward greater provision of private healthcare coverage. It's too early to tell exactly what health insurance will look like in 2017 and beyond, but investors in Molina aren't happy with the uncertainty at this point.

Kinahan, TD Ameritrade’s chief strategist. “All of a sudden you realize some of the things that the markets have been wishing for have a chance to be done. That’s why we’ve rallied so much. This scenario was such a low probability, nobody was planning for it.” Investors are now betting that Trump and a Republican-controlled congress will have a clear pathway to boost infrastructure spending, cut taxes and relax regulations that affect energy, finance and other businesses. That agenda flipped investors’ priorities this week away from defensive assets like bonds, utilities and phone companies, which traders had favored for much of this year, to health care, industrial and financial stocks, which notched their best week since 2009. The trades mark a reversal from the last couple of years, when investors coped with government gridlock, sluggish economic growth and low interest rates by prizing less-risky assets and stocks like phone companies and utilities with high dividends. Health care stocks are perhaps the best example of how investors’ mindset has changed in just a few days. The sector had been one of the worst performers this year in anticipation that Clinton, who had mostly maintained a lead in the polls, would push to expand the government’s role in health care and curb price increases by drugmakers. That began to turn around this week, as investors bid up shares in pharmaceutical companies. Banks also were seen to be potentially hurt by a Clinton win. But this week they went from being a laggard to one of the biggest gainers. The sector is benefiting from the expectation that the Trump administration will remove some of the regulations imposed on banks following the 2008 financial crisis. “You’re seeing strength in those sectors that are going to best be positioned for those changes,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “There’s been a massive shift toward a pro-growth bias within portfolios.” Investors also are betting that Trump’s policies will lead to higher interest rates, which benefits banks by making it more profitable to lend money. The anticipation of higher interest rates fueled the sell-off in bonds this week that sent bond prices lower and drove up the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to the highest level since January. On Monday it was 1.83 percent. It hit 2.14 percent as of late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday in observance of Veterans Day. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages. The move away from bonds, utilities and other safe-play assets is likely to continue as long as investors believe that Trump’s economic policies will lead to growth in the economy and usher in higher interest rates. “You’ve seen people rotating out of them this week because they don’t feel the need for the straight safety play, they don’t need necessarily the yield of the safe stocks longer-term if they believe that the interest rate market is going to continue higher,” Kinahan said. Despite the market’s enthusiasm this week, there is still an element of uncertainty about the Trump administration. Kinahan worries about the impact on the economy should inflation rise quickly. “That’s a major worry,” he said. Then there’s the question of what steps Trump will take to clamp down on illegal immigration and to renegotiate trade deals with other countries. “What sounded great on the campaign trail may not be actually so great to a lot of businesses, particularly technology,” Kinahan said. In energy futures trading Friday, benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.25, or 2.8 percent, to close at $43.41 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid $1.09, or 2.4 percent, to close at $44.75 a barrel in London. Among metals, the price of gold tumbled $42.10, or 3.3 percent, to $1,224.30 an ounce, while silver slid $1.36, or 7.2 percent, to $17.38 an ounce. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 106.78 yen from 106.83 yen late Thursday. The euro slid to $1.0845 from $1.0890. The Mexican peso continued to drop, as investors worried about Trump’s promises to scrap trade deals and build a wall along the border. One dollar bought 20.94 pesos on Friday, more than the 19.61 pesos it bought late Thursday. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The initial terror of the win by the proudly anti-establishment candidate quickly gave way to aggressive buying as traders realized his aggressive tax cut, infrastructure spending and militia-buildup plans amount to a huge, if unfunded, fiscal stimulus.

In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, the S&P 500 Index gave back 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5% and the Russell 2000 finished 2.5% higher. The dollar was mostly higher, gold extended its recent selloff falling another 3.5% and oil was under pressure losing 2.8%.© Provided by InvestorPlace 111116-DJI Treasury bond trading was closed for the holiday, but bond ETFs continued their recent weakness with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) down 0.6% to cap a 7.4% decline for the week.

Processor-maker Nvidia (NVDA) surged 29.7% thanks to a huge third-quarter earnings and revenue beat driven by solid demand for its GPUs with applications not only in computer gaming, but with exposure to emerging technologies in VR, autonomous driving and AI/deep learning. And Walt Disney (DIS) shrugged off overnight weakness to rise 2.9% after reporting a top- and bottom-line quarterly miss on a 13% drop in ESPN revenue as investors were emboldened by management talk of over-the-top offerings. Energy stocks were the laggards, down 1.7%. On the economic front, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment reading for November hit 91.6, beating the 87.5 expected and the 87.2 reported in October. The rise was driven by an improved outlook for the economy and was collected prior to the election outcome. Notably, inflation expectations rose to 2.7% from 2.4% in the prior month. Watch for rising inflation to be a growing theme of discussion on Wall Street in the weeks to come as Trump’s election has spooked the bond market into drastically repricing their outlook for prices. We are in the late stages of the business cycle, with corporate profits sliding, the unemployment rate below 5%, and evidence wage gains are building. Thus, Trump’s plans to boost the economy risk lifting inflation more than growth according to Capital Economics. Especially if mixed with a more aggressive renegotiation of trade policies enforced by tariffs and an encouragement of the return of manufacturing production to the United States. Trade barriers, in all forms, essentially raises the costs of imports — which directly influences the inflation rate. For a sense of scale, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates Trump’s policies could double the national debt at a cost of $12 trillion over the next 10 years. To merely stabilize the national debt, U.S. GDP growth would need to accelerate to 5.4% vs. the 2.1% growth currently projected. To balance the budget, growth would need to hit a whopping 10.3%. Wall Street is ignoring the fiscal risks of all this for now, but with the debt ceiling set to hit its limit in March, watch for concern to bubble up after the New Year. Over the near term, the rise in interest rates is likely to get a boost from a likely Federal Reserve interest rate hike in December — with an accompanying drag on housing, auto sales and consumer spending.© Provided by InvestorPlace 111116-EEM There is also the nagging problem of the narrowness of the stock market’s rally this week, with just four Dow stocks — Goldman Sachs (GS), Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), and Home Depot (HD) — responsible for half the index’s gain. Moreover, the performance divergence between the Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (with Big Tech stocks weak on fears of a clampdown on skilled H-1B visas used heavily by Silicon Valley) was the largest since the financial crisis. There is also the risk that chaotic weakness in emerging market currencies, with China devaluing its currency again overnight, could spark a global selloff as it has multiple times over the past two years.

That enthusiasm — call it the Trump rally — ultimately propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to consecutive all-time highs this week and gave the Standard and Poor's 500 index its biggest weekly gain in two years. The rally lost some steam Friday, pulling the S&P 500 slightly lower. The Dow rose 39.78 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,847.66. The S&P 500 index fell 3.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,164.45. The Nasdaq composite index gained 28.32 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,237.11. For months, investors viewed Trump and his proposed agenda as a more risky bet for the economy and the markets than his rival, who had been widely perceived as the candidate most likely to keep the status quo in place. But then the billionaire won. And, more importantly, Republicans retained majorities in the House and Senate, ensuring that the president-elect's party will be in control when he takes office on January 20. "I don't think people planned on a straight Republican sweep," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist.
