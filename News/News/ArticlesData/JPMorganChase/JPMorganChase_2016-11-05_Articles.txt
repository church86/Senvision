(STR/AFP/Getty Images) Credit Suisse AG is broadening its business in China, a move that puts the Swiss investment bank at odds with foreign rivals, some of which are reconsidering their China relationship after decades of slow growth and regulatory setbacks. The bank announced Nov. 2 that it will open an onshore securities brokerage through Credit Suisse Founder Securities, a joint venture in which Credit Suisse retains a 33.3 percent ownership stake. The brokerage will operate in the Qianhai free trade zone in Shenzhen, and will count both Chinese and foreign institutional investors as clients. The Swiss Bank is ramping up its China brokerage business on anticipation of greater onshore demand from the extension of the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock trading link to Shenzhen and in the future, other markets. The possible inclusion of Chinese A shares in MSCI’s widely followed global emerging markets index would also drive foreign business to Credit Suisse.  With last week’s announcement, Credit Suisse joins Goldman Sachs and UBS as the only foreign banks with brokerage capabilities in China. JPMorgan Exits Credit Suisse’s decision comes a month after JPMorgan said that it would exit its current joint venture JPMorgan First Capital. While JPMorgan has denied that the sale of its First Capital stake means a full exit from the China market, it does signal that the bank is reconsidering its business model in China. JPMorgan established the China venture in 2010 for equity and debt underwriting, and similar to Credit Suisse, owned a 33.3 percent stake. JPMorgan First Capital is profitable, but its small scale has been a drag. The joint venture generated a scant 18 million yuan ($3 million) in net profits last year. In an era where banks face increasing scrutiny from shareholders and regulators on risk management and capital deployment, Western banks have been reviewing the value of their Chinese presence. Shut Out of China The Chinese communist regime views banking as a core state industry and limits control and economic exposure foreign banks can hold. Wall Street banks must form a local joint-venture and are capped to a minority stake. Initially the ownership cap was one-third but in 2012 the threshold was increased to 49 percent, although no foreign bank has yet taken the step to increase their ownership. Source: Securities Association of China (data), Epoch Times (chart) As a whole, overseas institutions have made little headway in China since the country ostensibly opened up the market more than two decades ago. Morgan Stanley was the first foreign investment bank to set up a presence, forming China International Capital Corporation (CICC), a joint-venture with China Construction Bank. Today, CICC is no longer owned by Morgan Stanley—the firm sold its share in 2010 after the authorities refused to allow a greater ownership stake. CICC is now one of the biggest investment firms in China. Most of the foreign-domestic joint ventures are profitable, but their scale of business is often miniscule, according to data from the Securities Association of China. In 2015, UBS was the most profitable with net profits of 296 million yuan ($44 million). But that amount was only 2 percent of the profits at Citic Securities, China’s biggest investment bank. For foreign banks, that lack of operational control has made scaling the business far more difficult than previously envisioned. While China has grown to become the world’s third biggest market for bond and stock issuances, foreign investment banks haven’t been able to participate in the boom. “The foreign investment banks have been losing M&A opportunities in China,” Keith Pogson, senior partner in EY’s Asia Pacific financial services business, told Euromoney earlier this year. “There has been less paid in fees. And as returns on investment banking in China have been crushed, the investment banks have been downsizing their teams. The investment banks are in some cases being cut out of finder’s fee arrangements and are more being paid fees for negotiations and other services.” It’s telling that for a country with Asia’s biggest and the world’s second biggest economy, Goldman Sachs has been the only Western investment bank to base its Asia regional head—Mark Schwartz, who has since announced his retirement—in Beijing. Today, having a Chinese investment banking presence—once coveted—is no longer hallmark of a successful global bank. And Beijing’s draconian foreign investment policies could mean that JPMorgan’s move is only the beginning of a trend.

Duckett, a mother of four, spoke to The Associated Press about how she started her career and what role she tries to fill as a mentor and how she tries to balance work and personal life in her new job. Q: How'd you get your start in banking? This photo provided by JPMorgan Chase & Co. shows Thasunda Duckett. Duckett became the CEO of JPMorgan Chase¿s consumer banking division in late September 2016, becoming the first African-American woman promoted to such a role at the nation¿s largest bank.(Joe Vericker/PhotoBureau/JPMorgan Chase & Co. via AP) I got into banking through a program called Inroads. It's a program that prepares minorities for corporate and community leadership. Honestly, when I think about where I am today, I would say that being a part of Inroads was and still is one of the most impactful professional moments in my life. If you talk to successful minorities, specifically African-Americans, you'll be surprised how many are Inroads alums. It really is a special program. My career started at Fannie Mae, which Inroads helped me get. I grew up in the company and really believed in the mission of making home ownership affordable and accessible but I wanted to be closer to the customer. I joined JPMorgan in 2004 doing a lot of work around affordable lending and minority home ownership programs. Q: As an African-American woman, what advice would you give to young women, particularly young African-American women, who are just starting their careers? For me, I understand that I am on the shoulders of giants. To whom much is given, much is required. It is humbling to be in the position I'm in. But I go back to things that my parents instilled in me when I was younger: I knew there is no challenge I can't overcome. I want everyone to be proud of themselves. I think it's beautiful to be me, to be a woman, to be black, to be born in New York and raised in Texas because that is who I am. I tell women or other minorities to be confident in who you are and know that you do belong. I also tell a lot of the people I speak to: don't own someone else's bias and negativity. Don't subscribe to that. That's not who you are. Q: What does your typical day look like? There is no typical day, but I would say one of my constants is I work hard to make sure I see my kids before I leave in the morning. One of my special mommy moments, if you will, is my daughter Madison will make my coffee and she will write me a little note on my coffee for me to read on my way to work on the train. That is really special to me. At work, my days are like any other executive. But I try to talk to as many employees as possible to know the business from all levels. When I was made CEO of Auto, one of the first things I did was meet with the guys in the mailroom. I don't think they've ever had a CEO in the mailroom. The reason why I did that is, one, to say thank you and help them understand the role that they play in delivering customer experience. If a customer puts the wrong address on an envelope and it doesn't post on time that creates a bad customer experience. I wanted them to know how important their job was. I do also spend a lot of time mentoring people. People that want to see how great of a company this is and what type of career mobility there is here. Q: You recently created a charity. Can you tell us about it? It's called the Otis and Rosie Brown Foundation, named after my parents. What we do is we give scholarships based on character and often seed local organizations or individuals that are making an impact. Think about those unsung heroes in our community and to be able to shine that light on them and say "thank you." The website is extraordinaryis.org .

Duckett, a mother of four, spoke to The Associated Press about how she started her career and what role she tries to fill as a mentor and how she tries to balance work and personal life in her new job. Q: How’d you get your start in banking? I got into banking through a program called Inroads. It’s a program that prepares minorities for corporate and community leadership. Honestly, when I think about where I am today, I would say that being a part of Inroads was and still is one of the most impactful professional moments in my life. If you talk to successful minorities, specifically African-Americans, you’ll be surprised how many are Inroads alums. It really is a special program. My career started at Fannie Mae, which Inroads helped me get. I grew up in the company and really believed in the mission of making home ownership affordable and accessible but I wanted to be closer to the customer. I joined JPMorgan in 2004 doing a lot of work around affordable lending and minority home ownership programs. Q: As an African-American woman, what advice would you give to young women, particularly young African-American women, who are just starting their careers? For me, I understand that I am on the shoulders of giants. To whom much is given, much is required. It is humbling to be in the position I’m in. But I go back to things that my parents instilled in me when I was younger: I knew there is no challenge I can’t overcome. I want everyone to be proud of themselves. I think it’s beautiful to be me, to be a woman, to be black, to be born in New York and raised in Texas because that is who I am. I tell women or other minorities to be confident in who you are and know that you do belong. I also tell a lot of the people I speak to: don’t own someone else’s bias and negativity. Don’t subscribe to that. That’s not who you are. Q: What does your typical day look like? There is no typical day, but I would say one of my constants is I work hard to make sure I see my kids before I leave in the morning. One of my special mommy moments, if you will, is my daughter Madison will make my coffee and she will write me a little note on my coffee for me to read on my way to work on the train. That is really special to me. At work, my days are like any other executive. But I try to talk to as many employees as possible to know the business from all levels. When I was made CEO of Auto, one of the first things I did was meet with the guys in the mailroom. I don’t think they’ve ever had a CEO in the mailroom. The reason why I did that is, one, to say thank you and help them understand the role that they play in delivering customer experience. If a customer puts the wrong address on an envelope and it doesn’t post on time that creates a bad customer experience. I wanted them to know how important their job was. I do also spend a lot of time mentoring people. People that want to see how great of a company this is and what type of career mobility there is here. Q: You recently created a charity. Can you tell us about it? It’s called the Otis and Rosie Brown Foundation, named after my parents. What we do is we give scholarships based on character and often seed local organizations or individuals that are making an impact. Think about those unsung heroes in our community and to be able to shine that light on them and say “thank you.” The website is extraordinaryis.org . shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

Duckett, a mother of four, spoke to The Associated Press about how she started her career and what role she tries to fill as a mentor and how she tries to balance work and personal life in her new job. Q: How'd you get your start in banking? I got into banking through a program called Inroads. It's a program that prepares minorities for corporate and community leadership. Honestly, when I think about where I am today, I would say that being a part of Inroads was and still is one of the most impactful professional moments in my life. If you talk to successful minorities, specifically African-Americans, you'll be surprised how many are Inroads alums. It really is a special program. My career started at Fannie Mae, which Inroads helped me get. I grew up in the company and really believed in the mission of making home ownership affordable and accessible but I wanted to be closer to the customer. I joined JPMorgan in 2004 doing a lot of work around affordable lending and minority home ownership programs. Q: As an African-American woman, what advice would you give to young women, particularly young African-American women, who are just starting their careers? For me, I understand that I am on the shoulders of giants. To whom much is given, much is required. It is humbling to be in the position I'm in. But I go back to things that my parents instilled in me when I was younger: I knew there is no challenge I can't overcome. I want everyone to be proud of themselves. I think it's beautiful to be me, to be a woman, to be black, to be born in New York and raised in Texas because that is who I am. I tell women or other minorities to be confident in who you are and know that you do belong. I also tell a lot of the people I speak to: don't own someone else's bias and negativity. Don't subscribe to that. That's not who you are. Q: What does your typical day look like? There is no typical day, but I would say one of my constants is I work hard to make sure I see my kids before I leave in the morning. One of my special mommy moments, if you will, is my daughter Madison will make my coffee and she will write me a little note on my coffee for me to read on my way to work on the train. That is really special to me. At work, my days are like any other executive. But I try to talk to as many employees as possible to know the business from all levels. When I was made CEO of Auto, one of the first things I did was meet with the guys in the mailroom. I don't think they've ever had a CEO in the mailroom. The reason why I did that is, one, to say thank you and help them understand the role that they play in delivering customer experience. If a customer puts the wrong address on an envelope and it doesn't post on time that creates a bad customer experience. I wanted them to know how important their job was. I do also spend a lot of time mentoring people. People that want to see how great of a company this is and what type of career mobility there is here. Q: You recently created a charity. Can you tell us about it? It's called the Otis and Rosie Brown Foundation, named after my parents. What we do is we give scholarships based on character and often seed local organizations or individuals that are making an impact. Think about those unsung heroes in our community and to be able to shine that light on them and say "thank you." The website is extraordinaryis.org . © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Event chair is Suzanne L. Niedland, managing director of BusEyeFilms, LLC, a member of the Cultural Council's board of directors and former board chair of the Burt Reynolds Institute of Film & Theatre, and the Spotlight Luncheon is being sponsored by JPMorgan Chase & Co., Palm Beach Modern + Contemporary, An International Fair Presented by Art Miami and the Perry J. Cohen Foundation. Bernie Taupin Renowned internationally for his 50-year song-writing partnership with Sir Elton John and so many other recognized music accomplishments, as a life-long creative, Bernie Taupin is also an author, writer, poet, painter, sculptor, performer and composer. At the Cultural Council's Spotlight Luncheon, we will discuss his career and evolution as a lifelong, multidisciplinary "Artist". Describing his artistic style as "primal, intimate and organic," Bernie Taupin says, "As artists, we all struggle to find an original voice and escape the hindrance of labels. I'm gratified that serious art collectors and dealers are accepting and showing my work." Arriving in New York and starting his legendary musical journey in 1970, this 20-year old English country-lad was captivated by American culture and the modernist art of the 1960s and 70s. Inspired by the freedoms found in Abstract Expressionism and the emerging pop art, Taupin's "American" passions formed the foundations of much of his work. Reading Taupin's words turned into lyrics, one can see the consistency with his visual art. Taupin became an American citizen many years ago and over the past 15 years perfected painting to his self-satisfaction. Being inspired by the classics in literature and history of America and the American-West, utilizing found and repurposed materials including the ultimate American symbol, the American flag, Taupin's current aesthetic questions yet give tribute to this country. "Creating Artwork is a 24/7 endeavor," adds Taupin. "It's how I see myself now." How to Get Tickets: Individual tickets for the Spotlight Luncheon with Bernie Taupin are $150, while VIP tickets are $500 each and include the 10:30 a.m. pre-reception in the lobby of the Cohen Pavilion, where a first view of Taupin's artwork will be exhibited and available for acquisition with proceeds benefitting the Cultural Council and the Perry J. Cohen Foundation.  Attendees at the VIP Reception will also enjoy a meet-and-greet with the celebrated artist. Tickets and table sponsorships are available by contacting the Cultural Council's Kodie Ann Walcott at (561) 472-3342 or by email at kwalcott@palmbeachculture.com.

File photo: AP New York: Investors increased their hedges against Donald Trump pulling off a stunning upset in the US presidential election even as Hillary Clinton’s slide in the polls eased on the penultimate trading day before the vote. With traders worried that expectations for a status quo outcome—Democrat in the White House kept in check by Republicans in Congress—could be upended, the S&P 500 index fell for the ninth straight session, its longest losing streak since a few weeks after Ronald Reagan’s 1980 election. Clinton’s lead has plunged since the Federal Bureau of Investigation reignited controversy over her e-mail practices on 28 October, driving haven assets up and riskier ones down, as shown by this chart: On Friday, almost all of those assets became more hedged against a Trump win even as Clinton’s edge increased for the first time in a week, albeit by less than half a percentage point. The exceptions were the Japanese yen, a traditional safe harbour, and Mexico’s peso, with the former falling a bit from the day before and the latter rising 0.8%. Also Read: Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump 48-43% in Washington Post-ABC poll The week’s trend away from riskier investments is in line with—though less dramatic than—what analysts predict if the Republican prevails, much like the aftermath of the UK’s June vote to leave the European Union. “In case of a Trump win, we envision a violent flight to quality,” Barclays Plc said in a report. A Democratic sweep may also be disruptive, but that possibility is increasingly remote. JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised a third potential surprise in a report that it said would produce a similar market reaction. The title: “I demand a recount.” What happens if nobody wins the presidency: QuickTake Q&A The recent moves reflect worries that investors aren’t sure whether to believe reassurances from analysts at Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and elsewhere that Clinton remains more likely to win. Over the longer term, both candidates want to increase spending and cut taxes, which would be bullish for stocks and bearish for fixed income. Clinton Wins: “The market has already priced in a Clinton victory,” said Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays Plc said in a report that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3 percent. Beyond an initial “risk-relief rally on the prospect of policy continuity and predictability,” Deutsche Bank AG said that Clinton’s plans to limit the capital gains tax break may “have negative/dampening impact on some key risk bellwether assets like equities into the turn of the year.” The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley said in a report, citing the risk of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan. Moves against carried-interest rules that benefit asset managers, also targeted by Trump, would hurt firms including Janus Capital Group Inc. and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. Under Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs,” BlackRock Inc. researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising costs. Citigroup Inc. cut its rating on the European health-care industry to underweight in September, citing US election risks. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk A/S and Roche Holding AG have trailed the broader market this year as Clinton’s prospects rose, with the shares gaining only during times when her polling numbers fell. Hospital operators and Medicaid providers such as HCA Holdings Inc. and Universal Health Services Inc. may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Strategas Research Partners, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers, with Morgan Stanley touting the prospects of Sunrun Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. under Clinton. Strategas also likes First Solar Inc. in that scenario. Evercore ISI adds General Electric Co., Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Exelon Corp. to the list in its pre-election report. A Democratic sweep increases the odds for a minimum wage hike, which cuts both ways for consumer stocks, Morgan Stanley said. Also Read: US stocks post longest slide since 1980, bonds rise amid angst Trump Wins: “Valuations of US equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive selloff,” CMC’s Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event,” she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3% in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Barclays predicted an S&P 500 nosedive of as much as 13% if Trump wins. Citigroup equity strategist Tobias Levkovich put the hit at no more than 5 percent in a report. Judging the Republican’s longer-term impact is difficult to assess because “some of Trump’s policy proposals are so unconventional (trade, immigration) and others so vague (fiscal),” said John Normand, JPMorgan’s head of foreign exchange, commodities and international rates research, in a report on Friday. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual US stocks. Even some of these sectors, however, face Trump-related risks. He favours repealing Obamacare and allowing the importation of prescription drugs, which could hurt pharmaceutical companies, Morgan Stanley said. And finance companies may prefer Trump, but BlackRock warned that repealing the post-crisis Dodd-Frank law, derided by the industry’s Republican allies, may result in “simpler and blunter but equally onerous rules.” Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure, such as Caterpillar Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Corp., would have bigger opportunities for government work under Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, Credit Suisse said. Morgan Stanley sees NRG Energy Inc., which uses coal to produce electricity, benefiting under a Republican White House, due to less regulation and slower growth in the use of renewables. The bank said consumer stocks could be hurt by a Trump win because tougher immigration restrictions could crimp labour supply and consumer demand. The Japanese stock market may get hit harder than others, falling as much as 10% due to the yen strengthening, Citigroup said Friday in a report. “There could be investment opportunities in infrastructure names and military-related stocks in any subsequent correction,” the report said, citing Hitachi Ltd., Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., among others. Bonds Clinton wins: A victory by the Democrat would initially drive up yields as investors sell off Treasuries in favor of riskier assets, Bank of America Corp. analysts said in a report. Ripple effects would raise borrowing costs for individuals and corporations worldwide because US sovereigns are the global debt benchmark. Yields on 10-year US bonds have risen as much as 36 basis points since Clinton’s lead over Trump started widening in late July, and the bank’s analysts called the Democratic Party’s improving prospects “a major factor” behind that move. They’ve fallen a bit since the 28 October announcement that the FBI would examine more Clinton-related e-mails. Market participants surveyed by Ian Lyngen, head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, predicted an average increase of 5 basis points if Clinton wins, he said. Normand sees a much smaller reaction, titling the Clinton section of his report “next to nothing changes.” Over the longer term, a Clinton victory would do little to yields— as long as Republicans retain control of at least one chamber of Congress—because her fiscal stimulus would be relatively small, especially compared to Trump’s plans for bigger tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. A Democratic sweep would likely result in more spending and may drive yields higher. Municipal debt could gain under Clinton because any increased taxes she imposes on the wealthy would make tax-free bonds more attractive, BlackRock said. Trump wins: In the two weeks after the UK gobsmacked pollsters and voted to leave the EU on 23 June, the US benchmark 10-year yield fell 39 basis points and didn’t return to pre-Brexit levels until September. Something akin to that may happen if Trump defies conventional wisdom. Credit Agricole SA predicts a “massive disjoint” that would send 10-year yields down at least 10 basis points if he prevails. Lyngen’s survey average predicted a smaller drop. JPMorgan’s Normand said the yield would fall below 1.7 % in the days after a Trump win, from 1.78% on Friday. After the dust settles, Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure-spending plans may drive yields back up, especially if Republicans hold both the House and Senate. That impact could be exaggerated if the Republican’s isolationist foreign policy prompts countries with large Treasury stakes to unload them, Credit Agricole analysts said. Fiscal largess would also benefit inflation-linked bonds, which already are outperforming nominal securities this year. Yields would only remain flat under Trump, according to Bank of America, in the unlikeliest event of all: President Trump finds himself up against Democrats controlling both houses of Congress, because they would resist his massive tax cuts. Also Read: Does Trump have enough ‘hidden’ supporters to win? Trump’s support for fossil fuels could spur a rebound for energy industry bonds, especially high-yield ones, after two years of major losses in the commodities slump, Wells Fargo & Co. said in a report. As for munis, “Trump’s plan to slash personal tax rates could deal a blow to the asset class,” BlackRock’s report said. Currencies Clinton wins: The US dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies, with the Democrat heading toward the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London research firm. Down the road, Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Emerging-market currencies would see “modest and transitory” gains because a Clinton win “is mostly—but not fully—priced in,” though Russia may be an exception, Societe Generale SA said in a report. Mexico’s peso would benefit the most, the report said. It has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, moving in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who wants to revamp trade deals, restrict immigration and make the US’s southern neighbour pay for a border wall. If Clinton triumphs, the peso would strengthen to 18.25 per dollar, a 4.3% gain from Friday, and the Canadian dollar would also rise, though not quite as much, Normand of JPMorgan said. Elsewhere, most Asian currencies would rally 2% or so in relief, said Cliff Tan, a strategist in Hong Kong for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Trump wins: The foreign-exchange markets this week are suggesting what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against most major currencies and the Mexican peso bucking the trend as one of the worst performers against the greenback. Societe Generale sees Mexico’s currency weakening 17% from Friday’s close to 23 per dollar, while Bank of America said traders already “have gone a long way toward pricing in a surprise Trump victory.” JPMorgan’s Normand predicted one-day slides of 8% for the peso and 5 percent for the Canadian dollar—based on a President Trump’s power to impose protectionist measures unilaterally. The currencies of the US’s neighbours would then recover some, he said, with Mexico’s central bank intervening to defend the peso and Congress moving to restrain Trump’s trade policies. Other developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc may also gain on concern that China would dump US assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy, analysts said. Normand sees the yen gaining 3%. Commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian dollar also “would lose ground,” BMO said. The greenback could then rally in a three- to nine-month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. The candidate’s hostility toward China—including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation—likely would drive the offshore yuan down about 3% by year’s end, said Ken Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities Co. in Beijing. Risk aversion in the aftermath of a Trump win would also push down other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stances could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. That “could be negative for high-yielder countries,” Credit Agricole said in a report. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions that Trump has raised about the need for US troops on the North Korean border. If Republicans sweep, the euro might fall against the dollar, BMO said, because they would be inclined to open a foreign-earnings repatriation window for American companies to bring money back home, and “a high concentration of US-based multinationals’ earnings are held” in Europe. Emerging markets Clinton wins: It’ll be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defense shares because Clinton comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA Ltd. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that U.S. demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Nadia Kazakova, a Russian oil and gas specialist for Saxo Group, said she’s not convinced the country would benefit economically from Trump. If he wins, the global shock “could strike Russian markets much harder than others” due to risk aversion and falling commodities. “And as Trump makes America great again, would he still have the heart for a great deal with not-so-great Russia?” she wrote in a report. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10 percent, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. The Institute for International Finance explained why in a report on Thursday: “Nearly 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the U.S.,” and “workers’ remittances are one of the three largest sources of foreign currency,” behind oil and tourism. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies such as Cemex SAB de CV may be positioned for contracts to build Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong, by phone. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist US policies also would be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports,” said Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Yang adds Southeast Asia exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Citigroup called Latin America “most vulnerable” to US protectionism. To the extent that Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the US, Yang said. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins,” due to their robust domestic growth, Peng said. Commodities Clinton wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump Wins: Natural gas prices likely would suffer as coal benefits under Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the US power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated that a victory by the Republican would shave 11% off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Trump continues with the “bellicose language that’s been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. JPMorgan’s Normand sees Brent crude oil rising to $54 a barrel by year’s end, an 18% gain from Friday, but not before falling 5 percent initially “in sympathy with equities, much as occurred after Brexit.” Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Trump wins, said Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. Since the day before the FBI’s surprise announcement about the Clinton e-mail inquiry on 28 October, all precious metals have risen, with silver and gold up 4.5% and 2.9%, respectively. Normand sees gold immediately rising to $1,350 an ounce if Trump wins, 3.4% higher than Friday, before retreating in the next month to $1,225. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium” based on his plans to boost spending on bridges, roads and the like. Normand disagrees, calling Trump’s “gargantuan infrastructure ambitions” too vague and unrealistic to support base-metal prices for long. Given the danger his trade agenda poses to Asian growth, he sees copper immediately falling 3% if Trump wins.

No matter who wins the election, here's why the economy will take a hit next week CNBC 11/6/2016 Eric Chemi © Provided by CNBC While the election and the economy have been the major focus of discussion this week, a seemingly small change this weekend could lead to a significant drop in consumer spending. Quotes in the article DST Systems Inc DST ▲ 104.79 +1.63 +1.58% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 77.71 -0.31 -0.40% A recent study by the JPMorgan Chase Institute showed that when daylight saving time (DST) ends, there's a 3.5 percent drop in credit card spending in the following 30 days. In particular, consumer spending on goods drops more than services, and weekday spending drops more than weekends. JPMorgan (JPM) has access to millions of credit card transactions on its network, and the anonymized data allows the company to see exactly how consumer behavior changes immediately as a result of the one-hour shift. © Provided by CNBC When DST begins in the spring, there is a 0.9 percent increase in daily credit card spending per capita in Los Angeles. But the 3.5 percent drop in spending that happens when DST ends means the total economic effect of DST is a net loss. Remember, this weekend's end of DST means we "fall back," turning our clocks back an hour. We all sleep an extra hour, making the mornings brighter and the evenings darker. According to JPMorgan's data, grocery stores (down 6 percent per day per capita) suffered the most among consumer goods categories. Contrast that with health care, which saw almost no drop. That makes sense, because those types of decisions aren't going to change because of the time difference. © Provided by CNBC You can really see the stark difference when comparing weekday spending versus weekend spending. All of a sudden, weeknights lose an hour of light, digging into the limited time people had in the first place to shop then anyway.© Provided by CNBC If that's not bad enough, data from New York City show that the end of DST has a direct effect on the deaths of pedestrians, who are being hit by automobiles that are now being driven more in the dark. TheNew York Times recently reported on the issue, saying the city's Department of Transportation is concerned about added darkness increasing the danger to pedestrians during the evening commute. The city will spend $1.5 million on a "dusk and darkness" advertising campaign. Last year, there were nine pedestrian fatalities in the first eight days after DST ended on November 1. The city provides the full data on pedestrian deaths by the time of day and the week of year. While a lot of people are concerned the election could hurt economic spending and endanger people in the streets, here's the thing: It's going to happen no matter what.

Americans spend less, study shows By Sarah Ponczek Bloomberg Comments Email Print Economy Retail Daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. Sunday, when clocks are to turn back 1 hour. The clocks turn back this weekend, giving most Americans an extra hour to cash in on sleep. But new research finds they tend to spend less money with fewer hours of daily sunlight. A study by J.P. Morgan Chase Institute compared purchases by credit and debit card users with its parent bank in two southwest U.S. cities: Los Angeles, which adjusts in and out of daylight saving time, and Phoenix, which follows mountain time year round. Los Angeles saw a 0.9 percent increase, relative to Phoenix, in daily card spending per capita in the month after switching the clocks forward during the U.S. springtime. But the spending reductions outpaced the boost — falling 3.5 percent — after the end of daylight saving time, and losing an hour, in the autumn as the days get shorter. The spending effects vary: Switching back clocks in the fall impacts goods more than services while spending tends to drop more on workdays than weekends, the institute said. Grocery stores recorded the biggest decline, shedding almost 6 percent of daily retail per capita spending, followed by fuel sellers, retail shops and discount stores at more than 4.5 percent each.  The magnitude of change is smaller for restaurants probably because people eat at night no matter what time the sun goes down, and on health care and personal/professional services because it’s usually necessary, not discretionary, spending, the study showed. The study comes as the debate of daylight saving time's usefulness has been thrown into the spotlight — including its effects on everything from people's health to energy conservation. Legislation to abolish DST in California almost made it through the state’s Legislature, before the Senate squashed it in August. It followed movements over recent years in states such as Arizona, Florida and Michigan to consider changing how they observe time. The J.P. Morgan Chase Institute conducted the analysis using anonymized data from 450,000 customers for four time-change periods of each kind between October 2012 to June 2015.

With traders worried that expectations for a status quo outcome -- Democrat in the White House kept in check by Republicans in Congress -- could be upended, the S&P 500 index fell for the ninth straight session, its longest losing streak since a few weeks after Ronald Reagan’s 1980 election. Clinton’s lead has plunged since the Federal Bureau of Investigation reignited controversy over her e-mail practices on Oct. 28, driving haven assets up and riskier ones down, as shown by this chart: On Friday, almost all of those assets became more hedged against a Trump win even as Clinton’s edge increased for the first time in a week, albeit by less than half a percentage point. The exceptions were the Japanese yen, a traditional safe harbor, and Mexico’s peso, with the former falling a bit from the day before and the latter rising 0.8 percent. The week’s trend away from riskier investments is in line with -- though less dramatic than -- what analysts predict if the Republican prevails, much like the aftermath of the U.K.’s June vote to leave the European Union. “In case of a Trump win, we envision a violent flight to quality,” Barclays Plc said in a report. A Democratic sweep may also be disruptive, but that possibility is increasingly remote. JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised a third potential surprise in a report that it said would produce a similar market reaction. The title: “I demand a recount.” What Happens If Nobody Wins the Presidency: QuickTake Q&A The recent moves reflect worries that investors aren’t sure whether to believe reassurances from analysts at Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and elsewhere that Clinton remains more likely to win. Options bets on where the S&P 500 Index will be the day after the election suggest the Democrat has a 63 percent chance of winning, less than what’s indicated by prediction markets and polling-aggregator forecasts, Janus Capital Group Inc. said in an e-mail on Saturday. Over the longer term, both candidates want to increase spending and cut taxes, which would be bullish for stocks and bearish for fixed income. Below is a look at potential winners and losers. But first, a caveat. Investors’ immediate reaction to U.S. elections often doesn’t last, as shown by this chart: With that... Stocks Clinton Wins: “The market has already priced in a Clinton victory,” said Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays Plc said in a report that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3 percent. Beyond an initial “risk-relief rally on the prospect of policy continuity and predictability,” Deutsche Bank AG said that Clinton’s plans to limit the capital gains tax break may “have negative/dampening impact on some key risk bellwether assets like equities into the turn of the year.” The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley said in a report, citing the risk of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan. Moves against carried-interest rules that benefit asset managers, also targeted by Trump, would hurt firms including Janus Capital Group Inc. and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. Under Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs,” BlackRock Inc. researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising costs. Citigroup Inc. cut its rating on the European health-care industry to underweight in September, citing U.S. election risks. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk A/S and Roche Holding AG have trailed the broader market this year as Clinton’s prospects rose, with the shares gaining only during times when her polling numbers fell. Hospital operators and Medicaid providers such as HCA Holdings Inc. and Universal Health Services Inc. may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Strategas Research Partners, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers, with Morgan Stanley touting the prospects of Sunrun Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. under Clinton. Strategas also likes First Solar Inc. in that scenario. Evercore ISI adds General Electric Co., Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Exelon Corp. to the list in its pre-election report. A Democratic sweep increases the odds for a minimum wage hike, which cuts both ways for consumer stocks, Morgan Stanley said. Trump Wins: “Valuations of U.S. equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive selloff,” CMC’s Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event,” she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3 percent in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Barclays predicted an S&P 500 nosedive of as much as 13 percent if Trump wins. Citigroup equity strategist Tobias Levkovich put the hit at no more than 5 percent in a report. Judging the Republican’s longer-term impact is difficult to assess because “some of Trump’s policy proposals are so unconventional (trade, immigration) and others so vague (fiscal),” said John Normand, JPMorgan’s head of foreign exchange, commodities and international rates research, in a report on Friday. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual U.S. stocks. Even some of these sectors, however, face Trump-related risks. He favors repealing Obamacare and allowing the importation of prescription drugs, which could hurt pharmaceutical companies, Morgan Stanley said. And finance companies may prefer Trump, but BlackRock warned that repealing the post-crisis Dodd-Frank law, derided by the industry’s Republican allies, may result in “simpler and blunter but equally onerous rules.” Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure, such as Caterpillar Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Corp., would have bigger opportunities for government work under Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, Credit Suisse said. Morgan Stanley sees NRG Energy Inc., which uses coal to produce electricity, benefiting under a Republican White House, due to less regulation and slower growth in the use of renewables. The bank said consumer stocks could be hurt by a Trump win because tougher immigration restrictions could crimp labor supply and consumer demand. The Japanese stock market may get hit harder than others, falling as much as 10 percent due to the yen strengthening, Citigroup said Friday in a report. “There could be investment opportunities in infrastructure names and military-related stocks in any subsequent correction,” the report said, citing Hitachi Ltd., Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., among others. Bonds Clinton Wins: A victory by the Democrat would initially drive up yields as investors sell off Treasuries in favor of riskier assets, Bank of America Corp. analysts said in a report. Ripple effects would raise borrowing costs for individuals and corporations worldwide because U.S. sovereigns are the global debt benchmark. Yields on 10-year U.S. bonds have risen as much as 36 basis points since Clinton’s lead over Trump started widening in late July, and the bank’s analysts called the Democratic Party’s improving prospects “a major factor” behind that move. They’ve fallen a bit since the Oct. 28 announcement that the FBI would examine more Clinton-related e-mails. Market participants surveyed by Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, predicted an average increase of 5 basis points if Clinton wins, he said. Normand sees a much smaller reaction, titling the Clinton section of his report “next to nothing changes.” Over the longer term, a Clinton victory would do little to yields -- as long as Republicans retain control of at least one chamber of Congress -- because her fiscal stimulus would be relatively small, especially compared to Trump’s plans for bigger tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. A Democratic sweep would likely result in more spending and may drive yields higher. Municipal debt could gain under Clinton because any increased taxes she imposes on the wealthy would make tax-free bonds more attractive, BlackRock said. Trump Wins: In the two weeks after the U.K. gobsmacked pollsters and voted to leave the EU on June 23, the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield fell 39 basis points and didn’t return to pre-Brexit levels until September. Something akin to that may happen if Trump defies conventional wisdom. Credit Agricole SA predicts a “massive disjoint” that would send 10-year yields down at least 10 basis points if he prevails. Lyngen’s survey average predicted a smaller drop. JPMorgan’s Normand said the yield would fall below 1.7 percent in the days after a Trump win, from 1.78 percent on Friday. After the dust settles, Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure-spending plans may drive yields back up, especially if Republicans hold both the House and Senate. That impact could be exaggerated if the Republican’s isolationist foreign policy prompts countries with large Treasury stakes to unload them, Credit Agricole analysts said. Fiscal largess would also benefit inflation-linked bonds, which already are outperforming nominal securities this year. Yields would only remain flat under Trump, according to Bank of America, in the unlikeliest event of all: President Trump finds himself up against Democrats controlling both houses of Congress, because they would resist his massive tax cuts. Trump’s support for fossil fuels could spur a rebound for energy industry bonds, especially high-yield ones, after two years of major losses in the commodities slump, Wells Fargo & Co. said in a report. As for munis, “Trump’s plan to slash personal tax rates could deal a blow to the asset class,” BlackRock’s report said. Currencies Clinton Wins: The U.S. dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies, with the Democrat heading toward the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London research firm. Down the road, Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Emerging-market currencies would see “modest and transitory” gains because a Clinton win “is mostly -- but not fully -- priced in,” though Russia may be an exception, Societe Generale SA said in a report. Mexico’s peso would benefit the most, the report said. It has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, moving in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who wants to revamp trade deals, restrict immigration and make the U.S.’s southern neighbor pay for a border wall. If Clinton triumphs, the peso would strengthen to 18.25 per dollar, a 4.3 percent gain from Friday, and the Canadian dollar would also rise, though not quite as much, Normand of JPMorgan said. Elsewhere, most Asian currencies would rally 2 percent or so in relief, said Cliff Tan, a strategist in Hong Kong for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Trump Wins: The foreign-exchange markets this week are suggesting what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against most major currencies and the Mexican peso bucking the trend as one of the worst performers against the greenback. Societe Generale sees Mexico’s currency weakening 17 percent from Friday’s close to 23 per dollar, while Bank of America said traders already “have gone a long way toward pricing in a surprise Trump victory.” JPMorgan’s Normand predicted one-day slides of 8 percent for the peso and 5 percent for the Canadian dollar -- based on a President Trump’s power to impose protectionist measures unilaterally. The currencies of the U.S.’s neighbors would then recover some, he said, with Mexico’s central bank intervening to defend the peso and Congress moving to restrain Trump’s trade policies. Other developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc may also gain on concern that China would dump U.S. assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy, analysts said. Normand sees the yen gaining 3 percent. Commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian dollar also “would lose ground,” BMO said. The greenback could then rally in a three- to nine-month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. The candidate’s hostility toward China -- including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation -- likely would drive the offshore yuan down about 3 percent by year’s end, said Ken Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities Co. in Beijing. Risk aversion in the aftermath of a Trump win would also push down other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stances could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. That “could be negative for high-yielder countries,” Credit Agricole said in a report. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions that Trump has raised about the need for U.S. troops on the North Korean border. If Republicans sweep, the euro might fall against the dollar, BMO said, because they would be inclined to open a foreign-earnings repatriation window for American companies to bring money back home, and “a high concentration of U.S.-based multinationals’ earnings are held” in Europe. Emerging Markets Clinton Wins: It’ll be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defense shares because Clinton comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA Ltd. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that U.S. demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump Wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Nadia Kazakova, a Russian oil and gas specialist for Saxo Group, said she’s not convinced the country would benefit economically from Trump. If he wins, the global shock “could strike Russian markets much harder than others” due to risk aversion and falling commodities. “And as Trump makes America great again, would he still have the heart for a great deal with not-so-great Russia?” she wrote in a report. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10 percent, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. The Institute for International Finance explained why in a report on Thursday: “Nearly 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the U.S.,” and “workers’ remittances are one of the three largest sources of foreign currency,” behind oil and tourism. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies such as Cemex SAB de CV may be positioned for contracts to build Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong, by phone. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist U.S. policies also would be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports,” said Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Yang adds Southeast Asia exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Citigroup called Latin America “most vulnerable” to U.S. protectionism. To the extent that Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the U.S., Yang said. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins,” due to their robust domestic growth, Peng said. Commodities Clinton Wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump Wins: Natural gas prices likely would suffer as coal benefits under Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the U.S. power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated that a victory by the Republican would shave 11 percent off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Trump continues with the “bellicose language that’s been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. JPMorgan’s Normand sees Brent crude oil rising to $54 a barrel by year’s end, an 18 percent gain from Friday, but not before falling 5 percent initially “in sympathy with equities, much as occurred after Brexit.” Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Trump wins, said Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. Since the day before the FBI’s surprise announcement about the Clinton e-mail inquiry on Oct. 28, all precious metals have risen, with silver and gold up 4.5 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. Normand sees gold immediately rising to $1,350 an ounce if Trump wins, 3.4 percent higher than Friday, before retreating in the next month to $1,225. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium” based on his plans to boost spending on bridges, roads and the like. Normand disagrees, calling Trump’s “gargantuan infrastructure ambitions” too vague and unrealistic to support base-metal prices for long. Given the danger his trade agenda poses to Asian growth, he sees copper immediately falling 3 percent if Trump wins. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

A recent study by the JPMorgan Chase Institute showed that when daylight saving time (DST) ends, there's a 3.5 percent drop in credit card spending in the following 30 days. In particular, consumer spending on goods drops more than services, and weekday spending drops more than weekends. JPMorgan has access to millions of credit card transactions on its network, and the anonymized data allows the company to see exactly how consumer behavior changes immediately as a result of the one-hour shift. When DST begins in the spring, there is a 0.9 percent increase in daily credit card spending per capita in Los Angeles. But the 3.5 percent drop in spending that happens when DST ends means the total economic effect of DST is a net loss. Remember, this weekend's end of DST means we "fall back," turning our clocks back an hour. We all sleep an extra hour, making the mornings brighter and the evenings darker. According to JPMorgan's data, grocery stores (down 6 percent per day per capita) suffered the most among consumer goods categories. Contrast that with health care, which saw almost no drop. That makes sense, because those types of decisions aren't going to change because of the time difference. You can really see the stark difference when comparing weekday spending versus weekend spending. All of a sudden, weeknights lose an hour of light, digging into the limited time people had in the first place to shop then anyway. Then there are the fatalities If that's not bad enough, data from New York City show that the end of DST has a direct effect on the deaths of pedestrians, who are being hit by automobiles that are now being driven more in the dark. The New York Times recently reported on the issue, saying the city's Department of Transportation is concerned about added darkness increasing the danger to pedestrians during the evening commute. The city will spend $1.5 million on a "dusk and darkness" advertising campaign. Last year, there were nine pedestrian fatalities in the first eight days after DST ended on November 1. The city provides the full data on pedestrian deaths by the time of day and the week of year. While a lot of people are concerned the election could hurt economic spending and endanger people in the streets, here's the thing: It's going to happen no matter what.

But that system tends to overlook good programmers from other schools or gifted dropouts, according to recruiters. So the industry is turning to outside firms to evaluate prospective programmers based on objective measurements, not their pedigree. Bloomberg photo by Michael Nagle.   Hugh Son Bloomberg     For almost five years, Gregory Furlong worked 50-hour weeks as a shipping clerk at a Best Buy two miles from his childhood home in Wilmington, Delaware. It was a kind of employment purgatory for a computer obsessive who tinkers with motherboards in his free time. So last year, Furlong, 30, enrolled in a three-month coding boot camp that uses HackerRank, a web platform that trains and grades people on writing computer code. After earning a top ranking for Java developers globally, Furlong was hired by JPMorgan Chase in December for its two-year technology training program. This is Wall Street's new tech meritocracy. Financial institutions traditionally coveted graduates from Stanford and other big-name schools and people already working in Silicon Valley. But that system tends to overlook good programmers from other schools or gifted dropouts, according to recruiters. And besides, banks need to fill so many programming jobs that elite schools can't possibly pump out enough candidates. So the industry is looking in places it never did, turning to outside firms to evaluate prospective programmers based on objective measurements, not their pedigree. The idea is that people lacking a computer science degree -- art majors, graphic designers and chemistry graduates from the University of Delaware like Furlong -- can still make the leap to well-paid careers in technology. By using algorithms to spot talented coders, HackerRank and competitors with names like Codility claim they've essentially increased the world's supply of developers. "This is purely about skill," said 28-year-old Vivek Ravisankar, a HackerRank co-founder who used to work for Amazon.com. "Most really good programmers learn on their own and just continue to build their skills. Probably the really good programmers are college dropouts." The service is part of a broader trend among U.S. corporations to bring data rigor into recruitment, instead of relying only on resumes and interviews. Those methods have been known to perpetuate biases and aren't always predictive of on-the-job success. Goldman Sachs said in June it was overhauling the way it hires junior staff, using resume-screening software and replacing campus interviews with video submissions that are scored. "Finding people through alternate channels, we weren't doing that five years ago," said Michael Zbranak, a managing director in JPMorgan's global technology division. "Now we absolutely do it, because we've seen it work." There are at least 500,000 technology workers at banks globally, and about 10 percent of them have to be replaced annually due to attrition, according to Chris Skinner, a London-based technology consultant to financial firms. JPMorgan, with more than 40,000 technology workers, hires thousands annually just to replace those who depart. HackerRank is free for coders and makes money from fees from corporate clients. Users perform challenges and watch video tutorials to sharpen their skills in specific coding languages such as Java; solving harder problems results in higher rankings. They can also join contests set up by employers with challenges related to jobs they want to fill. Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and hedge fund Two Sigma are among HackerRank clients, as is Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News. Finance firms aren't the only ones who need help finding coders. Other clients include retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and medical products maker Stryker Corp. BlackRock uses HackerRank to evaluate each of the several hundred programmers hired annually to work on improvements to its critical Aladdin software, the investment and risk-management platform that handles $15 trillion in assets. "The old way of doing things is you cast a wide net, you get a bunch of resumes, you start screening through the resumes manually, and you hope the person looking at them is doing a good job," said Sunil Dalal, chief operating officer of the Aladdin product group. "There's a lot left to luck." Programmers are especially ripe for merit hiring. They usually can't show recruiters the code they created for past employers because of proprietary reasons, so in the past they've been judged solely by their resumes, Ravisankar said. The opaqueness of that talent market in turn created bidding wars for graduates from schools like Stanford or top tech firms, discounting coders from elsewhere, he said. Ravisankar and Hari Karunanidhi, a former IBM Corp. engineer, started HackerRank four years ago. Working in India, the pair struggled with two failed business plans until they landed on using algorithms to evaluate programmers' code. In 2012, they were accepted into Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, and soon clients included West Coast technology firms Twitter, Yelp and Dropbox. The firm, which has a million users globally, has raised almost $28 million in funding. For Furlong, who bears a resemblance to Elijah Wood from the "Lord of the Rings" movies, his new life couldn't be more different from his Best Buy days. He's more fulfilled, he says, and he's paid off student loans with pay that's double his previous earnings. He's also replaced a 2003 Volvo with a new Subaru Impreza, which he drives to JPMorgan's year-old Wilmington tech hub, a 335,000-square-foot complex filled with 2,000 developers. "Things have changed so much," Furlong said. "There's much more opportunity for people to break through and change their lives." --- Bloomberg's Dakin Campbell contributed.

Developing-nation stocks have seesawed in 2016, first making the worst start to a year ever and then swinging to a bull market. Published: 10:36 November 5, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE London: Emerging-market share sales are tipped to rebound in 2017 from their slowest pace in more than a decade. Companies in developing nations excluding China are reviving plans for initial and secondary public offerings as they become more convinced they can generate enough demand, according to investors as well as underwriters from Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS Group AG. Sales should pick up next year, they said, once US presidential elections and the Federal Reserve’s December policy decision are out of the way. The anticipated recovery signals the rally that boosted the value of the 31 biggest emerging equity markets this year by $3.3 trillion (Dh12.1 trillion) will soon translate into appetite for primary issuance. Investors have poured $8 billion into actively managed stock funds since July, ending a 16-month stretch of outflows, according to data from EPFR Global. Active funds are a key source of capital for newly issued shares. “Issuers are more willing to engage now,” said Nick Koemtzopoulos, the head of UK and emerging-market equity capital markets at Credit Suisse in London. “We are seeing early signs of global funds doing work on emerging markets like Russia, and could see that translate into investments.” US elections Developing-nation share sales outside of China are set to drop 32 per cent per cent this year, according to Freeman & Co, a New York-based financial advisory firm. Companies have been slow to return to equity markets in part because flows into actively managed stock funds have lagged behind those that invest in bonds or exchange-traded funds. Some are also staying away as they weigh risks around the US elections on November 8, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Capital Management. “The corporates have been extremely cautious because they’ve felt the demand wouldn’t be there if they built the deal,” Anthony Cragg, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management. Developing-nation stocks have seesawed in 2016, first making the worst start to a year ever and then swinging to a bull market. Hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union caused further swings. The fragility of the rally made investors delay an unwinding of bearish bets and pushed companies to wait for greater stability, according to Georgy Egorov of UBS in London. “In order to prepare an IPO, you need at least four to five months,” said Egorov, the head of emerging-market equity capital markets at the Swiss bank. “Dramatic changes in the market have made issuers cautious on timing.” Lag effect At least twice in the past decade and a half, the IPO market took about a year to rebound after stocks started an uptrend, suggesting a lag between the two. In 2003, when a new commodity cycle spurred gains in developing-nation equities, new issues declined. The next year, share sales more than doubled. A similar trend was seen in 2009-2010. For much of 2016, the primary market was dominated by stake sales from companies in the developed world. General Electric Co sold a majority stake in its Czech banking unit at the bottom of the target-price range. Barclays Plc and UniCredit SpA, looking to strengthen capital, cut stakes in Barclays Africa Group Ltd and Poland’s Bank Pekao SA, respectively. That is now changing. The value of public offerings jumped 35 per cent to $27 billion since June from the same period last year, according to Freeman & Co, and local companies are among the major issuers. Mexico’s largest pipeline operator, Infraestructura Energetica Nova SAB de CV, raised $1.45 billion in Latin America’s biggest offering since April. Brazil’s world-beating equity performance enabled Alliar Medicos A Frente SA, a medical-diagnostics company, to raise $242 million in the country’s first IPO since 2015. South Korea’s Lotte Group revived plans for a $4.5 billion offering of its hotel unit, while Samsung Biologics Co priced its $2 billion issue at the top of the price range. “I’m cautiously optimistic,” Egorov of UBS said.

Politics Race takes center stage as heated L.A. County congressional campaign approaches finish line 2464119_NA_0514_Black_Voters_IK Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times State Sen. Isadore Hall, center, at the opening of the Hillary for California office in South Los Angeles on May 14. State Sen. Isadore Hall, center, at the opening of the Hillary for California office in South Los Angeles on May 14. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Javier Panzar The race between Compton state Sen. Isadore Hall and former Hermosa Beach Councilwoman Nanette Barragán to replace Rep. Janice Hahn has taken a sharper, racial edge as election day approaches and the intraparty contest tightens. Not previously well known in political circles, Barragán has mounted a serious challenge against Hall, a 15-year veteran of Los Angeles politics. Running as a progressive outsider, she has relentlessly blasted Hall’s ties to special interests in the alcohol and tobacco industries and hit him for campaign contributions he has received from petroleum interests.  In a recent interview, Barragán, who is Latina, kept the attacks going, calling the African American lawmaker “slimy.” But she did not stop there, giving a statement that some say injected race into the campaign.   “I don’t think we should send a man to Congress who could have a black taint on the party with the number of ethical issues surrounding my opponent,” Barragan told the Daily Breeze newspaper. “This is the pattern of somebody who thinks they’re above the law. This is the worst type of politician who talks out of both sides of his mouth.” Hall, the chairman of California’s Legislative Black Caucus, and his allies have seized on the “black taint” comment, calling it a racial slur. The statement comes after a dust-up from the primary, when Hall’s campaign and the Los Angeles Sentinel, which covers the African American community in the city, slammed a mailer sent out by Barragán’s campaign as “disgraceful and lewd” for using a black-and-white photo of Hall they said  “artificially darkens the senator’s skin tone.” Barragán campaign mailers Handout Barragán campaign mailers Barragán campaign mailers (Handout) Alice Huffman, the longtime president of the California branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said in a statement she was “shocked and appalled” at what she called “the racially charged language and tactics” employed by Barragán’s campaign. “When I saw her quote in the [Daily Breeze] referring to Hall as a ‘black taint,’ I was, in a word, speechless. Then I saw how she artificially darkened his image in her campaign mailers, and I knew this was no mistake. This is a pattern,” Huffman said in the statement. “As such, she has proven herself to be totally unfit to serve in the U.S. Congress. We’ve come too far and fought too hard to let politicians like Barragan and Donald Trump debase our public discourse in this manner.” Hall’s campaign has sent out mailers that highlight Huffman’s statement on one side and feature large bold words on the other reading: “I sincerely hope Ms. Barragan pays dearly for her disgusting words and actions on Election Day.” Updates on California politics » Barragán apologized in a statement sent by her campaign Saturday. “I want to be clear that my comments in a recent Daily Breeze article were about the need to keep more corruption out of Washington and were never intended to be taken in a racial context,” she said in the statement. “I certainly meant no offense and I sincerely apologize for my poor choice of words.” The kerfuffle comes as the race has been tightening, with outside groups coming in to influence the race to the tune of nearly $1 million. Barragán, who has been endorsed by several Latino members of Congress as well as the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters, has benefited recently from a surge of independent expenditures paid for by Women Vote!, a super PAC tied to Emily's List, the national group that backs Democratic female candidates. The group has spent $678,000 to support Barragán and oppose Hall. California’s congressional delegation is losing three women between Hahn stepping down to run for Los Angeles County supervisor, Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) retiring, and Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Orange) running for the U.S. Senate. Meanwhile, Hall has benefited from support from many of the industries that helped him in his races for state Assembly and state Senate: three Native American tribes that operate casinos in the state, the California Independent Petroleum Assn. and a pair of billboard companies. Hall has the backing of the state Democratic Party as well as Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Gov. Jerry Brown. The governor cut a radio ad for Hall in October. Barragán's campaign has attempted to turn Hall’s deep roots in the party into a weakness. Her attacks on Hall’s ties to special interests have helped her win a number of endorsements from progressive and environmental groups including Our Revolution, a political 501(c)(4) nonprofit supporting down-ballot candidates that sprang up after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' failed presidential bid. After that endorsement, she posted a large haul from small donors — people who contributed less than the $250 reporting threshold for federal elections. Barragán now has $242,000 — twice as much as Hall — left in the bank, according to the latest federal records. The campaign has been marked by bitter attacks since the primary. Barragán’s campaign has tried a wide variety of attacks against Hall, including setting up a website filled with opposition research against him. Her campaign also posts updates on the website about a civil dispute between a Compton housing development and a group of tenants who claim they have been harassed by the owners. Hall, who supported the development as a councilman and lives in the complex, has been called as witness. They have accused Hall of committing fraud when one of his mailers claimed the endorsement of the Progressive Democrats of America, a group that has endorsed Barragán. Hall’s campaign said it was a typo — clarifying that a local group called the Progressive Democratic Club has endorsed Hall.  One Barragán staffer filed a complaint against Hall with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department — Hall is a reserve deputy — because he appeared in a uniform in campaign materials. California elections code prohibits using government seals in campaign literature. Hall’s camp responded by saying the uniform was a rented costume and by blurring over the badge in a YouTube ad online.  Meanwhile, Hall’s campaign has attacked Barragán for working as a litigation attorney for banks including J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America. One wild card in the race will be if minority voters show up in a district where it is estimated that 48% of voters are Latino and 25% are black, according to the firm Political Data Inc. “There is a school of thought that Latinos voters are angry and scared and will turn out in massive numbers,” said veteran Democratic strategist Darry Sragow. “That may be the story of the presidential race.” But he warned, “Just because a voter is Latino does not mean that the voter is automatically going to vote for the Latina in the race.”  Both sides are gunning for that vote. Barragán added the middle name “Diaz” just before filing to run in the race, according to court records. In an interview she said it was one of her father’s names and she had been intending to add it to her legal name for a long time.   She spent part of Saturday in South Gate campaigning with Sanchez, who along with former Nevada Atty. Gen. Catherine Cortez Masto could be the first Latinas in the U.S. Senate.  Hall campaigned Saturday with former Assembly Speaker Fabian Nuñez and Denise Lopez Diaz, who is running for South Gate City Council. The race will be closely watched by political insiders curious how the top-two primary is playing out in California.  “You couldn't get a much more stark contrast in terms of who the candidates are and how they are perceived,” Sragow said. “It is a classic face-off.”  Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.
