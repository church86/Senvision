Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Only Nine Dow Components With Recent Insider Buying, JPM is One of Them 3 February 2017Military News Shutterstock photo The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique inside view into the business, so when these insiders make purchases, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason for a company insider to choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money – maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. Within the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only nine companies have experienced such buying over the trailing six month period, one of which was JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM), where an investment totaling $2.8K was made by Director Laban Jackson. Click Here to Learn Which Other Eight Dow Components Also Had Recent Insider Buying » Purchased Insider Title Shares Price/Share Value 10/31/2016 Laban Jackson Director 40 $69.52 $2,780.80 Jackson’s average cost works out to $69.52/share. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co were changing hands at $84.54 at last check, trading off about 0.5% on Thursday. The chart below shows the one year performance of JPM shares, versus its 200 day moving average: Looking at the chart above, JPM’s low point in its 52 week range is $52.50 per share, with $88.17 as the 52 week high point – that compares with a last trade of $84.54. The current annualized dividend paid by JPMorgan Chase & Co is $1.92/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 01/04/2017.

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Jabin Botsford. By Matthew Campbell, WP Bloomberg Jan 30, 2017 at 8:29 am | Print View President Donald Trump vowed to end business as usual in Washington. Global companies are now learning just what that means. What began before his inauguration, with attempts to cajole corporations like Toyota into keeping jobs in the U.S. with critical tweets, is now escalating into a crucial test for business leaders trying to maintain the cross-border flows of people and goods that underpin commerce in the 21st century. Trump’s Friday signing of an executive order barring the citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., on the heels of his war of words with Mexico over trade, alarmed executives from big employers including General Electric, Google and Microsoft. A chaotic weekend of protests, emergency court hearings and White House rebuttals left executives with a tricky choice: speak out and risk drawing fire from an outspoken president, or stay silent and face criticism from employees and activists. GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt’s response underscored the delicate balance business will have to strike. “We have many employees from the named countries and we do business all over the region,” he said in an internal email. While he called those staff “critical to our success,” he avoided direct criticism of Trump’s policy. GE “will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and congress and reiterate the importance of this issue,” he said. Trump’s order shut the door to nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — including refugees, visiting scholars and, at least temporarily, even permanent American residents who happened to be abroad for work or holidays. Confusion reigned in the first 48 hours of its implementation, with border agents and airlines unsure how to interpret the rules. The decision, termed a “Muslim ban” by critics, fulfills a campaign promise that even Trump allies had suggested shouldn’t be taken literally, signaling the White House’s new occupant is committed to at least some of his most controversial pledges. “We would never think this would become any kind of an issue,” Ludwig Willisch, chief executive officer of North American operations at Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, said at an automotive conference on Saturday. “This country is a melting pot, freedom of speech, everybody gets together and creates this great country. So, we were not prepared for this kind of thing.” Criticism from pockets of corporate America, which was matched by statements from the leaders of Germany, France, and Canada, stood in stark contrast to the warm words toward Trump just a week ago. Executives at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Switzerland, including AT&T’s Randall Stephenson and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon, praised Trump’s promises to overhaul corporate taxes and invest in infrastructure. Optimists suggested he would quietly drop pledges to tear up trade deals and reconsider defense commitments to allies. Trump has “had this extraordinary honeymoon where Wall Street has kind of discounted all the negative aspects,” Richard Fenning, the CEO of consultancy Control Risks, told Bloomberg Television. As companies react to the migrant ban, “perhaps that honeymoon is starting to be over,” he said. The about-face was epitomized by Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk; last week he praised Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, as a potentially “excellent” pick. On Sunday, Musk tweeted that migrants “don’t deserve to be rejected” and asked his 6.89 million Twitter followers to read the immigration order and suggest changes. On the other hand, U.S. auto companies, whose home state of Michigan has a large Arab community, have yet to make their views known. Wall Street has also largely stayed out of the fray. At some of its biggest banks, executives said they were struggling to understand whether the order will ultimately apply to employees who work in the U.S. with green cards or legal work permits. If it doesn’t hit visa holders, few major companies’ employees will be affected, according to one executive who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to comment. On Sunday, JPMorgan said it was working to assist affected staff. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said Trump’s move left him with “deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise.” The coffee chain will redouble efforts to hire as many as 10,000 refugees over five years in 75 countries, he wrote in a note to employees Sunday. Reaction was sharpest from the technology industry, with Twitter awash in reminders that Apple’s late co-founder, Steve Jobs, was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Among the first to speak out was Google CEO Sundar Pichai, himself an immigrant from India, who called the policy “painful.” Another India-born CEO, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, took to LinkedIn to highlight “the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, for the world.” Trump should expect sustained challenges from the tech industry in particular, said Ian Bremmer, CEO of political consultancy Eurasia Group, because it differs significantly with him on issues from net neutrality to immigration. “While most every CEO wants to just ‘get back to business’ after Trump’s election, that’s going to prove much harder” for technology leaders, he said. “There’s going to be a fight.” Compounding business leaders’ unease was the order’s confused implementation, which included unclear directives on how border agents should treat lawful permanent residents, and contradictory statements about how it would affect those who hold passports from two countries — for example, a dual citizen of Iran and the U.K. For now, lawyers are advising such individuals not to travel to the U.S., or to stay put if they already live there. The new rules came into force with no transition period, leaving carriers like Emirates and American Airlines Group Inc. unsure what to do with passengers booked to fly to U.S. airports, or already in the air. “We are committed to protecting our people and will provide whatever support is necessary to protect them and their families,” Michael Roth, CEO of advertising firm Interpublic Group of Cos., wrote in an email. --With assistance from Mary Schlangenstein Christopher Palmeri Gabrielle Coppola Deena Kamel Yousef Eric Pfanner Richard Clough Hugh Son and Dakin Campbell Your next Nation & World articles Starbucks to speed up hiring of vets ami ...

Theresa May wants to avoid that mistake. by Simon Kennedy @simonjkennedy More stories by Simon Kennedy and Tim Ross @TimRoss_1 More stories by Tim Ross February 3, 2017, 2:44 AM EST Sign up to receive the Brexit Bulletin in your inbox, and follow @Brexit on Twitter. Prime Minister Theresa May has a plan in case of failure. Tucked away in the final pages of the government’s 75-page plan for the Brexit negotiations was the line that the government would draft emergency laws to protect the economy in the event that the talks break down without the sweeping free trade deal May wants. Source: Getty Images “The government is clear that no deal for the U.K. is better than a bad deal for the U.K.,” the white paper said. “In any eventuality, we will ensure that our economic and other functions can continue, including by passing legislation as necessary to mitigate the effects of failing to reach a deal.” The government also warned of financial market disruption if banks can’t secure access to the EU. The contingency work suggests a desire to avoid repeating the mistake of May’s predecessor, David Cameron, who entered June’s referendum without a plan for losing, leaving the U.K. unprepared for Brexit. Some criticized the white paper, released Thursday, for lacking depth and for assuming the U.K. can enjoy too many of the advantages of EU membership, including easy trade, while giving up the responsibilities such as free movement of people. “The administration is misjudging both the political and practical scale of the task ahead,” said Malcolm Barr, an economist at JPMorgan. “We see increasing grounds for concern that the plan as constituted cannot be credibly constituted.” The document serves as the basis for the next round of parliamentary talks on handing May the power to start the Brexit talks by the end of June. Some of May’s fellow Tories said on Thursday they want a binding vote on the draft deal before it’s too late to be changed, while others want more assurances on the future of EU citizens already in the U.K. Postcard from Malta May will join her (for now) fellow EU leaders for talks in Malta on Friday, where she will try calm nerves about U.S. President Donald Trump. A ship patrols in the port of Valletta in Malta on Feb. 2. Photographer: Filippo Monteforte/AFP via Getty Images Taking advantage of her one-on-one meeting in the White House a week ago, May will paint herself as having an inside track with Trump, perhaps hoping it will give her leverage over her EU counterparts in the Brexit talks. Backing the wrong side would, however, have repercussions. “It’s pretty clear she needs to choose her priorities well,” Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told Sky News.  Also on Friday, a court will hear whether there should be a full-scale lawsuit on whether June’s referendum covered membership of the European Economic Area or not. Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to rule out a parliamentary vote on that. Frankfurt Eyes 10,000 As the race to raid Britain’s banking talent heats up, Frankfurt’s lobby group said it expects to draw as many as 10,000 finance jobs from London over the next five years. It anticipates the exodus beginning imminently, Hubertus Vath of Frankfurt Main Finance said on Thursday at a London conference organized by City and Financial. “We’re not talking months any more,” Vath said. “We’re talking weeks.” Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and UBS are already said to be considering the German financial capital as their new EU hub. Vath acknowledged Germany’s tight labor laws are a deterrent but said politicians were reviewing them. Deutsche Bank Chief Regulatory Officer Sylvie Matherat said the bank “won’t be a first mover” on shifting staff. Separately, Spain’s securities regulator said it plans to increase its workforce by about 15 percent as part of its plan to cope with potential demand from investment firms after Brexit. Ireland’s central bank said it is hiring “immediately’’ to quicken authorizations for firms wanting to work there. U.K. Plc Taking Over U.K. companies are making more acquisitions abroad than they were before the referendum despite the falling pound making their targets more expensive by a fifth in dollar terms. Reckitt Benckiser’s $16.7 billion surprise bid for baby food producer Mead Johnson Nutrition this week was the second U.K. suitor in a month to make a move on a U.S. target. The first — British American Tobacco’s agreement to purchase Camel cigarettes maker Reynolds American for almost $50 billion — was the biggest overseas buyout by a U.K. firm since 2008. Despite sterling’s slide, British companies will generate sales in other currencies that can then be swapped back to the U.K. at a premium, Bloomberg’s Manuel Baigorri and Ruth David note. All told, British buyers have announced almost $126 billion of cash or cash-and-stock deals for targets outside of the country since the referendum. That’s up 72 percent from the same period a year earlier. Brexit Bullets AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said the U.K. will need its own drug agency after Brexit Scotland to vote on Tuesday on May’s draft plan to trigger Brexit Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Brexit would cause substantial economic damage to the U.K. The U.K. lawmaker who represents London’s financial district in Parliament said he sees the risk of “very little progress" in Brexit negotiations a year from now. “I’m slightly pessimistic,” Mark Field said. On the Markets The pound snapped a two-day rally on Thursday and gilts rose after the Bank of England signaled that it isn’t primed to tighten monetary policy even as it boosted its outlook for economic growth. “The Brexit journey is really just beginning,” Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said. “While the direction of travel is clear, there will be twists and turns along the way.” Brexit has brightened the outlook for U.K. solar funds, with higher power prices lifting earnings for the industry and prompting trading volumes at three London-listed U.K. solar funds to more than double since June, according to Bloomberg’s Anna Hirtenstein. And Finally… The government’s white paper was barely a week in the works, and it may have shown. Forced upon her by disgruntled Conservatives, May only agreed on Jan. 25 to publish the document. The chatter in Westminster was that it only reached the printers in the pre-dawn hours of Thursday, with some noting on Twitter that time stamps on some of the pages suggested the final version was only completed after 4 a.m. Sections of it were copied word-for-word from May’s speech in London last month. Errors were also spotted. Page 32 of the report appeared to suggest Britons are allowed a minimum of 14 weeks of paid vacation per year. It was later corrected to show the correct amount of about 5 weeks.

He previously covered corporate finance for Bloomberg News, and has written for Reuters/IFR, Forbes, the Wall Street Journal and Mergermarket. Follow @Asia_G3 Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Feb 3, 2017 12:30 AM EST Bond investors can sometimes be too sanguine, and Mongolia looks to be an example of that. The country's sovereign notes have returned 1.5 percent over the past three months, the best performance among nine Asian markets, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The nation's 10.875 percent U.S. currency debentures due 2021 are trading at 105.3 cents on the dollar to yield 9.3 percent, while its 5.125 percent bonds that mature in 2022 yield 8 percent, down from 11 percent 12 months ago. Risk Versus Reward At a yield of 9.3 percent, Mongolia's bonds seem to be offering a decent return...unless you consider the likelihood of default Source: Bloomberg That's despite the Development Bank of Mongolia LLC facing a $580 million note repayment next month that would wipe out more than half the country's $1.1 billion in reserves. The possibility of a default's so real that people are even donating their jewelry to the government in the hope it gets over the line. Thin Cushion Mongolia's foreign currency reserves dropped below $1 billion last year and were at $1.2 billion at the end of December Sources: IMF, Bloomberg Investors are taking a more optimistic view, betting the International Monetary Fund will finalize a rescue package that will allow the payment to be made and give Mongolia sufficient credibility to sell new bonds to meet other maturities -- there's about $645 million coming due in 2018. They're also emboldened by the fact that coal and copper -- Mongolia's two main exports -- have recovered from wild selloffs. Newcastle futures rose 87 percent last year while copper rose 16 percent, having plunged 47 percent from its peak in February 2013 to a low in January last year. But even after those rallies, the price of the two commodities remains depressed versus historic levels. Plus some 80 percent of exports are to China, where demand is slowing. Mongolia's 10.875% notes: sold at par Trading at: 105.3 cents Things could go the way of Mozambique, which is on the verge of default after an expected IMF handout didn't happen. Even if multilateral organizations find no fault with Mongolia, political developments can push a nation over the edge. As a young finance reporter, I remember attending a press conference with then Argentine minister of economy Domingo Cavallo in Sao Paulo in 2001. I recall being very impressed with his explanation of how he planned to avert a crisis by moving the peso's peg from the dollar to a basket that would include the euro -- then worth less than a buck -- and the yen. The market was buying it at the time, too. Unfortunately for Cavallo, Argentinians were more inclined to bang pots on the streets than donate riches, and one of the biggest sovereign defaults in history happened a few months later. Mongolia doesn't have a pegged currency and like South Koreans during the Asian financial crisis, its citizens are willing to make personal sacrifices so the nation doesn't miss its obligations. But unlike politics, finance is more of an exact science and here, the math doesn't add up. The last time Mongolia had a budget surplus was back in 2010, a meager $33.2 million. Last year's $1.5 billion deficit was the highest since at least 2000 and almost three times the figures recorded in 2014 and 2015. Down the Drain Mongolia hasn't recorded a surplus in six years and its latest deficit was a record Source: Bloomberg The tugrik's 20 percent drop against the dollar in 2016 was its worst one-year loss since 2000 as well. More than 10 percent of loans in the country are nonperforming and some say official statistics underestimate the problem. It was perhaps figures like these that prompted Franklin Templeton to exit its investment in Mongolia last year. Michael Hasenstab might have missed the latest rally, but, as any savvy investor knows, chasing the last dollar can sometimes be a loss-making strategy.

Image Credit: REUTERS/Carlos Barria (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump will likely face questions about his executive order restricting some travel to the United States when he meets with the CEOs of major U.S. companies at the White House on Friday. Companies whose chief executives are expected to attend the meeting of the president’s business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase, General Motors, Blackstone Group LP, IBM, and Walt Disney, two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday. Activists are already pressuring the CEOs to raise concerns about the travel restrictions at the meeting, which comes at the end of another turbulent week for the Trump administration. Trump’s order last Friday, barring travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, touched off public protests and stirred unease among employees at many big U.S. companies. CEOs have been faced with difficult choices to either criticize Trump’s move at a time when they are trying to win White House support on tax and trade policies, or remain silent and take heat from consumers and employees dismayed by the order. The Trump administration says the travel ban is aimed at strengthening national security. Backlash over the measure knocked the wind out of the post-inaugural stock market rally, although major indexes rebounded on Wednesday. Trump’s executive order put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Along with protests it has prompted legal challenges in the United States and drawn criticism from several leading U.S. companies. Among those critics, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that “the ban will impact many innocent people — an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump’s first business advisory group meeting.” Trump will kick off the two-hour meeting with an address lasting 10-15 minutes and will be followed by Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire founder of private equity group Blackstone <BX.N>, who chairs the panel and assembled it at Trump’s request. Four topics will be discussed — regulatory relief, women in the work force, tax and trade, and infrastructure — with two to three people talking briefly about each subject to help shape “how the administration should be thinking,” according to a person familiar with the matter. Investors said the CEOs would be mindful of Trump’s penchant for rebuking companies publicly. “Given recent history, being called out publicly is something that the CEOs in that room and other CEOs will absolutely be mindful to avoid,” said Jim Russell, vice president at Bahl & Gaynor Inc, which oversees $17 billion and owns shares in several of the companies attending Friday’s meeting. “I’m sure they will pick their fights carefully and articulate them carefully.” It was not clear if all 19 members of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Friday’s meeting. Other members include the CEOs of Tesla, Wal-Mart and Boeing. Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Motor Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure. GM has declined to take a position. On Wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with Trump. In a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said Trump’s order “undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the U.S. and beyond, and disrupts economic activity and company operations.” The letter was signed by dozens of people, including representatives of firms focused on socially-responsible investing like Calvert Research and Management and Domini Impact Investments. Others included representatives of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, the Institute for Human Rights and Business and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Companies that have been most critical of Trump’s immigration orders include Netflix, Apple, and Amazon.com, none of which form part of the business advisory panel.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Compliance Training Veteran, Anil D’Souza, Joins Traliant Team 3 February 2017Military News Traliant, a leader in interactive online compliance training, welcomes Anil D’Souza to the management team as VP, Learning. MANHATTAN BEACH, CA, USA, February 2, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — Traliant, a leader in interactive online compliance training, announced today that Anil D’Souza has joined its team as VP, Learning. Over the past 20 years D’Souza has instructionally authored over 800 learner hours of blended learning programs, focusing primarily on ethics and regulatory compliance topics. He has designed programs for a variety of progressive, international organizations including such firms as JPMorgan Chase, Standard Chartered Bank, and General Electric. Prior to joining Traliant, he was the Director of Products, Quality, and Innovation in the compliance learning division of Thomson Reuters. “The challenge with compliance training is that nobody really wants to take it,” observed D’Souza. “Since staff motivation is typically low, the training must be relevant, engaging and interactive if it is to be effective. If eLearning can also be adapted to an organization’s look, feel and vocabulary, it further enhances effectiveness as people tune-out when training doesn’t appear to be relevant to them. Traliant has wrapped these important concepts into a big vision of taking compliance training ‘from boring to brilliant,’ and I’m very excited to be able to help bring this vision to life.” Andrew Rawson, Traliant’s CMO, further commented, “I worked with Anil previously and his ability to lead a team of instructional designers, subject matter experts, graphic designers and course developers to rapidly build highly engaging, media-rich compliance training is without parallel.” Traliant launched its Preventing Discrimination and Harassment Suite in December 2016. A Code of Conduct training suite will be available in March 2017. About Traliant: Traliant was founded by industry veterans from some of the most successful compliance training companies in the nation to meet the challenge of transforming compliance training from boring to brilliant. Backed by Martinson Ventures, Traliant delivers millennial-friendly, broadcast-quality compliance training on an eLearning platform that allows revolutionary text and video customization—at off-the-shelf prices. Traliant has received industry-wide recognition for its innovative work. For more information on Traliant visit: http://www.traliant.com.

Quotes in the article Liberty All-Star Equity USA ▲ 5.40 +0.02 +0.37% Facebook Inc FB ▼ 130.84 -2.39 -1.79% Twitter Inc TWTR ▲ 17.78 +0.54 +3.13% Terms of the deal were not set because this is the initial filing. But we do know that Snap Inc. plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “SNAP.” And the underwriters are a who’s who of Wall Street financials, including Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (NYSE:DB). A look through the Snap Inc. S-1 provides a few more highlights for the Snapchat IPO: An average of 158 million people use the Snapchat app on a daily basis, and they create 2.5 billion snaps a day. Over 60% of the daily active users (DAUs) use the Chat Service every day to send Snaps and talk with friends. Last year, Snap posted revenues of $404.5 million but also a hefty net loss of $514.6 million. This compares to a top line of $57.7 million and loss of $372.9 million in 2015. The Snapchat IPO should be one of the largest — if not the biggest — offerings of the year. The Los Angeles Times also points out that the Snap Inc. IPO is expected to be the “biggest initial public offering ever for a Los Angeles company.” The Snapchat IPO: The Next Facebook Inc (FB) ... Or Twitter Inc (TWTR)? Snapchat was founded just five years ago by a pair of former Stanford students as a class project. It has now grown into one of the most popular apps in the world, allowing users to snap photos and short videos, and apply various filters and effects to them.

 A former Wall Street analyst made a $145 million trade of a lifetime to join Snap Matt Turner Feb. 2, 2017, 7:04 PM 1,639 facebook linkedin twitter email print Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Office of Snapchat, speaks the Financo CEO Forum 2016 on January 18, 2016 in New York City. Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images Snapchat's parent company Snap Inc. has set in motion what could be the biggest tech flotation in years.  The filing for its initial public offering revealed the compensation of Imran Khan, a former JPMorgan research analyst turned Credit Suisse technology banker, who moved the company in January 2015 as chief strategy officer.  Now, for a bit of background, Khan made the kind of move many on Wall Street dream of, swapping a job in finance for a big role at a fast-growing startup.  Others have done the same. Anthony Noto, a Goldman Sachs banker became Twitter's CFO in 2014, and Ruth Porat became Alphabet's finance chief last year.  But for Khan, who worked on the IPO of Alibaba Group, Groupon and China's Weibo before he moved to Snap, this trade is going to pay off like no other.  Khan received $145.3 million in stock awards in 2015, according to the filing, in addition to $230,000 in salary. In 2016, he received a $5.3 million bonus, in addition to $241,539 in salary. Khan is sure to be the envy of Wall Street.

Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order “and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump “understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation’s economy stronger.” The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. “In tomorrow’s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,” he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick’s departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. “There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. “They (the Trump administration) clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order “and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the US is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump “understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation’s economy stronger.” The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. “In tomorrow’s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,” he said in a tweet on Thursday.

Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Facebook, Microsoft Said to Circulate Immigration Open Letter Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order "and its issues for our community" and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. "There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," he wrote in a note to employees. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the US is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump "understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger." The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. "In tomorrow's meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy," he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick's departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. "There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley," said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. "They (the Trump administration) clearly don't value the economic activity generated by tech." Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump's travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump's order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general. © Thomson Reuters 2017 Tags: Uber, Travis Kalanick, Donald Trump, Trump Immigration Ban, Apps Karnataka Announces 'Initial Manufacturing Operations' of Apple in India but No Deal Yet Snap Files for $3 Billion IPO, Reveals Snapchat Has 158 Million Daily Active Users Uber CEO Quits Trump Advisory Group Amid Mounting Pressure     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Huawei Honor 8 Lite Intex Aqua Amaze+ Asus ZenFone 3S Max ZTE Blade A2 Plus Swipe Elite Power Lava X41+ Intex Cloud Q11 4G Intex Cloud Style 4G Lava A55 Lava A50 Vivo V5 Lite Vivo V5 Plus Micromax Vdeo 3 ZTE Hawkeye LG X300 Micromax Vdeo 4 Samsung Galaxy C7 Pro Samsung Galaxy J2 Ace Swipe Konnect Grand Huawei P8 Lite (2017) Popular Oppo A57 Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Nokia 6 OnePlus 3T Lenovo P2 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones Nokia Phones Vivo V5 Honor 6X Gadgets 360 Hindi अब एक नए अवतार में बिकेगा मोटोरोला मोटो एम स्मार्टफोन ऐप्पल भारत में आईफोन बनाने का काम अप्रैल के अंत तक करेगी शुरू व्हाट्सऐप के इन कमाल के फ़ीचर के बारे में ज़रूर जानना चाहेंगे आप Latest Videos 02:57 HTC Desire 10 Pro Review 02:40 Smartphones That Help You Take Better Selfies 02:30 360 Daily: Union Budget 2017's Tech Focus, Your Free Android VPN May Contain Malware, and More 01:17 Everything You Need to Know About UPI 02:27 360 Daily: H1-B Visa's Proposed Reform, Oppo A57 Launched, and More More Videos» OPINIONS ALL AUTHORS Gopal Sathe Cloud Kitchens Take the Risk Out of Trying New Places - and the Reward Rohan Naravane UPI Has an Identity Problem That's Stopping It From Taking Off Akhil Arora How I Learned to Buy Less and Live More Advertisement Recent Google to Let Android Users Pin Web Apps to App Drawer GoPro's Sales Resume Growth, but Still Miss Expectations Reliance Jio Tops Coverage in India, Airtel Tops 4G Speed: Report Tesla CEO Elon Musk to Meet US President Donald Trump on Immigration Ban Google Assistant Rumoured to Arrive on Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P Soon Amazon Says 'Bullish' on India Business, New Services in the Offing Moto M Grey Colour Variant to Go on Sale in India From Monday Sony Starts Rolling Out February Android Security Update Ahead of Google Sony Reports Loss Offset by PlayStation and Image Sensor Sales Nintendo Ignores India, Most of the World for Fire Emblem Heroes Launch More News TRENDING Nokia P1 Concept Render Leaked; Shows Front Fingerprint Scanner Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 2GB RAM Variant to Go on Sale in India Today Moto G5 Smartphone May Go on Sale Soon After MWC 2017 Reliance Jio Tops Coverage in India, Airtel Tops 4G Speed: Report Oppo A57 With 16-Megapixel Front Camera to Go on Sale in India Today Apple Set to Begin Making iPhones in India by April's End Everything You Need to Know about the H-1B Visas Uber CEO Quits Trump Advisory Group Amid Mounting Pressure Xiaomi Mi 6 Will Reportedly Sport an Underclocked Snapdragon 835 SoC Moto M Grey Colour Variant to Go on Sale in India From Monday Sitemaps Archives Advertise About Us Feedback Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Complaint Redressal Careers Contact Us RSS Ethics Gadgets Hindi © Copyright Red Pixels Ventures Limited 2017.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Your Mutual Funds May Have Bets On Super Bowl Advertisers 3 February 2017Military News Shutterstock photo As you sit back on Sunday to enjoy the Super Bowl, the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons are not the only teams you could have a rooting interest in. Through mutual funds in which you are a shareholder, you may have a financial stake in the annual sports and advertising extravaganza. More than 10,000 mutual funds hold shares in at least six companies that are running ads during the game in NRG Stadium in Houston, which is expected to be watched by more than 100 million viewers. The ranks of those funds include some of the biggest names in the industry. That puts the odds in your favor that a slice of your portfolio may gain value, depending on the impact of ads during the National Football League’s championship game. The odds go up that your portfolio will be impacted when the pool of mutual funds is expanded to account for ads before and after the game as well. Advertisers range from the very familiar such as Budweiser beer, whose parent company is Anheuser Busch InBev ( BUD ), and carmaker Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler ( DDAIF ), to lesser-known enterprise software company Wix.com ( WIX ). IBD’S TAKE: IBD reported Thursday that German automaker Daimler said that its fourth-quarter net profit rose 18%, but the firm offered only modest guidance for future earnings as it gets ready to spend on new models and advanced technologies such as autonomous driving. Mutual funds owning a piece of advertisers in the big game include $104 billion Fidelity Contrafund ( FCNTX ), $82.2 billion American Funds Investment Company of America ( AIVSX ), $40.9 billion MFS Value (MEIAX), $16.7 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), $13.1 billion JPMorgan U.S. Equity (JUEAX), $12 billion Franklin Growth (FKGRX) and $8.5 billion Hartford Capital Appreciation (ITHAX). Other funds with players in the ad contest: $7.5 billion MFS Total Return (MSFRX), $6.8 billion Vanguard Total International Stock Index (VGTSX), $5.7 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLGX), $4.8 billion Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value (GCMAX), $4.6 billion AMG Yacktman Focused (YAFFX) and $3.3 billion Alger Capital Appreciation (ALARX). Those funds are among the stock owners in six publicly traded companies that are slated, according to superbowlcommercials.co, to advertise on television during the Super Bowl: Budweiser, Intel (INTC), Mercedes-Benz, Mountain Dew (PEP), Victoria’s Secret (LB) and Wix.com. Altogether, 10,898 mutual funds held stakes in those six companies or their corporate parents as of Dec. 31. Their positions in the six amounted to 2.49 billion shares. Mutual funds held just 1.3% of total shares in Budweiser owner Anheuser Busch InBev. Mutual funds owned 40.7% of Wix.com, an Israeli company that offers customers a web development platform. Mutual funds held 39.1% of the shares in Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands, 34.8% of Intel, 31.7% of Mountain Dew parent PepsiCo and 26.6% of Mercedes driver Daimler’s ADRs.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Moneycontrol Bureau Cummins India With retaining underperform rating on Cummins and target price of Rs 687, Bank of America Merrill Lynch says it sees moderate growth in exports in the medium-term and de-rating is likely as growth expectations continue to reset. Third quarter earnings beat was driven by surprise in exports & domestic sales. It feels industrials will lead domestics & aid distribution sales. Phillip Capital has maintained neutral rating on the stock, with increased target price at Rs 990 (from Rs 955 earlier). The brokerage house feels current valuation leaves limited room for upside and revival in domestic growth seems priced into current valuations. Margin expansion in Q3 was mainly due to operating leverage benefits and gross margin was largely flat YoY due to an unfavourable sales mix. Morgan Stanley is underweight on Cummins with a target for the stock at Rs 647. Uncertainty persists in export markets, it believes. Emkay has upgraded FY17/18 earnings per share by 4.4 percent & 8.5 percent while advising accumulate rating on the stock, with increased target price by 8.2 percent to Rs 1,065. Glenmark Pharma JPMorgan has neutral rating on Glenmark with a target price of Rs 915 as it feels improving US growth trajectory and emerging market recovery priced into valuations. The brokerage house says it continues to like long-term business potential and newsflow on innovation R&D pipeline could be a positive trigger but delay in US approvals is a downside risk to estimates. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has reiterated its buy call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,100 as it feels strong growth and balance sheet clean-up are major re-rating triggers. Q3 earnings beat was led by higher than expected sales of gZetia in US. US business now is in a strong growth phase. Other segments are in line and operating leverage boosted margin, the brokerage house says. Macquarie has an outperform rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,350. Valuations look attractive, with stock trading at 14x FY18 EPS, the brokerage house feels. Marico With having a neutral call on the stock and target price of Rs 265, JPMorgan says Q3 earnings were in-line, led by margins and revenue performance was subdued. Sun TV Network CLSA says special court verdict on former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran and his brother & head of the company Kalanidhi Maran, in Aircel-Maxis case, ended long-standing legal overhang on the company. The brokerage house has upgraded the stock to buy from sell and raised target price to Rs 661 from Rs 438. Company's advertising revenue has been weak but TV ratings have improved. CLSA expects advertising revenue CAGR of 12 percent over decline & recently improved TV ratings. Rerating is pegged on advertising growth, but lower legal, policy issues are key positives, the brokerage house says. With maintaining buy rating with revised target price at Rs 750, ICICI Securities says the court ruling will trigger rerating. The company will be a major beneficiary of speeding up digitisation in the state, it believes. Emkay has retained its buy call on Sun TV Network with a target price of Rs 850. It raised target PE multiple to 26x and says valuation to FY19 EPS implies 54 percent upside. With legal overhang behind, Emkay believes re-rating in the stock is imminent. The brokerage house says resolution of phase III digitisation and growth in DTH are key upside risks while it expects cable TV & DTH subscription revenue to grow at 12 percent CAGR FY16-19.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Elon Musk is taking his travel ban objections directly to Trump by Jethro Mullen   @CNNTech February 2, 2017: 10:34 PM ET Ford CEO: 'We don't support' Trump's travel ban Elon Musk says he will raise objections to President Trump's controversial immigration order at a meeting at the White House on Friday. The Tesla (TSLA) chief defended his participation in Trump's business advisory council just hours after Uber CEO Travis Kalanick announced he was pulling out of it. "Advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration," Musk said in a statement posted on Twitter late Thursday. "I understand the perspective of those who object to my attending this meeting," he said. "But I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good." Related: Uber CEO drops out of Trump's business advisory council Musk said that he and others would "express our objections" to Trump's travel ban that affects all refugees as well as people from seven Muslim-majority countries -- and "offer suggestions for changes to the policy." The meeting Friday is the first for the economic advisory council, which included 19 business leaders before Kalanick dropped out. "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick said in a memo to employees. Related: Companies and executives speak out on Trump's travel ban Other high-profile members of the council, which is officially called the Strategic and Policy Forum, include Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Mary Barra of General Motors (GM) and Jim McNerney of Boeing (BA). Musk, who's also the CEO of SpaceX, said he's taking part in order to make his case for his main goals, which are "to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization." The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 He has previously voiced criticism of Trump's travel ban, calling it "not the best way to address the country's challenges." "Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US," he tweeted over the weekend. "They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected." Related: Elon Musk's surprising secret weapon: Trump? Days before Trump won the election, Musk said the Republican nominee was "not the right guy." But the Tesla chief has shown a willingness to engage in dialog with Trump and his team, joining the business council and visiting Trump Tower before the inauguration. The relationship has caught the attention of Tesla investors, with one analyst suggesting it could provide "strategic value" for the company.

The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the US is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump “understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation’s economy stronger.” The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc. CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. “In tomorrow’s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,” he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick’s departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. “There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. “They (the Trump administration) clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc. have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

The Tesla chief defended his participation in Trump’s business advisory council just hours after Uber CEO Travis Kalanick announced he was pulling out of it. “Advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration,” Musk said in a statement posted on Twitter late Thursday. “I understand the perspective of those who object to my attending this meeting,” he said. “But I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good.” Musk said that he and others would “express our objections” to Trump’s travel ban that affects all refugees as well as people from seven Muslim-majority countries — and “offer suggestions for changes to the policy.” The meeting Friday is the first for the economic advisory council, which included 19 business leaders before Kalanick dropped out. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick said in a memo to employees. Other high-profile members of the council, which is officially called the Strategic and Policy Forum, include Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Mary Barra of General Motors and Jim McNerney of Boeing. Musk, who’s also the CEO of SpaceX, said he’s taking part in order to make his case for his main goals, which are “to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization.” He has previously voiced criticism of Trump’s travel ban, calling it “not the best way to address the country’s challenges.” “Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US,” he tweeted over the weekend. “They’ve done right, not wrong & don’t deserve to be rejected.” Days before Trump won the election, Musk said the Republican nominee was “not the right guy.” But the Tesla chief has shown a willingness to engage in dialog with Trump and his team, joining the business council and visiting Trump Tower before the inauguration. The relationship has caught the attention of Tesla investors, with one analyst suggesting it could provide “strategic value” for the company.

Photo: Reuters/Danish Siddiqui BusinessUber Uber CEO quits Trump’s business advisory group Ride hailing firm's Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick, facing criticism from immigration advocates quit President Donald Trump's business advisory group By Reuters February 3, 2017 7:56 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 Uber Technologies Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick, facing criticism from immigration advocates for serving on President Donald Trump’s business advisory group, quit the group on Thursday, the company said. The CEO of the ride hailing service had been under mounting pressure from activists who oppose the administration’s immigration policies. Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order “and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the US is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors said its chief executive will attend, while Walt Disney said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. The departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. “There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. “They [the Trump administration] clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Apple and Amazon.com have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 3 February 2017 | MYT 9:35 AM Uber CEO quits Trump’s business advisory group Making a stand: Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order "and its issues for our community" and told the president he would not join the economic council. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON: Uber Technologies Inc chief executive officer Travis Kalanick quit President Donald Trump's business advisory group on Thursday amid mounting pressure from activists and employees who oppose the administration's immigration policies. Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order "and its issues for our community" and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. "There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," he wrote in a note to employees. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the US is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump "understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger." The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned-board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. The departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. "There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley," said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. "They (the Trump administration) clearly don't value the economic activity generated by tech." Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump's travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.   —  Reuters   You May Be Interested Here’s Apple’s challenge in India Under attack from hackers, UK isn’t hiring staff fast enough ‘The Elder Scrolls Online’ welcomes return of Morrowind Apple to expand iconic NYC ‘Cube’ store in lift for Fifth Avenue Uber CEO quits Trump’s business advisory group Scotiabank to invest US$1bil in digital technology Others Also Read Hussey warns Australia to avoid angering Kohli Preparations in full swing for a grand chingay show Cops to arrest those with spray paint at Batu Caves during Thaipusam advertisement Latest News Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Amazon projects spending that concerns investors watching profit Snap signed five-year, US$2bil deal to use Google’s Cloud Nintendo plays with fire as new mobile game takes ‘gacha’ global Under attack from hackers, UK isn’t hiring staff fast enough Most Viewed in Tech Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

The CEO of the ride hailing service had been under mounting pressure from activists who oppose the administration's immigration policies. Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves.

PHOTO: AFP [LONDON] Prime Minister Theresa May is making plans for emergency laws to protect the UK economy in case Brexit negotiations break down without a free-trade deal, as concerns grow that she'll fail to achieve the sweeping agreement she wants. In its 75-page plan for Brexit, Mrs May's government said on Thursday that while it was expecting to find common ground with the 27 other members of the European Union, it will prepare contingency measures to avert economic chaos if the discussions collapsed. "The government is clear that no deal for the UK is better than a bad deal for the UK ," according to the 'white paper' document on leaving the EU. "In any eventuality we will ensure that our economic and other functions can continue, including by passing legislation as necessary to mitigate the effects of failing to reach a deal." Failure to secure access to the single market for banks and other financial services companies would also risk "market fragmentation'' and the withdrawal of services for UK and European businesses, it added. Brexit Secretary David Davis vowed to try to avoid a "cliff edge" scenario. SEE ALSO: May depicts herself in Malta as a leader who understands Trump Mrs May's preparations emerged in her government's first written blueprint for "an ambitious and comprehensive free-trade agreement" with the EU after Brexit. They suggest she's keen to avoid repeating the mistake of her predecessor, David Cameron, who was faulted for not having a plan for losing last year's EU referendum, leaving the UK unprepared for the Brexit talks when he did. Bitter Failure Lawmakers and analysts including former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne have warned thaet Mrs May is unlikely to prsuade the EU to give her the free-trade deal she's aiming for given her ambitions in other areas such as immigration. They worry talks will turn bitter and the UK and EU end up making a clean break. "The administration is misjudging both the political and practical scale of the task ahead as it seeks to replicate much of the status quo in a new agreement with the EU," said Malcolm Barr, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co in London. "We see increasing grounds for concern that the plan as constituted cannot be credibly delivered." Although Mrs May's government has been bullish in predicting it can land a trade deal before it leaves the EU in two years, such a timeframe would be unprecedented especially as a pact between the UK and EU would likely to have to include services as well as goods. EU officials have also said they want to settle the divorce first before debating a new relationship. Global businesses based in the UK "may choose to vote with their feet" rather than waiting to see what deal the premier can deliver, Mr Barr said. Forced upon her by lawmakers including some from Mrs May's own Conservative party, the white paper provides the basis for the next round of discussions as Parliament inches towards handing the premier the power to start Brexit talks by March 31. The Article 50 law will be debated again next week after it won support of a majority in the House of Commons. Some fellow Tories said on Thursday they want Mrs May to promise them a binding vote on the draft Brexit deal before it is too late to be changed. "We can't predict what is going to happen in two years and I don't want to sign a blank check,'' Neil Carmichael, a Conservative member of Parliament, said by telephone. "What we need is the reassurance from the government that Parliament will be properly involved and will be given a meaningful say at the end of this process." The main opposition Labour party is likely to try to force a vote on giving legislators a binding say over the pact, while some others in the House of Commons may seek faster guarantees that EU citizens currently living in the UK will be allowed to stay. Mrs May only has a working majority of 16. The document itself contained little new information. Sections of it were copied word-for-word from May's speech in London last month, in which she announced she wanted to take the UK out of the EU single market, regain control over migration and lawmaking, and strike a new customs agreement with the bloc. Reforms to migration will require legislation and may be pushed back until after a lengthy transitional period lasting several years, the document suggested.

REUTERS/Shu ZhangMore By Heather Somerville and David Shepardson SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit President Donald Trump's business advisory group on Thursday amid mounting pressure from activists and employees who oppose the administration's immigration policies. Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order "and its issues for our community" and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. "There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," he wrote in a note to employees. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump "understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger." The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. "In tomorrow's meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy," he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick's departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. "There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley," said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. "They (the Trump administration) clearly don't value the economic activity generated by tech." Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump's travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Ralph Lauren plunged 12% after announcing that Stefan Larsson, who took over as chief executive for Ralph Lauren less than two years ago, is leaving the company. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.03 points, or less than 0.1%, to 19,884.91. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.30 points, or 0.1%, to 2,280.85 and the Nasdaq composite fell 6.45 points, or 0.1%, to 5,636.20. After a post-election rally that pushed stocks to all-time highs and the Dow above the 20,000-point mark, investors have stepped back this week. Several actions by President Donald Trump, from his immigration ban last weekend, to his various comments on trade, have given investors some concern about whether he is hurting US business confidence and the economy. "The overall economic and financial backdrop for the market looks quite good, but Trump's comments are spreading some uncertainty," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. Some of that uncertainty could come on Friday with the government's jobs report for January. For this report, the first that will be at least partially under the tenure of Mr Trump, economists are expecting employers created 175,000 jobs in January, and the unemployment rate remained at 4.7%, according to FactSet. However some recent data, including Wednesday's ADP private sector report, has given some traders hope for a jobs report over 200,000. Along with being important to investors as an economic indicator, the report is likely to be politically fraught. President Trump has called for measuring unemployment in different ways, through non-traditional metrics like the labour participation rate or the unemployment rate that includes measurements of workers in part-time jobs who want full-time work. Investors had a large batch of earnings and company news to work through on Thursday. Facebook fell 2.39 dollars, or 1.8%, to 130.84 dollars despite the company reporting results that easily exceeded analysts' expectations. The company continues to see huge growth in mobile and video advertising, which has bolstered its bottom line.

Wall Street's looking for a solid January jobs report, even better than economists are forecasting. Economists expect to see 175,000 nonfarm payrolls, with the unemployment rate steady at 4.7 percent and a smaller pickup in wages of 0.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. "I'm looking at 190,000 based on the magnitude of the increase in ADP, combined with the rebound in small firm hiring. I think there's some upside risk to that," said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. ADP's private sector payroll report for January showed 246,000 jobs, about 80,000 more than expected. Since that report, traders have been looking for a slightly better number. January is a number where seasonal adjustments have made past reports volatile. "The weather wasn't that bad, so the things that would be most likely to make this month weak should not be factors," McCarthy said. "Since December's number was kind of mediocre, that should limit the downside." There were 156,000 jobs created in December. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said one reason may be there was less retail hiring, and that in fact should help the January report because there will be less reduction in seasonal hiring for holiday sales. He expects 210,000 nonfarm payrolls, and broad based hiring. "If we get over 200,000, it's pretty much across the board. Construction, because of the weather. Manufacturing was pretty good. Retail and temp help because they didn't hire in the Christmas buying season so they're not laying off," Zandi said. "The most positive news is the job losses in the energy sector are over." Zandi also said he expects to see a pickup in government hiring of 10,000 to 15,000, as agencies may have added ahead of the inauguration of President Donald Trump, which brought in job freezes in the federal work force. Economists have varied views on how much wages rose in January, after a 0.4 percent increase in December. With the consensus at 0.3 percent, Zandi expects it picked up more — at 0.4 percent, but McCarthy sees it up 0.3 percent with a tough comparison of last year's 0.6 percent gain. But JPMorgan economists see average hourly wages rising 0.5 percent with about half of that from gains in minimum wages. They also expect 200,000 nonfarm payrolls. "We had 19 states raise their minimum wage in January, including some big states like California," said Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics. Swonk expects just 160,000 jobs, and she said she will be watching leisure categories to see if hiring in those areas was weaker because of higher wages. Stocks were mixed Thursday, with the S&P 500 up 1 at 2,280, but the Dow down 6 at 19,884. The Nasdaq was off 6 at 5,636. Amazon could be a factor in morning trading, since its stock fell sharply after reporting a revenue miss. "The [jobs] whisper number is probably above 170,000. That seems to be above consensus call because of ADP, but I think there's a realization that the economic data is taking a back seat to what's going on in Washington. This is usually the honeymoon period, but it's been more like a divorce. What puzzles me is [Trump's] doing everything in reverse order than I thought he would," said McCarthy. "I thought the warm and fuzzy stuff would come first, get the tax cuts and let everyone submit their list on what infrastructure is wanted." Stocks ran higher and bond yields rose after the election on hopes that President Donald Trump's infrastructure and tax cut plans would dominate over protectionist trade talk and immigration policies. McCarthy said the Trump trade worked for a month, but now investors are pessimistic about it. "Now they're back in the show me mode," he said. Besides the 8:30 a.m.ET jobs report, there is services PMI at 9:45 a.m., ISM nonfmanufacturing at 10 a.m. and factory orders, also at 10. President Trump meets his council of business leaders at 10 a.m. at the White House. A few companies report earnings including Honda Motor, AutoNation, Clorox, LyondellBasell Industries, Hershey, Philips 66, Weyerhaeuser and Apollo Management Group.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/Illustration (Copyright Reuters 2016) Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick has quit President Donald Trump's business advisory group after coming under criticism for taking part, the company said on Thursday. Continue Reading Below The CEO of the ride hailing service had been under mounting pressure from activists who oppose the administration's immigration policies, including Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts. The company this week has been emailing users who deleted their account to emphasize it shares concerns about the immigration orders and efforts to compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order "and its issues for our community" and told the president he would not join the economic council. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. "There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," he wrote in a note to employees. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive will attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned-board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. The White House did not immediately comment.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Friday February 3, 2017 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode Snapchat's parent kicks off $3.9b sharemarket float, the first since Twitter three years ago 3 Feb 2017, 11:20 a.m. Snap, maker of Snapchat, has file documents for its sharemarket float, the first social media IPO since Twitter three years ago. It could turn its boss Evan Spiegel and supermodel fiancee Miranda Kerr into one of the world's richest young couples. Snapchat's parent kicks off $3.9b sharemarket float, the first since Twitter three years ago Snapchat has more than 158 million daily active users but is yet to get into the black, the prospectus shows. Photo: Carl Court Young power couple: Co-founder and chief executive of Snapchat, Evan Spiegel, and supermodel Miranda Kerr got engaged last year. Photo: Vivien Killilea Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Snap, the maker of the messaging phenomenon Snapchat, filed documents for a US share market float, the first big social-media company to do so since Twitter more than three years ago. The parent of the disappearing-photo app filed its IPO documents with an initial size of $US3 billion ($3.9 billion), a placeholder amount used to calculate fees that may change. Snap plans to raise as much as $US4 billion in the share offer expected to come in March, people familiar with the matter have said. That would give it a market value of as much as $US25 billion and make its chief executive Evan Spiegel and his Australian supermodel fiancee Miranda Kerr one of the world's richest young couples. The prospectus filed on Thursday revealed that the company posted a net loss of $US515 million in 2016, on revenue of $US404 million. That compares with a loss of $US382 million in 2015, on revenue of $US59 million. Snapchat has more than 158 million daily active users, the prospectus shows. Quarterly average revenue per user on a global basis climbed to $US1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with US31¢ in the year-earlier period. Last year, Snapchat filed confidentially for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. The Jobs Act is a venue for companies with revenue of less than $US1 billion to file privately and work out details with the SEC away from the public eye. Founders to keep control The IPO prospectus is the first opportunity for outsiders to get a closer look into a company that's known for, among other things, its culture of secrecy. The next step will be the roadshow, in which Mr Spiegel and his management team will endeavour to explain the company's strategy and prospects to potential investors. According to the filing, Snap will become the first US company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to sharemarket investors. Mr Spiegel and co-founder Robert Murphy will keep control of the company. Mr Spiegel, a 26-year old internet entrepreneur, is the driving force behind the company. He is already amassed a $US2.1 billion fortune, according to estimates by Forbes magazine. Having proposed to the 33-year-old Ms Kerr in July, the couple could be worth about $3.9 billion if the company after the sharemarket float. A notorious partier from a well-off Los Angeles family, Mr Spiegel founded Snapchat when he was a student at Stanford University five years ago studying product design and the social chair of a fraternity. Snapchat was initially designed for sexting – the app was used to send short video messages that erased themselves after a few seconds. But it became a hugely popular rival to Instagram and a popular medium for advertisers chasing hard-to-get younger people. No voting rights  Mr Spiegel turned down a $US3 billion offer for the business from Facebook three years ago. In May the company was valued at $US18 billion, according to regulatory filings, which suggest it has about 200 investors. Mr Spiegel and Mr Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give them the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving sharemarket investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are leading the sharemarket offering with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Allen & Co. are also on the deal. Snap plans to list its Class A shares on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol SNAP. It plans to use proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, the filing shows.

Ride-hailing company's founder said the executive order is "hurting many people in communities all across America", and added that "there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." Trump's economic advisory council includes executives from JPMorgan Chase, General Motors, Boeing, and Tesla who are expected to provide the president with their opinion on how government policies would impact the American economy.  Related Uber Legal Notice: Copyright, trade marks and other intellectual property rights in this website can not be reproduced without the prior permission.

Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order "and its issues for our community" and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. "There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," he wrote in a note to employees. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co. said its chief executive will attend, while Walt Disney Co. said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned-board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser.

Kalanick said he was not participating because of the president's immigration order in a memo to employees. "Earlier today I spoke briefly with the president about the immigration executive order and its issues for our community," Kalanick said in the memo obtained by CNN. "I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." Kalanick was one of 19 business leaders on the council, which was scheduled to have its first meeting on Friday. Last Friday, Trump issued a sweeping executive order, which imposed a temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries. Tech companies were outraged at the order, especially as many companies were founded by immigrants. "There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that," Kalanick said in the memo. "The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America. Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." Kalanick has previously defended his working relationship with Trump, telling employees that it is necessary to execute on Uber's mission. On Inauguration Day, protesters stood in front of Uber's San Francisco office holding a sign that read: "Uber collaborates with Trump." A rallying cry, in the form of a hashtag, may have forced Uber's hand. Over the weekend, #DeleteUber was trending in response to a company tweet. The New York City Taxi Worker's Alliance announced a stoppage from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday. At 7:30 p.m., Uber tweeted that it had turned off its surge pricing, which people interpreted as trying to break the strike. By Sunday, Uber tweeted an apology, saying it was meant to ensure that protesters had means to transportation. Many pointed out the stark contrast between Uber and Lyft's reaction. Lyft was quick to pledge $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years to help "defend our Constitution." Uber's move received widespread praise, "We are heartened that Uber has listened to the drivers and the community on this important issue that is so integral to the promise of the American dream," said Jim Conigliaro, Jr., founder of The Independent Drivers Guild, in a statement. "This is an important show of solidarity with the immigrant drivers who helped build Uber and number over 40,000 in New York City alone." "Membership on this council is an endorsement of bigotry, period. Thanks to the thousands of activists who protested and made their voice heard, Kalanick and Uber woke up to this reality," Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, said in a statement. "However, the 18 other CEOs on this business council are still trying to have it both ways." Trump's advisory council, dubbed the Strategic and Policy Forum, includes JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and former GE CEO Jack Welch. The group is expected to have a direct line to Trump and be tasked with giving him nonpartisan views on how government policy impacts the economy and jobs. Other members include Elon Musk of Tesla, Mary Barra of General Motors, Larry Fink of Blackrock and Jim McNerney of Boeing. Musk announced late Thursday that he will use the meeting to raise objections to Trump's immigration order. "Advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration," he said in a statement posted on Twitter. Sara O'Brien and Jethro Mullen contributed reporting. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the size of the advisory council.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Friday February 3, 2017 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode Snapchat's parent kicks off $3.9b sharemarket float, the first since Twitter three years ago 3 Feb 2017, 11:20 a.m. Snap, maker of Snapchat, has file documents for its sharemarket float, the first social media IPO since Twitter three years ago. It could turn its boss Evan Spiegel and supermodel fiancee Miranda Kerr into one of the world's richest young couples. Snapchat's parent kicks off $3.9b sharemarket float, the first since Twitter three years ago Snapchat has more than 158 million daily active users but is yet to get into the black, the prospectus shows. Photo: Carl Court Young power couple: Co-founder and chief executive of Snapchat, Evan Spiegel, and supermodel Miranda Kerr got engaged last year. Photo: Vivien Killilea Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Snap, the maker of the messaging phenomenon Snapchat, filed documents for a US share market float, the first big social-media company to do so since Twitter more than three years ago. The parent of the disappearing-photo app filed its IPO documents with an initial size of $US3 billion ($3.9 billion), a placeholder amount used to calculate fees that may change. Snap plans to raise as much as $US4 billion in the share offer expected to come in March, people familiar with the matter have said. That would give it a market value of as much as $US25 billion and make its chief executive Evan Spiegel and his Australian supermodel fiancee Miranda Kerr one of the world's richest young couples. The prospectus filed on Thursday revealed that the company posted a net loss of $US515 million in 2016, on revenue of $US404 million. That compares with a loss of $US382 million in 2015, on revenue of $US59 million. Snapchat has more than 158 million daily active users, the prospectus shows. Quarterly average revenue per user on a global basis climbed to $US1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with US31¢ in the year-earlier period. Last year, Snapchat filed confidentially for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. The Jobs Act is a venue for companies with revenue of less than $US1 billion to file privately and work out details with the SEC away from the public eye. Founders to keep control The IPO prospectus is the first opportunity for outsiders to get a closer look into a company that's known for, among other things, its culture of secrecy. The next step will be the roadshow, in which Mr Spiegel and his management team will endeavour to explain the company's strategy and prospects to potential investors. According to the filing, Snap will become the first US company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to sharemarket investors. Mr Spiegel and co-founder Robert Murphy will keep control of the company. Mr Spiegel, a 26-year old internet entrepreneur, is the driving force behind the company. He is already amassed a $US2.1 billion fortune, according to estimates by Forbes magazine. Having proposed to the 33-year-old Ms Kerr in July, the couple could be worth about $3.9 billion if the company after the sharemarket float. A notorious partier from a well-off Los Angeles family, Mr Spiegel founded Snapchat when he was a student at Stanford University five years ago studying product design and the social chair of a fraternity. Snapchat was initially designed for sexting – the app was used to send short video messages that erased themselves after a few seconds. But it became a hugely popular rival to Instagram and a popular medium for advertisers chasing hard-to-get younger people. No voting rights  Mr Spiegel turned down a $US3 billion offer for the business from Facebook three years ago. In May the company was valued at $US18 billion, according to regulatory filings, which suggest it has about 200 investors. Mr Spiegel and Mr Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give them the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving sharemarket investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are leading the sharemarket offering with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Allen & Co. are also on the deal. Snap plans to list its Class A shares on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol SNAP. It plans to use proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, the filing shows.
