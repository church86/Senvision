In a press statement on Wednesday, the Competition Commission of SA announced that it has asked the Competition Tribunal to prosecute 17 banks it alleges were colluding to manipulate the value of the rand.

A front-facing 3-D scanner could replace the home button, which could be phased out if Apple goes with a full-glass front this year, Hall wrote in a research note this week. Biometric facial scanning would be more secure for Apple Pay and could work better in "wet conditions" if the iPhones are more water resistant, JPMorgan wrote. Other industry watchers, like Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, have speculated that Apple is likely working on an augmented reality platform using 3-D sensors in phones. While this may eventually be true, JPMorgan expects the feature is more likely to be used with clothing sizing, home improvement measurements and scanning for 3-D printing. CNBC has reached out to Apple, which rarely announces product features before a new version is officially unveiled. Facial scanning would put Apple in the race with Google's Android platform, which has a "trusted face" security lock setting. It would cost about $10 or $15 per phone, Hall said, squaring with other analysts who have predicted it would be costly. Apple's sensor technology is also a valuable part of its intellectual property, Hall said.

Of late, the flow of wisdom from top central bankers to the less privileged ones has come down to a trickle. But there is an exception – the subject of cyber security. Reserve Bank of India deputy governor SS Mundra has addressed three conferences in as many months. But the message is more worrying than comforting. His lament was that while the threats for over 1.4-billion bank accounts are on the rise, the banks are hardly doing much to protect their customers. Leave alone taking precautionary measures, they don’t even do the mandatory reporting bit to the regulator on time. Also Read: Bad bank is not a bad idea after all In March 2011, when hackers infiltrated RSA - one of the world’s top computer security companies - the message was loud and clear that if a security company gets broken into, it could happen to anyone. A few years later, its chief Amit Yoran shocked the security world when he announced that “the cyber-security industry was fundamentally broken and warned that it was only going to get worse.” A cyber-attack in the summer of 2014 on the world’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, rattled the industry when accounts of 76 million households and 7 million businesses were compromised. Its CEO Jamie Dimon wrote, “It is going to be a continual and likely never ending battle to stay ahead of it — and, unfortunately, not every battle will be won.” JPMorgan admitted to the breach and now invests nearly $600 million a year to prevent it. The $1.5-trillion Indian Banking industry in the last 6 months has reluctantly reported that a dozen banks were hit by malware, which included compromising 3.2 million card details. “The situation is very scary if banks don’t strengthen their cyber security, there is no doubt in my mind that all banks will be attacked,” says Kiran Shetty, India chief executive of SWIFT, a global financial messaging company. “I absolutely believe that cyber threat is going to evolve and it is going to become more intense than ever before.” So far, the attacks have been few and far between and most of them were minor breaches that did not threaten the industry or even the particular institution. But it could really bring down institutions as it recently happened with the Bangladesh central bank where operations came to a grinding halt. “Cyber-attacks in worst case situations can bring down the entire bank, it can deface their entire website, severely prohibit them from carrying on with their normal functions,” says Reshmi Khurana, managing director, global risk consultancy firm Kroll. The state of affairs in Indian banks does not give confidence. RBI has appointed a standing committee to redraw cyber security preparedness. “We have observed that in many cases, the banks react to cyber incidents in a knee jerk and ad hoc manner which at times has a potential to jeopardise future investigations,” RBI deputy governor SS Mundra said recently. “The world has learnt that in dealing with cyber-attacks, awareness and sharing of information play an important role. We often observe that this key premise is ignored.” While the regulator mandates reporting of cyber-attacks within 2-6 hours of detection, banks usually skip it. The official numbers also don’t reflect the true story. Top 51 banks in India have lost Rs 485 crore between April 2013 and Nov 2016 and 56 per cent of the money lost is due to Net banking thefts and card cloning incidents, finmin data shows. There are at least 15 ransomware attacks per hour in and one in three Indians falls prey to it. “Today India does not have a central repository to detect red flags early on and understand the modus operandi of cyber-attacks,” says Mukul Shrivastava, partner, fraud investigation & dispute services, EY India. “In many cases, organisations which have been previously attacked may mask it and move on, as compared to the western world where there is a reporting mechanism for cyber- attacks.” It is a double-edged sword for banks where digital transactions have soared since high value currency were scrapped while their infrastructure remained as unsafe as before. “As we go down the push towards digital, the counter point is security,” says Uday Kotak, executive vice-chairman, Kotak Bank. “There is risk with some digital initiatives, so be paranoid and believe that it is changing the world. It’s like belief in God. But make sure it’s the right God. Don’t say there is no God. Just in case there is one, you will be out of business. So better be paranoid.” Prevention requires investments, especially in technology. Globally, banks set aside 12-15 per cent of the annual tech spend for cyber security, while in India, most big banks do not even spend a couple of million dollars on IT, leave alone cyber security. “Before demonetisation, Indian banks had only 6-7 per cent transactions happening digitally versus the US, where over 80 per cent transactions are technologically enabled,” says Saket Modi, CEO, Lucideus Tech. “It simply means that the focus of the banks has not been on getting digitally enabled and, hence, it did not make commercial sense for the boards of large banks to sanction large budgets for cyber security.” Gartner, a global technology consultant, has predicted that IT spends by domestic banks and securities firms are expected to grow nearly 10 per cent to $8.9 billion in 2017. But despite the expected increase in IT spends, it’s quite possible that the adversaries will be able to outgun banks. “The probability of you being let down by your bank (even if they spend millions of dollars on security) is very real, thanks to the known unknowns in cyberspace. To err once is human, to err twice is lazy,” says Modi of Lucideus. The world of cyber security is like testing unchartered waters. RBI has warned banks that prevention is better than cure and banks will do well to secure themselves from a threat that has the potential to bring down a financial institution. “A chilling statement by an IT expert is ‘we have all been hacked, the only question is whether you know it or you don’t.’ While the statement may be alarmist, it is an antidote to complacency,” said former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan. “We will be living in interesting times. Whether it is a blessing or a curse is up to us.” READ MORE ON » Uday Kotak | reserve bank of india | Raghuram Rajan | Kotak Bank | Indians | Digital Payments | demonetisation Comments Add Your Comments NEXT STORY Get a Quote Browse CompaniesABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ|123456789 Browse Mutual FundsABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ The Economic Times Live Market News Portfolio Mobile Live TV Newsletter Commodities Speed QnA Blogs Alerts RSS Other Times Group news sitesTimes of India|इकनॉमिक टाइम्स ઈકોનોમિક ટાઈમ્સ|Mumbai Mirror Times Now|Indiatimes नवभारत टाइम्स|महाराष्ट्र टाइम्स ವಿಜಯ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ|Lifehacker Gizmodo|Eisamay|IGN India NavGujarat Samay Living and entertainmentTimescity|iDiva|Zoom| Luxpresso|Gaana|Happytrips| Cricbuzz|Get Smartapp Networkingitimes|MensXP.com Hot on the WebLive:Assembly Elections 2017|Punjab & Goa Election 2017 Income Tax calculator|Income Tax Slabs Sensex, Nifty Live|Elections 2017 Gold rate today Servicesads2book|Gadgetsnow|Free Business Listings Simplymarry|Astrospeak|Timesjobs|Magicbricks|Zigwheels|Timesdeal| dineout|Filmipop|Remit2india|Gaana|Greetzap|Techradar|Alivear| Google Play | Manage Notifications About us/Advertise with us/Terms of Use & Grievance Redressal/Privacy Policy/Feedback/Sitemap/Code of Ethics//Disclaimer Copyright © 2017 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here Of late, the flow of wisdom from top central bankers to the less privileged ones has come down to a trickle. But there is an exception – the subject of cyber security. Reserve Bank of India deputy governor SS Mundra has addressed three conferences in as many months. But the message is more worrying than comforting. His lament was that while the threats for over 1.4-billion bank accounts are on the rise, the banks are hardly doing much to protect their customers. Leave alone taking precautionary measures, they don’t even do the mandatory reporting bit to the regulator on time. Also Read: Bad bank is not a bad idea after all In March 2011, when hackers infiltrated RSA - one of the world’s top computer security companies - the message was loud and clear that if a security company gets broken into, it could happen to anyone. A few years later, its chief Amit Yoran shocked the security world when he announced that “the cyber-security industry was fundamentally broken and warned that it was only going to get worse.” A cyber-attack in the summer of 2014 on the world’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, rattled the industry when accounts of 76 million households and 7 million businesses were compromised. Its CEO Jamie Dimon wrote, “It is going to be a continual and likely never ending battle to stay ahead of it — and, unfortunately, not every battle will be won.” JPMorgan admitted to the breach and now invests nearly $600 million a year to prevent it. The $1.5-trillion Indian Banking industry in the last 6 months has reluctantly reported that a dozen banks were hit by malware, which included compromising 3.2 million card details. “The situation is very scary if banks don’t strengthen their cyber security, there is no doubt in my mind that all banks will be attacked,” says Kiran Shetty, India chief executive of SWIFT, a global financial messaging company. “I absolutely believe that cyber threat is going to evolve and it is going to become more intense than ever before.” So far, the attacks have been few and far between and most of them were minor breaches that did not threaten the industry or even the particular institution. But it could really bring down institutions as it recently happened with the Bangladesh central bank where operations came to a grinding halt. “Cyber-attacks in worst case situations can bring down the entire bank, it can deface their entire website, severely prohibit them from carrying on with their normal functions,” says Reshmi Khurana, managing director, global risk consultancy firm Kroll. The state of affairs in Indian banks does not give confidence. RBI has appointed a standing committee to redraw cyber security preparedness. “We have observed that in many cases, the banks react to cyber incidents in a knee jerk and ad hoc manner which at times has a potential to jeopardise future investigations,” RBI deputy governor SS Mundra said recently. “The world has learnt that in dealing with cyber-attacks, awareness and sharing of information play an important role. We often observe that this key premise is ignored.” While the regulator mandates reporting of cyber-attacks within 2-6 hours of detection, banks usually skip it. The official numbers also don’t reflect the true story. Top 51 banks in India have lost Rs 485 crore between April 2013 and Nov 2016 and 56 per cent of the money lost is due to Net banking thefts and card cloning incidents, finmin data shows. There are at least 15 ransomware attacks per hour in and one in three Indians falls prey to it. “Today India does not have a central repository to detect red flags early on and understand the modus operandi of cyber-attacks,” says Mukul Shrivastava, partner, fraud investigation & dispute services, EY India. “In many cases, organisations which have been previously attacked may mask it and move on, as compared to the western world where there is a reporting mechanism for cyber- attacks.” It is a double-edged sword for banks where digital transactions have soared since high value currency were scrapped while their infrastructure remained as unsafe as before. “As we go down the push towards digital, the counter point is security,” says Uday Kotak, executive vice-chairman, Kotak Bank. “There is risk with some digital initiatives, so be paranoid and believe that it is changing the world. It’s like belief in God. But make sure it’s the right God. Don’t say there is no God. Just in case there is one, you will be out of business. So better be paranoid.” Prevention requires investments, especially in technology. Globally, banks set aside 12-15 per cent of the annual tech spend for cyber security, while in India, most big banks do not even spend a couple of million dollars on IT, leave alone cyber security. “Before demonetisation, Indian banks had only 6-7 per cent transactions happening digitally versus the US, where over 80 per cent transactions are technologically enabled,” says Saket Modi, CEO, Lucideus Tech. “It simply means that the focus of the banks has not been on getting digitally enabled and, hence, it did not make commercial sense for the boards of large banks to sanction large budgets for cyber security.” Gartner, a global technology consultant, has predicted that IT spends by domestic banks and securities firms are expected to grow nearly 10 per cent to $8.9 billion in 2017. But despite the expected increase in IT spends, it’s quite possible that the adversaries will be able to outgun banks. “The probability of you being let down by your bank (even if they spend millions of dollars on security) is very real, thanks to the known unknowns in cyberspace. To err once is human, to err twice is lazy,” says Modi of Lucideus. The world of cyber security is like testing unchartered waters. RBI has warned banks that prevention is better than cure and banks will do well to secure themselves from a threat that has the potential to bring down a financial institution. “A chilling statement by an IT expert is ‘we have all been hacked, the only question is whether you know it or you don’t.’ While the statement may be alarmist, it is an antidote to complacency,” said former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan. “We will be living in interesting times.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 15, 2017 at 2:40PM One of the problems with investing in companies, says Nassim Taleb in his book Antifragile, is that the interests of investors and company executives aren't always aligned. Because executives earn a salary and bonuses that often dwarf the value of stock that they own in the company, they generally benefit more from the upside of taking risk without suffering as much downside. The harm tends to primarily accrue instead to the shareholders. The ancient Romans had an ingenious way of dealing with this when it came to building bridges, Taleb notes, requiring the engineers who built the bridges to spend time underneath the completed structures. The English took this a step further, requiring the engineers' entire family to spend time under the bridge after it was built. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Taleb refers to this as having "skin in the game," and it translates easily from bridge building into investing. To ensure that shareholders' and executives' interests are aligned, the people running companies should be required to own a significant number of stock in their firms, as this exposes them to the downside of taking excessive risk. It's for this reason that JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is such a solid stock for investors to own. A majority of CEO Jamie Dimon's net worth is tied up in JPMorgan Chase stock. According to the bank's latest proxy statement, he owns 6.7 million shares outright, valued at around $604 million -- and that doesn't include the options he owns as well. In no other industry is skin in the game as important as it is in banking. Banks are highly leveraged institutions, typically borrowing $10 in debt for every $1 in equity. The net result is that a mere 10% decline in the value of a bank's assets can render it insolvent. On top of this, there's a huge demand for a bank's product -- money. The only limit to how fast a bank can grow by making loans comes from the bank itself, as anyone in their right mind would take a loan if the price (i.e., interest rate) is right. When you combine these two fundamental aspects of banking, in turn, it's clear that a bank's executives must always keep the downside risk of growing too quickly at the forefront of their minds. The best way to do this is by ensuring that the executives of the banks you invest in have a lot of skin in the game. And no other bank executive that I'm aware of owns more stock in their institution than JPMorgan Chase's Dimon. Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Dimon isn't content just satisfying the bank's baseline requirement of owning a minimum of 1 million shares. His stake is nearly seven times that. On top of this, as JPMorgan Chase notes in its 2016 proxy statement: Mr. Dimon not only complies with all of these ownership guidelines and retention requirements, but has not sold a single share of JPMorgan Chase common stock or, prior to the merger, Bank One Corporation common stock, whether acquired as part of his compensation or on the open market, since he became CEO of Bank One in March of 2000. And it's not as if Dimon just accumulates shares of JPMorgan Chase from stock and options granted by the bank; he's also an avid purchaser in his own right. When bank stocks bottomed out at the beginning of last year, he ponied up $27 million to purchase 500,000 additional shares. In sum, if you want to invest in a bank that's looking out for your interests as a shareholder, you can't do much better than JPMorgan Chase. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 February 2017 by Military News JPMorgan Chase Institute’s Local Consumer Commerce Index Shows a 0.3 Percent Decrease in Consumer Spending Growth in October 2016 WASHINGTON–()–Today, the JPMorgan Chase Institute released its Local Consumer Commerce Index (LCCI) for October 2016, which showed that five of the 15 U.S. cities analyzed saw positive growth in year-over-year spending. However, overall, year-over-year consumer spending growth declined by 0.3 percent in October – making it the fourth consecutive month of negative growth. Denver continued to experience the fastest growth of all cities studied, this time at 7.9 percent year-over-year. Across all 15 cities, growth contributions from large businesses rebounded significantly from September 2016, adding 1.2 percentage points to overall growth. However, this rebound was offset by declines in growth contributions from small and medium businesses. This report provides a timely view of how the following cities and surrounding metro areas are faring economically, both individually and in aggregate: Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, Portland (OR), San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle. By looking at actual anonymized financial transactions, LCCI offers an ongoing, dynamic view of the health and vibrancy of the U.S. consumer and the places where businesses operate. “Despite a slight contraction, October 2016 brought some positive developments in local consumer commerce,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute. “Large businesses helped drive this change, as did ongoing spending growth from millennials and low income consumers. We are hopeful that November and December brought continued increases thanks to local holiday spending.” The key highlights from the latest Index include: Smaller cities, such as Seattle, San Diego, Denver, Portland, and Columbus, continued to grow faster than mid-sized and large cities, with a 2.1 percent overall average growth rate in October 2016. The top forty percent of consumers – from an income perspective – continued to be a drag on growth in October 2016, slightly overshadowing the positive growth contributed by the bottom sixty percent in that month. Small business growth contributions fell sharply in October 2016, subtracting 0.5 percentage points from growth in that month. This is a significant decline relative to the 2.3 percentage point contribution in September. This is only the fourth time in our series that small businesses have detracted from growth. Large businesses recovered significantly from the 2 percentage point subtraction from overall growth in September 2016, contributing 1.2 percentage points to growth in October. With a contribution of 0.9 percentage points, year-over-year spending growth on nondurables, such as office supplies and clothing, recovered in October after the decline experienced in September 2016. The LCCI offers unique advantages over existing measures of consumer spending. The LCCI captures actual transactions, instead of self-reported measures of how consumers think they spend. The LCCI provides timely data on spending in 15 major metropolitan areas; such geographic granularity is unavailable in most other spending measures. These 15 cities mirror the geographic and economic diversity of larger metropolitan areas in the United States and account for 32 percent of retail sales nationwide. The index also presents a more granular view of local consumer commerce through five important lenses: consumer age, consumer income, business size, product type, and consumer residence relative to the location of the business. For each lens, we show how different segments contributed to year-over-year spending growth. The LCCI captures economic activity in sectors that previously have not been well understood by other data sources. These include sectors such as food trucks, new merchants, and personal services. Each release of the LCCI will describe the economic picture of local communities and provide a powerful tool for city development officials, businesses, investors, and statistical agencies to better understand the everyday economic health of consumers, businesses, and the places they care about. About the JPMorgan Chase Institute The JPMorgan Chase Institute is a global think tank dedicated to delivering data-rich analyses and expert insights for the public good. Its aim is to help decision makers – policymakers, businesses, and nonprofit leaders – appreciate the scale, granularity, diversity, and interconnectedness of the global economic system and use better facts, timely data, and thoughtful analysis to make smarter decisions to advance global prosperity. Drawing on JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s unique proprietary data, expertise, and market access, the Institute develops analyses and insights on the inner workings of the global economy, frames critical problems, and convenes stakeholders and leading thinkers.

Steve Symington, Dan Caplinger, and Tim Brugger (TMFSymington) Feb 15, 2017 at 9:21AM One of the greatest fears of many investors is the potential for buying a stock at its peak share price. After all, the oft-repeated idea of buying low and selling high makes sense on the surface. But all too often -- and while it might seem counterintuitive -- the best deals are companies whose stocks have a strong history of share-price appreciation.  That's not to say finding those deals is easy. So to help get you started, we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to each pick a stock trading near its 52-week high that they believe investors would be wise to buy this month. Read on to see why they chose Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Image source: Getty Images Investing in the future of gaming Steve Symington (Activision Blizzard): Shares of Activision Blizzard popped more than 16% in a single day last week, touching an all-time high after the company's record fourth-quarter 2016 report. But despite drawing 447 million monthly active users (MAUs) last quarter, and having consumers spending an incredible 43 billion hours playing and watching Activision Blizzard content last year, I think the video-game titan is only just getting started.  For one, Blizzard achieved record fourth-quarter MAUs of 41 million. Overwatch became Blizzard's fastest-ever game to reach more than 25 million players globally, breaking the previous launch-year record for unit sales set by Diablo III in 2012. And even Blizzard's established World of Warcraft franchise managed to grow MAUs 20% year over year during the quarter, with the help of its new Legion expansion. Meanwhile, the Activision studio set its own record with 51 million MAUs in Q4, as Call of Duty capped its eighth consecutive year as the world's No. 1 console franchise. Activision also began to spread its wings last quarter with the debut of its new Skylanders Academy TV series through a partnership with Netflix.  One point of potential concern: MAUs at mobile gaming specialist King Digital -- which Activision Blizzard acquired for $5.9 billion early last year -- declined slightly on a year-over-year basis in Q4, to 355 million. But even then, King Digital simultaneously drove better per-user engagement and investment and still commanded two of the top 10 highest-grossing mobile app store titles for the 13th straight quarter -- an extraordinary demonstration of relative stability, given the ebbs and flows of the often fickle mobile gaming space. All told, revenue last quarter grew 49% year over year, to $1.45 billion, while adjusted earnings per share rose 160%, to $0.65. Activision Blizzard also generated 71% growth in operating cash flow last year, to $2.2 billion; increased its annual dividend by 15%, to $0.30 per share; and approved a new two-year, $1 billion stock repurchase plan. Add to that the potential for incremental revenue from other growth initiatives, including integration of in-game advertising, e-sports, and consumer products, and I'm convinced Activision will continue setting new highs going forward. Rendering beautiful market-beating gains Tim Brugger (Adobe Systems): Following a slow but steady increase in its stock price since it announced record quarterly and fiscal 2016 revenue on Dec. 15, Adobe is still at or near its 52-week high of $116.90. Not exactly a value investor's dream, right? But when investors consider how Adobe has consistently posted strong results, it becomes apparent that CEO Shantanu Narayen had it right all along. Narayen took a gamble: He shut down Adobe's software sales approach and focused on a more sustainable subscription model. Die-hard Adobe Photoshop users weren't amused, but fast-forward to the present and those same fans are kicking themselves if they didn't buy Adobe stock. Adobe ended fiscal 2016 with record revenue of $5.85 billion, and that's not even the best part. Of those sales, nearly 70% -- $4 billion -- were generated by the subscription-based annualized recurring revenue (ARR) from its Digital Media unit. Last fiscal year's ARR was a 28% improvement over 2015. The emphasis on ARR offers several advantages to investors, not the least of which is that it builds a relatively reliable, and predictable, sales foundation. That equates to fewer wild quarterly revenue fluctuations, which in turn limits Adobe stock's risk because if its relative stability. It's also less costly to service existing customers than rely exclusively on new sales. Not surprisingly, Adobe's expense increases are well below its top-line growth. Adobe shares are up 53% in the past year and over 12% in 2017, and it's absolutely still worth buying. This Wall Street bank has more room to run Dan Caplinger (JPMorgan Chase): The financial sector has been one of the biggest winners in the aftermath of the presidential election in November, and in the opening weeks of the Trump administration, the new president has already issued an executive order that will have the end result of reducing regulation on big banks. That's great news for JPMorgan Chase, which has already been rising because of anticipation of higher interest rates and the corresponding profit boost for the company's retail banking business. It isn't certain that Congress will follow through and repeal Dodd-Frank banking restrictions in their entirety. But the potential for JPMorgan Chase to boost the size of its lending portfolio and proprietary trading business could lead to unanticipated profit growth, and already, CEO Jamie Dimon has shown his support for the president's policies on issues ranging from bank regulation to tax reform. JPMorgan Chase has plenty of risks, and the potential threat of growing tensions in the global economy related to trade could have an adverse impact on its international business. However, few banks have successfully read changing trends better than Dimon and JPMorgan Chase, and as long as the bank keeps its fingers on the pulse of the geopolitical and macroeconomic climate, it has the ability to keep climbing despite its past share-price gains.  Dan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The commission said in a statement it has been investigating a case of price-fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since April 2015. It has now referred the case to the tribunal for prosecution. The banks are Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank NA, Investec Ltd, Standard New York Securities Inc, HSBC Bank Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Nomura International Plc, Macquarie Bank Limited, ABSA Bank Limited (ABSA), Barclays Capital Inc, Barclays Bank plc (Respondents). The commission is seeking an order from the tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act. Further, the Commission is seeking an order declaring that 14 of the banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Investec, Standard New York Securities, HSBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa, Commerzbank; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Nomura International and Macquarie Bank - are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover. The commission said it found that from at least 2007, the respondents had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US dollar / rand currency pair. It further found that the respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times. The commission said traders of the respondents primarily used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. They also used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform.  They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives. “The referral of this matter to the Tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves,” said Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele.

Financial News Hedge Funds Hedge fund investors ready to shop around Most respondents in JP Morgan's $750 billion investor survey say they will shop around for better returns in 2017 By Becky Pritchard Feb. 15, 2017 6:59 a.m. ET Investors were disappointed by so-so performance from their hedge funds last year, leading many to say they will shop around for better performance this year. After a year that saw many hedge funds stumble, three quarters of investors that responded to a survey by JP Morgan said their hedge fund investments did not meet their return targets. This was up on the two thirds of respondents in 2015. And the disappointment has come despite the fact that investors are asking hedge funds for less. JP Morgan found that two-thirds, 66% of investors have set their hedge funds an annual return target below 10% - up from 63% in 2015, and 46% in 2014. JP Morgan canvassed 234 investors who have put $750 billion into hedge funds between them; family offices, funds-of-hedge-funds, consultants and others. Nearly 90% of them said they plan to maintain their allocations to hedge funds this year. Of those looking to make changes, 75% said they would reallocate to different managers, while 49% said picking new strategies was an option. They are likely to be looking for " high conviction managers that are differentiated and uncorrelated" to the markets, JP Morgan said, with quant long-short equity, global macro, distressed credit and volatility arbitrage among the likely winners. Many hedge funds were criticised in 2016 for charging high fees for poor performance.  Overall, hedge funds in the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index ended 2016 up 5.6% against the over 11% gain in the S&P 500 Total Return Index. JP Morgan said the number of pension schemes responding to its survey had "declined significantly", accounting for only 6% of the 234 respondents. The bank said this "might be due to pensions' waning interest in hedge funds due to high fees and uneven performance". This is bad news for hedge fund managers, as pension schemes tend to make the largest individual allocations - at least $25 million per hedge fund investment, JP Morgan said, compared to $10 million or less for family offices and consultants.

"To reiterate what we've already shared when asked, we made this decision based on performance," the company said in a statement. "Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now." In other words, customers are just not into Ivanka. National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay, in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, gave a measured response. "What we are all seeing is that we're living in a world with a different kind of chief executive in the White House," he said. "It's someone who communicates directly and forcefully and has a strong opinion on issues. We are learning, all of us, I think, how to work in that environment." That's one way of putting it. Another is that the president and his aides are inviting corruption. Had any federal employee, including a Cabinet official, done what Trump did, he or she would have run afoul of federal ethics regulations, specifically, Title 5, Section 2635.702: "An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member, and persons with whom the employee has or seeks employment or business relations. ... An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office in a manner that is intended to coerce or induce another person, including a subordinate, to provide any benefit, financial or otherwise, to himself or to friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity." This is garden-variety corruption, of the type we around the country deplore in kleptocratic regimes. Likewise, if an American company consented to hire or do business with a foreign leader's children in order to grease the skids for business dealings or avoid government retribution it would be a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. As the Financial Times reported recently: "JPMorgan has agreed to pay $264m to settle a US probe into its practice of hiring well-connected Chinese 'princelings' to win business. ... " 'JPMorgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favored referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions,' said Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's enforcement division. 'JPMorgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative.' " The White House (falsely) keeps insisting the president cannot have conflicts of interest, neglecting the constitutional prohibition on receipt of monies from foreign governments. Nevertheless, Congress can and should close the gap in ethics laws given that this president refuses to divest himself of businesses and insists on using the power of his office (during the transition and currently) to benefit his family finances. Perhaps we need a presidential anti-corruption act that would make Title 5, Section 2635.702 applicable to the president and vice president. In any event, both spokesman Sean Spicer's derogatory comments (an attempt to "coerce") and counselor Kellyanne Conway, who directly hawked Ivanka's line ("I fully—I'm going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online."), seem to run afoul of existing ethics laws and should be held accountable. There may be other legal avenues as well. Ethics guru Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institution this week tweeted that there is a cause of action under California's Unfair Competition law forbidding "any unfair business act." Eisen told me Thursday, "The law has long recognized that when someone makes untrue statements about a business, and those statements cause harm, a cause of action lies. As it happens, California, which has a lot of Nordstrom's stores, has one of the most generous laws in the nation in allowing a business to respond when it is the victim of unfair treatment." He adds, "Interestingly, that law also allows the California attorney general or other public officials to bring an action as well. Nordstrom's says the president and Mr. Spicer's statements were not correct. ... [T]his was a business decision that was made because Ivanka's line was not selling, that there was nothing unfair or political about it." Conveniently, former Democratic congressman Xavier Becerra is now California's state attorney general. Over to you, Mr. Becerra. Jennifer Rubin is a Washington Post columnist.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 2 Comments Moneycontrol Bureau Tata Motors CLSA has downgraded Tata Motors to sell and slashed target price to Rs 405 from Rs 650 after cutting FY18-19 EPS estimates by 25-31 percent due to dismal performance in Q3FY17. Management commentary on JLR margins has weakened significantly, it says, adding hedging losses are likely to continue at high levels for longer. JPMorgan also reduced its target price on the stock to Rs 570 from Rs 610 after cutting FY17/18 JLR EBIT estimates by 26 percent/17 percent and consolidated earnings estimates by 33 percent/23 percent. It advises buying on dip as margin miss was not as bad as it seems. The commercial vehicle and luxury car maker's third quarter profit on consolidated basis fell sharply by 96 percent year-on-year to Rs 112 crore, impacted by big loss in domestic business and operational weakness in JLR. However, other brokerage houses also cut target price, though they retained their rating on the stock. Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock, with reduced target price at Rs 630 from Rs 680 after cutting FY17/FY18/FY19 EPS estimates by 26 percent/15 percent/12 percent. The brokerage house has built in slightly lower margins to account for higher incentives. It expects moderating forex losses from June onwards and sees progressive reduction in hedging losses. Macquarie also retained outperform rating but cut target to Rs 575 from Rs 630 after lowering FY17/18/19 consolidated EBITDA estimates by 20 percent/10 percent/7.0 percent. Most negative factors that impacted Q3 earnings are transitory, it feels. It expects stronger sales growth & margin for JLR in FY18. Deutsche Bank, which has a buy call on Tata Motors with reduced target at Rs 535 from Rs 575, says currency gains remained elusive but management looks upbeat on new models. It expects margin to normalise in medium term. Bank of America Merrill Lynch also retained buy call but cut target price to Rs 560 from Rs 575. The brokerage house forecasts consolidated EPS CAGR of 41 percent over FY16-19. It feels weaker GBP will remain a tailwind to margins in FY18/19 and pre-buy for commercial vehicles should help margins in Q4. Citi says correction in stock price is a buying opportunity as its feels details reveal a brighter picture, though headline is weak. JLR's favourable FS trends should aid in healthy volume growth, it believes. The research firm has a buy call on the stock, with a target price at Rs 660. Sun Pharma Nomura cut FY17 earnings estimates for Sun Pharma by 9 percent, FY18 by 5 percent & FY19 by 3 percent after Q3 earnings missed analysts' expectations. It sees 11 percent revenue growth & 10 percent earnings growth over next 2 years. Return on equities will fall another 200 bps to 18 percent and dividend payouts will be anaemic at 10 percent, it feels. Downside may be limited, it says. Citi has a buy call on Sun Pharma, with reduced target price at Rs 900 from Rs 970. The brokerage house raised FY17 EPS estimates by 4 percent but cut FY18/19 estimates by 7 percent/5 percent. According to the research firm, delay in fresh approvals from Halol plant would remain overhangs. After unclear earnings trajectory, Morgan Stanley retained its equal-weight rating on the stock, with reduced target price at Rs 690 from Rs 762. FY17, FY18 & FY19 EPS estimates cut buy 5.4 percent, 5.4 percent & 4.1 percent, it says. CLSA feels near-term outlook for Sun Pharma looks challenging but valuations are reasonable. The brokerage house has maintained a buy call on the stock but lowered target price to Rs 790 from Rs 800 after cutting FY17-19 EPS estimates by 1-4 percent. JPMorgan says Sun Pharma's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) miss was due to lower ex-Taro gross margins. Halol & ex-Taro performance are key drivers, it feels. The research firm is overweight on the stock, with reduced target at Rs 750 from Rs 775. Goldman Sachs has maintained buy rating on a favourable risk-reward on Sun Pharma but lowered target price to Rs 824 from Rs 836. It expects 14 percent EBITDA CAGR over FY16-19. Adani Ports While assigning a buy call on Adani Ports, with a target price of Rs 375, CLSA says strategic asset should deliver 54 percent growth in port EBITDA over FY16-19 and new corporate structure could lower taxes & boost EPS growth. Bank of America Merrill Lynch says Adani Ports' Q3 beat was led by higher realisation & SEZ income. The research firm has a buy call on the stock, with increased target price at Rs 350 from Rs 330. Credit Suisse feels valuations are reasonable at 16x. Hence, it maintained outperform rating on the stock, with target price at Rs 360. Goldman Sachs raised target price on Adani Ports to Rs 340 from Rs 333 after increasing earnings estimates by 3.6-9.6 percent for FY17-19. Jindal Steel & Power Deutsche Bank says Jindal Steel reported a strong & better-than-expected operating performance in October-December quarter and has achieved 71 percent of FY17 EBITDA forecast in 9 months. However, the research firm has retained sell rating on the stock on elevated risk from high leverage. Visibility on reduction in debt will be a strong stock price driver, it feels. Voltas Deutsche Bank has hold rating on Voltas, with a target price at Rs 365 after Q3 earnings. Cost controls offset weak revenues, Deutsche feels while Goldman Sachs says strong electro-mechanical projects margins drove bottomline beat in October-December quarter. SpiceJet CLSA has retained a sell call on SpiceJet. Fair value for the stock is Rs 35, it says.

Kelly said Yellen's remarks suggest that the Federal Reserve "will raise rates sooner, faster and more times than in the past."

Trader Dan Nathan said he likes JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Nathan said investment banks like Morgan Stanley are going to benefit from tax reform. Trader Guy Adami said he likes Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs because he expects the stock prices to continue on their run.

Banks understand, and are grabbing on to that trend. Customers who do not want to fumble around in their wallet for their ATM card — or who have misplaced it for the umpteenth time — will soon be able to unlock cash dispensers’ coffers by using their phone. JPMorgan Chase, which has more ATMs in the United States — 18,000 — than any other bank, has activated this technology on a few hundred machines in four test cities, including Miami and San Francisco. Six thousand more are upgraded and ready to go. Bank of America and Wells Fargo plan to introduce cardless options to all their machines by the end of the year. And while swiping an ATM card may not exactly seem onerous, bankers think going card-free will be a hit with consumers. “It’s about having the choice,” said Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo’s head of ATM and branch banking. “If you’ve lost your card or left home without your wallet, chances are you still have your smartphone in your hand.” But of course, any new financial technology brings with it new security holes. For decades banks have battled “skimming,” in which criminals sabotage ATMs to steal the information off a card and use it to clear out people’s accounts. The replacement of magnetic stripe cards with chip cards significantly reduced that problem, but mobile access brings in new worries. One Chase customer recently had $2,900 stolen from her account through the bank’s new cardless system — which she had never used. A thief got her online banking user name and password, installed Chase’s mobile app on his or her phone, and used it to withdraw cash. Unlike most cardless systems, Chase’s does not require customers to enter their four-digit PIN at the cash machine. Chase refunded the customer’s lost money and immediately made security changes. “We’ve put safeguards in place to protect our customers,” said Michael Fusco, a Chase spokesman. The bank’s system still does not require PINs, but Chase is confident it can detect and prevent similar attacks, he said. Other banks have fared better, and say their fraud rates on mobile ATM transactions are significantly lower than those for traditional card-swipe withdrawals. Wintrust Financial, which operates community banks in Illinois and Wisconsin, added cardless access to all its 250 cash machines nearly three years ago. Thanks to multiple layers of security, there has been no fraud so far, said Thomas P Ormseth, a senior vice president at the bank. (“Knock on wood,” he added.) How the mobile systems work varies from bank to bank — and sometimes, even within one bank. Most of the major banks are using a technology called near-field communications (known as NFC), which enables devices to exchange information wirelessly over short distances. Modern smartphones usually contain an NFC chip, which is used for many mobile payment systems, including Apple Pay and Android Pay. At Bank of America, customers with compatible phones and a digital wallet app can tap their phone on the cash machine’s wireless pad to authenticate their identity. From there, customers enter their personal identification numbers and carry out transactions in the usual way. Wells Fargo is also testing NFC and adding the hardware it requires to all of its cash machines. But in the meantime, it has a simpler approach: one-time access codes. Customers can log in to Wells Fargo’s mobile app and request one, which is good for 30 minutes. At the 900 Wells Fargo ATMs that are set up to accept the codes so far, the customer types in the code and then their PIN to withdraw cash. Mobile ATM transactions are usually at least a little bit faster than traditional ones, banks say — sometimes significantly so. Wintrust’s system, which lets customers set up their withdrawal in advance on their phone and simply scan a QR (quick response) code when they get to the machine to get their cash, cut its average transaction time to about 10 seconds from 45, Ormseth said. Around 17% of the bank’s customers have used the technology at least once. Some banks have gone further and let custo­mers ditch even their phones. With biometrics, a unique body part is enough to unlock cash. At Banco Bradesco, one of Brazil’s largest banks, customers can gain access to an ATM by tapping their palm on a scanner, which reads the pattern of their veins. (The system handled more than 700 million transactions without any reported fraud, according to Fujitsu, which built the technology.) Banks in Japan, India and elsewhere have used fingerprints for authentication. Problematic innovation Citibank experimented two years ago with an iris-scanning ATM, showing off a prototype at a trade show. The reaction was everything the bank had hoped for: “People’s jaws dropped,” said Mark Gilder, Citibank’s director of ATM distribution in the US. “They thought it was magical. You just had to look at the machine, and money would come out.” Then reality set in. A compromised bank card can be reissued. If a hacker figures out how to imitate someone’s eyeball — which has been done in laboratory settings — it cannot be replaced. For that and other reasons, Citibank shelved its iris scanner, for now. It is also taking a wait-and-see approach to cardless ATMs. “We want to be ready when people no longer carry cards and leave their wallets at home, but that timeline is developing more slowly than perhaps we thought it would a few years ago,” Gilder said. This year, though, could be a tipping point. About 2.5% of the 425,000 ATMs in the country are set up for cardless access, according to an estimate from Crone Consulting, which researches the payments industry. By the fall, it expects that number to rise to 25%. As with mobile wallets, technical hurdles may hamper customer enthusiasm. People will generally need to install their bank’s mobile app on their phone, and each major bank is setting up access for only its own customers. So, for example, a Chase customer will not be able to pop into a Bank of America branch and withdraw money using a mobile phone. That is likely to change eventually. In the early days of ATMs, networks were independent and isolated; now customers take it for granted that their cards will work at nearly any machine. The biggest opportunity in cardless access will come as it expands to financial services beyond traditional bank accounts, said Richard Crone of Crone Consulting. Even if mobile wallets finally take off and phones replace debit and credit cards, there are still times — even for millennials — when only old-fashioned cash will do.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Beauty in the Sky: Aero India begins...

The bank behemoth may have finally broken out of its long consolidation phase. Following its post-election rally from the $17.00 area, the rally stalled at the $23.50 area. In fact, until today the issue had been in a trading range from $21.95 to $23.55 since December 7. During that time period, the issue made multiple highs in the $23.50 area. After ending Monday's session at $23.40, the issue didn't have far to travel to clear the former high for the move at $23.55 and embark on its ascent to $24.00. At this time, the current high stands at $23.97. Bank of American hasn't traded in the $24.00 handle since November 2008, when it peaked at $24.62 that month and would bottom out three months later at $2.52 during the financial crisis.

Industry Voice Industry Voice: Sentiment does not reflect strong healthcare sector fundamentals Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   0 Comments New products, strong finances and robust growth were the main talking points at JP Morgan's recent healthcare conference in San Francisco. There were positive signals regarding the fundraising climate, as well as the strength of innovation within the sector. Reporting season for 2016 is now getting under way and most companies should meet expectations. Good funding levels in the biotech sector, combined with low va­luations and potentially favourable tax changes in the US, are expected to give takeover activity a big boost. The recently announced acquisition of Ariad Pharma by Takeda and the Actelion takeover by Johnson & Johnson mark the beginning of this trend. Actelion has long been one of BB Biotech's core investments.

Goshen College campus newspaper Home News Features Arts Perspectives Sports Funnies Contact Students urge GC divestment from Chase By Record February 10, 2017 0 Comment News Naomi Gross and Hannah Yoder, both seniors, wrote* a petition on Jan. 31 to the Goshen College community which stated their demand for the institution to divest its accounts in J.P. Morgan Chase, the banking company which has given its support to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. That day was also the day in which North Dakota senators recommended an easement passed on to them by the Army Corps of Engineers suggesting they allow the drilling under Lake Oahe and the Missouri River, both on top of lands held by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s land. The petition reminded students of President Brenneman’s recent message to students, ensuring them of Goshen College’s commitment to social justice in these times of political upheaval. “This easement would finish the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, and have disastrous implications for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and everyone in the country due to the large potential environmental destruction that will occur,” said Gross. “The fight at Standing Rock is twofold: a fight for indigenous self-determination and a fight for the water and the environment.” In accordance with that call to social justice, students, professors and alumni alike have signed the petition supporting the seniors’ demands for divestment. Nearly 200 signatures have been acquired, attracting the attention of the administration. Since then, the easement has been passed, allowing the continued drilling without proper environmental impacts studies. Gross, Yoder, Laura Miller, Sarah Hofkamp, Chelsea Risser and Naomi Salvador, all seniors, met with several members of the administration on Feb. 2,* to discuss possible plans for Goshen’s divestment. Glenn Gilbert, sustainability coordinator, Deanna Risser, interim vice president for finance and Ken Newbold, provost and executive vice president were the administrators present in that meeting. Miller, Gross, and Hofkamp have drafted a  tentative statement of intent for the college, which reads:* “Open Letter: Divest Goshen College from Chase Bank Recently President Brenneman issued a campus-wide email declaring his and the institution’s commitment to social justice. On January 31, ND Senators Hoeven and Cramer issued statements suggesting that the Department of Army has recommended that the Army Corps of Engineers grant Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) the necessary easement to drill under Lake Oahe and the Missouri River on Standing Rock Sioux Tribe land. The granting of this easement would be a clear violation under federal law, which declares that no easements can be granted before existing Environmental Impact Statements are complete. The granting of the easement could come at any moment. Therefore, we, as Goshen College students, demand that Goshen College divest all institutional funds from Chase Bank, a financial sponsor of DAPL, and make a corresponding public statement explaining their withdrawal from Chase and declaring their opposition to construction of DAPL. We demand that this statement be directly released to Goshen College, the City, State Senators, Chase Bank, and the Army Corps of Engineers.” “It’s not just about the Pipeline,” said Gross. “It’s worth noting that Chase is invested in many other unethical corporations and industries, including private prisons (GEO Group and CoreCivic, the two largest private corrections companies in the US) and the military industrial complex.” Through Chase, which is the college’s primary bank, Goshen conducts day-to-day operations and holds $24 million in debt through the bank. Because the college has many small accounts, the process is timely and costly, ultimately preventing the divestment in one swift action.* “Because most of us involved are seniors, we need to recruit people who will be invested in this process for years to come,” said Miller. “We need students who care about the issue, as well as students with some business knowledge.” In this sense, the college would work through the divestment alongside the students. Many of the students involved in this process have already left campus, a decision made after the easement was passed, to travel to Standing Rock in solidarity with those who continue to protest at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Gross, Yoder, Risser, Salvador and Deeksha Pagar, a junior, all left by car on the night of Feb. 7 to protest for the foreseeable future. “We encourage other people to come as well,” said Gross. “Just make sure you are organized and ready when you come.” For those who are interested in becoming a part of this process and conversation, email Laura Miller at lemiller@goshen.edu. *A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the two students released the statement. It also incorrectly stated that the meeting was held on Feb. 6. It also incorrectly implied that tentative plans were laid out for the coming years. Tagged News Written by Record No comments yet.

JP Morgan Asset Management has acquired Infinis' 19 operating wind projects and one site still under construction The portfolio comprises 19 projects totalling 343MW of generating capacity, with a further 66MW project under construction and due online by the end of February.  The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The sell-off will remove all of Infinis's generating portfolio, said Terra Firma, which owns the developer.  It continues to own a portfolio of 14 onshore wind projects currently in the development stage, which Terra Firma said it would "look to sell in due course". "We are delighted to acquire the onshore operational wind interests of Infinis's UK wind portfolio from Terra Firma. The acquisition continues our investment momentum in renewables, complementing the existing investment base, and increases our renewables energy production capacity to over 3.2GW," said JP Morgan Asset Management chief investment officer of the infrastructure investments group, Matthew LeBlanc.  The deal follows the sale of Infinis's landfill gas assets in December 2016 to 3i Infrastructure. Terra Firma acquired Infinis in 2003 as part of a larger takeover. Shares in the developer were floated in 2014, but it was taken private by Terra Firma again in 2015 following the UK government's decision to end the exemption of renewable energy sources from the climate change levy (CCL).  Infinis called for a judicial review in to the change in tax exemption, claiming it gave operators far too little warning, but lost the case in the High Court in February 2016 and was dismissed in a Court of Appeal hearing in November 2016.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 14 February 2017 | MYT 5:45 PM New witness delays trial over bitcoin exchange tied to JPMorgan hack Delayed trial: A US District Judge delayed jury selection until Feb 14 after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. — Reuters NEW YORK: The trial of two men was delayed on Feb 13 in a case stemming from a probe into a Bitcoin exchange and a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co after prosecutors revealed a new witness. Jury selection was set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, whom authorities call the architect of Bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. But US District Judge Alison Nathan delayed jury selection until Feb 14 after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. The witness, Philip Burgess, was represented by the law firm of one of Gross' lawyers in an unrelated tax case in which he was sentenced in 2010 to eight months in prison. Assistant US Attorney Daniel Noble said Burgess, while "reporting another potential fraud" to prosecutors on Feb 8, revealed he had incriminating information stemming from his time as a potential investor in the credit union Gross headed. But after spending the day discussing how to resolve the conflict of Gross and Burgess sharing the same law firm, Nathan ruled prosecutors could not call their eve-of-trial new witness. "It is my conclusion that we will proceed tomorrow and the government may not call Mr. Burgess," she said. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, are among nine people who have been charged following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts. While Gross and Lebedev were not accused of hacking, they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Florida resident Anthony Murgio and owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon.Shalon has pleaded not guilty to charges that he orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million people's information. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid US$150,000 (RM666,225) in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said. Federal regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty in January. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested ‘League of Legends’ adds practice mode Brazil judge rules Uber drivers are employees, deserve benefits Carpool and save with GrabShare Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Spotify expands with World Trade Centre move Gartner: Spend your limited IT budget wisely Others Also Read Ensuring a clean and safe Thaipusam Butterworth Art Walk in alley aimed at getting visitors to stop and ponder Najib: New KL ATCC will enable improved air traffic control facilities advertisement Latest News Carpool and save with GrabShare Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Stand up to cancer Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The state-owned company, also known as Nama Holding, will raise the funds through a combination of loans and bond sales, said the people, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Nama will use the funds to finance its projects, they said. Oman, the biggest Middle East oil producer that’s not a member of Opec, is increasing borrowing as the government seeks to finance a budget deficit caused by low oil prices. The country plans to raise as much as $2 billion through bond sales this year and OMR600 million from local debt, an official at Oman’s central bank said in December. JPMorgan declined to comment, while Bank Muscat didn’t respond to requests for comment. The government appointed banks including JPMorgan, HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc to help manage the sale of international bonds and a local currency sukuk, people with knowledge of the offering said in January. Nama holds the government’s stake in nine local electricity companies, according to its website.

Cards The New York Times By STACY COWLEY 2 days ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL 27 things you probably didn't know about Netflix The most expensive trailer parks in the US © Minh Uong/The New York Times Wallets can be lost, stolen or forgotten, but most people today wouldn’t be caught dead without their phones. Quotes in the article Wintrust Financial Corp WTFC ▲ 75.46 +0.43 +0.57% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 135.51 +0.49 +0.36% Fujitsu Ltd FJTSY ▲ 28.66 +0.14 +0.49% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▲ 58.55 +0.57 +0.98% Banks understand, and are grabbing on to that trend. Customers who don’t want to fumble around in their wallet for their A.T.M. card — or who have misplaced it for the umpteenth time — will soon be able to unlock cash dispensers’ coffers by using their phone. JPMorgan Chase, which has more A.T.M.s in the United States — 18,000 — than any other bank, has activated this technology on a few hundred machines in four test cities, including Miami and San Francisco. Six thousand more are already upgraded and ready to go. Bank of America and Wells Fargo plan to introduce cardless options to all their machines by the end of the year. And while swiping an A.T.M. card may not exactly seem onerous, bankers think going card-free will be a hit with consumers. “It’s about having the choice,” said Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo’s head of A.T.M. and branch banking. “If you’ve lost your card or left home without your wallet, chances are you still have your smartphone in your hand.” But of course, any new financial technology brings with it new security holes. For decades banks have battled “skimming,” in which criminals sabotage A.T.M.s to steal the information off a card and use it to clear out people’s accounts. The replacement of magnetic stripe cards with chip cards significantly reduced that problem, but mobile access brings in new worries. One Chase customer recently had $2,900 stolen from her account through the bank’s new cardless system — which she had never used. A thief got her online banking user name and password, installed Chase’s mobile app on his or her phone, and used it to withdraw cash. Unlike most cardless systems, Chase’s does not require customers to enter their four-digit PIN at the cash machine. Chase refunded the customer’s lost money and immediately made security changes. “We’ve put safeguards in place to protect our customers,” said Michael Fusco, a Chase spokesman. The bank’s system still does not require PINs, but Chase is confident it can now detect and prevent similar attacks, he said. Other banks have fared better, and say their fraud rates on mobile A.T.M. transactions are significantly lower than those for traditional card-swipe withdrawals. Wintrust Financial, which operates community banks in Illinois and Wisconsin, added cardless access to all its 250 cash machines nearly three years ago. Thanks to multiple layers of security, there has been no fraud so far, said Thomas P. Ormseth, a senior vice president at the bank. (“Knock on wood,” he added.) How the mobile systems work varies from bank to bank — and sometimes, even within one bank. © James Estrin/The New York Times Banks are introducing cardless options to their A.T.M.s. Customers may enjoy the convenience, but the technology also opens some security holes. Most of the major banks are using a technology called near-field communications (known as “N.F.C.”), which enables devices to exchange information wirelessly over short distances. Modern smartphones usually contain an N.F.C. chip, which is used for many mobile payment systems, including Apple Pay and Android Pay. At Bank of America, customers with compatible phones and a digital wallet app can tap their phone on the cash machine’s wireless pad to authenticate their identity. From there, customers enter their personal identification numbers and carry out transactions in the usual way. Wells Fargo is also testing N.F.C. and adding the hardware it requires to all of its cash machines. But in the meantime, it has a simpler approach: one-time access codes. Customers can log in to Wells Fargo’s mobile app and request one, which is good for 30 minutes. At the 900 Wells Fargo A.T.M.s that are set up to accept the codes so far, the customer types in the code and then their P.I.N. to withdraw cash. Mobile A.T.M. transactions are usually at least a little bit faster than traditional ones, banks say — sometimes significantly so. Wintrust’s system, which lets customers set up their withdrawal in advance on their phone and simply scan a QR (Quick Response) code when they get to the machine to get their cash, cut its average transaction time from about 45 seconds to 10, Mr. Ormseth said. Around 17 percent of the bank’s customers have used the technology at least once. Some banks have gone further and let customers ditch even their phones. With biometrics, a unique body part is enough to unlock cash. At Banco Bradesco, one of Brazil’s largest banks, customers can access an A.T.M. by tapping their palm on a scanner, which reads the pattern of their veins. (The system handled more than 700 million transactions without any reported fraud, according to Fujitsu, which built the technology.) Banks in Japan, India and elsewhere have used fingerprints for authentication. Citibank experimented two years ago with an iris-scanning A.T.M., showing off a prototype at a trade show. The reaction was everything the bank had hoped for: “People’s jaws dropped,” said Mark Gilder, Citibank’s director of A.T.M. distribution in the United States. “They thought it was magical. You just had to look at the machine, and money would come out.” Then reality set in. A compromised bank card can be reissued. If a hacker figures out how to imitate someone’s eyeball — which has been done in laboratory settings — it can’t be replaced. For that and other reasons, Citibank shelved its iris scanner, for now. It is also taking a wait-and-see approach to cardless A.T.M.s. “We want to be ready when people no longer carry cards and leave their wallets at home, but that timeline is developing more slowly than perhaps we thought it would a few years ago,” Mr. Gilder said. This year, though, could be a tipping point. About 2.5 percent of the 425,000 A.T.M.s in the country are currently set up for cardless access, according to an estimate from Crone Consulting, which researches the payments industry. By the fall, it expects that number to rise to 25 percent. As with mobile wallets, technical hurdles may hamper customer enthusiasm. People will generally need to install their bank’s mobile app on their phone, and each major bank is setting up access for only its own customers. So, for example, a Chase customer will not be able to pop into a Bank of America branch and withdraw money using a mobile phone. That is likely to change eventually. In the early days of A.T.M.s, networks were independent and isolated; now, customers take it for granted that their cards will work at nearly any machine. The biggest opportunity in cardless access will come as it expands to financial services beyond traditional bank accounts, said Richard Crone of Crone Consulting. “Think of things that don’t have cards issued against them, like money market accounts or Venmo,” he said. “Unlocking cash access to those accounts would be a really big deal.” Venmo, the digital payment system of choice for many millennials, is owned by PayPal. Giving PayPal and Venmo customers direct access to their money through A.T.M.s is not currently in the works, but it “isn’t something I would rule out,” said Chris Gardner, the product head for PayPal’s mobile wallet software. Even if mobile wallets finally take off and phones replace debit and credit cards, there are still times — even for millennials — when only old-fashioned cash will do.

The two men were arrested in Florida on August 4, 2015. REUTERS/File Photos By Nate Raymond NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trial of two men was delayed on Monday in a case stemming from a probe into a bitcoin exchange and a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co after prosecutors revealed a new witness. Jury selection was set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, whom authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. But U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan delayed jury selection until Tuesday after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. The witness, Philip Burgess, was represented by the law firm of one of Gross' lawyers in an unrelated tax case in which he was sentenced in 2010 to eight months in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Noble said Burgess, while "reporting another potential fraud" to prosecutors on Wednesday, revealed he had incriminating information stemming from his time as a potential investor in the credit union Gross headed. But after spending the day discussing how to resolve the conflict of Gross and Burgess sharing the same law firm, Nathan ruled prosecutors could not call their eve-of-trial new witness. "It is my conclusion that we will proceed tomorrow and the government may not call Mr. Burgess," she said. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, are among nine people who have been charged following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts. While Gross and Lebedev were not accused of hacking, they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Florida resident Anthony Murgio and owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon.Shalon has pleaded not guilty to charges that he orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million people's information. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid $150,000 in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said. Federal regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty in January.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    BlackRock Inc. is looking to capitalize on Argentina’s improving fortunes, but it may be too late. The world’s largest asset manager unveiled the iShares MSCI Argentina Global Exposure ETF on Feb. 2, four months before MSCI Inc. will decide whether the country qualifies for inclusion in its emerging-market index. An upgrade from its current designation as a frontier market may prompt investors to pour $1 billion into Argentine stocks, says JPMorgan Chase & Co.  But BlackRock -- whose more than 800 ETFs make it the world’s largest provider of such funds -- will be playing catch-up as it seeks to capitalize on a stock market boom fueled by President Mauricio Macri’s dismantling of capital controls. That’s because it will have to contend with the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF -- the only other U.S.-listed ETF covering Argentine equities. The fund, which has about $100 million in assets, has already staked its claim since starting in 2011. That means even mighty BlackRock may struggle to lure buyers, said Sebastian Mercado, a strategist for ETFs at Deutsche Bank AG. “There’s always a level of loyalty for the first to market,” he said. “It’s very difficult to get a first-to-market out of the market, even if you have BlackRock. The reason for that is that first-to-market tends to encompass liquidity as well.” BlackRock need only look to its experience in Colombia to realize the importance of being first on the scene.  Fee Battles The company’s Colombia equity ETF, known as ICOL, had initially charged a lower fee than Global X’s GXG for the same country, which was unveiled four years earlier in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Global X boosted a fee waiver in July 2014 that it had first added in June 2013, moves that put GXG’s overall expense in line with that of BlackRock’s ICOL. With $100 million in assets, the GXG fund dwarfs the less than $18 million accumulated by ICOL. “Brand power is important to a certain extent,” said Edward Lopez, head of ETF Product Management at VanEck Associates. “But even if a higher-cost product has already dominated in terms of assets and trading volume, nothing else will really matter.” ARGT charges 74 basis points per fund share. BlackRock hasn’t disclosed its management fee for its Argentina ETF. BlackRock -- whose ETF will track an index that includes 25 companies categorized by MSCI as being Argentine -- is seeking to tap into soaring investor optimism in the country since Macri took office in December 2015. The nation’s benchmark index has gained 65 percent in dollar terms over the past 12 months. “ARGT saw $58 million in inflows since President Macri’s election in November 2015, reflecting renewed investor interest in the country,” said Jay Jacobs, vice president and director of research at Global X. Argentina Appeal In January, Macri jettisoned a rule that required investments remain in Argentina for at least 120 days, stoking speculation that the country is poised for an upgrade. The implementation of capital controls led MSCI to downgrade the country’s stocks to frontier market in 2009, relegating it to a universe that includes the likes of Kazakhstan and Morocco. Last year, the index provider said it would evaluate the country’s classification and will announce its decision in June. In a Morgan Stanley survey, investors said the country’s MSCI reclassification was the second-most important catalyst for Argentine stocks after price stability. Investors with $1.6 trillion in assets follow MSCI’s emerging-market index, versus an estimated $26 billion for the frontier gauge. “Although Argentina is still in the early stages of regaining access to the global market place and beginning what could be a multi-year fiscal adjustment process, the current administration has committed to structural reforms intended to help Argentina achieve more sustainable growth in the future,” said Paul Young, a spokesman for BlackRock. For buyers who are seeking exposure to Argentina but still wary of the local stock market’s low liquidity -- only an average of $20 million trades every day -- an ETF makes a lot of sense. “We don’t have boots on the ground in Argentina to know those trading markets and we manage separate accounts where our clients felt more comfortable owning dollar denominated assets versus ARS denominated assets,” said Andy Wester, a money manager at Proficio Capital Partners LLC who owns Global X’s ARGT ETF. The fund allows for liquid access to an otherwise obscure market and to the industries he thinks are more representative of the Argentine economy, like energy, he said. Almost 20 percent of the fund is made up of steel-pipe maker Tenaris, while 8 percent consists of state-controlled oil company YPF. Still, Wester suggests there may be a potential opening for BlackRock, saying it would just come down to fees. “With all else being equal, we would move into a new ETF with a lower fee,” Wester said. “Assuming ARGT wouldn’t slash their fees to be competitive, that is.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Two days of testimony this week from a more hawkish and confident Fed Chair Janet Yellen, and stronger-than-expected retail sales and consumer inflation data Wednesday, combined to move some expectations for a Fed rate hike slightly forward. JPMorgan, in fact, said it now sees the Fed hiking in May, rather than June, as most of Wall Street expects. Market expectations moved up slightly to about a 30 percent chance of a hike as early as March. "[Yellen] made it very clear that the economic data matters, and the trajectory of monetary policy is predicated on better economic data, along with inflation moving higher. We're going to be watching the data releases that come out tomorrow," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. Thursday's reports include weekly jobless claims, housing starts and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing, all at 8:30 a.m. ET. There are also earnings reports from Alexion, Encana, TransCanada, Dean Foods, Wendy's, Cabela's, GNC Holdings, Time and others before the opening bell. Con Ed, Allscripts Healthcare, WebMD, Yamana Gold and TrueCar, are among companies reporting after the close. As Fed expectations have risen, so have Treasury yields, with the two-year note yield at 1.24 percent late Wednesday and the 10-year at 2.49 percent. Stocks surged Wednesday, closing at a record high for a fifth day. The S&P 500 was up 11 at 2,349, while the Dow was up 107 at 20,611. The Nasdaq was up 36 points at 5,819. "Obviously all eyes are on the White House, who is going to be Labor secretary," said Krosby. Andrew Puzder withdrew, after it appeared he would be rejected by the Senate. Krosby said the market has chosen not to focus on controversies in the Trump White House, like the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and reports about Trump campaign contacts with Russia. "The market has just zeroed in on growth, pro-business, rolling back regulation and as long as the market believes this is his agenda, and he is going to follow through, the market has just embraced that," she said. "It's a market that for so many years has wanted a pro-business backdrop. It finally gets that, and I think it sees the issues coming from the White House, personnel issues, as just a zig with a zag," she said. Krosby said it was a positive the VIX, the CBOE volatility index, jumped 11 percent Wednesday to just near 12. She said a higher VIX would remove some concerns that there is too much complacency in the market. "Today the victory was for the financials, taking another leg up on the back of a higher 10-year yield and continued potential for scaled back regulation," she said. The S&P financial sector rose 0.7 percent Wednesday, and was up 3.1 percent week to date. "Also the president seems to have moderated some of his views with regard to China. Those are the sort of things that have worried investors," she said, noting his friendlier tone with China and a report that he was not likely to label China a currency manipulator. show chapters Many fundamental reasons to take advantage of the market: Kate Moore    21 Hours Ago | 03:15 Patti DommCNBC Markets Editor To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Thursday, February 16, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Archive thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Hong Kong police struggle to stop brokerage hacking spree February 16, 2017, Thursday HONG KONG: Hong Kong police are struggling to deal with digital pump-and-dump schemes targeting brokerages – a little-known type of computer-generated fraud that surged in the Chinese territory last year. Although the money involved was small – only about US$20 million worth of shares – there were 81 such incidents reported in 2016, more than triple the number in 2015, according to police. In the scheme, criminals invest in thinly traded penny stocks and then manipulate their share prices by ordering trades from hacked brokerage accounts. They earn profits by selling before the fraudulent trades are reported. After last year’s cyber-heist of US$81 million at Bangladesh’s central bank and a series of hacks of ATM’s around the world, authorities fear such pump-and-dump schemes could be increasingly used for electronic theft. Hong Kong is a favoured place for such attacks because of the number of thinly-traded penny stocks in the territory and because its securities industry has fallen behind other financial centers in defending against cyber fraud. At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China International (BOCI) Securities, according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations. A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for BOCI Securities said he could not comment on its case but the brokerage would continue to invest in IT security. “If you ask regulators in the industry what is the number one threat, not surprisingly it’s all about cyber attacks,” Ashley Alder, CEO of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, said in a speech to the local legislature last week. “We’ve seen that happen not only in banking but also at brokers in Hong Kong, in particular recent attacks to do with basically hijacking share trading accounts.”  Such schemes surfaced more than a decade ago in the United States. Charles Schwab Corp, E*Trade Financial Corp and JP Morgan Chase & Co. were identified as victims of these schemes in a 2006 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The pace of attacks reported in the United States has slowed in recent years after big brokerages implemented a variety of strategies to thwart the hacks, said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Office of Internet Enforcement. Some use algorithms to identify and halt unusual trading activity, others scrutinise Internet traffic for orders coming from suspicious servers and one stopped permitting customers to use its online trading platform from buying penny stocks, said Stark, who now runs cyber-security consulting firm John Reed Stark Consulting LLC. But such protections are rare in Hong Kong, where the government has only recently started suggesting security improvements to banks and brokerages which have traditionally considered stock trading to be low-risk. The Hong Kong SFC last year told firms to increase surveillance of client transactions and data protection. Authorities believe that hackers accessed brokerage accounts using stolen or guessed passwords, according to investigators. This might have been thwarted if they were protected with two-factor authentication, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has said. Two-factor authentication typically includes a password and a piece of information only the user has, for instance an electronic token with changing numbers. “Hong Kong is being targeted because they have not instituted the same cyber protections that we see in the US and certain parts of Europe,” said Jeff Cramer, a former US prosecutor. Cramer, who is managing director with cyber-security investigations firm Berkeley Research Group, said he expects to see more attacks in Hong Kong and perhaps other Asian nations, including China, Japan and South Korea that are also behind in cyber security. Such pump and dump cases have proven tough to crack in the United States because the masterminds are typically overseas, using surrogates and pseudonyms to make investments. Brokerages are typically not required to go public when they are hacked, so cases often only surface when the government files a complaint against suspected cyber criminals, or the hack results in litigation. The attack involving BOCI Securities year became public after it was sued by a customer that claimed its account was breached. Trading firm Fast Track Holdings Limited alleged in court documents that somebody hacked into its brokerage account on the afternoon of September 23 using a valid user ID and password. Within 18 minutes, the intruder had emptied the account by spending HKUS$38 million to buy 49 million shares of thinly traded Pa Shun Pharmaceutical, according to Fast Track. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

Africa   17 banks to be prosecuted in S. Africa for collusion Source: Xinhua   2017-02-16 03:14:20             Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African Competition Commission said Wednesday they have referred 17 banks to their tribunal for prosecution of collusion. Among the 17 banks, 3 of them are South Africa's biggest banks who face prosecution of collusion for price fixing of the South African rand. The country's consumer watchdog has been investigating the banks for the past two years and has resolved to refer the case to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution. The Competition Commission said the banks manipulated the price for bids and offers through an agreement to abstain from trading and creating fake bids and offers at given times. The collusion happened through groups chats. The South African Banks involved in collusion includes Standard Bank of South Africa, Absa and Investec. The foreign banks involved are JP Morgan Chase Bank, Barclays Capital, Barclays Bank, HSBC Bank and Bank of America Merril Lynch International, among others. Tembinkosi Bonakele, one of the Commissioners from the Competition Commission said "the referral of this matter to the tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves." The Commission said the banks had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving U.S. dollar and rand currency pair. According to the Commission, some banks used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. Some used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. The banks coordinated trading times and helped each other to reach desired prices. The Commission applied to the Tribunal to declare that the 17 banks as having contravened the Competition Act and are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10 percent of their annual turnover. South African ruling party, African National Congress spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the actions by the banks are an attack on the constitutional mandate of the South African Reserve Bank to protect the value of the South African currency.

Africa for collusion Source: Xinhua 2017-02-16 03:14:20 JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African Competition Commission said Wednesday they have referred 17 banks to their tribunal for prosecution of collusion. Among the 17 banks, 3 of them are South Africa's biggest banks who face prosecution of collusion for price fixing of the South African rand. The country's consumer watchdog has been investigating the banks for the past two years and has resolved to refer the case to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution. The Competition Commission said the banks manipulated the price for bids and offers through an agreement to abstain from trading and creating fake bids and offers at given times. The collusion happened through groups chats. The South African Banks involved in collusion includes Standard Bank of South Africa, Absa and Investec. The foreign banks involved are JP Morgan Chase Bank, Barclays Capital, Barclays Bank, HSBC Bank and Bank of America Merril Lynch International, among others. Tembinkosi Bonakele, one of the Commissioners from the Competition Commission said "the referral of this matter to the tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves." The Commission said the banks had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving U.S. dollar and rand currency pair. According to the Commission, some banks used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. Some used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. The banks coordinated trading times and helped each other to reach desired prices. The Commission applied to the Tribunal to declare that the 17 banks as having contravened the Competition Act and are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10 percent of their annual turnover. South African ruling party, African National Congress spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the actions by the banks are an attack on the constitutional mandate of the South African Reserve Bank to protect the value of the South African currency. "The African National Congress takes an extremely dim view of the activities of the listed banks, understanding the banking sector as being instrumental to our quest for economic growth and development," he said.

Shedding Opel and U.K. nameplate Vauxhall would eliminate GM's overlap with Fiat in Europe and allow GM to replace money-losing operations with Fiat's profitable marques. Fiat chief executive officer Sergio Marchionne is still open to a deal even though GM rejected his overtures in 2015 and his focus at the moment is on meeting financial targets, according to people with knowledge of the carmaker's strategy. If PSA Group, manufacturer of Peugeot and Citroen vehicles, succeeds in buying Opel, "it would certainly fuel additional M&A speculation, including possibly Fiat taking another shot at GM," Jose Asumendi, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase in London, said in a note to clients. Fiat shares rose as much as 3.3 per cent on Wednesday. The gain extended the surge into record figures that began on Tuesday after GM said it's considering selling Opel and Vauxhall to France's PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars. Marchionne, who completed Fiat's acquisition of U.S.-based Chrysler in 2014, has often said that automakers should merge to become more profitable, arguing that billions of dollars are wasted by the industry on creating multiple versions of the same technology. High costs for developing more energy-efficient cars and adding self-driving features are putting pressure on traditional automakers, which also face threats from new rivals such as Tesla Inc. Even with a potential opening for a deal, Marchionne is focused on reaching operational targets, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the information is private. At the Detroit car show in January, Marchionne suggested that President Donald Trump might support a tie-up between Fiat and GM, although the CEO later downplayed his statement. Representatives at Fiat Chrysler and GM declined to comment. On Wednesday, GM CEO Mary Barra and company president Dan Ammann were in Germany for a number of visits in a bid to win political support for the proposed sale of Opel to PSA Group. The sale would mark GM's exit from Europe after losing about $9.1 billion (all figures U.S.) in the region since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009. That creates a tough hurdle for any deal that would expose the company to the region's saturated and mature auto market. Even if it loses Opel's one million in annual deliveries, the company is not interested in a merger with Fiat or any other major automaker, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because the information is private. GM's management believes the company has plenty of size even without Opel. Still, a GM-Fiat deal could be possible down the line, Banca Akros analyst Gabriele Gambarova wrote in a note to clients. "The move doesn't automatically mean that GM is ready" for a deal with Fiat, he said. "But it can create better conditions for a possible tie-up." Marchionne has focused on completing an ambitious business plan that would put Fiat on stronger footing ever since his public courtship of GM in 2015 ended fruitlessly. His targets for 2018 include more than doubling profit and turning 4.6 billion euros ($4.9 billion) of debt into at least 4 billion euros of cash. His efforts have paid off: Fiat's shares have almost doubled in the past year, giving the company a market value of 16.5 billion euros. Investors have been bidding up the stock as Fiat has reported better-than-expected financial results and expressed higher confidence in reaching its goals. While the stock gains have made Fiat more expensive, the company's value is still less than a third of GM's $55.8 billion.

Bloomberg News reports that The Competition Commission identified banks including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Nomura as having participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since at least 2007. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal, concluding an investigation that began almost two years ago. ''The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the commission said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” Hit the link below to access the complete Bloomberg News article: South Africa Regulator Says Banks Colluded on Forex Trades UBS France Said to Be Charged With Harassment Amid Tax Probe And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

Now, that volatility could be spurred by the Trump administration. Hawkish foreign policy positions, coupled with looser domestic regulation, could create an avalanche of selling from two of the biggest Treasury buyers: big U.S. banks and China. Since the financial crisis, banks have been stockpiling Treasurys because they qualify as "safe" assets that count toward required regulatory capital levels. U.S. commercial banks now hold $2.4 trillion in government debt and agency securities, more than double the total from nine years ago, according to the St. Louis Fed. But House Republicans — with the support of the administration — are pushing to roll back parts of the Dodd-Frank regulations that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. That means banks could get a reprieve from those capital level requirements, and they could reduce their Treasury holdings as a result. In a report, RBC managing director and banking analyst Gerard Cassidy calculates the 24 largest bank holding companies already hold $100 billion in excess capital, with Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase having the highest dollar amount. As regulation eases, the capital that was once used as a large cushion against a future recession could be funneled into stock buybacks. Those Treasury-heavy portfolios "will certainly be the source of cash to use to buy back stock," Cassidy wrote in an e-mail to CNBC. Banks have already been slowly selling off the debt, which causes yields to rise. Between the middle of 2013 and 2014, Bank of America's holdings of U.S. Treasurys grew from $2.9 billion to $58 billion. At the end of 2016, that figure had dropped to $48 billion, according to the bank's earnings. Wells Fargo's $26 billion Treasury balance in September is down nearly 30 percent from a year ago. Not all banks break out the specific balance, but the totals as of the third quarter of 2016 range from $23 billion (Morgan Stanley) to $111 billion (Citigroup). The bigger risk: China But banks are just one source of possible selling en masse. China is a creditor of a different magnitude: The country held $1.05 trillion in Treasurys as of November, down by $215 billion from a year earlier. It dumped $41 billion in U.S. debt in October alone, a move that relinquished its ranking as the largest foreign creditor to the United States. One reason for the country selling U.S. debt previously was its need to raise cash to prop up its currency, the yuan, after years of seeking to devalue it to make its exports more attractive. Its intervention in the currency markets led President Donald Trump, while campaigning, to label China a currency manipulator and threaten a 45 percent tariff on products made in China but sold in the United States. Goldman Sachs senior political economist Alec Phillips writes that if the White House pursues a unilateral policy on tariffs on Chinese products, one possible avenue for China to retaliate would be to dump even more U.S. Treasurys. "China would retaliate swiftly against even a slight increase in tariffs," according to the report, citing Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Now it appears the administration may take a broader approach to foreign currencies. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Commerce Department could pursue a blanket policy against currency manipulation by any country in an effort to avoid singling out China and keep the relationship intact. But if a creditor of that magnitude is angered, the Treasury market could be the first place it looks to send a message back to the United States. — CNBC's Stephanie Dhue contributed to this report. show chapters Cramer: Why it's critical to watch boring bonds to detect the economy's next move    Thursday, 9 Feb 2017 | 6:40 PM ET | 14:30 Kayla TauscheCNBC Correspondent Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change C --- US 10-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- AGG --- BND --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

The Michigan Chronicle Leave a comment Terence Blanchard Regina Carter The Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO) will honor trumpeter, composer, and Fred A. & Barbara M. Erb Jazz Creative Chair Terence Blanchard and jazz violinist and MacArthur Fellow Regina Carter at the 39th annual Classical Roots Celebration. Classical Roots honors African-American composers, musicians, and educators for lifetime achievement and raises funds to support the DSO’s African-American music and musician development programs. The concert will take place on Friday, March 3 at 8 p.m. at Orchestra Hall, located within the Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Music Center. The celebration—presented by JPMorgan Chase and the DTE Energy Foundation—surrounds the performance, featuring a pre-concert strolling dinner and a post-concert celebration in The Cube. A separate performance featuring the same program in a concert-only setting, scheduled for Friday, March 3 at 10:45 a.m. as a Classical Series Coffee Concert, will take place as planned. The DSO will present the world premiere of a yet-unnamed piece composed by Blanchard marking the 50th anniversary of Detroit’s tumultuous summer of 1967. (Please note: Blanchard does not perform on the piece, which is scored for orchestra and voice.) Kazem Abdullah will conduct the program, which also includes a performance by Carter and Jeffrey Mumford’s cello concerto titled of fields unfolding…echoing depths of resonant light with guest cellist Christine Lamprea, First Prize winner of the 2013 Sphinx Competition. A performance by the Brazeal Dennard Chorale will also be featured. The premiere of Blanchard’s piece is an element of the DSO’s partnership with Detroit 67: Looking Back to MOVE FORWARD, a multi-year community engagement project of the Detroit Historical Society that brings together diverse voices and communities around the effects of an historic crisis to find their place in the present and inspire the future. “The DSO’s Classical Roots Celebration is an annual tradition, celebrating African American musicians and composers whose contributions transcend time and place while rooting us deeply in our community,” says Marlowe Stoudamire, Director of the Detroit 67 Project. “The debut of Terence Blanchard’s piece demonstrates the role art can play in making history relevant in the present as we come together to tell our story and inspire our future.” Co-chairing the Classical Roots Celebration are Jason Tinsley and Therese Peace, with the support of more than 30 Detroit-area volunteers and corporate leaders committed to the Classical Roots mission. About the Honorees Terence Blanchard has established himself as one of the most influential jazz musicians and film score masters of his generation. With more than 31 albums to his credit, Blanchard is a five-time Grammy Award-winner and a Golden Globe nominee. He has composed scores for more than 50 films, including Lucasfilm’s 2013 historical drama Red Tails, about African-American pilots in World War II. Blanchard’s Champion: An Opera in Jazz will receive its east coast premiere in 2017 at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. In Detroit, Blanchard serves as the DSO’s Fred A. & Barbara M. Erb Jazz Creative Chair and the regular host of the Paradise Jazz Series. Regina Carter is considered the foremost jazz violinist of her generation. A Sony Masterworks artist, Regina was a 2006 recipient of a MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant. A master of improvisation, she has released numerous albums as a leader and has collaborated with artists as diverse as Wynton Marsalis, Lauryn Hill, Max Roach, Joe Jackson, and Dolly Parton. Carter is a native Detroiter, proud Cass Technical High School alumna, and former DSO Civic Youth Ensembles student.

They also accused of using trading chat rooms to co-ordinate times for the sale of rand or stop selling for a time in order to manipulate prices from 2007. “This is a big deal‚” said market commentator and trader Simon Brown He said it was a major announcement because “our Competition Commission are good at what they do“. When it comes to price fixing‚ “they are not often wrong on everything from bread to bicycles“. He also said the rand affected the petrol price and this is also why accusations of manipulating currency have implications and huge interest for South Africans. The commission said in a press release on Wednesday afternoon that it was “seeking an order from the Tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act“. It is “seeking an order declaring that the Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited‚ BNP Paribas‚ JP Morgan Chase & Co‚ JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A‚ Investec Ltd‚ Standard New York Securities Inc.‚ HSBC Bank Plc‚ Standard Chartered Bank‚ Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd‚ Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited‚ Nomura International Plc.‚ Macquarie Bank Limited are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover“.

There is a lot of dodgy stuff.” Banks never admit they were wrong but pay large non-admission of guilt fines‚ said Brown. The three local banks: Absa‚ Standard Bank and Investec share prices barely moved after the announcement. Brown said this may be partly as the investigation by the tribunal would take a long time. “I am expecting a Twitter storm. The banks are under huge pressure in South Africa.” Most foreign banks had local financial assets and offices that could be attached if they were eventually fined making it not so easy to ignore local competition authorities. -TMG Digital Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Steve Symington, Dan Caplinger, and Tim Brugger (TMFSymington) Feb 15, 2017 at 9:21AM One of the greatest fears of many investors is the potential for buying a stock at its peak share price. After all, the oft-repeated idea of buying low and selling high makes sense on the surface. But all too often -- and while it might seem counterintuitive -- the best deals are companies whose stocks have a strong history of share-price appreciation.  That's not to say finding those deals is easy. So to help get you started, we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to each pick a stock trading near its 52-week high that they believe investors would be wise to buy this month. Read on to see why they chose Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Image source: Getty Images Investing in the future of gaming Steve Symington (Activision Blizzard): Shares of Activision Blizzard popped more than 16% in a single day last week, touching an all-time high after the company's record fourth-quarter 2016 report. But despite drawing 447 million monthly active users (MAUs) last quarter, and having consumers spending an incredible 43 billion hours playing and watching Activision Blizzard content last year, I think the video-game titan is only just getting started.  For one, Blizzard achieved record fourth-quarter MAUs of 41 million. Overwatch became Blizzard's fastest-ever game to reach more than 25 million players globally, breaking the previous launch-year record for unit sales set by Diablo III in 2012. And even Blizzard's established World of Warcraft franchise managed to grow MAUs 20% year over year during the quarter, with the help of its new Legion expansion. Meanwhile, the Activision studio set its own record with 51 million MAUs in Q4, as Call of Duty capped its eighth consecutive year as the world's No. 1 console franchise. Activision also began to spread its wings last quarter with the debut of its new Skylanders Academy TV series through a partnership with Netflix.  One point of potential concern: MAUs at mobile gaming specialist King Digital -- which Activision Blizzard acquired for $5.9 billion early last year -- declined slightly on a year-over-year basis in Q4, to 355 million. But even then, King Digital simultaneously drove better per-user engagement and investment and still commanded two of the top 10 highest-grossing mobile app store titles for the 13th straight quarter -- an extraordinary demonstration of relative stability, given the ebbs and flows of the often fickle mobile gaming space. All told, revenue last quarter grew 49% year over year, to $1.45 billion, while adjusted earnings per share rose 160%, to $0.65. Activision Blizzard also generated 71% growth in operating cash flow last year, to $2.2 billion; increased its annual dividend by 15%, to $0.30 per share; and approved a new two-year, $1 billion stock repurchase plan. Add to that the potential for incremental revenue from other growth initiatives, including integration of in-game advertising, e-sports, and consumer products, and I'm convinced Activision will continue setting new highs going forward. Rendering beautiful market-beating gains Tim Brugger (Adobe Systems): Following a slow but steady increase in its stock price since it announced record quarterly and fiscal 2016 revenue on Dec. 15, Adobe is still at or near its 52-week high of $116.90. Not exactly a value investor's dream, right? But when investors consider how Adobe has consistently posted strong results, it becomes apparent that CEO Shantanu Narayen had it right all along. Narayen took a gamble: He shut down Adobe's software sales approach and focused on a more sustainable subscription model. Die-hard Adobe Photoshop users weren't amused, but fast-forward to the present and those same fans are kicking themselves if they didn't buy Adobe stock. Adobe ended fiscal 2016 with record revenue of $5.85 billion, and that's not even the best part. Of those sales, nearly 70% -- $4 billion -- were generated by the subscription-based annualized recurring revenue (ARR) from its Digital Media unit. Last fiscal year's ARR was a 28% improvement over 2015. The emphasis on ARR offers several advantages to investors, not the least of which is that it builds a relatively reliable, and predictable, sales foundation. That equates to fewer wild quarterly revenue fluctuations, which in turn limits Adobe stock's risk because if its relative stability. It's also less costly to service existing customers than rely exclusively on new sales. Not surprisingly, Adobe's expense increases are well below its top-line growth. Adobe shares are up 53% in the past year and over 12% in 2017, and it's absolutely still worth buying. This Wall Street bank has more room to run Dan Caplinger (JPMorgan Chase): The financial sector has been one of the biggest winners in the aftermath of the presidential election in November, and in the opening weeks of the Trump administration, the new president has already issued an executive order that will have the end result of reducing regulation on big banks. That's great news for JPMorgan Chase, which has already been rising because of anticipation of higher interest rates and the corresponding profit boost for the company's retail banking business. It isn't certain that Congress will follow through and repeal Dodd-Frank banking restrictions in their entirety. But the potential for JPMorgan Chase to boost the size of its lending portfolio and proprietary trading business could lead to unanticipated profit growth, and already, CEO Jamie Dimon has shown his support for the president's policies on issues ranging from bank regulation to tax reform. JPMorgan Chase has plenty of risks, and the potential threat of growing tensions in the global economy related to trade could have an adverse impact on its international business. However, few banks have successfully read changing trends better than Dimon and JPMorgan Chase, and as long as the bank keeps its fingers on the pulse of the geopolitical and macroeconomic climate, it has the ability to keep climbing despite its past share-price gains.  Dan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned. Steve Symington has no position in any stocks mentioned. Tim Brugger has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Activision Blizzard.

Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase both hit all-time highs, with Goldman recouping all it had lost since the 2007 financial crisis. Bank of America traded in line with its book value for the first time since late 2008; it had traded as low as 15% of book value back in March 2009. Ambitious move: Japan's SoftBank, which despite its name isn't a bank but a technology and communications conglomerate, made a big step into becoming a serious player in the financial services business Tuesday when it agreed to buy asset manager Fortress Investment Group for $3.3 billion. The acquisition of Fortress, which manages about $70 billion in assets in real estate, credit and private equity, fits Softbank chief Masayoshi Son's "ambitious long-term plans to become one of the world's biggest asset managers, focusing on technology but with a broader platform to raise money and shepherd companies across different sectors," the Wall Street Journal said.

Search Primary Menu Skip to content FRONT PAGE NEWS SOCIETY BUSINESS ECONOMY POLITICS EDUCATION SCI-TECH SPORTS TRAVEL 日本語 Japan's economy running along on half-empty fuel tank Bloomberg -- Feb 15 Japan's economy is cruising along, at least by its own recent standards, with real growth clocking in at 1 percent in 2016. It may have reached top speed. Real gross domestic product expanded for a fourth consecutive quarter at the end of 2016, the best run in more than three years. A number of indicators are flashing green as global demand strengthens and last year's fiscal stimulus kicks in. Exports rose in December for the first time in more than a year, and in the fourth quarter industrial production gained the most in nearly three years. "Japan is in the best position it's been in in four years," said Izumi Devalier, head of Japan economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who expects a 1.5 percent expansion in real GDP this year--nearly twice the potential growth rate of 0.8 percent. Her forecast ranks the second-highest among those compiled by Bloomberg, behind JPMorgan's 1.6 percent. The median is for 1 percent growth. The problem, though, is that near-term growth depends on external demand and fiscal stimulus, economists say, meaning the upside and growth horizon are limited. Japan also faces the risk that U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric is soon transformed into policy that disrupts global trade, while the effects of last year's stimulus are expected to fade by the second quarter of next year. "Unless domestic private consumption picks up the economy is unlikely to gain traction," said Atsushi Takeda, an economist at Itochu Corp. in Tokyo. A hit to exports would leave Japan's beleaguered consumers to pick up the slack, something they've shown little inclination to do since a sales-tax increase in early 2014. Wages are rising only slightly, even with the tightest labor market in decades.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Tata Motors sinks 11%; analysts cut target sharply post Q3 nos Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock, with reduced target price at Rs 630 from Rs 680 after cutting FY17/FY18/FY19 EPS estimates by 26 percent/15 percent/12 percent. Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 17 Comments Moneycontrol Bureau Tata Motors shares crashed 10.6 percent intraday Wednesday (on top of 3.7 percent loss in previous session) as brokerage houses worried about company's hedging losses that may likely to continue for next 3-4 quarters. Analysts slashed target price of the stock sharply due to disappointing set of earnings in the quarter ended December 2016. CLSA has downgraded the stock to sell and lowered target price to Rs 405 from Rs 650 after cutting FY18-19 EPS estimates by 25-31 percent due to dismal performance in Q3FY17. Management commentary on JLR margins has weakened significantly, it says, adding hedging losses are likely to continue at high levels for longer. JPMorgan also reduced its target price on the stock to Rs 570 from Rs 610 after cutting FY17/18 JLR EBIT estimates by 26 percent/17 percent and consolidated earnings estimates by 33 percent/23 percent. It advises buying on dip as margin miss was not as bad as it seems. Edelweiss downgraded the stock to hold from buy, with reduced target price at Rs 501 (from Rs 604) after lowering FY17/18 EBIDTA estimates by 35/25 percent to Rs 29,500/38,500 crore to reflect weaker margins. The commercial vehicle and luxury car maker's third quarter profit on consolidated basis fell sharply by 96 percent year-on-year to Rs 112 crore , impacted by big loss in domestic business and operational weakness in JLR due to adverse product & regional mix and higher discounts. UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover's net income during the quarter dropped 62 percent year-on-year to 167 million pound as operating profit fell 26.7 percent to 611 million pound and margin contracted 510 basis points to 9.3 percent on year-on-year basis, which both were far below estimates. Edelweiss says JLR, management indicated that it can take 4-5 quarters to reach 14-16 percent margin trajectory and average discounts are likely to remain higher in 2017 versus 2016/2015. JLR’s volume momentum will be sustained by series of new launches/upgrades from January 2017 (new Discovery, XF in China, mid-size Range Rover and smaller crossover E-Pace), the company says. For India, Tata Motors indicated that efforts intensified to improve profitability and regain market share in commercial vehicle; and capex is expected to remain at Rs 3,500 crore till FY19 for various product development program. On standalone basis (i.e. domestic business), the company posted a big loss of Rs 1,046 crore during the quarter against Rs 137 crore in Q3FY16 and that was quite higher compared with Rs 500 crore estimated by analysts. In previous quarter (July-September), the loss was Rs 631 crore. Other brokerage houses also cut target price, though they retained their rating on the stock. Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock, with reduced target price at Rs 630 from Rs 680 after cutting FY17/FY18/FY19 EPS estimates by 26 percent/15 percent/12 percent. The brokerage house has built in slightly lower margins to account for higher incentives. It expects moderating forex losses from June onwards and sees progressive reduction in hedging losses. Macquarie also retained outperform rating but cut target to Rs 575 from Rs 630 after lowering FY17/18/19 consolidated EBITDA estimates by 20 percent/10 percent/7.0 percent. Most negative factors that impacted Q3 earnings are transitory, it feels. It expects stronger sales growth & margin for JLR in FY18. Deutsche Bank, which has a buy call on Tata Motors with reduced target at Rs 535 from Rs 575, says currency gains remained elusive but management looks upbeat on new models. It expects margin to normalise in medium term. Bank of America Merrill Lynch also retained buy call but cut target price to Rs 560 from Rs 575. The brokerage house forecasts consolidated EPS CAGR of 41 percent over FY16-19. It feels weaker GBP will remain a tailwind to margins in FY18/19 and pre-buy for commercial vehicles should help margins in Q4. Citi says correction in stock price is a buying opportunity as its feels details reveal a brighter picture, though headline is weak. JLR's favourable FS trends should aid in healthy volume growth, it believes. The research firm has a buy call on the stock, with a target price at Rs 660. Kotak expects gradual improvement in JLR EBITDA margin as forex hedge rate comes closer to spot rates in next two years. Volume growth will likely remain strong led by a fresh and young model line-up, the brokerage house says while maintaining buy rating on attractive valuations but lowered target price to Rs 550 (from Rs 600 earlier). At 09:25 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 445.70, down Rs 41.10, or 8.44 percent amid high volumes on the BSE.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 15 February 2017 | MYT 1:14 PM Hong Kong police struggle to stop brokerage hacking spree Hotbed of cybercrime activity: At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China International (BOCI) Securities, according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations. — Reuters HONG KONG: Hong Kong police are struggling to deal with digital pump-and-dump schemes targeting brokerages – a little-known type of computer-generated fraud that surged in the Chinese territory last year.  Although the money involved was small – only about US$20mil (RM89mil) worth of shares – there were 81 such incidents reported in 2016, more than triple the number in 2015, according to police.  In the scheme, criminals invest in thinly traded penny stocks and then manipulate their share prices by ordering trades from hacked brokerage accounts. They earn profits by selling before the fraudulent trades are reported.  After last year's cyber-heist of US$81mil (RM360.45mil) at Bangladesh's central bank and a series of hacks of ATM's around the world, authorities fear such pump-and-dump schemes could be increasingly used for electronic theft.  Hong Kong is a favoured place for such attacks because of the number of thinly-traded penny stocks in the territory and because its securities industry has fallen behind other financial centres in defending against cyber fraud.  At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China International (BOCI) Securities, according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations.  A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment.  A spokeswoman for BOCI Securities said he could not comment on its case but the brokerage would continue to invest in IT security.  "If you ask regulators in the industry what is the number one threat, not surprisingly it’s all about cyberattacks," Ashley Alder, CEO of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and chairman of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, said in a speech to the local legislature last week.  "We've seen that happen not only in banking but also at brokers in Hong Kong, in particular recent attacks to do with basically hijacking share trading accounts."  Such schemes surfaced more than a decade ago in the United States. Charles Schwab Corp, E*Trade Financial Corp and JP Morgan Chase & Co were identified as victims of these schemes in a 2006 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The pace of attacks reported in the United States has slowed in recent years after big brokerages implemented a variety of strategies to thwart the hacks, said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Office of Internet Enforcement.  Some use algorithms to identify and halt unusual trading activity, others scrutinise Internet traffic for orders coming from suspicious servers and one stopped permitting customers to use its online trading platform from buying penny stocks, said Stark, who now runs cyber-security consulting firm John Reed Stark Consulting LLC.  But such protections are rare in Hong Kong, where the government has only recently started suggesting security improvements to banks and brokerages which have traditionally considered stock trading to be low-risk.  Two-factor authentication  The Hong Kong SFC last year told firms to increase surveillance of client transactions and data protection.  Authorities believe that hackers accessed brokerage accounts using stolen or guessed passwords, according to investigators. This might have been thwarted if they were protected with two-factor authentication, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has said.  Two-factor authentication typically includes a password and a piece of information only the user has, for instance an electronic token with changing numbers.  "Hong Kong is being targeted because they have not instituted the same cyber protections that we see in the US and certain parts of Europe," said Jeff Cramer, a former US prosecutor.  Cramer, who is managing director with cybersecurity investigations firm Berkeley Research Group, said he expects to see more attacks in Hong Kong and perhaps other Asian nations, including China, Japan and South Korea that are also behind in cyber security.  Fighting back  Such pump and dump cases have proven tough to crack in the United States because the masterminds are typically overseas, using surrogates and pseudonyms to make investments.  Brokerages are typically not required to go public when they are hacked, so cases often only surface when the government files a complaint against suspected cyber criminals, or the hack results in litigation.  The attack involving BOCI Securities year became public after it was sued by a customer that claimed its account was breached.  Trading firm Fast Track Holdings Limited alleged in court documents that somebody hacked into its brokerage account on the afternoon of Sept 23 using a valid user ID and password.

PHOTO: REUTERS [HONG KONG] Hong Kong police are struggling to deal with digital pump-and-dump schemes targeting brokerages - a little-known type of computer-generated fraud that surged in the Chinese territory last year. Although the money involved was small - only about US$20 million worth of shares - there were 81 such incidents reported in 2016, more than triple the number in 2015, according to police. In the scheme, criminals invest in thinly traded penny stocks and then manipulate their share prices by ordering trades from hacked brokerage accounts. They earn profits by selling before the fraudulent trades are reported. After last year's cyber-heist of US$81 million at Bangladesh's central bank and a series of hacks of ATM's around the world, authorities fear such pump-and-dump schemes could be increasingly used for electronic theft. Powered by GET.com Hong Kong is a favoured place for such attacks because of the number of thinly-traded penny stocks in the territory and because its securities industry has fallen behind other financial centres in defending against cyber fraud. SEE ALSO: Hong Kong, Shanghai: Stocks track Wall Street higher At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China International (BOCI) Securities, according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations. A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for BOCI Securities said he could not comment on its case but the brokerage would continue to invest in IT security. "If you ask regulators in the industry what is the number one threat, not surprisingly it's all about cyber attacks," Ashley Alder, CEO of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, said in a speech to the local legislature last week. "We've seen that happen not only in banking but also at brokers in Hong Kong, in particular recent attacks to do with basically hijacking share trading accounts." Such schemes surfaced more than a decade ago in the United States. Charles Schwab Corp, E*Trade Financial Corp and JP Morgan Chase & Co were identified as victims of these schemes in a 2006 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The pace of attacks reported in the United States has slowed in recent years after big brokerages implemented a variety of strategies to thwart the hacks, said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Office of Internet Enforcement. Some use algorithms to identify and halt unusual trading activity, others scrutinise Internet traffic for orders coming from suspicious servers and one stopped permitting customers to use its online trading platform from buying penny stocks, said Mr Stark, who now runs cyber-security consulting firm John Reed Stark Consulting LLC. But such protections are rare in Hong Kong, where the government has only recently started suggesting security improvements to banks and brokerages which have traditionally considered stock trading to be low-risk. The Hong Kong SFC last year told firms to increase surveillance of client transactions and data protection. Authorities believe that hackers accessed brokerage accounts using stolen or guessed passwords, according to investigators. This might have been thwarted if they were protected with two-factor authentication, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has said. Two-factor authentication typically includes a password and a piece of information only the user has, for instance an electronic token with changing numbers. "Hong Kong is being targeted because they have not instituted the same cyber protections that we see in the US and certain parts of Europe," said Jeff Cramer, a former US prosecutor. Mr Cramer, who is managing director with cyber-security investigations firm Berkeley Research Group, said he expects to see more attacks in Hong Kong and perhaps other Asian nations, including China, Japan and South Korea that are also behind in cyber security. Such pump and dump cases have proven tough to crack in the United States because the masterminds are typically overseas, using surrogates and pseudonyms to make investments. Brokerages are typically not required to go public when they are hacked, so cases often only surface when the government files a complaint against suspected cyber criminals, or the hack results in litigation. The attack involving BOCI Securities year became public after it was sued by a customer that claimed its account was breached. Trading firm Fast Track Holdings Limited alleged in court documents that somebody hacked into its brokerage account on the afternoon of September 23 using a valid user ID and password. Within 18 minutes, the intruder had emptied the account by spending HK$38 million to buy 49 million shares of thinly traded Pa Shun Pharmaceutical, according to Fast Track. The stock soared more than 30 per cent after the purchase, which was made at a 36 per cent premium to the previous day's closing price, Reuters data shows. BOCI alerted Fast Track of the suspicious activity an hour later, but it has said in court documents it should not be held financially responsible, saying it found no evidence its systems had been compromised. Peter Pang, Pa Shun's CFO, told Reuters the management "would keep an eye to the incident and report to the regulators and the public when necessary". One person familiar with the case said Fast Track's management believes the incident was a pump and dump scam and that Pa Shun was targeted because it is thinly-traded, but it remained unclear who was responsible. Fast Track's directors did not respond to requests for comment.

The Zoning Committee had also unanimously rejected the request. Marsha Lilley, the committee's chairwoman, said during Tuesday's meeting the group prefers Avangrid use a bank based in the U.S., if not in Illinois. According to documentation placed in the County Board packet, Credit Agricole is ranked second among European banks by Tier One Capital. JP Morgan Chase is ranked No. 1 in the U.S. Avangrid was attempting to change its existling leter of credit with the county. County approves to change polling places The board approved changing election polling places to allow easier accessibility for voters. Princeton Precinct 3/6, previously at St. Matthew's Church, and Princeton Precinct 4/5, at the Bureau County Farm Bureau building, will now be located at the Princeton Moose Lodge on North Euclid Avenue. Selby Precinct 2/3 at St. Mary's Church Hall will now be located at the VFW building in DePue. The new polling places will not include steps down into a voting room or the use of a non-compliant ramp, making it easier for voters to cast their ballots on Election Day. In other news, the board: • Approved the appointment of Kevin Buckman to fill an unexpired term for Buda Fire trustee opened by Raymond Behrens' retirement. • Approved an engineering agreement with Hutchinson Engineering of Peoria to replace an existing bridge structure over Smith Ditch in Gold Township. Bureau County's cost is $43,800 in federal funds for 80 percent of the preliminary engineering cost, as well as $10,950 of local funds for 20 percent of the engineering costs. • Approved to change the regular meeting in April to Wednesday, April 12, due to a conflict with annual township meetings.

Homepage Follow Sign in / Sign up Nafeez AhmedBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Investigative journalist, recovering academic, tracking the Crisis of Civilization patreon.com/nafeez Feb 10 How the Trump regime was manufactured by a war inside the Deep State A systemic crisis in the global Deep System has driven the violent radicalization of a Deep State faction By Nafeez Ahmed A special report published by INSURGE INTELLIGENCE, a crowdfunded investigative journalism project for people and planet. Support us to keep digging where others fear to tread. President Donald Trump is not fighting a war on the establishment: he’s fighting a war to protect the establishment from itself, and the rest of us. At first glance, this isn’t obvious. Among his first actions upon taking office, Trump vetoed the Trans Pacific Partnership, the controversial free trade agreement which critics rightly said would lead to US job losses while giving transnational corporations massive power over national state policies on health, education and other issues. Trump further plans to ditch the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and US, which would have diluted key state regulations on the activities of transnational corporates on issues like food safety, the environment and banking; and to renegotiate NAFTA, potentially heightening tensions with Canada. Trump appears to be in conflict with the bulk of the US intelligence community, and is actively seeking to restructure the government to minimize checks and balances, and thus consolidate his executive power. His White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has restructured the National Security Council, granting himself and Trump’s Chief of Staff Richard ‘Reince’ Priebus permanent seats on the NSC’s Principals’ Committee – opening the door to the White House politicization of the government’s highest national security body. Trump’s White House has purged almost the entire senior staff of the State Department, and tested the loyalty of the Department of Homeland Security with its new ‘Muslim ban’ order. So what is going on? One approach to framing the Trump movement comes from Jordan Greenhall, who sees it as a conservative (“Red Religion”) Insurgency against the liberal (“Blue Church”) Globalist establishment (the “Deep State”). Greenhall suggests, essentially, that Trump is leading a nationalist coup against corporate neoliberal globalization using new tactics of “collective intelligence” by which to outsmart and outspeed his liberal establishment opponents. But at best this is an extremely partial picture. In reality, Trump has ushered in something far more dangerous: The Trump regime is not operating outside the Deep State, but mobilizing elements within it to dominate and strengthen it for a new mission. The Trump regime is not acting to overturn the establishment, but to consolidate it against a perceived crisis of a wider transnational Deep System. The Trump regime is not a conservative insurgency against the liberal establishment, but an act of ideologically constructing the current crisis as a conservative-liberal battleground, led by a particularly radicalized white nationalist faction of a global elite. The act is a direct product of a global systemic crisis, but is a short-sighted and ill-conceived reaction, pre-occupied with surface symptoms of that crisis. Unfortunately, those hoping to resist the Trump reaction also fail to understand the system dynamics of the crisis. All this can only be understood when we look at the big picture. That means the following: we must look a little more closely at the individuals inside Trump’s administration, the wider social and institutional networks they represent, and what emerges from their being interlocked in government; we must contextualize this against two factors, the escalation of global systemic crisis, and the Trump regime’s ideological framing(s) of that crisis (both for themselves, and for public consumption); we must connect this with the impact on the transnational Deep System, and how that links up with the US Deep State; and we must then explore what this all means in terms of the scope of actions likely to be deployed by the Trump regime to pursue its discernable goals. This investigation will help to establish a ground state for anyone on which to build a meaningful strategy of response that accounts for the full systemic complexity of our Trumpian moment. So the first step to diagnosing our Trumpian moment is to see who is leading it. We’ll begin by looking at a cross-section of some of Trump’s most prominent nominations and appointments. 1. The Trump regime Money Monsters If all Trump’s appointees are confirmed, his administration will be among the most business-heavy, corporate-friendly governments in American history. Five of the 15 people nominated by Trump as Cabinet secretaries have no public sector experience, and have spent their entire careers in the corporate sector. “That would be more business people with no public-sector experience than have ever served in the Cabinet at any one time,”, concludes Pew Research Center. Betsy DeVos has been nominated for Education Secretary. She’s a billionaire married to the Amway conglomerate. Andrew Puzder has been nominated as Labor Secretary. He’s a billionaire CEO of fastfood chain owner CKE Restaurants. Trump’s nominee for Commerce Secretary is Wall Street veteran Wilbur Ross. He’s a billionaire financier who invests in buying and selling companies in distressed industries, and who made his early fortune as a fund manager at the Rothschild Group. Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s Treasury Secretary, is a former partner at the global investment bank Goldman Sachs, a hedge fund manager and, until his nomination, a board member of the Fortune 500 financial holding company, CIT Group. He’s also a member of the Yale University secret society, Skull and Bones. Vincent Viola is Trump’s nominee for Army Secretary. He’s a billionaire, former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and current chairman of Virtu Financial, a high-frequency trading firm. Linda McMahon is Trump’s Small Business Administrator. She’s a co-founder and former CEO of WWE, which is now valued at around $1.5 billion, and married to billionaire WWE promoter Vincent McMahon. Gary Cohn is Trump’s chief economic advisor and Director of the White House National Economic Council. He just left his previous post as president and chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs for the job. Anthony Scaramucci has served as a senior advisor to Trump on the executive committee of the Presidential Transition Team. Previously he was founding co-managing partner of global investment firm SkyBridge Capital. Like Steve Bannon, he also began his career at Goldman Sachs. Walter ‘Jay’ Clayton is Trump’s nominee for the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), the financial industry’s top regulatory watchdog. Yet Clayton himself is a Wall Street lawyer who has worked on deals for major banks, such as Barclays Capital’s acquisition of Lehman Brothers’ assets, the sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan Chase, and the US Treasury’s capital investment in Goldman Sachs. In the same capacity, he has campaigned to reduce restrictions on foreign public companies, and sought lax enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. His wife, Gretchen Butler, works for Goldman Sachs as a private wealth advisor. Trump’s crack team of money monsters is clearly not planning on acting in the interests of American workers — they will instead do what they know best: use the considerable power of the American state to break down as many regulatory constraints on global banking finance as possible, with a special view to privilege US banks and corporations. Source: Earth Island Journal via Chris van Es www.chrisvanes.com Fossil Fuel Freaks Trump’s administration has not just been bought by Wall Street. It’s been bought by the oil, gas and coal industries. Rex Tillerson is Trump’s Secretary of State, and former chairman and CEO of giant oil and gas conglomerate ExxonMobil. As the world’s largest oil major of all, ExxonMobil is the de facto king of fossil fuel interests. Tillerson has close business ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and has previously headed up the joint US-Russian oil company Exxon Neftegas. Tillerson is a friend of Igor Sechin, who heads up the military security services faction of the Kremlin known as ‘Siloviki’. ExxonMobil also had intimate ties with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates under Tillerson. In any case, Trump has richly rewarded Tillerson for services rendered — 91% of the $1.8 million donated to federal candidates by ExxonMobil’s PAC under Tillerson for this election cycle, went to Republicans. It’s well-known that ExxonMobil has funded climate denialism to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. What’s less well-known is that in the 1970s, ExxonMobil’s own scientific research fully validated the scientific reality of climate change. Yet company executives made a self-serving business-decision to suppress these findings, and fund efforts to discredit climate science. Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, is Trump’s Secretary of Energy. Perry holds board directorships at Energy Transfer Partners LP and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, which jointly developed the Dakota Access Pipeline project. The CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, Kelcy Warren, donated $5 million to a super-PAC supportive of Perry. More generally, his two presidential campaigns received over $2.6 million from the oil and gas industry. Scott Pruitt, former Attorney General in Oklahoma, is the new head of the Environment Protection Agency. Pruitt has a track record of launching federal lawsuits to weaken and overturn EPA regulations not just on carbon emissions, but on all sorts of basic environmental rules on air and water pollution. The New York Times reports that he and other Republican attorneys general have forged an “unprecedented, secretive alliance” with the oil industry. Congressman Ryan Zinke is Trump’s nominee for Secretary of the Interior. During Senate confirmation hearings, he refused to admit the accuracy of the scientific consensus on human activity being the dominant cause of climate change. Zinke has supported clean energy measures in the past, but in May 2016, he sponsored a bill for a time limit on Obama’s moratorium on federal coal leasing. He routinely voted against environmental protection measures, supporting fossil fuel use, seeking to minimize public and state involvement in managing public lands, while opposing protections for endangered species. Zinke’s philosophy is basically ‘drill, baby, drill’. That’s why he’s taken over $300,000 in campaign donations from oil and gas companies that want to accelerate drilling across public lands. Mike Catanzaro is Trump’s nominee for Special Assistant for Energy and the Environment. He is also a climate-denying lobbyist for the oil and gas industry, working for Koch Industries, America’s Natural Gas Alliance (ANGA), Halliburton, Noble Energy, Hess Corporation, and many others. Early on in his career, he was Deputy Policy Director of the 2004 Bush-Cheney presidential campaign. The fossil fuel freaks want to burn all the oil, gas and coal they can, at any cost — and they are willing to dismantle whatever environmental protections stand in their way. Black Ops Brigade It would be mistaken to assume that Trump’s conflicts with the US intelligence community mean he is necessarily at odds with the military-industrial complex. On the contrary, his defense appointees and advisors are embedded across the military-industrial complex. Trump’s education secretary, DeVos, is the sister of Erik Prince, the notorious founder of disgraced private security firm Blackwater, now known as Academi, which was outed for slaughtering 17 Iraqi civilians. A source in Trump’s transition team confirms that Erik Prince has advised Trump’s team on intelligence and security issues. Prince now runs another security firm, Frontier Services Group. He supports Trump’s proposal for the US military to grab Iraq’s oil and recommends the escalated deployment of private defense contractors across the Middle East and North Africa, such as in Libya, to crackdown on refugees. General ‘Mad Dog’ James Mattis is Trump’s Secretary of Defense. He was also, until his resignation due to his political appointment, on the board of directors of General Dynamics, the fifth largest private defense contractor in the world. Mattis is also on the board of Theranos, a biotechnology company known for its questionable automated fingerstick blood test technology. Lieutenant-General Mike Flynn was Trump’s National Security Advisor until his resignation on February 13 over his ties to Russia. He is a former head of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under Obama, and a longstanding military intelligence and special operations insider. Previously, he was director of intelligence for the Joint Special Operations Command; director of intelligence for the US Central Command; commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; chair of the Military Intelligence Board; and Assistant Director of National Intelligence. Flynn also runs Flynn Intel Group, a private intelligence consulting firm. Flynn has just co-authored a book with Michael Ledeen, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and its Allies. Ledeen is a leading neoconservative defense consultant and former Reagan administration appointee who was involved in the Iran–Contra affair as a consultant of then US National Security Advisor, Robert McFarlane. Currently a Freedom Scholar at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), he was a staunch advocate of the 2003 invasion of Iraq (he was directly involved with the Yellowcake forgeries attempting to fabricate a weapons of mass destruction threat to justify the war) and has campaigned for military interventions in Syria, Iran and beyond. Ledeen’s aggressive foreign policy vision was deeply influential in the formation of the Bush administration’s foreign policy strategy. It’s worth noting how low Ledeen stoops with his political philosophy. In his 2000 book, Tocqueville on American Character, Ledeen argues that in some situations, “[i]n order to achieve the most noble accomplishments, the leader may have to ‘enter into evil.’” (p. 90) He even argues that this is sanctioned by the Christian God: “Since it is the highest good, the defense of the country is one of those extreme situations in which a leader is justified in committing evil.” (p. 117) That sort of thinking has led him to endorse the ‘cauldronization’ of the Middle East. In 2002, he wrote in support of invading Iraq that: “One can only hope that we turn the region into a cauldron, and faster, please. If ever there were a region that richly deserved being cauldronized, it is the Middle East today.” General John F. Kelly is Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security. He is a retired United States Marine Corps general who previously served under Obama as commander of the US Southern Command, responsible for American military operations in Central America, South America and the Caribbean. Before that Kelly was the commanding general of the Multi-National Force-West in Iraq, and the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North. Kelly is also a vice chairman at the Spectrum Group, a defense contractor lobbying firm; and on the board of directors of two other private Pentagon contractors, Michael Baker International and Sallyport Global. James Woolsey, the former CIA director and neoconservative stalwart — a former Vice President at NSA-contractor Booz Allen Hamilton and among Michael Ledeen’s bosses at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies — was an early Trump supporter, and a senior advisor to Trump on his transition team. He dropped out over reservations with Trump’s plans to restructure the intelligence community. Lieutenant General Joseph Keith Kellogg is Chief of Staff and Executive Secretary of Trump’s White House National Security Council – but has replaced Flynn as acting National Security Advisor. Kellogg was the US military’s top information technology official during the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. He went on to become chief operating officer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, the mechanism for the US occupation of Iraq, from November 2003 to March 2004 — the period widely recognized as being particularly corrupt and inept. In between, Kellogg had joined the board of directors of US government IT contractor, GTSI Corp, where he returned as an independent director after his Iraq stint from 2004 until 2013 — when the firm changed its name to ‘UNICOM Government Inc.’ in an attempt to distance itself from earlier revelations of misconduct. Kellogg later joined the Advisory Board of US defense contractor Raytheon’s Trusted Computer Solutions Inc., and the Strategic Advisory Board of RedXDefence, a US military contractor part-owned by Regina Dugan, former director of the Pentagon’s Defense and Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 2012, Wired magazine outed RedXDefense for creating completely rubbish bomb detection technology under a multi-million dollar DARPA contract during Dugan’s tenure. Despite its flaws, the tech was purchased widely by the US military, and numerous allied militaries around the world. Mike Pompeo is the icing on the cake. As Trump’s CIA director, this Republican Congressman has no obvious experience relevant to running a national intelligence agency, except perhaps for one thing: as Jane Mayer writes in her book Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right (Doubleday 2015), Pompeo is “so closely entwined with the climate-change denying Koch brothers that he was known as the ‘congressman from Koch.’” The Koch brothers, who made their fortune investing in fossil fuels, now have a direct line to America’s premiere national intelligence agency. Now that’s what you call a coup. Ku Klux Klan Virulent white nationalism is another fundamental defining feature of the Trump regime. Steve Bannon was founding executive chair of Breitbart News, “the platform of the alt-right” according to Bannon himself. Breitbart is widely known for its publication of “racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic material.” Bannon himself is also a prolific film producer, and has made or contributed to a range of xenophobic films. Before his rise to media mogul status, though, Bannon spent a brief time as acting director of the Biosphere 2 experiment, an effort to create a self-sufficient ‘closed system’ environment survivable by a small group of people from 1993 to 1995. At the time, Bannon appeared to share and strongly support the concerns of the Biosphere 2 scientists about the danger of climate change driven by, in his own words, “the effect of greenhouse gases on humans, plants and animals.” He later underwent an Exxon-like about-turn, illustrated by Breitbart’s rampant opposition to the idea that the burning of fossil fuels by human civilization is intensifying climate change. In 2007, Bannon produced a proposal for a new documentary, ‘Destroying the Great Satan: The Rise of Islamic Facism [sic] in America’, which accused various media outlets, “Universities and the Left”, the “American Jewish Community”, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the CIA, the FBI, the State Department, and the White House as being “enablers” of a covert mission to establish an “Islamic Republic in the United States.” Bannon consulted on the proposal with Steven Emerson of the Investigative Project on Terrorism. In 2015, Emerson was described as a “complete idiot” by then Prime Minister David Cameron for claiming falsely on Fox News that Britain is full of Muslim “no go zones” (like the entire city of Birmingham), and that London is run amok by Muslim religious police who beat and wound people who refuse to dress according to a Muslim dress code. Bannon’s list of interviewees for the proposed film is like a Who’s Who of far-right bigotry. Two of the most well known names included Walid Phares, who advised Trump on his national security team during the presidential campaign, and Robert Spencer. Both are connected to the Washington DC-based Center for Security Policy (CSP), a far-right think tank run by former Reagan defense official Frank Gaffney, where they appear regularly as guests on CSP’s ‘Secure Freedom’ radio podcast run by Gaffney. Phares is also a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy. Frank Gaffney’s CSP commissioned the original flawed opinion poll that was cited by Trump to justify his ‘Muslim ban’ when he first announced it in late 2015. So it’s clearly no coincidence that Kellyanne Conway, the pollster who carried out the flawed poll, is now Counselor to the President. Gaffney thus has a significant degree of ideological influence on the Trump regime. He has appeared at least 34 times on Bannon’s Breitbart radio program. His work has also been cited in speeches by Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security advisor. Alarmingly, Gaffney has disturbing connections to full-blown neo-Nazi groups across Europe, such as the Danish People’s Party (DPP) and the Vlaams Belang (VB) in Belgium. But he simultaneously has close ties to the US military-industrial complex. In 2013, CSP tax records showed that the CSP had received funding from six of America’s biggest aerospace and defense contractors, namely Boeing ($25,000); General Dynamics ($15,000); Lockheed Martin ($15,000); Northrup Grumman ($5,000); Raytheon ($20,000); and General Electric ($5,000). The CSP has a particularly close relationship with Boeing, the second largest defense contractor in the world, which still provides Gaffney’s group with “general support.” Michael Reilly, who has been Director of Federal Budget and Program Analysis at Boeing since 2010, was previously Gaffney’s Vice President for Operations at the CSP. These incestuous ties with the US private defense sector comprise one prime reason that fully 22 officers or advisors of Gaffney’s CSP ended up having appointments in the George W. Bush administration. Senator Jeff Sessions is Trump’s Attorney General. Gaffney’s CSP awarded Sessions the annual ‘Keeper of the Flame’ award in 2015. Sessions has previously expressed sympathies for the Ku Klux Klan. He has closely associated with far-right anti-immigrant organizations founded by John Tanton, a driving force in America’s white nationalist movements. In 1993, Tanton declared: “… for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that.” Yet Trump’s new Attorney General is known for frequently quoting from Tanton’s groups, showing up at their press conferences, and has even received recognition and campaign contributions from them. The John Tanton connection opens up a can of worms. Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s Counsellor, is also connected to Tanton. Her polling firm was previously contracted by Tanton’s anti-immigration platform Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). Numerous other officials involved in the Trump team — Lou Barletta, Kris Kobach and Julie Kirchner — have direct organizational ties to Tanton’s FAIR. But this connects senior Trump officials to a grim history of neo-Nazi agitation in the US. Tanton received large sums of early money for FAIR from the Pioneer Fund, a pro-Nazi grant-giving organization which funded eugenics — the discredited ‘science’ of ‘racial hygiene’. Tanton’s various anti-immigrant platforms received money from the Pioneer Fund as late as 2002. According to a study in the Albany Law Review, the Pioneer Fund had direct ties to Nazi scientists, and its founding directors were Nazi sympathizers. One of them had even travelled to Germany in 1935 to attend a Nazi population conference. Stephen Miller is a senior policy advisor to Trump. He previously worked as communications director for Jeff Sessions in his senator’s office, and crafted the strategy to defeat a bipartisan immigration reform bill in 2013. During his university days, he worked closely with the neo-Nazi leader Richard Spencer, who coined the term “alternative Right” as a new way of capturing a movement about white racial identity. Miller denies having worked closely with Spencer when they were at university together as members of the Duke Conservative Union. According to Spencer, Miller helped him with fundraising and promotion for an on-campus debate on immigration policy in 2007. The event featured Peter Brimelow, who runs the white nationalist website Vdare.com, which regularly publishes articles by neo-Nazis. Miller’s relationship with Spencer at this time has been confirmed by email correspondence between Spencer and Brimelow. It’s perhaps worth noting that the inspiration for Tanton’s neo-Nazi sympathies were, ostensibly, environmental concerns. In a recent article he admits, “my initial interest in curtailing immigration was motivated by a longstanding concern for the environment.” From 1971 to 1975, Tanton was chair of the National Population Committee of one of America’s oldest environmental organizations, the Sierra Club. His theory was that immigration drives unsustainable population growth, which then drains resources and harms the environment. The environmental crisis, from Tanton’s point of view, is a population problem — specifically, a problem of too many people. Part of dealing with that means cracking down on immigration — this, ironically, in a nation founded on immigration. This insidious proto-Nazi ideology now appears to have an operating influence on the White House through Tanton’s ideological surrogates, many of whom are connected to Gaffney and his acolytes in the Trump regime. Guru Gang The unifying ideology that lends coherence to these intersecting networks of influence comes from a variety of people, but the following stand out in particular. Michael Anton is a little-known but powerful figure in the Trump administration, now a senior director of strategic communications in the White House National Security Council. He launched his career as a speechwriter and press secretary for New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, before joining Bush’s White House in 2001 as a communications aide for the National Security Council. He went on to become a speechwriter for media mogul Rupert Murdoch at News Corp, then moved into the financial sector, firstly as director of communications for Citigroup, then as a managing director at the BlackRock investment firm. Anton has played a major role in attempting to cajole and convince conservatives, through various anonymous writings in conservative publications and behind-the-scenes networking, of the necessity of voting Trump to head off the crisis of conservative decline amidst the apocalyptic failures of liberalism. Rupert Murdoch has a direct line to the Trump White House through Michael Anton, but it’s one the News Corp owner has gone to pains to build personally. Murdoch and his wife Jerry Hall were hosted for dinner by Trump at his golf course in Scotland in June 2016. Later Murdoch was seen visiting Trump Tower in November 2016. Murdoch is set to have significant influence on Trump, who reportedly asked the Fox News owner to recommend his top preferred candidates to chair the Federal Communications Commission. The Murdoch connection has other alarming ramifications. Since 2010, Murdoch has been an equity-holding board member of the American energy firm, Genie Oil & Gas. He had teamed up with Lord Jacob Rothschild, chairman of Rothschild Investment Trust (RIT) Capital Partners, to buy a 5.5% stake in the corporation then worth $11 million. Murdoch and Rothschild also serve on Genie’s strategic advisory board. Joining them on the board are Larry Summers, former Director of President Obama’s National Economic Council; former Trump senior advisor James Woolsey; Dick Cheney, former Vice-President under George W. Bush; and Bill Richardson, former Secretary of Energy under Clinton and Governor of New Mexico. Genie Oil & Gas has two main subsidiaries. One of them, Afek Oil & Gas, operates in Israel and is currently drilling in the Golan Heights, which under international law is recognized as Syrian territory. The Golan was captured by Israel from Syria in 1967, and unilaterally annexed in 1981 with the introduction of Israeli law to the territory. The other Genie subsidiary, American Shale Oil, is a joint project with the French major Total SA, and operates in Colorado’s Green River Formation. Screenshot of Murdoch part-owned Genie subsidiary On its website, the company offers an extraordinary declaration regarding its rationale for focusing on unconventional oil and gas resources: “The peaking of world oil production presents the US and the world with an enormous challenge. Aggressive action must be taken to avoid unprecedented economic, social and political costs.” This may well reveal much about the crisis-perceptions of those who influence the Trump regime. Trump’s administration has been further augmented by a man with especially extensive ties to the US Deep State: Henry Kissinger. Since December 2016, Kissinger, the notorious former Secretary of State convincingly accused of complicity in war crimes by the late Christopher Hitchens — who has played direct advisory roles in both the preceding Bush and Obama administrations — has become Trump’s unofficial foreign policy guru. Kissinger was a secret national security consultant to President Bush, and under Obama was directly involved in the US National Security Council’s chain-of-command. He now appears to be intimately involved in the evolution of Trump’s foreign policies toward China and Russia. His firm, Kissinger Associates, has for some years played a central role in easing the passage of numerous US corporations into lucrative Chinese investments. Trump’s peculiar brand of haphazard, unscripted and chaotic political announcements may well have endeared him to Kissinger, who has argued that “unpredictability” is a hallmark of the greatest statesmen. Such leaders act beyond the sort of “pre-vision of catastrophes” offered by established experts recommending caution, instead indulging in “perpetual creation, on a constant redefinition of goals.” The greatest statesmen are able to both “maintain the perfection of order” and “to have the strength to contemplate chaos”, where they can “find material for fresh creation.” Kissinger’s critical role in developing Trump’s eastward facing strategy was revealed by the German tabloid, Bild, which obtained a document from the Trump transition team. The document confirmed Kissinger’s role as the key mastermind brought in to craft a way to rebuild relationships with Russia. Kissinger’s plan would include lifting US economic sanctions — paving the way for a potentially lucrative partnership between American and Russian oil and gas companies — and recognizing Russia’s ownership of the Crimea. Kissinger’s advice on China policy, however, is not yet fully known. Writing in the South China Morning Post, Pepe Escobar argues that Kissinger’s record suggests Trump will deploy “a mix of ‘balance of power’ and ‘divide and rule’. It will consist of seducing Russia away from its strategic partner China; keeping China constantly on a sort of red alert; and targeting Islamic State while continuing to harass Iran.” Kissinger’s ‘unofficial’ advisory role in the Trump regime is solidified through the direct influence of one of his longtime acolytes. K.T. McFarland, who is to work under Michael Flynn as Trump’s Deputy National Security Adviser, was an aide to Henry Kissinger during the Nixon administration on the National Security Council from 1970 to 1976. In that capacity, she played a lead role in working on Kissinger’s notorious and originally classified 1974 National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM200). The document advocated that population growth in poorer countries was the principal threat to US overseas security and other interests, especially by endangering US access to “mineral supplies”. Making America hate again It appears that there are common themes among the different groupings that comprise the Trump regime. Among them are experiences and recognition of crisis: Rex Tillerson and Steve Bannon, for instance, come from backgrounds acknowledging the reality of the planetary ecological crisis. Energy interests linked to Murdoch believe in an imminent social, economic and political crisis due to peak oil. Most Trump teamsters see their task as saving the fossil fuel industries from crises external to them, and now all ostensibly tend to deny the gravity of the industry’s environmental impacts. All are worried about the profits of their friends in Wall Street. A large number of Trump team associates have ties to John Tanton, whose proto-Nazi views are rooted in an eugenics-inspired belief that the environmental crisis is due to too many non-white people. And now Trump’s national security team draws on the parallel views of the old Nixon era Kissinger team concerning the threat of overpopulated poor countries undermining US access to the world’s food, energy and raw materials resources — for which the solution could be to ‘cauldronize’ countries of strategic interest. These crisis-perceptions, however, are not grounded in systemic insight: but are refracted through the narrow lenses of self-serving power. The crises are relevant only insofar that they represent a threat to their interests. But most importantly, their ensuing beliefs about how to respond to these crises end up being refracted through the ideological framework of the conservative-liberal polarity. 2. The Deep System Perhaps the most powerful takeaway from this examination of who the Trump administration actually is, is that the Trump regime is not external to the Deep State. On the contrary, the people who hold senior posts in his administration, both formal and otherwise, are key nodes that represent whole layers of social and institutional networks within and across the wider US Deep State. If this is not immediately obvious, it’s because there is much misunderstanding of what the Deep State actually is. The Deep State is not simply ‘the intelligence community’. When a more accurate understanding of the American Deep State and its symbiotic embeddedness in a transnational Deep System is adopted, the role of the Trump faction can be properly discerned. Secret state, opaque system In his book, Deep Politics and the Death of JFK (University of California Press, 1996), Professor Peter Dale Scott coined the term deep politics to designate the study of criminal and extra-legal practices linked to the state. He defined a deep political system or process as one in which institutional and non-institutional bodies, criminal syndicates, politicians, judges, media, corporations and leading government employees, resort to “decision-making and enforcement procedures outside as well as inside those sanctioned by law and society. What makes these supplementary procedures ‘deep’ is the fact that they are covert or suppressed, outside public awareness as well as outside sanctioned political processes.” Deep political analysis is therefore concerned with revealing the tendency of the state to enter into activity outside of the state’s own rule of law. From the viewpoint of conventional political science, law enforcement and the criminal underworld are opposed to each other, the former struggling to gain control of the latter. But as Scott observes: “A deep political analysis notes that in practice these efforts at control lead to the use of criminal informants; and this practice, continued over a long period of time, turns informants into double agents with status within the police as well as the mob. The protection of informants and their crimes encourages favours, payoffs, and eventually systemic corruption. The phenomenon of ‘organized crime’ arises: entire criminal structures that come to be tolerated by the police because of their usefulness in informing on lesser criminals.” This can lead to a form of state-crime symbiosis, blurring the defining parameters of which side controls the other. From the outside, this appears as the emergence of an invisible “deep” dimension to state activities tying it to organized crime, when in reality what is happening is that the state is inherently porous: its “deep” invisible side connects it to all manner of private, extra-legal actors who often seek to operate outside or in breach of the law — or to influence or bend the law to serve their interests. In his more recent opus, The American Deep State, (p. 14) Scott also acknowledges in this vein that the deep state “is not a structure but a system, as difficult to define, but also as real and powerful, as a weather system.” As I’ve shown in my paper published in the anthology, The Dual State (Routledge, 2016), one of the least understood features of deep politics, then, is that the “deep state” must inherently be inter-networked with a vast array of non-state and often transnational influencers across corporations, financial institutions, banks, and criminal enterprises. Capitalism, Covert Action and State-Terrorism: Towards a Political Economy of the Deep State In the name of fighting the post-9/11 "War on Terror" Western states have with increasing impunity bent, stretched and…www.academia.edu The postwar global deep system America’s historic role as the principal shaper of global capitalism means that the globalization of capitalism enabled the emergence and expansion of a US-dominated transnational Deep System — within this global Deep System, a US-dominated transnational financial elite has become inherently entangled with criminal networks. The expansion of global capitalism since 1945 was not an automated process. On the contrary, it was a deeply violent process led principally by the United States, Britain and Western Europe. Throughout, the CIA and Wall Street acted largely hand-in-hand. Globalization was tied directly to military interventions in over 70 developing nations designed to create the political conditions conducive to markets that would be ‘open’ to western capital penetration, and thus domination of local resources and labour. The logic of ‘deep politics’ required that much of this criminal political violence in foreign theatres be suppressed from public consciousness, or otherwise justified in different ways. This was privately acknowledged by US State Department planners working in partnership at the time with the Council on Foreign Relations: “If war aims are stated, which seem to be concerned solely with Anglo-American imperialism, they will offer little to people in the rest of the world… Such aims would also strengthen the most reactionary elements in the United States and the British Empire. The interests of other peoples should be stressed, not only those of Europe, but also of Asia, Africa and Latin America. This would have a better propaganda effect.” The number of people that died in the course of this forcible integration of former colonies across Asia, Africa, South America and the Middle East into the orbit of an emerging US-UK dominated global economy, is astonishing. In his book, Unpeople (2004), British historian Mark Curtis offers a detailed breakdown of the death toll at approximately 10 million — a conservative under-estimate, he qualifies. American economist Dr JW Smith, in his Economic Democracy (2005), argues that globalization was: “… responsible for violently killing 12 to 15 million people since WW II and causing the death of hundreds of millions more as their economies were destroyed or those countries were denied the right to restructure to care for their people… that is the record of the Western imperial centers of capital from 1945 to 1990.” On the back of this deep, transnational political violence — which remains obscured in mainstream media and history education — the US and UK erected a global financial architecture to serve the interests of their most powerful corporate and banking institutions, which hold overwhelming sway over the political class. State power was deployed to integrate the resources, raw materials, fossil fuel energy reserves, and cheap labour from these vast areas of the world into a global economy dominated by transnational elite interests based largely in the US, UK and Western Europe. This, too, opened the way for new forms of criminalization of state power. This can be illustrated with a powerful example from terrorism finance expert Loretta Napoleoni, who chaired the Club de Madrid’s terrorism financing group. She reports that financial deregulation pursued by successive US governments paved the way for different armed and terror groups to link up with each other and with organized crime, generating an overall criminal economy valued at about $1.5 trillion. This criminal economy consists of “illegal capital flights, profits from criminal enterprises, drug trading, smuggling, legal businesses, and so on”, most of which is recycled into Western economies through money laundering via mainstream financial institutions: “It is a vital element of the cash flow of these economies.” But the problem goes further. As the primary medium of exchange for this criminal economy is the US dollar, the latter’s role as the world reserve currency has cemented a structural situation in which the economic power of the US Treasury has become conditional on the economic immunity of transnational criminal networks, who systematically use US dollars for criminal transactions: The greater the stock of dollars held abroad, the greater the source of revenue for the US Treasury. These examples illustrate how the US Deep State operates as the chief regulator of a global Deep System, in which seemingly legitimate international financial flows have become increasingly enmeshed with transnational organized crime, powerful corporate interests who control the world’s fossil fuel and raw materials resources, and the privatization of the military-industrial complex. The Deep State faction behind Trump Trump fits into this system snugly. Among his draft executive orders is one that would open the door for US corporations to engage in secretive corrupt and criminal practices to buy conflict minerals from the Congo — which are widely used in electronic products like smartphones and laptops. From this broader perspective, it’s clear that far from representing a force opposed to the Deep State, the Trump regime represents an interlocking network of powerful players across sectors which heavily intersect with the Deep State: finance, energy, military intelligence, private defense, white nationalist ‘alt-right’ media, and Deep State policy intellectuals. According to Scott, this reflects a deepening “old division within Big Money — roughly speaking, between those Trilateral Commission progressives, many flourishing from the new technologies of the global Internet, who wish the state to do more than at present about problems like wealth disparity, racial injustice and global warming, and those Heritage Foundation conservatives, many from finance and oil, who want it to do even less.” So rather than being a nationalist ‘insurgency’ against the corporate globalist ‘Deep State’, the Trump regime represents a white nationalist coup by a disgruntled cross-section within the Deep State itself. Rather than coming into conflict with the Deep State, we are seeing a powerful military-corporate nexus within the American Deep State come to the fore. Trump, in this context, is a tool to re-organize and restructure the Deep State in reaction to what this faction believe to be an escalating crisis in the global Deep System. In short, the Deep State faction backing Trump is embarking on what it believes is a unique and special mission: to save the Deep State from a decline caused by the failures of successive American administrations. However, what they are actually doing is accelerating the decline of the American Deep State and the disruption of the global Deep System. Slide from lecture at Global Sustainability Institute, Anglia Ruskin University (Ahmed) 3. Systemic Crisis The Trump faction is correct that there is a crisis in US power, but they fail to grasp the true nature of the crisis in its global systemic context. Each grouping within the Trump faction, and the elite social and institutional networks they represent, has its own narrow understanding of the crisis, framed from within the ideological parameters of its own special interests and class position. Each grouping suffers serious epistemological limitations which mean they are not only incapable of grasping the systemic nature of the crisis and its impacts, but they hold self-serving views about the crisis which tend to project their insecurities onto all sorts of Others. The growth problem For instance, the ongoing failure to lift the US economy into a meaningful recovery is framed by the Trump faction as due to not putting ‘America first’ in trade relations. Trump’s plan is to boost infrastructure investment to create jobs at home, and to adopt more protectionist trade policies to protect American industries and manufacturing. The immediate reality here is that Trump’s money monsters are keenly aware that conventional neoliberal American economic and financial policies are no longer working: Under Obama, for instance, the median household income saw its first significant increase since the 2007–8 recession in 2015, rising by 5.2%. In real terms, though, little has changed. Median household income is at $56,516 a year, which when adjusted for inflation, is 2.4% less than what it was at the turn of the millennium. So while Obama managed to create over a million new jobs, purchasing power for the working and middle classes hasn’t increased — it’s actually decreased. Meanwhile, although the poverty rate dropped by 1.2% in 2015, the overall trend since the 2007 crash has seen the number of poor Americans increase from 38 million to 43.1 million people. But this problem goes beyond Obama — it’s systemic. Over the last century, the net value of the energy we are able to extract from our fossil fuel resource base has inexorably declined. The scientific concept used to measure this value is Energy Return on Investment (EROI), a calculation that compares the quantity of energy one extracts from a resource, to the quantity of energy used to enable the extraction. How global economic growth will drown in Trump’s oil glut after 2018 All the oil on the planet can’t save a financial system in overshoot, but another world is still possiblemedium.com There was a time in the US, around the 1930s, when the EROI of oil was a monumental 100. This has steadily decreased, with some fluctuation. By 1970, oil’s EROI had dropped to 30. Over the last three decades alone, the EROI of US oil has continued to plummet by more than half, reaching around 10 or 11. According to environmental scientist professor Charles Hall of the State University of New York, who created the EROI measure, global net energy decline is the most fundamental cause of global economic malaise. Because we need energy to produce and consume, we need more energy to increase production and consumption, driving economic growth. But if we’re getting less energy over time, then we simply cannot increase economic growth. Trump's Plans for Fossil Fuels Will Shrink the Economy - Motherboard As President-elect Trump spearheads plans to boost oil, coal and gas, a major new study by one of the world's foremost…motherboard.vice.com And this is why there has been an unmistakeable correlation between long-term global net energy decline, and a long-term decline in the rate of global economic growth. There is also an unmistakeable correlation between that long-term decline, the rise in global inequality, and the increase in global poverty. The self-styled liberal faction of the Deep State has convinced itself that capitalist growth helped halve global poverty since the 1990s, but there’s reason to question that. That success rate is calculated from the World Bank poverty measure of $1.25 a day, a level of very extreme poverty. But this poverty measure is too low. While the numbers of people living in extreme poverty has indeed halved, many of those people are still poor, deprived of their basic needs. A more accurate measure of poverty shows that the number of poor worldwide has overall increased. As the London-based development charity ActionAid showed in a 2013 report, a more realistic poverty measure lies between $5 and $10 a day. World Bank data shows that since 1990, the number of people living under $10 a day has increased by 25 percent, and the number of people living under $5 a day has increased by 10 percent. Today, 4.3 billion people — nearly two-thirds of the global population — live on less than $5 a day. So really, poverty has worsened in the Age of Progress. And now the unsustainability of this equation is coming home to roost even in the centres of global growth, where wealth is most concentrated. The UN's Sustainability Plan Is 'Doomed,' According to Linguistic Analysis - Motherboard The UN will launch its 2030 Sustainable Development agenda at the end of this month in New York City, where it will be…motherboard.vice.com As of mid-2016, the GDP of Europe has been stagnant for over a decade, and the US has reached a GDP growth rate of 1.1 percent, nearly the same as its population. This means that the US has actually experienced no average increase in “per capita wealth”, according to SUNY’s Charles Hall. To maintain this semblance of economic growth, we are using ingenious debt mechanisms to finance new economic activity. The expansion of global debt is now higher than 2007 pre-crash levels. We are escalating the risk of another financial crisis in coming years, because the tepid growth we’ve managed to squeeze out of the economy so far is based on borrowing from an energetically and environmentally unsustainable future. And that growth-by-debt mechanism is also occurring within the oil industry, which has amassed two trillion dollars worth of debt that, in the context of the chronic oil price slump, means the industry is not profitable enough to generate the funds to ever repay its debt. Exclusionary polarities Both pro- and anti-Trump factions of the Deep State are in denial of the fact that this escalating crisis is due, fundamentally, to the global net energy decline of the world’s fossil fuel resource base. In a time of fundamental systemic crisis, the existing bedrock of norms and values a group normally holds onto maybe shaken to the core. This can lead a group to attempt to reconstruct a new set of norms and values — but if the group doesn’t understand the systemic crisis, the new construct, if it diagnoses the crisis incorrectly, can end up blaming the wrong issues, leading to Otherization. Slide from lecture at Global Sustainability Institute, Anglia Ruskin University (Ahmed) The Trump faction ends up falling-back on the narrow pathways with which they are familiar, and believe that rather than requiring a different path, the problem is that we are not fully committed to pursuing the old path. They insist that the problem is not inherent to the structure of the fossil fuel industry itself, or the debt-infested nature of the parasitical global financial system. The problem is seen simply as insufficient exploitation of America’s fossil fuels; too much regulation of the financial system; constant economic pandering to unAmericans — Muslims, immigrants, Latinos, black people — who are either draining the financial system through crime, drugs and terror, or simply overburdening it with their huge numbers. While they believe that business-as-usual growth must now be monopolized by ‘America first’ (and particularly by a white nationalist definition of ‘America’), their liberal detractors cling to the belief that business-as-usual will in itself usher in continued growth, with a tad of technocratic tinkering and billionaire philanthropy spreading the gains throughout the world. Both worldviews suffer from serious ideological fallacies — but it’s the failure of the latter that has helped radicalize the former. Looking at the writing of Trump’s senior advisor Michael Anton throws significant light on how the crisis has radicalized the Trump faction into a delusional, binary worldview. For Anton, the key culprit is the moral and ideological bankruptcy of the liberal paradigm, which has destroyed the economy and is eroding American values; as well as the failure of the conservative establishment to do anything meaningful about it. Anton pined for a great disruptor to revitalize conservativism on a new footing: in the process tearing down liberals and old conservatives in one fell swoop. And so began his ideological love affair with Donald Trump. The result is Trump’s vision of himself as a sort of American messiah — but this is, of course, a grand construction. The Trump faction, following Anton’s line of argument, have simply framed all of America’s challenges through the narrow lens in which they see everything: the problem of liberals; and thus all America’s problems can be conveniently Otherized, pinned on the fatal combination of liberal decadence, and conservative bankruptcy. Thus, Trump’s proposed programme is seen by its proponents as a war on both the liberal and conservative establishments responsible for the crisis. The vision seems simple enough. Domestically and economically: kickstarting economic growth by ramping up massive investments in America’s remaining fossil fuel resources; using this to generate the revenues to fund the trillion dollar infrastructure plan; while refocusing efforts on revitalising American manufacturing; all of which will create millions of new American jobs. The foreign affairs extension is to partner with Russia to facilitate US-Russian cooperation on new oil and gas projects in the region; weakening the Russia-China partnership to facilitate American pressure on China to capitulate to US encroachment on untapped oil and gas resources in the South China Sea. The ‘war on terror’ corollary of the Trump vision is to rollback Iran’s expanding influence in the Middle East, which has greatly increased thanks to the 2003 Iraq War and the destabilization of Syria; thereby reconsolidating the regional geopolitical power of the Gulf states, where the bulk of the world’s remaining oil and gas resources are to be found. The domestic dimension of that ‘war on terror’ corollary involves cracking down on the increasing numbers of ‘useless eaters’, the hordes of non-white Others, who are seen ultimately as parasites gnawing at America’s financial, cultural and national security. Thus, the walling off of Mexico, the ‘Muslim ban’, the crackdown on immigrants, and the veiled threats to the Black Lives Matter movement that its ‘anti police’ attitude will not be tolerated, all become explicable as the result of what happens when a systemic crisis is not understood for what it is, but simply projected onto those who are affected the most by that very crisis. In all these areas, the common theme discernible across the Trump regime’s key appointments is to react to crisis-perceptions by attributing the crisis to various populations, both inside and outside the United States — invariably painted as out of control, rapidly growing in numbers, and thereby comprising an inherent threat to the ‘greatness’ of an ‘American’ identity that is increasingly defined in parochial, ethno-nationalist terms. But that’s obviously not going to work. Instead it will escalate the crisis. Slide from lecture at Global Sustainability Institute, Anglia Ruskin University (Ahmed) Global net energy decline is not going to go away by drilling harder and faster. The very act of drilling harder and faster will ultimately accelerate net energy decline. The geophysical brake on economic growth will harden, not weaken. And this means that Trump will be forced to rely on public private partnerships to bring in huge investment loans from the private sector to deliver his infrastructure plan. So whatever domestic low paid, sweatshop-style, factory jobs Trump manages to engineer in the near-term, American taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill for the trillions of dollars in repayment of those private loans. Trump’s plan will thus compound the already crisis-prone debt-levels in the American and global financial system. Meanwhile, climate change will accelerate, even as international order becomes more unstable while Trump spearheads a more aggressive military posture in the Middle East and South Asia, particularly toward Iraq, Iran and China; and cracks down harder on minorities at home. For every degree to which Trump upscales aggression, America’s real national security will be downgraded. And like any good despot, Trump’s failures will become food for his own propaganda, to be conveniently blamed on the myriad of Others who, in the small minds of the Trump faction, are preventing America from becoming ‘great again.’ 4. The future As global systemic crisis intensifies, the myriad of networks, forces and factions that comprise the American Deep State are turning on each other: Trump is not the cause, but the symptomatic outcome of this structural rupture within the US establishment. What this means is that defeating Trump in itself is not going to weaken or rollback the forces which his regime has unleashed. On the other hand, although this trajectory will produce immense upheaval and chaos while it lasts, the social support base for our Trumpian moment is dwindling. We are witnessing the reactionary death throes of the social forces behind the Trump faction. Exit polls show that only 37% of young people aged 18–29 years old voted Trump. However, while over 55% voted for Clinton, a large number of young people — approximately one million — who might have usually voted Democrat, simply didn’t come out to vote. That’s because while they may have disliked Trump, they didn’t particularly like Clinton either. One in ten millennial voters went for a third party candidate — though still a modest number, it’s three times higher than the number of third-party votes than in the previous election. At this rate of growth, the millennial shift to third party candidates could become fatal for Democrats. According to Republican strategist Evan Siegfried, if millennials had turned out to vote in 2016, they could have swung the election away from Trump decisively. This is because the party’s traditional support base consists largely of middle class white people, rural voters and baby boomers. “They are literally dying out,” said Siegried. “Every four years the white population decreases by two per cent, and the white non-college educated population decreases by four per cent.” Siegfried thus argues that Trump’s victory was won by trying to ensure that millennials and minorities who were unlikely to vote for him didn’t even come out to vote at all. But here’s the rub. While Siegfried concedes that the demographics continue to shift in favour of the Democrats in the long-run, Clinton was clearly a deeply uninspiring candidate, compromised utterly by her ties to Wall Street and the Deep State. Democrats looking at these demographic dynamics in the run up to 2016 fooled themselves into believing that a Clinton victory was inevitable. They were wrong, obviously. And while the demographics prove that the Trump support base in America will shrink, this proves that the millennial future won’t just be sceptical of Republicans, but Democrats too. Today, the composition of the Trump regime proves that Clinton’s loss was not a loss for the Deep State. On the contrary, the real problem is that the American electoral system reflects a form of regime-rotation within the Deep State itself. The rise of the Trump faction signals that the escalation of global systemic crisis has pushed the usual round of regime-rotation into a tipping point, where one branch of the Deep State is now at war with the other branch. Both sides of the US Deep State blame each other for the system’s failures, neither wishing to admit their own complicity in driving the systems responsible for those failures. One side wants to respond to the systemic crisis by accelerating market share of the old paradigm — extending the life of the fossil fuel system and deregulating predatory capital. While most are climate deniers, some even appear to recognize the dangers of environmental crisis and resource scarcity but wish to shore up the US Deep State against the crisis as a nationalist response: Fortress America. The other side hold a deep faith that technological progress will save the day and permit business-as-usual and endless extraction-premised growth to continue — they believe that digitally-driven technological innovations will allow Wall Street to have its cake and eat it: we can grow the economy, and enrich a tiny number of financiers in the West exponentially, and the dividends will trickle down to the Rest with a bit of technocratic tinkering, selective regulation and generous philanthropy. Neither side truly understands that they both remain locked into the old, dying industrial neoliberal paradigm. That both the conventional Republican and Democrat strategies have failed. And that if they continue to ignore and overlook the reality of the global systemic crisis and its escalating symptoms, they will both become increasingly disrupted and irrelevant to large sectors of the American population. In that scenario, politics will become increasingly polarized, not less so. Republicans will seek to shore up their white nationalist support base while Democrats will continue to lose credibility as a genuine critical voice due to their establishment myopia. In an alternative scenario, agents at different levels in both parties, third parties, and across civil society begin to see our Trumpian moment for what it really is. They realize that both the conservative and liberal polarities are being disrupted by the global systemic crisis. That the Deep State is being disrupted by the global systemic crisis. And that Trump is merely an effort by a branch of the Deep State to stave off the disruption. And that the failures of the other branch of the Deep State are precisely what enabled and emboldened this eventuality. An Applied Blueprint for the Restoration of Democracy At Exile, we have forged a new path aligning ecological, economic, journalistic and policy development.medium.com In that scenario, the current political tendencies of the millennial generation open the possibility for new paths forward for politics, whether conservative or liberal: to re-build their parties, organizations and paradigms in accordance with the emerging dynamics of a global system in transition to a new phase state: beyond carbon, beyond endless growth, beyond mass consumerism, beyond the banal polarities of left and right, white and black, native and foreign, and in service to people and planet. This article was amended on February 13 2017 to correct an error in describing the restructuring of the National Security Council. The previous version said that certain senior officials would be barred from NSC meetings unless their expertise was required. This is incorrect, and was based on a widely reported misconstrual of the policy. The status of Michael Flynn and Keith Kellogg was also updated on February 14 2017.

Posted 15 Feb 2017 11:35 An electric display chart showing the afternoon trading trend of the blue chip Hang Seng Index is seen through a camera at a brokerage in Hong Kong, China July 8, 2015. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A HONG KONG: Hong Kong police are struggling to deal with digital pump-and-dump schemes targeting brokerages: a little-known type of computer-generated fraud that surged in the Chinese territory last year. Although the money involved was small - only about US$20 million worth of shares - there were 81 such incidents reported in 2016, more than triple the number in 2015, according to police. In the scheme, criminals invest in thinly traded penny stocks and then manipulate their share prices by ordering trades from hacked brokerage accounts. They earn profits by selling before the fraudulent trades are reported. After last year's cyber-heist of US$81 million at Bangladesh's central bank and a series of hacks of ATM's around the world, authorities fear such pump-and-dump schemes could be increasingly used for electronic theft. Hong Kong is a favoured place for such attacks because of the number of thinly-traded penny stocks in the territory and because its securities industry has fallen behind other financial centers in defending against cyber fraud. At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China International (BOCI) Securities, according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations. A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for BOCI Securities said he could not comment on its case but the brokerage would continue to invest in IT security. "If you ask regulators in the industry what is the number one threat, not surprisingly it’s all about cyber attacks," Ashley Alder, CEO of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, said in a speech to the local legislature last week. "We've seen that happen not only in banking but also at brokers in Hong Kong, in particular recent attacks to do with basically hijacking share trading accounts." Such schemes surfaced more than a decade ago in the United States. Charles Schwab Corp, E*Trade Financial Corp and JP Morgan Chase & Co. were identified as victims of these schemes in a 2006 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The pace of attacks reported in the United States has slowed in recent years after big brokerages implemented a variety of strategies to thwart the hacks, said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Office of Internet Enforcement. Some use algorithms to identify and halt unusual trading activity, others scrutinise Internet traffic for orders coming from suspicious servers and one stopped permitting customers to use its online trading platform from buying penny stocks, said Stark, who now runs cyber-security consulting firm John Reed Stark Consulting LLC. But such protections are rare in Hong Kong, where the government has only recently started suggesting security improvements to banks and brokerages which have traditionally considered stock trading to be low-risk. TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION The Hong Kong SFC last year told firms to increase surveillance of client transactions and data protection. Authorities believe that hackers accessed brokerage accounts using stolen or guessed passwords, according to investigators. This might have been thwarted if they were protected with two-factor authentication, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has said. Two-factor authentication typically includes a password and a piece of information only the user has, for instance an electronic token with changing numbers. "Hong Kong is being targeted because they have not instituted the same cyber protections that we see in the U.S. and certain parts of Europe," said Jeff Cramer, a former U.S. prosecutor. Cramer, who is managing director with cyber-security investigations firm Berkeley Research Group, said he expects to see more attacks in Hong Kong and perhaps other Asian nations, including China, Japan and South Korea that are also behind in cyber security. FIGHTING BACK Such pump and dump cases have proven tough to crack in the United States because the masterminds are typically overseas, using surrogates and pseudonyms to make investments. Brokerages are typically not required to go public when they are hacked, so cases often only surface when the government files a complaint against suspected cyber criminals, or the hack results in litigation. The attack involving BOCI Securities year became public after it was sued by a customer that claimed its account was breached. Trading firm Fast Track Holdings Limited alleged in court documents that somebody hacked into its brokerage account on the afternoon of September 23 using a valid user ID and password. Within 18 minutes, the intruder had emptied the account by spending HKUS$38 million to buy 49 million shares of thinly traded Pa Shun Pharmaceutical, according to Fast Track. The stock soared more than 30 percent after the purchase, which was made at a 36 percent premium to the previous day's closing price, Reuters data shows.     BOCI alerted Fast Track of the suspicious activity an hour later, but it has said in court documents it should not be held financially responsible, saying it found no evidence its systems had been compromised.     Peter Pang, Pa Shun's CFO, told Reuters the management "would keep an eye to the incident and report to the regulators and the public when necessary".     One person familiar with the case said Fast Track's management believes the incident was a pump and dump scam and that Pa Shun was targeted because it is thinly-traded, but it remained unclear who was responsible.     Fast Track's directors did not respond to requests for comment.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Levin Report The Chair of the Federal Reserve Just Fact-Shamed Donald Trump Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Levin Report The Chair of the Federal Reserve Just Fact-Shamed Donald Trump Janet Yellen reveals the president has no idea what he’s talking about when it comes to Dodd-Frank. by Bess LevinFebruary 14, 2017 4:53 pm Email Facebook Twitter Janet Yellen, who doesn’t have time for this amateur-hour presidency. By Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images. When it comes to the economy, it’s becoming uncomfortably apparent that in many cases, self-described “incredible” businessman Donald Trump either has no idea what he’s talking about or he’s lying. Last week, we learned that he called erstwhile national security adviser Mike Flynn at 3 A.M. with questions about how the dollar works. Over the weekend, it was National Economic Council director Gary Cohn who had to explain that the administration’s big infrastructure plan will actually cost money. Today’s revelation comes courtesy of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, whose testimony before Congress might as well have simply been “Donald Trump is full of sh*t.” Per CNBC: During testimony before Congress, the central bank leader was asked if businesses have access to capital. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asked Yellen specifically about remarks from Trump alleging that banks are not lending because of financial reforms adopted after the 2008 financial crisis. Yellen said commercial and industrial lending specifically surged after the crisis, rising 75 percent since 2010, the year Dodd-Frank was passed. “They’re lending,” Yellen said in response to an earlier question from Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat. “Their price-to-book ratios are substantially higher than the ratio of banks headquartered in other areas, and they're gaining market share, and they remain quite profitable.” Yellen also told Brown, “Lending has expanded overall by the banking system, and also to small businesses,“ and, in response to a question about how U.S. banks are doing relative to their competitors abroad, she said, “U.S. banks are generally considered quite strong relative to their counterparts. They've built up quite a bit of capital, partly as a result of our insistence that they do so.” That insistence, of course, came via Dodd-Frank, which Trump recently knee-capped by way of an executive order. Dodd-Frank, Trump explained on the morning that he signed the order, had imposed onerous requirements on his “friends”, he said, preventing them from borrowing the money they need for their “nice businesses.” He knew this, he said, because JPMorgan C.E.O. Jamie Dimon had told him so. Yellen, you may recall, was subject to claims by Trump during his campaign that she was in cahoots with Barack Obama to create a “false stock market” to make the president look good. So it’s certainly conceivable that today’s fact-checking exercise won’t be well-received. If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe. Goldman Sachs gently tells 100 investment bankers that maybe investment banking isn’t for them Within the financial services industry, there exists a very small subset of people who would sign up for the crushing hours, abusive colleagues, and often tedious work even if they weren’t being paid gobs of money. They just love it that much! Everyone else, though, mostly does it for the money. And when that money largely comes from bonuses (as opposed to base pay), having your boss write down a number, slide it across the table, and see that it says zero has got to hurt. Sadly, 100 Goldman Sachs employees know what we’re talking about. Per Bloomberg: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. didn’t pay 2016 bonuses to about 100 bankers who advise on takeovers and underwrite securities offerings, signaling to a bigger crowd of underperformers that they’re probably better off elsewhere, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The move is more draconian than in past years, when many dealmakers who failed to impress their bosses still got something, said the people who asked not to be identified discussing the firm’s compensation practices. The number of employees denied a bonus in recent weeks is higher than a year ago--eliminating what’s typically a major component of their pay. For bankers and traders at a well-capitalized and profitable firm, getting no bonus is a dreaded scarlet letter--usually a strong hint that they’re no longer wanted and should start hunting for another job. Around the industry, it’s known as getting “blanked,” or receiving a “goose egg,” a “bagel,” or a “doughnut.” In happier news, for everyone else at the firm, the bank’s stock hit a record high today. Banks consider slapping a hazard label on the Trump Administration You know that guy in the White House who is prone to flashes of anger in which he violates decades of diplomatic protocol, lashes out at world leaders (including longtime allies), and crosses 100-foot high ethical lines when it comes to his children and businesses? Oh, and who also wreaks havoc with things like hastily signed executive orders barring thousands of people from entering the country? And whose inner circle, on top of that, may just be collapsing? All that is starting to worry banks just a bit: U.S. and U.K. banks are considering adding to their risk disclosures or beefing up particular sections in their annual reports due later this month, according to people familiar with the drafting of the documents. They’d likely cite the incoming new administration as a potential source of heightened uncertainty, but stop short of mentioning Trump by name, they said. Although banks stand to benefit from higher interest rates and Trump’s pledge to relax rules, heightened volatility could affect trading, and a slowdown in global commerce may curtail dealmaking as the president turns his attention to trade policies with China and Mexico. Bank stocks have been on a bull run in recent weeks, but some money managers say investors have ignored emerging political risks. Credit Suisse looks on the bright side The Swiss financial services giant reported a fourth-quarter loss of 2.35 billion francs ($2.34 billion) today and said it plans to lighten its load by 6,500 employees by the end of the year. But it’s super excited about having paid the U.S. government $5.3 billion for an investigation into the bank's sale of toxic mortgage securities during the financial crisis. C.E.O.

U.S. and U.K. banks are considering adding to their risk disclosures or beefing up particular sections in their annual reports due later this month, according to people familiar with the drafting of the documents. They’d likely cite the incoming new administration as a potential source of heightened uncertainty, but stop short of mention Trump by name, they said. Although banks stand to benefit from higher interest rates and Trump’s pledge to relax rules, heightened volatility could affect trading and a slowdown in global commerce may curtail deal-making as the president turns his attention to trade policies with China and Mexico. Bank stocks have been on a bull run in recent weeks, but some money managers say investors have ignored emerging political risks. Warnings that the new U.S. administration may be disruptive “would most likely have to be included, given the potential ramifications,” said Rob Smith, a partner in risk consulting at KPMG in London. “I would be very surprised if a particular institution called out Trump. Rather, they will explain the impacts in broader terms about U.S. regulatory reassessments. He presents a risk, but there are also opportunities.” <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> Political risks The new disclosures could go further than banks’ warnings when Barack Obama took office. Back then, with Obama vowing to “crack down on the culture of greed and scheming” that caused the financial crisis, firms worried about stiffer financial rules. JPMorgan Chase & Co., for example, told shareholders in 2009 that the administration had signaled a “comprehensive plan for regulatory reform.” Bank of America Corp. said it faced “legislative and regulatory initiatives, both enacted and proposed, that may significantly impact” its business. It mentioned a new law overhauling credit-card rules. Senior executives at multiple major U.K. lenders have held internal discussions about highlighting potential disruption in annual reports, which are released next week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Warnings about measures to restrict travel and curb global trade, as well as the capacity for market volatility, will probably be included as part of risk disclosures, the people added. While banks flag potential risks ranging from health pandemics to terrorist attacks in financial results, they have included more specific concerns in recent years arising from political events. U.K. lenders have previously cautioned about fallout from Britain’s exit from the European Union and the 2014 vote on Scottish independence. The decision on how to phrase the disclosures “is going to be very politically charged,” said Chris Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. “They may have some comments on interest rates, inflation and taxation, but they’re not going to point the finger at Trump directly.” Companies across all industries have been grappling with what Trump’s policies and behavior will mean for their prospects. Trump has promised tax cuts and stimulative infrastructure spending, while also attacking individual companies on Twitter for anything from their outsourcing practices to not carrying his daughter’s fashion label. ‘Highly uncertain’ “Trump just keeps on being volatile,” said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities PLC in London. “It’s hard to get a clear view on whether he’ll be positive or negative for banks, but it’s highly uncertain what banks can say right now, which I don’t think Mr. Market finds all that reassuring.” Some of Trump’s policies could prove a boon for the financial industry. The president is moving to unravel the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act put in place to prevent another financial crisis that includes a ban on proprietary trading, while expectations for rising interest rates have also bolstered major lenders. Global banking regulations may also diverge as the United States seeks to halt negotiations to develop international rules for bank capital standards known as Basel III. More broadly, many measures of corporate and investor sentiment are up. Executives used the word “optimistic” on a record 51 percent of earnings calls this quarter. The S&P 500 is heading for its fourth consecutive monthly gain since the election. Yet, the president may erect trade barriers that would slow global trade and hurt international lenders. HSBC Holdings PLC CEO Stuart Gulliver has warned a trade war between the U.S. and China “would clearly be negative for us.” Keywords Donald Trump, risk adjustment, risk to banks, relax rules, heightened volatility, trade war Print Email Comment Tweet Comments No comments on this story | Please log in to comment by clicking here Please log in or register to add your comment Related Stories banking Galvin slams Trump’s 'fiduciary rule' order (Feb. 14, 2017) immigration Trump administration to argue U.S. faces peril without ban (Feb. 7, 2017) investing Vanguard warns of Trump 'sugar high' as markets ignore risks (Feb. 3, 2017) Popular Most Read 1.

In a clarifying point during Senate questioning on Tuesday, Yellen said her monetary policy panel doesn’t need to wait for the Trump’s administration’s plans on fiscal stimulus to hike rates. “We are not basing our judgments about current interest rates on speculation” about fiscal policy, Yellen told Nevada Republican Senator Dean Heller. She added that the economy’s “solid progress” is what is “driving our policy decisions.” It’s a subtle but important switch from a year ago, when the Federal Open Market Committee started with a plan for four rate hikes, and was already worrying by March about the state of the global economy. In the end, they hiked a single time, in December. Watch Part of Yellen’s Testimony to Senate Committee The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The committee’s conviction about its plans for three hikes this year boils down to a shifting sense that upside risks this year look as potent as downside risks, if not more. Business sentiment indicators are up, and that could lead to stronger investment. The committee in December forecast that labor markets would slightly overshoot their estimate of full employment, which could put some momentum behind inflation. “You really have to turn over a lot of stones to find that shadow slack in labor markets,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, who said the Fed chair’s comments were consistent with a rate hike in the first half of this year. “For her, it is really about inflation risks” as the unemployment rate heads lower, Feroli said. Yellen also said that the committee “in the coming months” will provide further guidance on how it plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. “I would anticipate a balance sheet that’s substantially smaller than at the current time,” she said in response to a question. U.S. Treasury securities sold off on her testimony, raising the yield on the government 10-year note to 2.48 percent from 2.43 percent the previous day. Probabilities for a March rate increase moved back above 30 percent. Yellen’s semiannual report on monetary policy is her first since Trump became president. During the hearing, Yellen addressed a question about her future, saying she has no plans to leave before her current term as Fed chair expires in a year. New Administration Speaking separately at the White House press briefing when asked about the administration’s view of Yellen, newly installed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he looks forward to meeting with her to continue the tradition of regular discourse between the Treasury and the Fed. Yellen reiterated that falling behind on inflation could do more harm to the economy and possibly cut short the expansion. The Fed’s preferred inflation benchmark, the personal consumption expenditures price index, has been below the central bank’s 2 percent target since April 2012. It finished with a gain of 1.6 percent last year. “Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession,” she added. Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets LLC in New York, said Yellen’s view was “that things are looking pretty good from the labor market perspective.” “She’s had plenty of opportunity to back away from three hikes this year, and she did not,” he said.

Janet Yellen doesn't believe that should happen. Point by point, the Federal Reserve chief on Tuesday debunked the core arguments used by the White House to push for rolling back the 2010 Wall Street reform law. Trump has bashed Dodd-Frank as a "disaster" that has choked off bank loans. The president even said "many friends of mine who have nice businesses" can't get loans due to strangling regulations. Asked during Tuesday's U.S. Senate hearing if there's any truth to claims that banks aren't lending, Yellen said an "extremely low number" of small businesses complained of access to credit as their main problem. The Fed chief quickly rattled off numbers from a National Federation of Independent Businesses survey showing that just 4% of respondents are unable to get the loans they need. "We have seen healthy growth in actual lending in the economy," Yellen said, noting that bank commercial and industrial lending has exceeded its 2008 peak. Republicans have argued that Dodd-Frank has made U.S. banks less competitive against their global peers. Related: Banks are lending a ton, despite what Trump says But Yellen said U.S. banks are "quite profitable" and considered "quite strong relative to their counterparts." She credited the fact that American banks quickly built up capital, "as a result of our insistence they do so, following the financial crisis." "I see well-capitalized banks that are regarded as safe, sound and strong," Yellen said, adding this gives them a "competitive advantage." Investors seem to see it that way too. Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), two of the symbols of American financial might, were on track to close at all-time highs on Tuesday. Goldman hasn't closed at an all-time high since 2007. The White House has said that Dodd-Frank failed to address the Too Big To Fail problem exposed by the 2008 meltdown. But Yellen believes the system is in fact safer and more resilient than a decade ago. She cited the banks' doubling of high-quality capital known as Tier 1 capital. "I believe the financial system is much more resilient than it was," she said. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Yellen's responses to questions about financial regulation show that Trump and White House officials are "wrong about every major reason they've given to tear up Dodd-Frank." Warren argued that Trump and his top economic official Gary Cohn, a former president at Goldman Sachs, want to return to the kind of lax regulation that led to the 2008 meltdown. "We cannot afford to go down this road again," she said. Related: Wall Street has a powerful seat at Trump's table During the campaign, Trump criticized Yellen, saying she should be "ashamed of herself." While Trump now has three vacancies to fill at the Federal Reserve, Yellen doesn't plan to step down before her term expires in February 2018. To be sure, Yellen didn't argue that Dodd-Frank is perfect as is. Like others, the Fed chief emphasized the importance of cutting the legal and compliance costs that Dodd-Frank has placed on community banks. "We're very well aware of the burden they face and are looking for every way we can find to mitigate those burdens," she said. For instance, Yellen suggested Congress should exempt community banks from the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from making big bets with their own money. Yellen also said she agrees with the principles laid out by Trump's recent executive order on how the U.S. financial system should be regulated. Trump ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to use those broad principles to "consult" with regulators about changes that should be made to existing law. "I look forward to working with the treasury secretary" and other regulators on this review, Yellen said. But based on her comments on Tuesday, Yellen and Trump officials are likely to disagree about precisely what to do next.

Cruz was released by the New York Giants on Monday. The good news is that he's been careful about his money since the start of his career. He may not be heading into retirement any time soon, but the wide receiver has been planning for it so that he won't end up broke, the way other players do. It all started with his first NFL paycheck in 2010. "Oh man. I remember holding it up into the light and making sure it was real. Kind of hiding it like is everybody else seeing this?" Cruz said. "It was definitely a moment where I knew things were different and where I had to take care of this and make sure I make this forever and ever and ever and not just short-term." Cruz's first NFL contract was with the Giants -- it was for three years and was worth $1.215 million. In 2013, he signed a five-year contract worth $43 million. His release by the Giants Monday came ahead of a $1 million roster bonus he was supposed to get on March 11. Early on, he was advised by New York Giants' staffer Charles Way to keep track of his money. "He was like, 'Man, make sure you understand what your money is doing and understand what's happening with your money. Don't just give it to some accountant and just let him do whatever he wants with it.'" Related: Inside the world of women's tackle football As part of his effort to be financially secure once his days playing -- and dancing -- are over, Cruz teamed up with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which manages his money. Cruz has been a partner with the bank for five years now. "They teach me to be conscious of how I spend my money and to plan for the long term, not just what I see in front me," he said. "That's sometimes easier said than done." The biggest thing he's learned? "Save as much as you can." "What you do with your finances, everything is calculated. You have to make concise and precise moves with your money and not be careless with it and I think football is the same way," Cruz said. "You have to understand what you're doing [in] practice so that when game time comes, you know what you're doing and you're just playing as opposed to just reacting." Cruz said he thinks many retired players get into financial trouble because they aren't informed. "They weren't knowledgeable about what their money was doing," he said. "[Things] can add up and next thing you know, you're in debt and you're in the hole and you have to struggle a little bit and live paycheck to paycheck." Related: Millionaire NBA player isn't only guy living with his parents When Cruz eventually does leave the NFL, he wants to work with kids and teach them about financial literacy and saving. After attending the White House Science Fair in 2012, he launched the Victor Cruz Foundation to help expose inner-city students to STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and math. "Once I attended the White House Science Fair, it just kind of hit me," he said. The program started at the Boys and Girls Club in Paterson, New Jersey, where he went as a kid, and Cruz hopes it will expand. President Obama's administration started the White House Science Fair in 2010. It's unclear whether President Trump will put the same priority on STEM initiatives. "It's a time where you don't know what's going to happen," Cruz said. "We'll see if there even is a science fair ... but obviously, full support from the White House would be great and beneficial."

Tyler Crowe, Jordan Wathen, and Beth McKenna (TMFDirtyBird) Feb 14, 2017 at 8:05AM America loves its underdog stories. Whether it's some unknown rising to prominence or a big name on the comeback trail after a fall from grace, there is always that desire to see those kinds of stories succeed over the long term. So we asked three of our contributors to highlight a stock they see as a real underdog in the market today and why investors should be watching this stock. Here's a quick look into why they picked banker Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), railcar manufacturer Greenbrier Companies (NYSE:GBX) , and egg wholesaler Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM) Image source: Getty Images. Banking on the stagecoach Jordan Wathen (Wells Fargo): Maybe Wells Fargo isn't exactly the kind of stock you'd think of as an underdog, given that it trades near post-crisis highs like most banks. But since its recent accounts scandal, Wells Fargo has broadly lagged the larger banking industry. Some of its sector-lagging performance can be explained by asset sensitivity. It just doesn't have as much to gain from higher interest rates as other banks do. The other part can be explained by a widespread belief that Wells Fargo's fee generators won't be as lucrative as they used to be. While Wells Fargo may be loved for its ability to generate fee income, its credit record is much better than that of its big-bank peers. In the years that followed the financial crisis, Wells Fargo's net charge-offs peaked at 2.3% of average loans, while Bank of America's reached 3.6%, and JPMorgan's "fortress" balance sheet endured losses equal to 3.4% of its loans. Wells Fargo has a long history of adequately provisioning for losses, and running from markets where it sees increasing default risks. As a recent example, its decision to pull back on subprime auto lending in 2015 appears to have been well timed. As long as the aggressive sales processes didn't infect its underwriting or credit processes, it should continue to outperform its big-bank peers by simply being a little smarter about managing its lending risks. A railroad investment picking up steam Tyler Crowe (Greenbrier Companies): It's hard to deny the competitive advantages that railroads have over other forms of transportation for moving goods over long distances. The average revenue per ton-mile for moving goods via rail is consistently a small fraction of the cost to move things via truck or rail. This means that there is little chance that freight rail is going to be disrupted anytime soon. That is the underlying idea for investing in railcar manufacturer Greenbrier Companies, but the story is much deeper than that. Greenbrier has undergone a major transformation over the past several years. What was once a debt-laden company with middling returns on equity now has cleaned up its balance sheet and is churning out strong rates of return. During that time of higher debt, the company was making some large investments to revamp its manufacturing capacity and expand into other types of railcars to meet customer demand. These efforts have led to higher margins and a large backlog of work. Wall Street doesn't seem to be wise to the changes that have happened at Greenbrier. The company's stock currently trades at an incredibly cheap enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.97 times. This stock looks like a real gem of a value at a time when valuations at so many other stocks are getting awfully frothy. A scrambled stock that has sunny-side-up potential Beth McKenna (Cal-Maine Foods): One underdog stock I'm watching is that of Cal-Maine Foods, the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States. The company isn't an underdog in the sense that it's a small player in its industry, but in the sense that its stock has been struggling, while the broader market has been performing well. Cal-Maine stock's total return is negative 18.6% for the one-year period through Feb. 9, while the S&P 500 has returned 26.5% over this period. It remains, however, a long-term winner, as the chart below shows. This superior long-term performance reflects the company's sustainable competitive advantages and management's ability to execute, in my opinion. So I believe the company and its stock have a good shot at eventually resuming their strong performances.  Data by YCharts. Cal-Maine's recent stock-price volatility stems from the avian flu outbreak in the U.S. in the spring of 2015. (None of Cal-Maine's flock tested positive for the virus.) The company's year-over-year financial results benefited big-time from the surge in shell egg prices following the outbreak, though naturally suffered when shell egg prices fell back down to Earth. Moreover, export demand declined as a result of the outbreak and still hasn't recovered. Cal-Maine has a strong balance sheet with just $22.5 million in debt and $197.7 million in cash at the end of the most recently reported quarter. So, unlike many smaller players, it's well equipped to weather the challenging market conditions. Moreover, the company has a huge long-term catalyst for growth: Nearly all major egg buyers, including retailers such as Wal-Mart and fast-food chains like McDonald's, have pledged to buy only eggs laid by cage-free hens by a certain date.  As the industry's heavyweight, Cal-Maine has the most resources to ramp up its cage-free egg production capacity, which it has been doing.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files 6/6 By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK The trial of two men was delayed on Monday in a case stemming from a probe into a bitcoin exchange and a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co after prosecutors revealed a new witness. Jury selection was set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, whom authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. But U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan delayed jury selection until Tuesday after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. The witness, Philip Burgess, was represented by the law firm of one of Gross' lawyers in an unrelated tax case in which he was sentenced in 2010 to eight months in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Noble said Burgess, while "reporting another potential fraud" to prosecutors on Wednesday, revealed he had incriminating information stemming from his time as a potential investor in the credit union Gross headed. But after spending the day discussing how to resolve the conflict of Gross and Burgess sharing the same law firm, Nathan ruled prosecutors could not call their eve-of-trial new witness. "It is my conclusion that we will proceed tomorrow and the government may not call Mr. Burgess," she said. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, are among nine people who have been charged following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts. While Gross and Lebedev were not accused of hacking, they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Florida resident Anthony Murgio and owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon.Shalon has pleaded not guilty to charges that he orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million people's information. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid $150,000 in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said. Federal regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty in January.

US and UK banks are considering adding to their risk disclosures or beefing up particular sections in their annual reports due later this month, according to people familiar with the drafting of the documents. They’d likely cite the incoming new administration as a potential source of heightened uncertainty, but stop short of mentioning Trump by name, they said. Although banks stand to benefit from higher interest rates and Trump’s pledge to relax rules, heightened volatility could affect trading and a slowdown in global commerce may curtail deal making as the president turns his attention to trade policies with China and Mexico. Bank stocks have been on a bull run in recent weeks but some money managers say investors have ignored emerging political risks. Warnings that the new US administration may be disruptive “would most likely have to be included, given the potential ramifications,” said Rob Smith, a partner in risk consulting at KPMG in London. “I would be very surprised if a particular institution called out Trump. Rather, they will explain the impacts in broader terms about US regulatory reassessments. He presents a risk, but there are also opportunities.” The new disclosures could go further than banks’ warnings when Barack Obama took office. Back then, with Obama vowing to “crack down on the culture of greed and scheming” that caused the financial crisis, firms worried about stiffer financial rules. JPMorgan Chase & Co., for example, told shareholders in 2009 that the administration had signalled a “comprehensive plan for regulatory reform.” Bank of America said it faced “legislative and regulatory initiatives, both enacted and proposed, that may significantly impact” its business. It mentioned a new law overhauling credit-card rules. Senior executives at multiple major UK lenders have held internal discussions about highlighting potential disruption in annual reports, which are released next week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Warnings about measures to restrict travel and curb global trade, as well as the capacity for market volatility, will probably be included as part of risk disclosures, the people added. While banks flag potential risks ranging from health pandemics to terrorist attacks in financial results, they have included more specific concerns in recent years arising from political events. UK lenders have previously cautioned about fallout from Britain’s exit from the European Union and the 2014 vote on Scottish independence. The decision on how to phrase the disclosures “is going to be very politically charged,” said Chris Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. “They may have some comments on interest rates, inflation and taxation, but they’re not going to point the finger at Trump directly.” Companies across all industries have been grappling with what Trump’s policies and behaviour will mean for their prospects. Trump has promised tax cuts and stimulative infrastructure spending, while also attacking individual companies on Twitter for anything from their outsourcing practises to not carrying his daughter’s fashion label. “Trump just keeps on being volatile,” said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London. “It’s hard to get a clear view on whether he’ll be positive or negative for banks, but it’s highly uncertain what banks can say right now, which I don’t think Mr. Market finds all that reassuring.” Some of Trump’s policies could prove a boon for the financial industry. The president is moving to unravel the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act put in place to prevent another financial crisis that includes a ban on proprietary trading, while expectations for rising interest rates have also bolstered major lenders. Global banking regulations may also diverge as the US seeks to halt negotiations to develop international rules for bank capital standards known as Basel III. More broadly, many measures of corporate and investor sentiment are up. Executives used the word “optimistic” on a record 51 per cent of earnings calls this quarter. The S&P 500 is heading for its fourth straight monthly gain since the election. Yet, the president may erect trade barriers that would slow global trade and hurt international lenders. HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver has warned a trade war between the US and China “would clearly be negative for us.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Why would Malaysia sell its ‘symbol of dignity’ to China? 2 How far can Singapore’s grand plan for economy really go? 3 Why 110 Japanese went bankrupt in China last year 4 China’s stock market regulator vows to ‘capture’ more tycoons 5 TVB shares rise to 11-month high on takeover offer Shared 1 Why would Malaysia sell its ‘symbol of dignity’ to China? 2 Growing number of foreign firms shutting shop in China 3 How far can Singapore’s grand plan for economy really go? 4 Why 110 Japanese went bankrupt in China last year 5 China’s stock market regulator vows to ‘capture’ more tycoons Commented 1 Why would Malaysia sell its ‘symbol of dignity’ to China? 2 How far can Singapore’s grand plan for economy really go? 3 Looser regulation, more risk: Singapore’s new economic plan 4 CK Property first in Hong Kong with 100pc stamp duty subsidy 5 We should sell our public housing for HK$1 per flat       You may also like Politics Why Malaysia is fighting Singapore over a rock 11 Feb 2017 - 12:21pm 5 Fast facts of cloud computing In partnership with: Alibaba Cloud Hong Kong Dwindling support for bitcoin businesses in Hong Kong 11 Feb 2017 - 10:55pm 2 We can make a difference Sponsored by: Hong Kong International School Opinion Trump’s assault on Muslims takes US back to 1882 11 Feb 2017 - 11:31am 36 World CIA files reveal how US used psychics to spy on Iran 11 Feb 2017 - 9:27pm 3 Post Magazine Hong Kong men victims of sextortion by Philippine cybercriminals 11 Feb 2017 - 9:31am 14 Geopolitics Revealed: Malaysia’s ‘new evidence’ in island row against Singapore 11 Feb 2017 - 2:19am 16 Hong Kong John Tsang builds big poll lead over Carrie Lam in leadership race 10 Feb 2017 - 10:28am 35 China China to store foreigners’ fingerprints upon entry, starting with Shenzhen 10 Feb 2017 - 8:25am 27 China Fire at Chinese factory that supplied Samsung Note 7 batteries 9 Feb 2017 - 10:25am 8 China Does China’s Communist Party follow any succession rules at all? 7 Feb 2017 - 9:21pm 10 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Tyler Crowe, Jordan Wathen, and Beth McKenna (TMFDirtyBird) Feb 14, 2017 at 8:05AM America loves its underdog stories. Whether it's some unknown rising to prominence or a big name on the comeback trail after a fall from grace, there is always that desire to see those kinds of stories succeed over the long term. So we asked three of our contributors to highlight a stock they see as a real underdog in the market today and why investors should be watching this stock. Here's a quick look into why they picked banker Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), railcar manufacturer Greenbrier Companies (NYSE:GBX) , and egg wholesaler Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM) Image source: Getty Images. Banking on the stagecoach Jordan Wathen (Wells Fargo): Maybe Wells Fargo isn't exactly the kind of stock you'd think of as an underdog, given that it trades near post-crisis highs like most banks. But since its recent accounts scandal, Wells Fargo has broadly lagged the larger banking industry. Some of its sector-lagging performance can be explained by asset sensitivity. It just doesn't have as much to gain from higher interest rates as other banks do. The other part can be explained by a widespread belief that Wells Fargo's fee generators won't be as lucrative as they used to be. While Wells Fargo may be loved for its ability to generate fee income, its credit record is much better than that of its big-bank peers. In the years that followed the financial crisis, Wells Fargo's net charge-offs peaked at 2.3% of average loans, while Bank of America's reached 3.6%, and JPMorgan's "fortress" balance sheet endured losses equal to 3.4% of its loans. Wells Fargo has a long history of adequately provisioning for losses, and running from markets where it sees increasing default risks. As a recent example, its decision to pull back on subprime auto lending in 2015 appears to have been well timed. As long as the aggressive sales processes didn't infect its underwriting or credit processes, it should continue to outperform its big-bank peers by simply being a little smarter about managing its lending risks. A railroad investment picking up steam Tyler Crowe (Greenbrier Companies): It's hard to deny the competitive advantages that railroads have over other forms of transportation for moving goods over long distances. The average revenue per ton-mile for moving goods via rail is consistently a small fraction of the cost to move things via truck or rail. This means that there is little chance that freight rail is going to be disrupted anytime soon. That is the underlying idea for investing in railcar manufacturer Greenbrier Companies, but the story is much deeper than that. Greenbrier has undergone a major transformation over the past several years. What was once a debt-laden company with middling returns on equity now has cleaned up its balance sheet and is churning out strong rates of return. During that time of higher debt, the company was making some large investments to revamp its manufacturing capacity and expand into other types of railcars to meet customer demand. These efforts have led to higher margins and a large backlog of work. Wall Street doesn't seem to be wise to the changes that have happened at Greenbrier. The company's stock currently trades at an incredibly cheap enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.97 times. This stock looks like a real gem of a value at a time when valuations at so many other stocks are getting awfully frothy. A scrambled stock that has sunny-side-up potential Beth McKenna (Cal-Maine Foods): One underdog stock I'm watching is that of Cal-Maine Foods, the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States. The company isn't an underdog in the sense that it's a small player in its industry, but in the sense that its stock has been struggling, while the broader market has been performing well. Cal-Maine stock's total return is negative 18.6% for the one-year period through Feb. 9, while the S&P 500 has returned 26.5% over this period. It remains, however, a long-term winner, as the chart below shows. This superior long-term performance reflects the company's sustainable competitive advantages and management's ability to execute, in my opinion. So I believe the company and its stock have a good shot at eventually resuming their strong performances.  Data by YCharts. Cal-Maine's recent stock-price volatility stems from the avian flu outbreak in the U.S. in the spring of 2015. (None of Cal-Maine's flock tested positive for the virus.) The company's year-over-year financial results benefited big-time from the surge in shell egg prices following the outbreak, though naturally suffered when shell egg prices fell back down to Earth. Moreover, export demand declined as a result of the outbreak and still hasn't recovered. Cal-Maine has a strong balance sheet with just $22.5 million in debt and $197.7 million in cash at the end of the most recently reported quarter. So, unlike many smaller players, it's well equipped to weather the challenging market conditions. Moreover, the company has a huge long-term catalyst for growth: Nearly all major egg buyers, including retailers such as Wal-Mart and fast-food chains like McDonald's, have pledged to buy only eggs laid by cage-free hens by a certain date.  As the industry's heavyweight, Cal-Maine has the most resources to ramp up its cage-free egg production capacity, which it has been doing.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned. Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned. Tyler Crowe has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends The Greenbrier Companies.

The tendency for the governing or regulating bodies isn’t to try to get things from over-exuberant back to the mean, it’s to over-regulate, so it can never ever happen again. While that always seems like a good solution at the time, it is usually so stifling that in the normal course of events, transactions and business can be bottlenecked for years. A new Merrill Lynch research report makes the case that some regulatory relief is possibly on the way, and the resignation in April of this year of Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, who is said to be the de facto head of bank supervision, could pave the way for an improved administration of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. The analysts also feel this could free up some of the tremendous amount of capital the banks are forced to hold. In fact, they estimate that there is as much a $230 billion in what they call “dead weight” capital from the CCAR process. While two banks immediately hit the Merrill Lynch screens as possible winners from the rules changes, only one is ranked Buy at the firm. We suspect this would to a large degree help all banks, so we screened the Merrill Lynch research database for the large money center banks also rated Buy. Citigroup This is one of the banks that Merrill Lynch feels could benefit among the most if the CCAR is modified. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. It provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services and wealth management. Trading at a still very cheap 10.9 times estimated 2018 earnings, this company still looks very reasonable in what is becoming a pricey stock market. A continuing stock buyback program at the bank is a positive, which could be increased if some of the restrictions were relaxed. While fourth-quarter results were generally in line with estimates, management was conservative looking forward and some were disappointed. Citigroup investors receive a 1.2% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $64. The Wall Street consensus price objective is $64.61. Shares closed most recently at $59.90. JPMorgan This stock trades at a still low 11.8 times estimated 2018 forward earnings and could respond good in a rising rate scenario. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is expected to continue to benefit from commercial loan growth and an upturn in capital spending. Wall Street analysts agree that the stock seems attractively valued on estimated price-to-earnings and a very solid price-to-book value. Some on Wall Street have cautioned that last year’s divestiture of the physical commodities business could provide earnings headwind going forward. With $2.6 trillion in assets on a worldwide basis, and one of Wall Street’s savviest leaders in Jamie Dimon, the stock is a solid buy for investors. Last year, Dimon put his money where his mouth was and bought a stunning 500,000 shares of the stock for a massive $26 million. The company reported solid fourth-quarter results that came in a touch above estimates. The analysts feel the company is able to take advantage of revenue opportunities while still improving efficiency. The firm’s forward estimates are above current Wall Street expectations. JPMorgan investors receive a 2.5% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $95 price target, and the consensus target is $89.21. The shares closed Monday at $88.24.

Explaining his forecast, Gartside said that the U.S. economy is "on an improving trajectory; inflation (is going) higher." Janet Yellen, the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, would "react to reality," he added. Justifying his viewpoint, Gartside said that, "that sounds aggressive now, but remember that we've not yet seen the phenomenal tax plan that is yet to come," referring to new U.S. President Donald Trump's fiscal policy of reforming taxation in the country. "Tax cuts work very quickly for both consumers, for corporations," he added, viewing the potential changes as positive for U.S. economic growth. By way of suggesting when the first of this year's predicted rate hikes will be, Yellen "should keep March open – and if she's brave, she should go in March," said Gartside. "When you look at GDP (gross domestic product) in the U.S. this year, the reality is that the risk is to the upside, and considerably to the upside," emphasized Gartside. "The market's not got that yet," he added. With regards to U.S. debt, Gartside argued that "markets are dominated by animal spirits." "When we see the detail of those tax cuts, expect the greed bond to take over," he said. Discussing the U.S. 10-year bond yield, Gartside forecast that "by the end of the year, it probably (will go) to three and a half percent." "If you've got an environment where the economy is improving, corporations are making more money, households have bigger incomes, they have tax cuts, then that debt service is able to financed," he said, describing the U.S. economy's potential for "a self-fulfilling recovery as you look forward." "Probably before Easter time, we'll see markets really latch on to that," he added. Gartside thought that tax reform would be the first factor to affect U.S. bond yields. But commenting on the implication of political risk in Europe and how this could impact the U.S., Gartside said that the "when you look at the recent history of electoral surprises, a – they tend to be pretty idiosyncratic and pretty localized, and then secondly, markets have shrugged them off." He said that markets would be preoccupied with positive growth and inflation forecasts, and with "accommodative" central banks in Europe, "that's probably supportive for asset prices."

Here's why    Tuesday, 14 Feb 2017 | 7:19 AM ET | 03:21 While the nation's unemployment rate declines, the jobless trend for America's youngest veterans is climbing, jumping to 6.3 percent in January from 4.4 percent in September. "We still see around half a million veterans that are unemployed right now, and over a million veterans that are underemployed," said Brian Stann, CEO of Hire Heroes USA. Economist note that the jobless rate for post-9/11 vets is volatile, and the small sample size leaves it open to inaccuracy. But even looking at the trend over a three-month period, the scenario looks tough for young vets. One reason, according to Stann: "They get out of the military and they're competing against their peer group that just graduated college. And a lot of companies do not equate four years of military service to four years at a university or state institution." And it can be a huge challenge to transition from a regimented, follow-orders environment to the civilian world where self-starters succeed. Getty Images People cheer veterans in the Veterans Day Parade in New York City last year. Leaving the Army behind Brandon Smith left the Army in 2015. After a restaurant hosting job and a brief stint with UPS, he enrolled full-time in Syracuse University's Institute for Veterans and Military Families, the first-in-the-nation cross-disciplinary institute to focus on veterans. "I think a lot of the soldiers that go in the military don't have entirely what they need to tackle the workforce in the first place," Smith said. "I went in the military because I couldn't find the job I wanted, or I couldn't get the opportunity I wanted." To complicate matters, President Donald Trump's federal hiring freeze may hit veterans hardest. It's a primary source of civilian employment post-service because of its preferential hiring practices toward veterans. A third of federal workers are veterans. Companies that value the leadership and experience earned in the armed forces are working to make sure veterans have that same kind of training going into the civilian world. JPMorgan Chase committed $22 million to fund Syracuse's Institute for Veterans, and within its company has dedicated a team to recruit, acclimate and retain veterans. The bank has hired 11,000 veterans in the past five years. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz also pledged $20 million to the endeavor through his family foundation. The coffee chain has hired 8,800 veterans and military spouses, and that number is slated to increase to 10,000 by next year. But experts suggest that many employers have allowed their vigilance to lag when it comes to hiring vets. As U.S. forces withdraw from overseas conflicts, news coverage of military matters has softened, allowing national attention to lapse. Hollywood has also shifted its focus away from broader military themes, with movies and television shows honing in on extremes, portraying veterans who are either heroes or victims suffering from PTSD, addiction or suicidal tendencies. "A lot of people put me into a box, which is what a lot of veterans face when they go into the civilian world," said J.R. Martinez, one of the best-known veterans of the second Gulf War. "Once I started to deal with this feedback of people rejecting me, I then started to have to deal with the mental and emotional — then I became angry, developed resentment. … I'd earned the right for people to give me a shot, to give me a chance." Getty Images J.R. Martinez speaks on stage at Hollywood Bridging The Military Civilian Divide at Paramount Pictures on February 9, 2017 in Los Angeles. A different perspective Martinez got his chance when he landed a role on ABC's daytime drama "All My Children" and then went on to win "Dancing with the Stars," helping America see beyond his scars and disfigurement. "If we let that narrative be simply about victims or heroes, I think we've missed an opportunity," said Mike Haynie, executive director of the Syracuse's institute. "Most veterans are somewhere in the middle of those two extremes." At a panel sponsored by the institute about Hollywood's influence on America's perception, David Gale, formerly of MTV and now the co-founder of a veterans-focused production company We Are the Mighty, said, "We need more volume. We need more stories. We need to be able to show veterans in the complexities that everyday people are." CBS' "NCIS" employs more than 100 veterans on the show's roster of 250, and Scott Williams, a writer and executive producer of the show, says the vets fully inform the stories "NCIS" produces. That means writing storylines with complex, multilayered individuals with leadership, experience and problem-solving know-how. With some 200,000 servicemen and women leaving the military every year, highlighting that perception could make all the difference. "It's more competitive to stay in," said Zachary Watson, who left the Marines in the fall. "So, now a lot of people are realizing, 'OK, I can't stay in here. I've got to get a job or something.'" Watson is taking advantage of the GI bill, enrolled as a full-time student. He believes a college degree will help him launch a successful career in TV or film but thinks his military experience would be the most valuable to future employers. "At 22 years old, I was in charge of an entire crew, and I was responsible for being part of the whole organization and unit that was repairing helicopters that are [worth] millions of dollars. How many 22-year-olds are in charge of stuff like that?" Experts urge companies to consider adapting their approach to recruiting veterans — anticipating unique needs for acclimation and retention — in a similar way that they've had to change their approach for hiring millennials. Veterans say those in the armed forces need to prepare themselves for the civilian world six to nine months before leaving the military, taking advantage of the tools available to them through the military, the Veterans Administration and support groups. Martinez, who is taking a break from acting to study psychology full time at Fordham said, "As much as we're talking about hiring veterans and giving them an opportunity, we hope people don't translate that to just saying, 'Just hire us on the spot because we're veterans and because of what we've done for this country.' We want to be in the conversation. Give us a chance to sell ourselves to you, and to prove to you that we can, and we will!" CNBC's Michael Newberg contributed to this report. show chapters The ranks of unemployed young veterans are rising.

U.S. and U.K. banks are considering adding to their risk disclosures or beefing up particular sections in their annual reports due later this month, according to people familiar with the drafting of the documents. They’d likely cite the incoming new administration as a potential source of heightened uncertainty, but stop short of mention Trump by name, they said. Although banks stand to benefit from higher interest rates and Trump’s pledge to relax rules, heightened volatility could affect trading and a slowdown in global commerce may curtail dealmaking as the president turns his attention to trade policies with China and Mexico. Bank stocks have been on a bull run in recent weeks but some money managers say investors have ignored emerging political risks. Warnings that the new U.S. administration may be disruptive “would most likely have to be included, given the potential ramifications,” said Rob Smith, a partner in risk consulting at KPMG in London. “I would be very surprised if a particular institution called out Trump. Rather, they will explain the impacts in broader terms about U.S. regulatory reassessments. He presents a risk, but there are also opportunities.” Political Risks The new disclosures could go further than banks’ warnings when Barack Obama took office. Back then, with Obama vowing to “crack down on the culture of greed and scheming” that caused the financial crisis, firms worried about stiffer financial rules. JPMorgan Chase & Co., for example, told shareholders in 2009 that the administration had signaled a “comprehensive plan for regulatory reform.” Bank of America Corp. said it faced “legislative and regulatory initiatives, both enacted and proposed, that may significantly impact” its business. It mentioned a new law overhauling credit-card rules. Senior executives at multiple major U.K. lenders have held internal discussions about highlighting potential disruption in annual reports, which are released next week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Warnings about measures to restrict travel and curb global trade, as well as the capacity for market volatility, will probably be included as part of risk disclosures, the people added. While banks flag potential risks ranging from health pandemics to terrorist attacks in financial results, they have included more specific concerns in recent years arising from political events. U.K. lenders have previously cautioned about fallout from Britain’s exit from the European Union and the 2014 vote on Scottish independence. The decision on how to phrase the disclosures “is going to be very politically charged,” said Chris Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. “They may have some comments on interest rates, inflation and taxation, but they’re not going to point the finger at Trump directly.” Companies across all industries have been grappling with what Trump’s policies and behavior will mean for their prospects. Trump has promised tax cuts and stimulative infrastructure spending, while also attacking individual companies on Twitter for anything from their outsourcing practices to not carrying his daughter’s fashion label. ‘Highly Uncertain’ “Trump just keeps on being volatile,” said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London. “It’s hard to get a clear view on whether he’ll be positive or negative for banks, but it’s highly uncertain what banks can say right now, which I don’t think Mr. Market finds all that reassuring.” The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Some of Trump’s policies could prove a boon for the financial industry. The president is moving to unravel the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act put in place to prevent another financial crisis that includes a ban on proprietary trading, while expectations for rising interest rates have also bolstered major lenders. Global banking regulations may also diverge as the U.S. seeks to halt negotiations to develop international rules for bank capital standards known as Basel III.

Executives used the word “optimistic” on a record 51 percent of earnings calls this quarter. The S&P 500 is heading for its fourth straight monthly gain since the election. Yet, the president may erect trade barriers that would slow global trade and hurt international lenders. HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver has warned a trade war between the U.S. and China “would clearly be negative for us.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Though she is unlikely to win the mandate to become the next French president in the second round of voting, it is worth noting there is increasing support for the anti-euro and anti-European party. One of Le Pen's campaign pledges is putting the country's membership of the euro zone to a referendum, arguing that the common currency hasn't benefited the French people. Analysts have told CNBC that such an argument is nonsense and that in fact, the second-largest euro zone economy has been one the main beneficiaries of the single currency. "Interest rates were much higher pre-euro," Gilles Moec, chief European economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told CNBC over the phone on Friday. "It's thus hard to argue France has been a victim of the monetary union," he said. "In fact, France has been one of the main beneficiaries of the lower rates," he added. The euro was introduced on January 1, 1999, with the European Central Bank taking control of monetary policy. As a result, the euro has removed most of the politics from currency markets in Europe and has boosted trade. Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC that he doesn't see any ground to blame the euro for the subdued economic growth in France. "The economy is picking up at the moment," he noted, adding that French companies have seen exports rise because of the single currency. According to data released by the European Commission, France is set to grow 1.4 percent this year, 0.2 percentage points higher than in 2016. The country has struggled to expand its economy, while reducing its government spending. In fact, France's deficit is set to increase from this year to the next, from 2.9 percent of gross domestic product to 3.1 percent in 2018 – above the EU's threshold. However, according to Juvyns from JP Morgan, the solution to boost the French economy is not returning to the franc as Le Pen supports. "I don't think this is a very good economic plan," he said, commenting on Le Pen's plan to convert the 1.7 trillion euros ($1.81 trillion) into francs. Looking at the main economic indicators pre and post euro membership, it is clear that exports rose since the country began using the euro and the economy has grown at a faster pace, despite a higher deficit and a stagnation in unemployment. 1998 2004 2015 Unemployment (percentage of active population) 10.3% 8.9% 10.4% Exports (in million) To the EU = 199,767 Extra EU = 105,662 To the EU = 240, 248 Extra EU = 122,960 To the EU = 268,205 Extra EU = 187,785 GDP (million euros) 1,350,167.7 1,710,760.0 2,181,064 Deficit (million) 829,384 1,123,511 2,097,610 Data from the Eurostat Furthermore, some analysts believe that France has potential to grow further. "France's demographics are a comparative advantage over other EU countries," Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note last month. "France can still benefit from 0.1-0.2 percent natural growth per year on average over 2018-25, while Germany's natural growth will turn negative to 0.4 percent absent further immigration acceleration," the bank added. The same research noted also that each hour worked in France creates 52.4 euros of real gross domestic product, above the 47.9 euros registered in Germany. "What's missing is stronger total factor productivity," the bank said, calling for labor market reforms. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

NEW DELHI: GIC of Singapore is set to enter into exclusive bilateral negotiations with KP Singh and his family, the promoters of India’s largest real estate firm DLF Limited, to acquire their 40% stake in DLF Cyber City Developers Limited (DCCDL), the company that owns a portfolio of leased commercial assets, including the entire Cyber City complex in Gurgaon. The deal will help the promoters raise about Rs 12,000 crore, valuing the rental arm at nearly Rs 40,000 crore, inclusive of its Rs 10,000-11,000 crore debt, said two persons familiar with the negotiations. The promoters plan to use most of these funds in subscribing to a Rs 10,000-crore preferential issue of DLF Limited, which in turn will use this money to retire a portion of its debt. “The agreement is likely to be signed soon,” said one of the persons quoted above. The balance 60% in DCCDL is owned by DLF Limited. A DLF spokesperson declined to comment. “We do not wish to comment on speculation. We are in our silent period as our quarterly results are scheduled for February 14,” said the spokesperson. GIC did not respond to queries. Last year, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were mandated by DLF to help monetise their stake in an effort to deleverage their balance sheet. GIC, which already has close relationship with DLF, trumped Blackstone and a consortium of sovereign wealth funds from Abu Dhabi and Qatar, added officials in the know. Close to 15 suitors had expressed initial interests to partner DLF. DCCDL operates 27 million square feet of commercial property assets that are already leased and earning rent of Rs 2,250 crore as of March 31, 2016. It also has 20 million sq ft of future development potential. The proposed transaction will reduce DLF Ltd’s debt in a two-step transaction. The promoters will pump Rs 10,000 crore into India’s largest real estate developer by purchasing shares in a preferential issue with funds raised from the sale of their stake in the company’s rental unit. In addition, the real estate firm plans to raise about Rs 3,000 crore from institutional investors. From these two transactions, the company will raise about Rs 13,000 crore, and this money will be used to retire a portion of DLF Ltd’s standalone debt. In addition, DCCDL owes Rs 11,000 crore to its lenders. As it will continue to be 60% owned by DLF Ltd, its debt will remain in the parent company’s books. “DLF has been running operational cash flow deficit of Rs 5-6 billion (Rs 500-600 crore) per quarter due to slowdown in sales and continued construction spend (Rs 6.5-7 billion per quarter). With sales expected to remain muted, the company does not expect the gap to close in coming quarters. Closure of DCCDL transaction would help close that gap," wrote analysts from Axis Securities in a report in December. DLF shares fell 0.07%, or 10 paise, to close at Rs 147.7 50 on the BSE on Monday.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files 6/6 By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK The trial of two men was delayed on Monday in a case stemming from a probe into a bitcoin exchange and a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co after prosecutors revealed a new witness. Jury selection was set to begin in Manhattan federal court in the case of Yuri Lebedev, whom authorities call the architect of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's platform, and Trevon Gross, a pastor and ex-chairman of a now-defunct credit union. But U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan delayed jury selection until Tuesday after prosecutors said they had secured a new witness. The witness, Philip Burgess, was represented by the law firm of one of Gross' lawyers in an unrelated tax case in which he was sentenced in 2010 to eight months in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Noble said Burgess, while "reporting another potential fraud" to prosecutors on Wednesday, revealed he had incriminating information stemming from his time as a potential investor in the credit union Gross headed. But after spending the day discussing how to resolve the conflict of Gross and Burgess sharing the same law firm, Nathan ruled prosecutors could not call their eve-of-trial new witness. "It is my conclusion that we will proceed tomorrow and the government may not call Mr. Burgess," she said. Gross, 52, and Lebedev, 39, are among nine people who have been charged following an investigation connected to a breach JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts. While Gross and Lebedev were not accused of hacking, they came under scrutiny in connection with Coin.mx, which authorities said was operated by Florida resident Anthony Murgio and owned by an Israeli behind the JPMorgan breach, Gery Shalon.Shalon has pleaded not guilty to charges that he orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million people's information. Prosecutors said Coin.mx operated through a front called "Collectables Club" to trick financial institutions into believing it was a memorabilia club while it converted, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin. To further evade scrutiny, in 2014, Murgio, with Lebedev's help, tried to take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which was linked to HOPE Cathedral. To do so, they and others paid $150,000 in bribes via the church to Gross, its pastor, in exchange for facilitating Murgio's takeover and arranging for Lebedev and others to be put on the credit union's board, prosecutors said. Federal regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty in January.

Finance Search US aid groups hobbled by banking barriersAAP – Tue, Feb 14, 2017 11:02 AM AEDT Most US aid groups working abroad face the unintended consequences of US banking regulations aimed at preventing terrorist financing, just as the number of people displaced worldwide has reached record levels, according to a new survey. Two-thirds of US non-profit organisations working internationally experience banking problems, according to the survey commissioned by the Charity & Security Network and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Fifteen per cent of non-profits experienced those problems constantly or regularly. Smaller organisations were more likely to face banking barriers, the report found. Major western banks have pulled out of certain lines of business or parts of the world because they fear violating tighter US regulations, a trend referred to as "de-risking". Those hit hardest include charities, money remittance services, and even entire regions. The most common problems charities face include delayed wire transfers, sometimes stretching into weeks, requests for more documentation, and higher fees, the survey found. Some non-profits see their accounts closed or banks refuse to open accounts for them in the first place. Non-profits are forced to use riskier ways to move money, including carrying cash, the report said. The Swasia Charity Foundation has had problems accessing banking services ever since it was founded in New Jersey in 2012 to provide aid to Syrians affected by the civil war, Rami Bitar, a board member, said in an interview. In 2014, Bank of America Corp blocked a transfer for about $US35,000 ($A45,822) because Swasia's treasurer mentioned the money was destined for an education program in a Syrian village. The bank asked for more information and in the end did not complete the transfer, Bitar said. The same year, JPMorgan Chase & Co gave the group two months' notice before it closed its account, Bitar said. "We did not inquire about why or whether they can do it or not," Bitar said. "We assumed the reason behind it is that we are a charity for the Syrian people and simply that was it." Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. Critics say the US government is primarily concerned with stopping terrorist financing, an approach they argue drives transactions outside the formal financial system and makes it harder to track illicit activity. "They want the bad guys out and that's the only thing they're set up to do," said Scott Paul, senior humanitarian policy adviser at Oxfam America. A State Department official said the US government's interests are served by charities being allowed to do their work, but that priority competes with that of protecting the global financial system from abuse. "It's not like there are great solutions that are leaping forward that are being ignored by anyone," said the official, on condition of anonymity. The Treasury Department declined to comment.

REUTERS/File Photos 3/3 By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK A Florida software engineer and a New Jersey pastor engaged in lies and corruption to facilitate an illegal bitcoin exchange business whose operators wanted to take over a small credit union to evade scrutiny, a federal prosecutor said on Wednesday. At the start of a trial in Manhattan federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Won Shin told jurors that programmer Yuri Lebedev schemed with others to bribe Trevor Gross, the pastor and head of a Jackson, New Jersey-based credit union housed in his church. Shin said Gross accepted bribes including a $150,000 church donation in exchange for helping unlicensed bitcoin exchange Coin.mx's operator take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union. Coin.mx, which employed Lebedev while running through a front called "Collectables Club," in exchange could use the credit union to evade scrutiny of banks wary of processing payments by individuals buying the virtual currency. "The bribes and lies had a simple, shared purpose: For the defendants Lebedev and Gross and their co-conspirators to make money," Shin said. But lawyers for Lebedev, 39, and Gross, 52, said they did nothing wrong and were being blamed due to actions by Anthony Murgio, who ran Coin.mx and who they said manipulated people while trying to illegally grow the business. "Yuri was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people," said Eric Creizman, Lebedev's lawyer. Kristen Santillo, Gross' lawyer, said he was tricked into believing Coin.mx was a memorabilia club, and thought there was nothing wrong about a donation to the church, and which did not benefit him personally. "He didn't know anything about what they were up to," she said. The trial followed an investigation rooted in a data breach that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts, leading to charges against nine individuals. Gross, Lebedev and Murgio were not accused of hacking. But prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by an Israeli behind the breach, Gery Shalon. Prosecutors say Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million peoples' information. Prosecutors said they carried out the hackings to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails. Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein have pleaded not guilty. Regulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty to charges related to Coin.mx in January.

By Nicole Rojas February 15, 2017 23:38 GMT Close Co-op bank up for sale after turnaround stalled IBTimesUK/Wochit US stocks continued on an upward trend Wednesday (15 February), closing at record highs for a fifth straight session. All three major indices posted the longest record-setting streak since January 1992 following President Donald Trump's promise of a "massive" tax plan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 107.45 points, or 0.5%, to settle at 20,611.86. Gains in the blue chip gauge were led by Procter & Gamble Co, whose shares rose 3.7% after investor Trian Fund Management LP revealed a $3bn stake in the company, MarketWatch reported. CNBC noted that official filings released Tuesday (14 February) showed a number of US hedge fund investors transferred significant parts of their portfolios into the financial and pharmaceutical sectors. The S&P 500 index rose 11.67 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 2,349.25. A rise of nearly 1.2% in healthcare stocks led the S&P higher at the close of the session. The financials sector also contributed to gains, rising 0.7% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite gained 36.87 points, or 0.6%, to end at 5,819.44. MarketWatch reported the tech-heavy index closed at a record for a seventh session in a row, marking the longest similar streak since 27 December 1999. Trump's comments on Wednesday echoed those made earlier in February when he promised to deliver a "phenomenal" tax plan. The president said that his administration is "focused on the issues that will bring economic growth. That's what we're all about." In economic news, the consumer price index (CPI) gained a more-than-expected 0.6% in January, CNBC reported. Retail sales also rose at a faster pace than what was expected, gaining 0.4% in January. Following the inflation report, economist at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan raised their expectations of a rate hike for March or May. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified in front of Congress on Tuesday and raised expectations for a rate hike in March, saying it would be "unwise" for the Fed to delay. Gold futures for April delivery rose $7.40 to settle at $1,233.10 an ounce. Meanwhile US crude oil for March delivery dropped $0.09 to $53.11 a barrel. The dollar moved lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.06 and the yen 114.1 against the greenback. US Treasury yields jumped after the data releases, with the short-term two-year yield at 1.26% and the 10-year yield climbing above 2.5%.

The country's licensed lenders grew their loan books at the fastest pace in eight years in 2016, with $393.6 billion of loans and advances as at Dec. 31 from $364 billion a year earlier, according to KPMG's financial institutions performance survey. Still, skinnier net interest margins of 2.18 percent compared with 2.28 percent a year earlier, meant net profit fell 6.5 percent to $4.84 billion across the sector. While customer deposits rose 8.1 percent to $287.5 billion, it wasn't big enough to fund the credit expansion and lenders turned to wholesale funding lines overseas which were more expensive in what remains a low interest rate environment. Bank executives spoken to by the report's authors said the more expensive wholesale funding will be compounded by increased lending restrictions and capital requirements imposed on the big four Australian-owned banks' parents, which will see them "return billions of dollars in funding to their Australian parents over the next few years". That's expected to "slow lending growth in the upcoming year," the report said. This week ASB Bank chief executive Barbara Chapman noted the narrowing margins when the lender reported a 6 percent increase in first-half profit, saying deposits weren't keeping pace with credit growth. Just three banks were able to widen their margins in 2016, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (New Zealand), which its margin by seven basis points to 0.89 percent, and the New Zealand branches of JP Morgan Chase Bank, which increased it by eight basis points to 0.85 percent, and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp, which eked out a three basis point gain to 1.85 percent. NZX-listed Heartland Bank retained the widest margin at 4.79 percent, down from 4.89 percent a year earlier. In 2015, New Zealand's lenders reaped their biggest margins in nine years in a period of strong lending growth, primarily in the residential and agricultural sectors. Since then banks have become more wary about the rural sector after a slump in dairy prices meant many farms faced another year operating at a loss, although dairy prices have since recovered somewhat. At the same time, the property market has slowed down after the Reserve Bank imposed new curbs to cool investor demand, which was seen driving up prices at an unsustainable pace, taking advantage of a housing shortage during a time of rapid population growth. The lenders themselves adopted tougher criteria, and ANZ Bank New Zealand chief executive David Hisco went as far as writing an op-ed piece in the New Zealand Herald newspaper last July warning property prices were overcooked. The banks' executive said they faced a "tough predicament" in the public eye over interest rates when the Reserve Bank lowered the official cash rate last year, as "they were unable to reduce deposit rates due to a decline in the volume of deposits because of already low rates, and at the same time they could not reduce home loan rates any further as they were already under margin pressure and starting to hit ROE (return on equity) and ROI (return on investment) limits."

The most popular means to make this happen is with NFC, or Near-Field Communication. It’s a wireless protocol that securely sends data between two electronic devices when they are within a few inches of each other. They can transfer files or data to confirm an identity or facilitate a purchase. This is the tech at work behind every Apple Pay transaction, for example. Now it may soon be headed to your ATM. RELATED: Protect Your Privacy: Apps That Go the Extra Mile With 18,000 domestic ATMs to its name, JPMorgan Chase is test-driving this technology on a few hundred machines in four American test cities. Bank of America and Wells Fargo will introduce cardless access to ATMs before the end of 2017. Forgetful bank customers everywhere seem bound to benefit — shunning the card might seem like a baby step, but it’s big news for two main reasons: security and convenience. MORE: How to Keep Your Data Safe While Traveling? Bankers have long been at war with “skimmers,” disguised hardware that malicious third parties install on an ATM to record card numbers as people swipe them, and their corresponding PIN codes as people punch them in. The all-important ATM card becomes the weakest point of attack here; by using a physical card, there is a mild yet inherent lack of security for a bad guy to take advantage of. For a similar attack to take place at an NFC-enabled ATM, the bad guy would have to steal your entire phone, and you’d notice a missing phone before a missing wallet.

The country’s licensed lenders grew their loan books at the fastest pace in eight years in 2016, with $393.6 billion of loans and advances as at Dec. 31 from $364 billion a year earlier, according to KPMG’s financial institutions performance survey. Still, skinnier net interest margins of 2.18 percent compared with 2.28 percent a year earlier, meant net profit fell 6.5 percent to $4.84 billion across the sector. While customer deposits rose 8.1 percent to $287.5 billion, it wasn’t big enough to fund the credit expansion and lenders turned to wholesale funding lines overseas which were more expensive in what remains a low interest rate environment. Bank executives spoken to by the report’s authors said the more expensive wholesale funding will be compounded by increased lending restrictions and capital requirements imposed on the big four Australian-owned banks’ parents, which will see them “return billions of dollars in funding to their Australian parents over the next few years”. That’s expected to “slow lending growth in the upcoming year,” the report said. This week ASB Bank chief executive Barbara Chapman noted the narrowing margins when the lender reported a 6 percent increase in first-half profit, saying deposits weren’t keeping pace with credit growth. Just three banks were able to widen their margins in 2016, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (New Zealand), which its margin by seven basis points to 0.89 percent, and the New Zealand branches of JP Morgan Chase Bank, which increased it by eight basis points to 0.85 percent, and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp, which eked out a three basis point gain to 1.85 percent. NZX-listed Heartland Bank retained the widest margin at 4.79 percent, down from 4.89 percent a year earlier. In 2015, New Zealand’s lenders reaped their biggest margins in nine years in a period of strong lending growth, primarily in the residential and agricultural sectors. Since then banks have become more wary about the rural sector after a slump in dairy prices meant many farms faced another year operating at a loss, although dairy prices have since recovered somewhat. At the same time, the property market has slowed down after the Reserve Bank imposed new curbs to cool investor demand, which was seen driving up prices at an unsustainable pace, taking advantage of a housing shortage during a time of rapid population growth. The lenders themselves adopted tougher criteria, and ANZ Bank New Zealand chief executive David Hisco went as far as writing an op-ed piece in the New Zealand Herald newspaper last July warning property prices were overcooked. The banks’ executive said they faced a “tough predicament” in the public eye over interest rates when the Reserve Bank lowered the official cash rate last year, as “they were unable to reduce deposit rates due to a decline in the volume of deposits because of already low rates, and at the same time they could not reduce home loan rates any further as they were already under margin pressure and starting to hit ROE (return on equity) and ROI (return on investment) limits.” (BusinessDesk) ends Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url Trackback-URL  Print This Post comments feed for this post Tweet   No comments yet.

"As long as we stay focused on that, the market is going to continue to go higher." The president continued to tout his economic agenda in a meeting with retail CEOs Wednesday. He said the administration remains "focused on the issues that will bring economic growth. That's what we're all about." The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) traded about two thirds of a percent higher. However, shares of H&R Block hit a session low after Trump said the company probably wouldn't like his tax reform plan. Shares recovered to trade about 0.7 percent lower. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent, and the Nasdaq added 0.64 percent. "We're halfway through the first quarter, and ... people have to chase performance," said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. "At the end of the day, the sentiment is you're going to get some tax reform and some infrastructure policy," he said. Stocks had closed at record highs again on Tuesday, lifted by the financials sector, which received a lift from higher interest rates. The major U.S. stock indexes had traded mostly sideways this year, until Trump said last week the administration will be releasing a "phenomenal" tax plan in the next two-to-three weeks. "I think what may have started off as short covering, then a short squeeze, has brought in some money off the sidelines into the more cyclical areas of the market," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. The financials sector is up more than 22 percent since the election as the top performer in the S&P 500. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) traded more than half a percent higher Wednesday at an all-time high. The initial pop in equities following Trump's election was mostly spurred by hopes of infrastructure spending, deregulation and lower corporate taxes. But the transition into Trump's presidency has been bumpy. On Monday, Trump's National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned from his post after days of speculation about his status within the administration and intense scrutiny into his discussions about Russia prior to Trump's inauguration. "The market has been surprisingly generous to Trump," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "If we learn that Trump did something unethical ahead of the election, then that would have some impact. But barring something of that magnitude, I think the market will continue to shrug off those issues." In economic news, the consumer price index (CPI) rose a more-than-expected 0.6 percent in January, the largest monthly gain since February 2013. In the 12 months through January, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since March 2012. After the inflation report, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan economists increased their expectations for a rate hike as soon as March or May. U.S. Treasury yields spiked following data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.5 percent, while the shorter-term two-year note yield briefly climbed to 1.26 percent. The U.S. dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.059 and the yen around 114.2. Retail sales also beat expectations, with the headline number showing a 0.4 percent rise for January after an upwardly revised 1 percent gain in December. The so-called core retail sales, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, posted a 0.4 percent rise. "You can see that the picture is changing as inflation has picked up over in China and this is having a more prominent impact over in the U.S.," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, in a note. "The U.S. retail sales data was hot and it tells us how much investors are willing to dig deep into their pockets and how confident they are in their spending attitude." Other data released include business inventories for December, which rose 0.4 percent, and the February read on U.S. home builder sentiment, which showed a decline. "This market, for a long time, was hungry for a growth story," said Jim Davis, regional investment manager for The Private Client Group of U.S. Bank. "Every time we get a number supporting that, more people jump on the bandwagon." Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified in front of Congress for the second straight day. On Tuesday, she said it would be "unwise" for the U.S. central bank to wait too long to raise interest rates, lifting market expectations for a March rate hike. "Our view is the over/under on rate hikes for this year is at two. But the data continue to come in stronger," said Michael Collins, senior investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income. "I think it gives the Fed more room to act how they've communicated." "But there are still a lot of risks in the global economy, and in the U.S. there is some policy risk," he said. Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.59 percent to $1,232.60 per ounce. U.S. crude futures for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to $53.10 per barrel.  U.S. crude oil futures for March delivery settled down 9 cents at $53.11 a barrel.

The economy's strengthening outlook was also bolstered by other data on Wednesday showing manufacturing and mining production rising last month as the drag from lower oil prices fades. The reports came as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appeared to put a March interest rate hike on the table. "All things consumer show the economy is starting the year off with a bang," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "Interest rates are too low and with an economy this strong rates need to be put on a preset course higher." The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month, buoyed by purchases of electronics and appliances. Households also spent more on dining out, sporting goods and hobbies. December's sales were revised up to show a 1.0 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent advance. Sales rose despite motor vehicle purchases posting their biggest drop in 10 months. Compared to January last year retail sales were up 5.6 percent. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent after a similar gain in December. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales ticking up 0.1 percent and core sales gaining 0.3 percent last month. In the wake of the data financial markets were pricing in a 27 percent chance of an interest rate hike at the Fed's March 14-15 policy meeting, up from 18 percent late on Tuesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch programme. The dollar briefly rose to a one-month high versus a basket of currencies on the data, before surrendering gains to trade marginally lower. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell, while Wall Street extended its record-setting run for a fifth day. In a separate report, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index jumped 0.6 percent last month as households paid more for gasoline, new motor vehicles, airline fares and clothing. It was the largest increase since February 2013 and followed a 0.3 percent gain in December. In the 12 months through January, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since March 2012. The CPI rose 2.1 percent in the year to December. Inflation is trending higher as prices for energy goods and other commodities rebound in response to a pick-up in global demand. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in December. That lifted the year-on-year core CPI increase to 2.3 percent in January from December's 2.2 percent rise. The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.7 percent. Strengthening domestic demand together with firming inflation and a tightening labour market could allow the Fed to raise interest rates at least twice this year. Testifying before lawmakers on Wednesday, Yellen reiterated that it would be "unwise" for the U.S. central bank to wait too long to raise interest rates. HAWKISH RHETORIC The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year. The Fed hiked its overnight interest rate last December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. Despite January's strong inflation and retail sales reports, many economists only expect two rate hikes in 2017. "Recent rhetoric from Fed officials has turned marginally more hawkish lately. We still think March is too early for them to hike, particularly given their propensity to prepare markets for a move," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "We continue to look for two hikes this year." A third report from the Fed showed manufacturing production increased 0.2 percent in January after a similar rise in December. Output at mines shot up 2.8 percent, with oil and gas well drilling increasing further. While the reports on Wednesday suggested the economy regained momentum early in the first quarter, rising inflation means households have less spending power. Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0.5 percent in January and were unchanged from a year ago. "This is not the best thing in the world for lower income households living paycheck-to-paycheck," said Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. Still, Christopher said an improving labour market would support relatively robust consumer spending. "Household finances are in good shape, thanks to gains in both home prices and stock prices, along with debt deleveraging," he added.

"This is not the best thing in the world for lower income households living paycheck-to-paycheck," said Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. Still, Christopher said an improving labour market would support relatively robust consumer spending. "Household finances are in good shape, thanks to gains in both home prices and stock prices, along with debt deleveraging," he added.

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 U.S. retail sales rise; inflation posts largest gain in four years By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in January and consumer prices recorded their biggest gain in nearly four years, boosting prospects of an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve next month. The economy's strengthening outlook was also bolstered by other data on Wednesday showing manufacturing and mining production rising last month as the drag from lower oil prices fades. The reports came as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appeared to put a March interest rate hike on the table. "All things consumer show the economy is starting the year off with a bang," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "Interest rates are too low and with an economy this strong rates need to be put on a preset course higher." The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month, buoyed by purchases of electronics and appliances. Households also spent more on dining out, sporting goods and hobbies. December's sales were revised up to show a 1.0 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent advance. Sales rose despite motor vehicle purchases posting their biggest drop in 10 months. Compared to January last year retail sales were up 5.6 percent. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent after a similar gain in December. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales ticking up 0.1 percent and core sales gaining 0.3 percent last month. In the wake of the data financial markets were pricing in a 27 percent chance of an interest rate hike at the Fed's March 14-15 policy meeting, up from 18 percent late on Tuesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch programme. The dollar briefly rose to a one-month high versus a basket of currencies on the data, before surrendering gains to trade marginally lower. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell, while Wall Street extended its record-setting run for a fifth day. In a separate report, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index jumped 0.6 percent last month as households paid more for gasoline, new motor vehicles, airline fares and clothing. It was the largest increase since February 2013 and followed a 0.3 percent gain in December. In the 12 months through January, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since March 2012. The CPI rose 2.1 percent in the year to December. Inflation is trending higher as prices for energy goods and other commodities rebound in response to a pick-up in global demand. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in December. That lifted the year-on-year core CPI increase to 2.3 percent in January from December's 2.2 percent rise. The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.7 percent. Strengthening domestic demand together with firming inflation and a tightening labour market could allow the Fed to raise interest rates at least twice this year. Testifying before lawmakers on Wednesday, Yellen reiterated that it would be "unwise" for the U.S. central bank to wait too long to raise interest rates. HAWKISH RHETORIC The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year. The Fed hiked its overnight interest rate last December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. Despite January's strong inflation and retail sales reports, many economists only expect two rate hikes in 2017. "Recent rhetoric from Fed officials has turned marginally more hawkish lately. We still think March is too early for them to hike, particularly given their propensity to prepare markets for a move," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "We continue to look for two hikes this year." A third report from the Fed showed manufacturing production increased 0.2 percent in January after a similar rise in December. Output at mines shot up 2.8 percent, with oil and gas well drilling increasing further. While the reports on Wednesday suggested the economy regained momentum early in the first quarter, rising inflation means households have less spending power. Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0.5 percent in January and were unchanged from a year ago. "This is not the best thing in the world for lower income households living paycheck-to-paycheck," said Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. Still, Christopher said an improving labour market would support relatively robust consumer spending. "Household finances are in good shape, thanks to gains in both home prices and stock prices, along with debt deleveraging," he added.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks jumped to record closes again on Wednesday (Feb 15) on fresh assurances that President Donald Trump intends to press ahead with tax cuts soon. For the fifth straight day, all three major US equity indices ended at all-time highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 107.45 points (0.52 per cent) to 20,611.86. The S&P 500 also rose 11.67 points (0.50 per cent) to 2,349.25, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 36.87 points (0.64 per cent) to 5,819.44. US stocks have been on a tear since last week when Trump vowed to release details of his promised tax cut plan within two to three weeks. On Wednesday, Trump told a White House meeting of retailers he would release specifics on the plan in the "not-too-distant future," and it will be "good and simpler." "It feels like investors might get the pro-growth part of the platform," Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich said, adding that questions about Trump's connections to Russia so far are not rattling investors. Analysts also said January data showing higher consumer inflation and retail sales helped to boost stocks. Sectors with strong gains included financials, with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo all winning more than one per cent. Pharmaceuticals also outperformed: Pfizer gained 2.3 per cent, Gilead Sciences 3.3 per cent and Mylan 4.2 per cent. P&G jumped 3.7 per cent on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management led by Nelson Peltz holds 6.4 million shares worth US$575 million in the consumer products giant, according to a securities filing. Some news reports said Trian has added to the stake since the filing deadline and now holds more than US$3 billion in shares. Trian is known for pushing companies to reorganise businesses and return funds to shareholders. Insurer American International Group slumped 9.0 per cent after reporting a US$3 billion loss in the fourth quarter. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

For his bar mitzvah — the ceremony that welcomes 13-year-old Jewish boys into adulthood — Bloch received $7,000 in cash. It was 1998 and, like so many amateur traders at the time, he plunged his wealth into the stock market, mostly software and telecommunication names like Lucent and Nortel. He quickly tripled his money. By age 15, it was all gone. "This knocked me over the head and left a burning curiosity that I still carry today," said Bloch, now 31, from the San Francisco headquarters of his financial-tech start-up Digit. "I realized I didn't know s--- about how any of this was working." Now Bloch is playing into another trend that's taking over Silicon Valley: Machine learning. Using the combination of massive data sets, exploding compute capacity in the cloud and a host of analytics tools, entrepreneurs are training computers to make increasingly sophisticated decisions. Eventually, the experts say, we'll land at true artificial intelligence, where computers are smart enough to train computers. And it's going to upend the traditional banking industry. Helping consumers with their finances It's hardly a straight line from the dot-bomb blunder to Bloch's new gig developing an automated savings tool for millennials. But Bloch says he's been obsessed with finance for almost two decades, even while running his first software start-up Flowtown, a social media marketing platform. Bloch sold Flowdown to Demandforce for a few million bucks in 2011. The following year, having banked enough cash to follow his passion, Bloch set out on a mission to improve consumers' financial health. The tagline on his website is, "Save money, without thinking about it." The company is initially targeting younger consumers, who've grown up in an era dominated by smartphones and a loathing for brick-and-mortar banks. show chapters These five industries are being revolutionized by AI    14 Hours Ago | 02:23 Digit's software plugs into a user's checking account, analyzing expenses and income and determining how much money could be stashed away without the customer feeling it. Based on the personalized algorithm, Digit puts a few bucks or so a week into a savings account, notifying users with a simple text to help them pay off college or credit card debt or prepare for a wedding. It also serves up reminders to eliminate late fees and recently launched a notification bot on Facebook Messenger. Digit says that it's saved more than $350 million for its customers. That includes people like Jenn Chen, a former community manager at a San Francisco software company who's now in between jobs. Chen has saved close to $16,000 over the past three years using Digit, money that would have otherwise remained in her checking account and more than likely have been spent. "It started off small and as time went by, I started seeing different ways I could increase that amount and be OK," she said. The savings were of particular importance after a hit-and-run accident left her with a hefty out-of-pocket payment for hospital bills. The changing workforce According to Goldman Sachs, machine learning and AI will enable $34 billion to $43 billion in annual "cost savings and new revenue opportunities" within the financial sector by 2025, as institutions use technological advancements to maximize trading opportunities, reduce credit risk and lower compliance and regulatory costs. What that means for the labor force is a complicated equation. The banking sector contracted dramatically during last decade's financial crisis, with the failure of large institutions like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual and mass layoffs elsewhere. Three of the four largest U.S. banks — Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America — have fewer employees than they did in 2008. Jobs most in jeopardy from here are those that lend themselves to automation. Bank tellers will see an 8 percent decline between 2014 and 2024, and the number of insurance underwriters will drop by 11 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. On the flip side, financial firms are hiring software developers and data scientists, areas of employment growth. Arvind Purushotham, a managing director at Citigroup's venture investing arm, is backing start-ups in fraud detection and security whose technology can potentially be applied internally at the banking giant. While there's a shift in the skills required to meet the financial challenges of the future, the problems are still being solved by people. "We think of human-assisted AI and AI-assisted humans," said Purushotham, "There are some things that humans can do that software programs can't hope to catch up to in decades." Expanding the lending pool The problem Douglas Merrill is trying to tackle will require sophisticated machines. Merill, who spent five years as Google's chief information officer, is the founder and CEO of ZestFinance, a Los Angeles-based start-up that's out to end the predatory system of payday lending by building algorithms that can underwrite people with little to no credit history. (He's among a handful of ex-Googlers applying computer science to finance. Consumer lender Upstart was created by former Google executives and is led by Dave Girouard, who previously ran Google's enterprise business. PeerStreet, a marketplace that matches real estate with investors, was co-founded by Brett Crosby, a former product marketing director at Google.) Merrill, who has a Ph.D in cognitive science from Princeton University, lives and breathes this stuff. From his vantage point, true machine learning is almost entirely absent from the lending industry despite a rapid acceleration over the past half-decade in online banking and underwriting. Consumer lenders like LendingClub, Prosper and SoFi have built substantial Web-based businesses using technology, but they're still targeting borrowers with good, if not pristine, credit. Source: ZestFinance ZestFinance CEO Douglas Merrill. That approach does nothing for Americans who struggle to make ends meet and rely on cash advances from one of the country's 20,000 payday lenders that populate mostly low-income areas. ZestFinance is looking for non-traditional data — information that can't be found in credit files — to determine the types of behavior that can help predict whether someone will repay debt. It turns out that a prospective borrower who fills out an application in all capital letters is a greater-than-average credit risk. While mounds of data exist that would help in developing new credit models, much of it sits in places that are very difficult to reach. For example, finding out if a bank account is open can be "super challenging," Merrill said. "I didn't foresee how hard would be to get access to a large number of those third-party data streams," said Merrill, whose 100-person team includes more than 30 data science and machine learning experts. "To run a big data and machine learning shop you have to have big data and machine learning." This week, ZestFinance introduced the Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) platform, opening up the technology to any bank, credit card issuer or auto finance company. Merrill is also testing his algorithms in perhaps the world's greatest ocean of messy data: China. Through partnerships with e-retailer JD.com and Internet search provider Baidu, ZestFinance is aiming to help create a system for lending to half a billion people who lack any credit history. "Lenders in China are beginning to use these advanced techniques that analyze non-traditional variables, whether search, shopping or other data, to form the backbone of a new credit infrastructure," Merrill wrote recently in Chinese business publication Boao Review. "The credit landscape in China is about to change drastically." show chapters Goldman's top tech banker on artificial intelligence    Wednesday, 19 Oct 2016 | 11:18 AM ET | 03:22 The revolution is coming, but slowly The data suggests human lenders in the U.S. are still safe, for the time being. According to the BLS, the number of loan officers will increase 8 percent annually through 2014. Since the election of Donald Trump, bank stocks have rallied as investors wager that a Republican-controlled government will ease regulations on big financial firms just as rising rates will help boost earnings. Shares of Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America have each jumped more than 20 percent since Trump declared victory on Nov. 9. But as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wrote in his letter to shareholders in 2015, "Silicon Valley is coming." Here's one reason. Adyen, a 500-person payments start-up with offices in Amsterdam, San Francisco and 10 other cities, generates more than $1 million in revenue per employee. That looks more like Google than JPMorgan, which is around $400,000 per employee. Over the last two years, Adyen has been staffing up on data scientists to develop systems for preventing fraud. Adyen's customers range from Airbnb, Netflix and Spotify to easyJet and NH Hotels. When consumers sign up or make purchases on those apps, Adyen's software gets to work determining how much it can trust the buyer and whether another form of authentication is needed. It's a tricky formula. Asking for more information, be it the answer to a secret question or a code that's sent to a mobile phone, makes it more likely the consumer will drop off without completing the transaction. Minimizing fraud while maximizing so-called conversions is the goal, and it requires a personalized experience. Adyen's engine analyzes the shopper to figure out in real time if it's a regular customer and if the device, e-mail address and account information are familiar. A trusted buyer can go right through, but any red flags may mean more information is needed. Adyen Sam Halse, Adyen's chief operating officer, said clients see a 1.4 percent increase in revenue using the software. "That's a huge number on the bottom line, which was in the past simply lost revenue," Halse said. For Adyen, the algorithm keeps getting smarter, learning more about individual shoppers and broadly how fraudsters behave. Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at London-based venture firm Balderton Capital, said artificial intelligence in finance represents the next stage of human capital replacement. The first big one was the automatic-teller machine. Then came internet and mobile banking. Now, it's what Chandratillake calls "pseudo white-collar jobs," where machines are being trained to recognize patterns on forms like mortgage applications and insurance claims and to act with better accuracy in less time than people. "These are jobs that require human judgment but that are very repetitive," said Chandratillake. "To crack these you need a smart AI founder and team but you also need someone who has expertise in some weird niche like this and can see how to exploit it."

Banks likely to scale bank lending growth as margins squeezed Paul McBeth Thursday February 16, 2017 4 Share ASB chief executive Barbara Chapman Play NBR radio on Banks profit margins have been hit and have fallen 6.5% across the sector. The banks are likely to wind back the pace of new lending this year as the margin squeeze caused by higher capital requirements for the big four Australian-owned institutions and greater use of more expensive wholesale funding weighed on their profits. The country's licensed lenders grew their loan books at the fastest pace in eight years in 2016, with $393.6 billion of loans and advances at the end of December from $364 billion a year earlier, according to KPMG's financial institutions' performance survey. Still, skinnier net interest margins of 2.18% compared with 2.28% a year earlier, meant net profit fell 6.5% to $4.84 billion across the sector. While customer deposits rose 8.1% to $287.5 billion, it wasn't big enough to fund the credit expansion and lenders turned to wholesale funding lines overseas which were more expensive in what remains a low-interest rate environment. Bank executives spoken to by the report's authors say the more expensive wholesale funding will be compounded by increased lending restrictions and capital requirements imposed on the banks' parents, which will see the local institutions "return billions of dollars in funding to their Australian parents over the next few years". That's expected to "slow lending growth in the upcoming year," the report says. This week ASB Bank chief executive Barbara Chapman noted the narrowing margins when the lender reported a 6 % increase in first-half profit, saying deposits weren't keeping pace with credit growth. Just three banks were able to widen their margins in 2016, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (New Zealand), which increased its margin by seven basis points to 0.89% and the New Zealand branches of JP Morgan Chase Bank, which increased it by eight basis points to 0.85%, and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp, which eked out a three basis point gain to 1.85%. NZX-listed Heartland Bank retained the widest margin at 4.79%, down from 4.89% a year earlier. In 2015, New Zealand's lenders reaped their biggest margins in nine years in a period of strong lending growth, primarily in the residential and agricultural sectors. Since then banks have become more wary about the rural sector after a slump in dairy prices meant many farms faced another year of operating at a loss, although dairy prices have since recovered somewhat. At the same time, the property market has slowed down after the Reserve Bank imposed new curbs to cool investor demand, which was seen to be driving up prices at an unsustainable pace, taking advantage of a housing shortage during a time of rapid population growth. The lenders themselves adopted tougher criteria, and ANZ Bank New Zealand chief executive David Hisco went as far as writing an op-ed piece in the New Zealand Herald newspaper last July warning property prices were overcooked. The banks' executive said they faced a "tough predicament" in the public eye over interest rates when the Reserve Bank lowered the official cash rate last year, as "they were unable to reduce deposit rates due to a decline in the volume of deposits because of already low rates, and at the same time they could not reduce home loan rates any further as they were already under margin pressure and starting to hit ROE (return on equity) and ROI (return on investment) limits."

News RELATED STORIES Qatar equity market has broken out of technical downtrend: Credit Suisse RBA keeps rates unchanged Credit Suisse nearing Swiss bank spin-off with new unit As lira falls, Turkey’s central bank takes rare pause in rate cuts Credit Suisse plans Mideast growth as millionaires rise A tram passes the illuminated headquarters of Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. Credit Suisse plans to cut as many as 6,500 jobs this year and is keeping its options open as it prepares for a partial sale of its Swiss unit to strengthen capital. Text Size: A A A Bloomberg/Zurich Credit Suisse Group plans to cut as many as 6,500 jobs this year and is keeping its options open as it prepares for a partial sale of its Swiss unit to strengthen capital. The share sale “is a very good option, it’s on the table,” Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “But of course, as you would expect, it’s what we’re paid for, we look at other options as well, continuously.” The Swiss bank is stepping up cost cuts after a charge to settle a US investigation into the role of its mortgage securities business in the 2008 financial crisis led to a fourth-quarter loss of 2.35bn francs ($2.34bn). While the $5.3bn settlement dented the bank’s capital buffers, the damage was less severe than some analysts expected. Credit Suisse doesn’t need the initial public offering, according to Peter Casanova, a Zurich-based analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux who rates the stock buy. Thiam said the bank “will decide in the best interest of shareholders and that’s a hint he may not do it,” Casanova said. “It’s not in the interest of shareholders to sell the bank’s crown jewel.” Credit Suisse reported a common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, of 11.6% at the end of December, down from 12% at the end of September. The bank is targeting 13% by the end of 2018. Cost-cutting is ahead of schedule and an improved market sentiment for banks that boosted trading in the fourth quarter has continued this year, Thiam said in the interview. The bank eliminated 7,250 jobs last year, surpassing its target of 6,000 cuts for 2016, Chief Financial Officer David Mathers told reporters. The bank employs about 47,000. Thiam had said he was accelerating cost cuts when he updated investors on his turnaround plan in December. But he declined to give a target for job cuts at the time, except to say that the downsizing of the global markets unit, where most of last year’s cuts occurred, was largely completed. The CEO has long described the plan to raise 2bn francs to 4bn francs through a sale of 20% to 30% of the Swiss business as a cornerstone of his strategy to reshape the company to focus on wealth management. On a conference call with analysts Tuesday, he repeatedly referred to it as merely a “backstop.” “It’s not convincing that the IPO would have achieved any great benefit to the capital position of the bank,” said Ray Soudah, founder of Millenium Associates, a corporate finance advisory firm in Zurich. “They’ve now realised this and the IPO is unlikely to happen. There’s no merit to doing it, especially after the recent recovery in the share price.” The shortfall in fourth-quarter profit reflected a charge to settle with the US Justice Department. Thiam said the bank expects to pay only $2.55bn of the $5.3bn settlement. The agreement calls for $2.8bn in consumer relief for which the bank has set aside about $70mn, he told analysts. The settlement is a “game-changer” that “leaves us in a more comfortable position to look today at our capital planning,” Thiam said in the Bloomberg interview. Credit Suisse’s “capital ratio is much better than expected by 50 basis points, and the January outlook statement shall be seen as a strong start,” Kian Abouhossein, an analyst with JPMorgan, said in a note. “What we think Credit Suisse needs to illustrate now is that it can generate ongoing profit and book value growth to deserve a re-rating.” Like other big European lenders, Credit Suisse is reining in spending under pressure from low interest rates and rules requiring banks to hold more reserves. The bank is targeting an operating cost base of less than 17bn Swiss francs by 2018, down from an earlier goal of below 18bn francs. Restructuring costs amounted to 49mn francs, as Credit Suisse cut about 1,800 jobs during the quarter. That brought the total for the year to 540mn francs, below the bank’s guidance of about 600mn. The bank said in December the cost would remain about the same this year. The Swiss universal bank delivered the largest contribution to the bank’s pretax profit in the fourth quarter, with a pretax profit of 382mn francs. “The preparation for the IPO continues, however Credit Suisse stated that it will continue to assess the evolving regulatory environment to identify the best options for shareholders,” Jernej Omahen, an analyst at Goldman Sachs with a buy rating on the bank, said in a note to clients. “It is unclear to us what the possible alternatives to the IPO could be, but the market will no doubt focus on this in the immediate future.” 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

(Bloomberg) The Competition Commission said it plans to prosecute more than a dozen international and local banks for alleged collusion in foreign currency trading. The commission, which has been investigating a case of price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand, has referred the case for prosecution, it said on Wednesday. The lenders included Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit, JPMorgan Chase & Co, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group, HSBC Holdings and Nomura Holdings. The commission said that, from at least 2007, banks had an agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving the dollar and rand currency pairing. — Bloomberg.   BNP Paribas Read More Contravention and collusion - issues the commission deals with on a daily basis Steep fines fail to deter collusion Maharaj dismisses alleged involvement in spy tape collusion Climate change: The secrets of our collusion Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Ramaphosa, Zuma cold war hits freezing point National | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 National | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 Editorial: Zuma’s fears erode democracy Editorials | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 Editorials | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 A not-so-proudly South African link to Trump's inner circle Opinion | 2017-02-08 11:08:00 Opinion | 2017-02-08 11:08:00 OkMalumKoolKat: The case of an escape artist Music | 2017-01-30 00:00:00 Music | 2017-01-30 00:00:00 ANC plans 'constitutional revolution' on land Politics | 2017-02-03 00:00:00 Politics | 2017-02-03 00:00:00 Most Read Client Media Releases Press OfficesAfroCentric HealthBarloworld LogisticsBoston City CampusCIO Council of South AfricaContinuitySACorporate TravellerDefencewebFaculty Training InstituteFCm Travel SolutionsFedGroup Financial ServicesFutureSenseGIBSHollardImperial LogisticsInternet SolutionsIpsosiStoreITWebJag MethodLime CapitalLottery ResultsKhulumani Support GroupMail and GuardianMandela Bay DevelopmentMiWayMiX TelematicsMessageLOUDMitelMTNNihilent TechnologiesNorth West UniversityOxbridge AcademyPragmaRosebank CollegeSANRALSAS InstituteSAP AfricaSentechSoarsoft InternationalTeraco Data EnvironmentsThe Innovation HubTiger BrandsVaal University of Technology North West University NRF recognises NWU professor's research Barloworld Logistics Paving the road ahead for young entrepreneurs Soarsoft International Lunch & Learn with Soarsoft International and iManage SANRAL SANRAL welcomes ConCourt judgment on N1/N2 Winelands iStore Introducing iStore Makers: the evolution of iPhoneography Want to publish your media releases here?

The Competition Commission identified lenders including  Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC Holdings Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. as having participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since at least 2007. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal, concluding an investigation that began in 2015. Banking stocks traded in Johannesburg fell for the first day in six to head for their biggest decline in a week. The outcome of the probe comes as President Jacob Zuma and his governing African National Congress step up pressure to break the dominance of South Africa’s four largest lenders. Zuma and the banks are locked in a stand-off after the lenders closed the accounts of companies tied to his friends, the Guptas. He has accused banks of not doing enough to improve access to the economy that still eludes many of the country’s black majority almost 23 years since the end of apartheid. “The timing for banks couldn’t be worse,” said Adrian Saville, the chief strategist at Citadel Investment Services & Cannon Asset Managers. “They’ve been trying to capture the moral high ground on the Gupta issue. It comes at a time when they’re trying to demonstrate impeccable behavior. It makes a case for intervention.” Fictitious Bids The action by South African authorities also follows the sentencing by a U.S. federal judge in January of Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, JPMorgan and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, which all pleaded guilty in May 2015 to rigging currency rates. As part of an overall $5.8 billion settlement with multiple regulators, they agreed to pay about $2.5 billion to the Justice Department. South Africa’s central bank said the Competition Commission’s investigation related mainly to the rand-dollar in offshore markets. “The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the Pretoria, South Africa-based commission said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email.

Some 30 percent of daily turnover in the rand takes place in South Africa, of which foreigners account for 58 percent. In April 2016, the daily average worldwide foreign-exchange trading involving the rand was about $49 billion, it said, citing Bank for International Settlements data, representing 1 percent of total turnover. Bad Reputation “Collusive practices must lead to consequences such as termination of the services of key management, executive and non-executive directors.,” said Asief Mohamed, chief investment officer at Cape Town-based Aeon Investment Management. “The banks, if guilty, will most likely be fined and this will have a negative impact on earnings and reputation. ” Bank of America, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered Plc, Commerzbank AG, Macquarie Group Ltd., Australia & New Zealand Banking Corp., Standard Bank Group Ltd., HSBC and BNP declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Investec Plc said it would cooperate with authorities, but was unable to comment further because it didn’t have details of their investigations.  Barclays Africa Group Ltd. also said it would cooperate with the authorities, while noting that the regulator had not sought penalties against it. Credit Suisse said it is looking into the matter. Stocks Fall Standard Bank led banking shares in Johannesburg lower on Thursday, falling 1 percent by 11:15 a.m. in the city. Nedbank Group Ltd. and FirstRand Ltd., which aren’t named in the probe, dropped 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, while Barclays Africa declined 0.6 percent. “The profit-driven assault on the South African rand through such collusion and corruption by the banks flies in the face of efforts” to ensure prosperity for everyone in the country, the ANC said in a statement. “It is further an indication of how the markets are and can be manipulated by dominant oligopolies to cripple its functioning to suit their nefarious agenda.” The tribunal will now notify the banks of the complaint and ask them to respond, Chantelle Benjamin, a spokesman for the body, said by phone. The banks will then file statements and attend a preliminary meeting to set a date for a full hearing, she said. The commission has previously uncovered collusion in the country’s bread and flour industry, among cement producers and by construction companies that bid to build stadiums for the 2010 soccer World Cup. Those involved were forced to pay hefty fines.  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed to a record high on optimism President Donald Trump’s administration will spur trading and dealmaking, slash corporate taxes and roll back costly regulations after installing the firm’s executives in top government posts. The shares rose 1.3 percent to $249.46 at 4 p.m. in New York, passing a record close set in late 2007, just before the industry plunged into a crisis that almost brought down the global financial system. Goldman’s stock recovered much of its loss in the years after that turmoil, and since Trump’s election has soared 37 percent, leading the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher. Investors are betting big U.S. banks can generate larger profits and pay out more to shareholders if Trump sidelines the industry’s sharpest critics, dismantles post-crisis rules and pursues policies that spur inflation and lift long-term interest rates. While Trump repeatedly attacked Goldman Sachs’s government influence during his campaign, the New York-based firm is now positioned to have its market philosophies expressed in policy in coming years. In December, Trump enlisted the investment bank’s then-president, Gary Cohn, to serve as the White House’s top economic adviser. On Monday, the Senate confirmed former Goldman partner Steven Mnuchin as U.S. Treasury secretary. Dina Powell, who ran the firm’s philanthropic arm, was named an assistant to the president, and Jim Donovan, a wealth manager, might also join the administration. Steve Bannon, who left the bank more than two decades ago, is Trump’s chief strategist. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 28 requiring appointees such as Cohn to recuse themselves from decisions “directly and substantially related” to their former employers for two years. Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin called on Cohn this month to also withdraw from matters that may have “a significant indirect impact on Goldman” for as long as he serves in the administration. The Dow has climbed 12 percent since the Nov. 8 election, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. the second-best performer behind Goldman. The broader S&P 500 has gained 9.3 percent, with financial firms, oil drillers, rail and freight companies and airlines among those advancing. Apple Inc. shares reached a record this week on optimism the next iPhone will drive a resurgence in sales. Trump’s election already set off a flurry of market trading, boosting banks’ profits in the final months of 2016 as customers rushed to reposition their portfolios, generating fees. Such activity may remain elevated as the new president crafts policies and pushes companies to change practices, sometimes taking to Twitter. Goldman Sachs’s profits in recent years are still short of pre-crisis levels. Net income amounted to $7.4 billion in 2016, about 22 percent less than in 2006. Its revenue of $30.6 billion last year was about 19 percent lower. The firm expressed some concern this month about Trump’s ability to quickly jump-start growth. Chief economist Jan Hatzius and economist Jari Stehn wrote that they anticipate a delayed boost from increased government spending because legislation probably won’t pass until late 2017 or early 2018. “The more adverse parts” of Trump’s agenda remain substantial, they said. © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.
