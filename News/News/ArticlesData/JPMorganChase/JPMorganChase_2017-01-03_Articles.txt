 JPMorgan Chase is about to slash the 100,000-point sign-up bonus for the most ballyhooed credit card of 2016 Tanza Loudenback Jan. 4, 2017, 12:19 PM 48,377 facebook linkedin twitter email print Time is running out on the Chase Sapphire Reserve's enormous sign-up bonus. JPMorgan Chase Last summer, JPMorgan Chase revealed its newest rewards card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve. It came complete with a $450 annual fee and a bevy of benefits, including an unheard-of 100,000-point sign-up bonus worth about $1,500 in travel credit. That sign-up bonus will be slashed in half for online applicants after January 11, according to The Points Guy. The Reserve's debut made waves among consumers. A spokeswoman for Chase previously told The New York Times that the card was an unexpected hit, especially among millennials, even before the bank spent a dime on advertising. But the card's generous benefits were perhaps too big of a hit. By December, JPMorgan Chase said it expected an earnings dip in the fourth quarter to the tune of $200 million to $300 million as a result of the card's popularity, according to CEO Jamie Dimon. The Reserve's sign-up bonus will soon match that of the Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card: If you spend $4,000 in the first three months, you'll receive 50,000 bonus points worth about $625, which is still a lucrative offer. The card will also maintain its steep annual fee, though cardholders receive a $300 travel credit reimbursement awarded each calendar year, effectively reducing the card's annual fee to $150. And the card's extensive benefits will still include: 1 point earned for every $1 spent 2 additional points earned for every $1 spent on travel (includes airfare, hotels, Airbnbs, taxis, Ubers, etc.) 2 additional points earned for every $1 spent on dining (includes Seamless, bars, cafés, restaurants, etc.) Beyond the points, the Reserve offers some perks that are truly unparalleled, including a suite of "elite travel benefits": $100 application-fee credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck Transfer points 1:1 to frequent flyer and hotel loyalty partners Access to over 900 VIP airport lounges worldwide No foreign transaction fees Special benefits during a stay at Chase's Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection (including room upgrades, free breakfast, and early or late check-in/check-out) If you miss the January 11 cutoff but still want to cash in on one of the most eye-popping credit card offers in recent memory, you can still get the original 100,000 sign-up bonus points until March 12 by applying at a physical JPMorgan Chase bank branch, according to The Times.

Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:30pm on 4 Jan 2017 That's it for today - thanks for reading and posting your comments. We'll be back tomorrow from 9am. 4:29pm on 4 Jan 2017 Investors lost some of their new year exuberance sending the ASX only marginally higher, as gains in financials and Telstra offset losses in the energy and utilities sectors.  The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each closed up 0.06 per cent to 5736.4 points and 5788.2 points respectively.  Investors are turning wary of the recent record highs attained on Wall Street and the buoyant ASX, which hit a 2016 high just before Christmas, as the inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States looms.  "Markets have been rallying quite strongly on this notion of fiscal hope but, as we move into the reality of 2017 and what a Trump presidency will actually look like, there is some risk of fiscal disappointment," said Paul Eitelman, strategist at Russell Investments. "Any disappointment at this point could be a source of downside risk for markets from here, so we're incrementally being a bit more cautious." A slight tumble in the iron ore price weighed on Rio Tinto, which closed down 0.9 per cent, while BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals found buying support, closing up 0.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively.  There was broad based buying in the big four banks, which all closed up between 0.5 and 0.9 per cent. Investors also piled into Telstra, boosting the stock 0.4 per cent.  Gold was trading marginally higher but a strong finish on Tuesday night was enough to prompt some buying support for the likes of Newcest Mining, Australia's largest gold producer, which closed up 0.8 per cent and Evolution Mining, which bumped up 1.4 per cent. 4:04pm on 4 Jan 2017 Banks hiking mortgage interest rates out of cycle and failing to pass on official rate cuts are expected to dampen demand for housing this year, according to a new report. The REA Group Property Demand Index shows demand for housing on the company's realestate.com.au website peaked last year in October and November, before slipping by 6.6 per cent in December. REA Group chief economist Nerida Conisbee said the fall in demand at the end of the year is likely due to banks hiking rates in late November and early December. She said demand could track lower given that lenders have indicated they won't pass possible Reserve Bank rate cuts onto borrowers. "We expect out-of-cycle interest rate rises by banks to continue," Conisbee said. "This will be a key issue for borrowers this year, especially first home buyers and investors, with access to cheap money becoming more difficult." Out-of-cycle rate hikes are set to continue, says REA Group. Photo: Karl Hilzinger 3:38pm on 4 Jan 2017 Underneath the blistering outperformance of iron ore and coking coal during 2016, some lesser-known commodities also staged handsome price rises. Zinc was one of the best performers, surging 75 per cent year-on-year thanks to tightening supply, while uranium was one of the few base metals to close the year lower than where it started. Agricultural commodities, such as pork, jumped 22 per cent in December after five months of steep declines, with palm oil hitting a four-year high after a 9 per cent gain in December thanks to supply concerns out of Malaysia. "For many metals and energy products, the rally in prices has been particularly supported by a pullback in supply," said Paul Bloxham, chief economist at HSBC Australia, He noted that business investment had dried up as producers reacted to low prices. He pointed to a devastating plunge in broad-based commodity prices in early 2016 as the catalyst for some companies to put the brakes on production. "Decisions by OPEC, a pullback in investment by major energy and mining companies plus ongoing reform in China to reduce excess capacity have all contributed to the commodity price rally," Bloxham said. Zinc enjoyed a significant price hike as supply growth dwindled thanks to the closure of the Century zinc mine in Queensland in late 2015 and the Lisheen mine in Ireland. While the price has soared, Australian listed zinc plays have responded only modestly.

However, once rates start rising, pressure on household finances is due to increase, which is probably why the RBA has been sounding a bit more concerned about debt levels of late. Back to top 3:04pm on 4 Jan 2017 Bellamy's Australia is facing a fresh set of problems with a major shareholder group believed to be backed by Jan Cameron looking to spill the board and install herself along with three others as non-executive directors. The Singapore-based Black Prince Private Foundation, believed to be a holding company for Ms Cameron's interest at 14.48 per cent, is seeking to dump four non-executive directors including former Billabong CEO Launa Inman, Patria Mann, Michael Wadley and Charles Sitch. ​The foundation proposes that Kathmandu founder Jan Cameron, Chan Wai-Chan, Vaughan Webber and Black Prince representative, Rodd Peters, be appointed to the board. The request comes amid a lengthy suspension to the trading in shares of the company as it seeks to renegotiate supply agreements. However the chairman of Bellamy's, Rob Woolley, said the proposal to shake up the board is an "unwanted distraction". "If the proposals were to succeed, it would be disruptive to the company," he said. More turmoil ... Bellamy's chairman Rob Woolley is opposed to a move to force out several of its directors. Photo: Jessica Hromas 2:37pm on 4 Jan 2017 There are growing concerns that the rally in the global oil market, which has seen prices hurtle to an 18-month high, could be stalling amid doubts whether major oil producers will achieve their ambition of bringing an end to the painful supply glut that has weighed on the market for the past two years. Oil enjoyed its biggest annual gain since the financial crisis in 2016 with the price of Brent, the global benchmark, rising 52 per cent, while US crude finished the year up 45 per cent. Oil prices were lifted by hopes that the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with other oil-producing countries such as Russia, would follow through on their agreement to cut output by 1.8 million barrels a day – or almost 2 per cent of global output. But some traders are sceptical whether OPEC members will abide by the deal which hopes to end the global oil supply glut that has weighed on the market for two years and pushed the oil price to a decade low of $US26 a barrel in early 2016. Although oil prices rose in early trading overnight, boosted by local media reports that Kuwait was adhering to the OPEC deal by cutting its output by 130,000 barrels a day, oil futures finished lower. Brent crude finished down 2.4 per cent at $US55.47 a barrel. It's up 0.6 per cent at $US55.81 in Asian trade today. Reports that major oil companies are flocking to develop oil and gas reserves in Iran after the lifting of international sanctions did little to boost confidence that the OPEC deal will stick. Several media outlets in Tehran reported on Tuesday that 29 European and Asian companies – although no US groups – had been selected to participate in tenders planned for this year to develop oil and gas reserves in Iran. In addition, traders pointed out that the output cuts only begin this month and it could take several months before they cause high inventory levels to fall. Others noted that Trump's promise to boost the nation's oil and natural gas production by scrapping environmental regulations could lead to a surge in US production. Here's more at the AFR Has the oil price rally run out of puff? Photo: Matthew Brown 2:04pm on 4 Jan 2017 The Australian dollar is moving further away from a seven-month low it hit last week, aided by tighter capital controls from China. The Aussie is buying US72.33¢, after falling as low as US71.63¢ last week. Traders said there was some relief that a feared rush of capital out of China had yet to eventuate, with Beijing slapping tighter controls on foreign currency purchases over the weekend. The Aussie is often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan and had been under pressure recently on worries the yuan would come under pressure when China's individual annual quota for foreign currency purchases was reset this week. The Aussie lost 2.8 per cent in January last year when the yuan tumbled amid heavy capital outflows. "Of course these are early days, but to the extent that the news eases concerns of a possible repeat of last January's China's equity and CNY meltdown, that is good news for China and the AUD," said Rodrigo Catril, currency strategist at National Australia Bank. Still, the yuan remains under pressure, trading just below 7 per US dollar, but the falls have been more gradual over the past months, and they've been mostly shrugged off by sharemarkets as the following chart shows: This chart (of $SPX vs $USDCNY) was fun for a while... pic.twitter.com/V5Z9s5t7B9— Topdown Charts (@topdowncharts) January 4, 2017 1:41pm on 4 Jan 2017 Hunter Hall has established an independent board committee to consider a takeover bid from investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson, which Hunter Hall says is at a material discount to the company's current share price. WHSP announced on December 30 that it intends to acquire all of the shares in the ASX-listed investment manager that it does not already own, after agreeing to buy a stake of 19.9 per cent from Hunter Hall chief executive Peter Hall, who is also the largest shareholder. Hall, who controls 43.95 per cent of Hunter Hall shares, has told WHSP that he intends to accept its offer for his remaining stake of 25.05 per cent unless there is a superior offer. WHSP is offering $1.00 per Hunter Hall share, which values the target at about $27.3 million. Hunter Hall shares are down 1.2 per cent at $2.47, their third straight day of losses after the company confirmed Hall is stepping down and selling his stake. "The WHSP takeover offer of $1.00 represents a material discount to Hunter Hall's prevailing share price, being a 67.7 per cent discount to HHL's share price prior to close on 30 December, 2016," Hunter Hall said today, adding that, given the nature of the WHSP offer and Mr Hall's direct involvement, the Hunter Hall board had established an independent board committee (IBC). Hunter Hall said its shareholders need take no action at this time, and the independent board committee would provide updates when appropriate. Peter Hall's surprise stake sale and resignation as CEO and chief investment officer has shocked investors. Photo: Domino Postiglione 12:55pm on 4 Jan 2017 Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said investors are being far too sanguine about the risks associated with Donald Trump's incoming administration. The Harvard professor, a Democrat who was Treasury chief under Bill Clinton, cited the possibility of protectionist measures by the US as well as changes to foreign policy and domestic social policy as issues that are creating "extraordinary uncertainty". With just over two weeks to go before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, the S&P 500 is close to a record high, having risen almost 10 percent in 2016 on optimism over fiscal stimulus and stronger economic growth. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has struggled to close at the 20,000 level, it rose 13 percent last year. "This is probably the largest transition ideologically and in terms of substantive policy that we've seen in the US in the last three quarters of a century," Summers said. "Those kinds of transitions have to be -- given the central role of the US in the global system -- matters of enormous uncertainty. I don't think that's fully recognised by markets." Summers was also critical of a paper jointly written by economist Peter Navarro, who will lead a newly formed White House National Trade Council, and Commerce Department head Wilbur Ross. "The Navarro-Ross paper is well beyond voodoo economics," Summers said of the September report on Trump's growth plans. "The logic of it, the arguments made, are so far out of the mainstream of any kind of responsible economic thinking that they are the economic equivalent of creationism." Summers dismissed the idea that any tax policy introduced to encourage US companies to repatriate profits would boost investment and hiring. "The vast majority of the companies who have large overseas cash also have substantial amounts of domestic cash," he said. "The reality is that cash that is brought home will be used to pay dividends, to buy back shares, to engage in mergers and acquisitions, to rearrange the financial chessboard, not to invest in large amounts of new capital. It is a chimera to suppose that there will be large increases in capital investment as a consequence of that repatriation." Lawrence "Larry" Summers, former US Treasury secretary, reckons markets are underestimating the risks of a Trump presidency. Photo: Kiyoshi Ota Back to top 12:55pm on 4 Jan 2017 Australia's east coast-centric housing boom will roll on in 2017 but could become unstuck in 2018, according to SQM Research founder Louis Christopher, arguably the country's most accurate forecaster. Christopher expects capital city house prices to rise between 6 and 10 per cent this year, led by double-digit price growth in Sydney, Melbourne and possibly Hobart. There will be single-digit growth in the other capital cities, apart from Perth and Darwin where further steep falls are predicted. "It is now very likely it will be a strong start to the new year for Sydney and Melbourne, given the way 2016 ended," he said. Looking ahead to 2018 the picture is gloomier, according to Christopher. He believes both Sydney and Melbourne's housing markets will be "dangerously overheated and overvalued" by the end of 2017, paving the way for a possible correction. His forecasts for 2017 are under a base case scenario of a steady economy, no changes to the cash rate, the Australian dollar hovering between 70¢ and 80¢ and no meddling in bank lending by the Australian Prudential Authority in the first six months of the year. Should the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate again next year, house price growth could be even greater. His forecasts are worth noting. Over the past two years Christopher has predicted capital city house price growth in line with the Australian Bureau of Statistics's Residential Property Price Index. Read more at the AFR No signs of a slowdown in the housing market. Photo: Rob Homer 12:26pm on 4 Jan 2017 In an interview with The AFR, the director of research and strategy at the $78bn investment fund QIC, Katrina King, gave her outlook for 2016. Here's a taste: AFR: What's the outlook for commodities? King: Let's consider those most important to the Australian economy – coal and iron ore. No view on commodities can be complete without first considering what has happened and what will happen in China. To shore up its growth targets for the year, the Chinese government has continued its fiscal and credit stimulus which has boosted construction and hence steel demand. The other major contributor to commodity prices has been the domestic cuts to production of iron ore and coal in China – this is largely on environmental grounds and also reflects the need to rationalise capacity and remove debt overhang. As a result, we believe these shutdowns are permanent. Thus there is a structural, rather than simply cyclical, increase in demand for Australian commodities. Our outlook is for some slowing of China housing construction in 2017 but we don't expect production cuts there to be reversed. Therefore we expect some softening in commodity prices from their elevated levels at the end of 2016 – but by no means a complete reversal to their levels of early 2016. There's persistent talk of a housing collapse? What's ahead for the Australian property market? Our base case is that we will see a mild downturn in the annual growth of house prices in 2017 and 2018. The risk to this view would be one where oversupply (in particular in Brisbane and Melbourne) causes units to face a price correction, which then leads to contagion to house prices more generally. This is certainly a risk we need to keep an eye on in 2017 but, for now, we don't see it as highly probable for several reasons. First, units in Australia represent less than 20 per cent of the total housing stock and limited land release has meant demand/supply conditions have remained tight for houses. Second, units are not direct substitutes for houses so the contagion channel isn't clear-cut. Finally, interest rates are low but, unlike many countries, still have room to move lower if the RBA needs to step in to ensure a more orderly housing correction. We will continue to watch developments in China closely as further tightening of capital controls could exacerbate price falls in the unit market, heightening the contagion risk.

QIC's Katrina King. Photo: Glenn Hunt 11:55am on 4 Jan 2017 Talking price rises, one of the biggest themes for 2017 — the rising outlook for inflation — was underscored overnight after German consumer prices staged a sharp 1.7 per cent rise from a year ago, beating expectations of a 1.3 per cent advance. Though underlying price pressures remain weak, the data may embolden European Central Bank hawks who argue the euro-area economy is on a firmer footing, justifying a shift away from loose monetary policies. Analysts at Societe Generale reckon ECB tapering fears are likely to haunt markets once more in the second half of the year.  The first reduction in the ECB's asset purchase program, announced in December, will take place in April 2017. "We then expect a gradual tapering of 10 billion euros to continue as of June 2017, with reductions of €10bn per meeting, assuming our forecasts hold steady, but also in view of the legal problems of raising the issue limit." 11:35am on 4 Jan 2017 The Turkish lira hit a fresh record low, pummelled by higher-than-expected inflation and security worries after militant attacks The lira sank to an all-time low of 3.6 per US dollar after sharp rises in food and drink prices pushed annual inflation to 8.53 per cent last month, 53 basis points above one of the nation's key interest rates. That erodes the yield on Turkish assets already under pressure from growing security concerns and adds pressure on the central bank to raise borrowing costs. "The inflation number is worse than expected ... it's an awful number and obviously there is a lag of months before the full effect of lira depreciation ... is reflected, so one would expect core inflation to remain high from here," said Paul Fage, an emerging market strategist at TD Securities. ​The currency's depreciation since end-September calls for at least 200 basis points of rate hikes just to keep the real rate stable," said Inan Demir, an economist at Nomura. "To beef up real yield support for the lira, the magnitude of the hikes will have to be larger." The central bank, which is under government pressure to ease borrowing costs to spur economic growth even when inflation is still well above its target, raised the top end of its three-pronged interest rate corridor 25 basis points in November. That month, it also boosted the one-week repurchase rate 50 basis points to 8 per cent for the first time since 2014. Fage noted that a presidential adviser had said a rate hike would "break the economy's back", implying intense pressure on the central bank to avoid much-needed rate hikes. "It's unlikely they will do the big emergency hikes they did in the past and if they do hike it will be the order of 25-50 bps," he added. Sharp rises in food prices have pushed Turkish inflation above 8 per cent.  11:08am on 4 Jan 2017 Alumina shares have dropped 1.8 per cent to $1.81 after the company outlined the size of the hit it will take from charges related to its AWAC joint venture's closure of an alumina refinery and bauxite mines in Suriname as well as an impairment of interest in a Western Australia gas field. The recently announced closure of the Suriname operations - a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina - will result in total restructuring-related charges of $108 million and related cash costs of $181 million over five years from 2017. Alumina said its share of the charges and costs will be $43 million and $72 million respectively, while it will bear another $21 million of a $52 million charge related to the Perth basin gas field impairment.Back to top 10:43am on 4 Jan 2017 Remember the biggest market scare headline from January 2016: The Royal Bank of Scotland's "sell everything!" alarm? And the $10,000 bet Steven Koukoulas tried to make against the RBS analyst? Well now the tables have turned and "The Kouk" is the bear, Michael Pascoe says: Funny thing about the RBS analyst who made the "edge of a cataclysm" call – he seems to have disappeared. After advising RBS clients they should sell everything except high-quality government bonds, Andrew Roberts hasn't turned up on a Google search since. I've gone through several pages of searches but there's been nothing fresh from Mr Roberts since that headline-grabbing advice. If he was out to get publicity, he was certainly successful, featuring in stories around the world. Embarrassingly, much of the coverage was uncritical or even barely sceptical. Hey, fear sells. But not everyone was unquestioning. Stephen Koukoulas of Market Economics, alias The Kouk, went a step further than expressing doubt by immediately calling Roberts out, prepared to bet 10 grand that at least six of 11 markets Roberts indicated as losers would in fact rise. Koukoulas never heard from Roberts, but he kept score anyway. As it has turned out, all 11 of the nominated markets finished in the black, averaging a stunning gain of 29.6 per cent with the US dollar iron ore price the best performer, up 85.9 per cent. Roberts wasn't just wrong, he was stunningly wrong. In the pantheon of failed Doomsday forecasts, he's at the top table with Marc Faber and whoever it is who has been advertising "The Crash of Next Year" for the past several years. But in a twist to the bulls versus bears game, now it's the Kouk who has turned cautious, predicting Australian and global stocks will fall, commodity prices will drop, including a halving of the coal price, and he's tipping Australian unemployment to finish this year at 6 per cent despite the Reserve Bank cutting interest rates two more times. Sell everything? Not such a good idea in 2016. Photo: Stephen Koukoulas 10:28am on 4 Jan 2017 Local shares have opened marginally higher, feeding off continuing bullish sentiment in the market. The ASX is up 0.1 per cent at 5739.3 and the All Ords has added 0.1 per cent to 5791.2. "The fact that the index closed at its high after a 1.2 per cent rally yesterday hints at the possibility of unsatisfied buying," says CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner. "Against this, traders will be weighing a soft overnight session for commodities, especially oil and a positive session for precious metals, neither of which suggest strong 'risk on sentiment' for this morning's session." The big banks and Telstra are propping up the benchmark index, with CBA's 0.6 per cent gain the biggest tailwind. Fortescue is up 1.2 per cent despite a dip in the iron ore price overnight, while Rio has dropped 0.7 per cent and South32 is down 0.5 per cent. Gold miners are rebounding from yesterday's losses, after the precious metal's price rose overnight. Newcrest has added 1 per cent. 10:10am on 4 Jan 2017 Iron ore has a tough act to follow in 2017. After surging last year in a rally that caught out many investors, the commodity faces a challenge as supply concerns re-emerge, with Vale bringing on the industry's biggest project and holdings at China's ports at a record level. Seaborne supply is expected to remain strong on shipments from Vale's newly completed S11D project in Brazil, and as miners look to take advantage of current prices, according to Tan Hui Heng, a Singapore-based analyst at Marex Spectron. That, coupled with slowing demand, may hurt iron ore, he said, joining banks including Morgan Stanley in expecting a retreat. Iron ore soared 81 per cent in 2016 in a year when low-cost supply had been expected to rise further amid tepid consumption, hurting prices. Instead, stimulus in China helped sustain steel output, and that, along with speculative interest and record coal prices, fuelled the rally. Better demand and a more restrained approach by top miners Rio Tinto and Vale are likely to carry into this year, limiting losses, according to Clarksons Platou Securities. This year "will bring more supply than current pricing can handle, so pricing should see downward pressure from the current $US80 a tonne levels", Jeremy Sussman, an analyst at Clarksons, said. "Nevertheless, we expect it to be a gradual decline rather than a crash that many are still calling for." The iron ore spot price fell 1.2 per cent to $US77.91 a tonne on the first trading day in 2017, not far off a two-year high of $US83.58 hit on December 12. The rally supercharged miners' shares in 2016, with Rio 34 per cent higher and Vale more than doubling. The holdings at ports in the largest buyer, one gauge of supply, surged 22 per cent last year for the biggest annual gain since 2011. In the final week of 2016, they expanded 2.7 per cent to 113.95 million tonnes, according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co. That's the highest level on record. "If history is any precedent, record stocks at Chinese ports carry an ominous sign," Axiom Capital Management analyst Gordon Johnson and senior associate James Bardowski wrote in a January 2 note. Axiom predicts prices will drop to $US61 if inventories fall just half as much as in the last down cycle. Prices should remain about $US70 to $US80 in the early part of 2017, with a gradual easing toward the $US50-$US60 range by mid-year, according to Gavin Wendt, founding director and senior resource analyst at MineLife. The drop would come as supply better balances with demand, Wendt said. Iron ore stockpiles in China are at worryingly high levels. Photo: Dado Galdieri 10:04am on 4 Jan 2017 SPONSORED POST The open of the Asian markets promises to be a fairly drab affair, with our call for the ASX 200 sitting up three points, IG's Chris Weston writes: Turnover through the Aussie market was predicably terrible yesterday at $3.74 billion (38% below the 30-day average) and that will likely be the case again today, although I'd expect turnover north of $4 billion. BHP's ADR is largely unchanged, if we use the mining heavyweight as a proxy for the space, and I would expect banks to open ever so slightly stronger. The trend in the ASX 200 is strong though and moves into 5700 should be supported and looking at the daily chart there are no red flags warranting more aggressive short positions just yet. Happy to stay long for now. In terms of volatility the commodities space has been interesting, and there seems to have been somewhat of a move from energy into precious metals. US crude basically collapsed close to 5% after hitting $US55.00 in mid-US trade and technically looks to be putting in a double top. A move through $US52 could be on the cards if we get a poor weekly inventory report (tonight 03:00 aest), with the market expecting a drawdown of 1.38 million barrels. Surprisingly the S&P 500 energy sector is still strong on the day and it will be interesting to see if Aussie energy plays can hold up this morning. Precious metals have seen a good level of short covering, and my preference in this space has been to be long platinum and this trade has been working well, with price gaining over 4%. Technically we have seen price break out of multi-month wedge pattern and $US1000 to $US1020 would be my target here. We can also look at seasonality and see that that platinum has gained for 13 of the last 15 January's, with views that traditionally car manufacturers tend to receive budgets in January and buy volumes of PGM in this window. There tends to be a fall in production as well during this period which supports price. Here's more 9:29am on 4 Jan 2017 Manufacturing output in China, the UK and the US is recovering at a steady pace, boosting hopes for the global economy days into the new year. Factories have struggled around the world the past few years in an environment of goods-price deflation, according to economists at JPMorgan, which today released its global manufacturing PMI for December, up 0.4 points to 53.8, its best level since 2014.  "The latest output PMI reading implies global production growth at a 3.7 per cent annualised pace based on the historical relationship," JPMorgan said. "This would mark a dramatic improvement over the recent past. In 2015 and 1H16, output gains averaged just 1.1 per cent annualised."  JPMorgan said a recovery in pricing power and expected gains in profits and spending are "expected to give a major boost to manufacturing output in our forecast, which calls for 2.5 per cent average gains in 2017". First on the mark this week was China. Its factory activity picked up more than expected in December as demand accelerated, with output reaching a near six-year high, a private business survey showed, giving the manufacturing sector a solid boost heading into 2017. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.9 on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 50.9 in November and easily beating analysts' forecasts of 50.7. After a rocky start to the year, China's economy looks set to hit Beijing's 2016 growth target of 6.5 to 7 per cent, after expanding 6.7 per cent for each of the first three quarters. British manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in two and a half years last month, adding to signs that the economy ended 2016 strongly despite the shock of June's Brexit vote. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 56.1, the strongest reading since June 2014, from 53.6 in November, helped by orders from home and abroad. Britain's economy has fared much better than many economists predicted since the vote to leave the European Union, with consumer spending strong and companies performing well. IHS Markit's eurozone PMIs showed manufacturing growth there hit a more than five-year high, similarly boosted by an influx of new orders. US factory activity accelerated to a two-year high in December amid a surge in new orders and rapidly rising raw material prices, indicating that some of the drag on manufacturing from prolonged dollar strength and a slump in oil prices was fading. Other data on Tuesday showed US construction spending hit a 10-1/2-year high in November, providing a boost to a fourth-quarter economic growth estimate. The reports suggested President-elect Donald Trump would inherit a strong economy, with a labour market that is near full employment, from the Obama administration. "The economy is ending the year on a high note with even the manufacturing sector showing signs of faster growth. It appears that President (Barack) Obama will be leaving his successor with a pretty good economy," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity rose 1.5 percentage points to 54.7 last month, the highest level since December 2014. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 per cent of the US economy.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Business News | Tue Jan 3, 2017 | 2:19pm EST Indonesia penalizes JPMorgan for negative report in latest emerging markets skirmish A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Nilufar Rizki, Eveline Danubrata and David Henry | JAKARTA/NEW YORK JAKARTA/NEW YORK Indonesia has cut some ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country, the latest in a series of skirmishes between Wall Street banks and governments in emerging markets. Indonesia will no longer use JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked a special designation that allows it to perform certain banking services, Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in China to Banco Santander (SAN.MC) in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise." In 2015, Indonesia's then-finance minister said that JPMorgan had been "sanctioned" for a negative report recommending less exposure to government bonds, but did not explain what the sanctions involved. [reut.rs/2iF58uK] Banks have encountered a variety of problems managing conflicts in emerging markets. In another high-profile skirmish in 2006, Morgan Stanley's head economist in Asia, Andy Xie, left the bank after a critical email he sent about Singapore was leaked. In 2014, Banco Santander publicly fired an analyst who had published a critical note about Brazil's economic policies. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) lost a lucrative underwriting mandate for South Korea's Kookmin Bank [KOOKM.UL] in 2008 after one of its analysts issued a sell recommendation on the shares. More recently, Goldman has been embroiled in a scandal regarding the way it courted Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, while JPMorgan has faced probes into its hiring children of Chinese officials to gain an edge in the country.

In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in China to Banco Santander (SAN.MC) in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise." In 2015, Indonesia's then-finance minister said that JPMorgan had been "sanctioned" for a negative report recommending less exposure to government bonds, but did not explain what the sanctions involved.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Business News | Tue Jan 3, 2017 | 2:19pm EST Indonesia penalizes JPMorgan for negative report in latest emerging markets skirmish A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Nilufar Rizki, Eveline Danubrata and David Henry | JAKARTA/NEW YORK JAKARTA/NEW YORK Indonesia has cut some ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country, the latest in a series of skirmishes between Wall Street banks and governments in emerging markets. Indonesia will no longer use JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked a special designation that allows it to perform certain banking services, Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in China to Banco Santander (SAN.MC) in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise." In 2015, Indonesia's then-finance minister said that JPMorgan had been "sanctioned" for a negative report recommending less exposure to government bonds, but did not explain what the sanctions involved. [reut.rs/2iF58uK] Banks have encountered a variety of problems managing conflicts in emerging markets. In another high-profile skirmish in 2006, Morgan Stanley's head economist in Asia, Andy Xie, left the bank after a critical email he sent about Singapore was leaked. In 2014, Banco Santander publicly fired an analyst who had published a critical note about Brazil's economic policies. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) lost a lucrative underwriting mandate for South Korea's Kookmin Bank [KOOKM.UL] in 2008 after one of its analysts issued a sell recommendation on the shares. More recently, Goldman has been embroiled in a scandal regarding the way it courted Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, while JPMorgan has faced probes into its hiring children of Chinese officials to gain an edge in the country.

A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan has already taken effect. The decision was taken after JPMorgan issued a note in November downgrading its rating for Indonesian bonds to “underweight” from “overweight”, he said. The official said the bank’s analysis “did not make sense” because it recommended a “neutral” position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. “We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They’ve explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It’s not that we think we’re so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries’ economies,” Nazara said. “Our mindset is, if you’re doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don’t create unnecessary volatility to create business,” he added. Business as usual A JPMorgan spokeswoman said today that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” she said in an email. In a note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan downgraded emerging markets including Indonesia and Brazil, citing higher risk premiums for their credit default swaps after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. “Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit,” the bank wrote, adding that the “spike in volatility” may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a “tactical” response to Trump’s victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. Indonesia’s 10-year credit default swap, a swap contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield of its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the US election, though they have since dipped. Trump signalled more protective US trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said that Indonesia’s economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia’s lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. In 2015, then-Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said he had given JPMorgan a sanction that “will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable” after it recommended an “underweight” position on Indonesian bonds. He didn’t say what the sanction was. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Job cuts, fewer flights?

The finance ministry ended the partnerships from Jan 1, saying the bank's November research report downgrading Indonesia to underweight was potentially destabilising to the nation's financial system, Okezone reported, citing a letter from Marwanto Harjowiryono, director general of treasury at the ministry. JPMorgan downgraded Indonesia by two notches to underweight from overweight in a Nov 13 report as a "tactical response" to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil to neutral from overweight, while noting that both countries may provide a "better buying opportunity" later. JPMorgan's business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday (Jan 3). "The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," it said. Suahasil Nazara, head of fiscal agency at Indonesia's finance ministry, did not immediately respond to calls to his mobile phone on Tuesday. Foreign investors sold a net US$2.8 billion (S$4.05 billion) of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Mr Trump's victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policy makers to intervene to stabilise the currency.

Monday, January 16, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Indonesia penalises JPMorgan for ‘underweight’ call January 5, 2017, Thursday JAKARTA: Indonesia will drop JPMorgan Chase & Co from providing some services to the government after the bank’s research arm said investors should reduce their exposure to the country, senior finance ministry officials said. “After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan’s services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank,” Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry’s fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan was already in effect. In an equities research note dated Nov 13, JPMorgan downgraded its investment recommendation on Indonesia to ‘underweight’ from ‘overweight’, citing higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. “Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit,” the bank wrote, adding that the “spike in volatility” may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a ‘tactical’ response to Trump’s victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. “The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” she said by email. The finance ministry’s Nazara said the bank’s analysis “did not make sense” because it recommended a ‘neutral’ position for Brazil, which is better than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. “We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They’ve explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It’s not that we think we’re so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries’ economies,” Nazara said. “Our mindset is, if you’re doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don’t create unnecessary volatility to create business,” he added. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia’s director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan’s research should not have a major impact on Indonesia’s future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place “until we say otherwise”. Primary dealers of Indonesian government bonds as of Nov. 25 included Citibank, Deutsche Bank AG, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited and local lender PT Bank Central Asia Tbk, according to the finance ministry’s website. Indonesia’s 10-year credit default swap, a contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield on its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the US election, though they have since dipped. Trump signalled more protective US trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said Indonesia’s economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia’s lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. Indonesia’s central bank said shortly after the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates in December that it was on guard against ‘reversals’ of capital flows into the country. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

Clayton has extensive ties to Wall Street. He advised Goldman Sachs on its government bailout and his wife Gretchen currently works at the bank as a private wealth advisor. Trump announced his SEC pick on Wednesday and explained that Clayton's background as a Wall Street lawyer will help unleash the "job-creating power" of the economy while still providing strong oversight. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers," Trump said in a statement. The appointment rankled some Democrats, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren. She told CNNMoney in a statement that Trump's selection of Clayton is another sign that "his administration will put Wall Street first and working families last." "Mr. Clayton's selection is great news if you happen to run a big bank or manage a hedge fund," Warren said, "but you're out of luck if you want to see tough rules on Wall Street and bankers held accountable when they break the law." The SEC is responsible for rooting out financial crime such as fraud as well as ensuring capital markets are fair for all investors. "Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority," the Trump statement said. Clayton is currently a partner at the powerful law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and has advised on a slew of major deals, including the record-breaking Alibaba IPO and the sale of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks. His law firm bio also notes that Clayton helped secure mortgage settlements on behalf of large financial institutions with the government. It's not clear which specific banks Clayton defended. However, Sullivan & Cromwell's website said the firm represented Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and other banks against allegations that they fraudulently issued or underwrote hundreds of toxic mortgage deals prior to the subprime collapse. Sullivan & Cromwell similarly helped JPMorgan reach its $13 billion toxic mortgage settlement with the Department of Justice in 2013. Clayton also has ties to Bear Stearns, the investment bank that collapsed during the financial crisis as its toxic loan portfolio spiraled out of control. He represented Bear in its fire sale to JPMorgan. Additionally, Goldman Sachs hired Clayton to advise on the Wall Street firm's TARP bailout as well as the crucial $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway during the crisis. Clayton already has experience working with the SEC, albeit on the other side. In 2010, Clayton helped secure a $365 million bribery settlement with the SEC on behalf of Italian oil giant Eni. If confirmed, Clayton said he wants the SEC to strike a balance between providing oversight and helping the economy. "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs," Clayton said. Clayton would replace Mary Jo White, who is stepping down on January 20 even though her term doesn't expire until June 2019. Some liberal critics, led by Senator Warren, have claimed White didn't do enough to prevent business from pouring cash into politics. While White spent her tenure trying to implement a wave of rules coming from Dodd-Frank, Clayton could be charged with helping Trump carry out his pledge to "dismantle" the reform law. Clayton beat out former federal prosecutor Debra Wong Yang for the SEC job. While Yang is a star corporate lawyer like Clayton, she earned a reputation for toughness as a prosecutor by taking down a violent drug-dealing gang and investigating financial fraud. Democrats strongly criticized Trump's selection of Clayton. Senator Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, knocked Clayton as an "attorney who's spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap." Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, compared Clayton's nomination to allowing the "fox guard the henhouse on Wall Street." On the other hand, the Investment Adviser Association, which represents SEC-registered firms, praised Clayton as a "highly regarded, respected and accomplished" lawyer who has a "deep understanding" of complex transactions and regulations. Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen & Co., called Trump's selection of Clayton a "conventional choice" for a Republican president given his background at a high-profile law firm.

Clayton has extensive ties to Wall Street. He advised Goldman Sachs on its government bailout and his wife Gretchen currently works at the bank as a private wealth advisor. Trump announced his SEC pick on Wednesday and explained that Clayton's background as a Wall Street lawyer will help unleash the "job-creating power" of the economy while still providing strong oversight. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers," Trump said in a statement. The appointment rankled some Democrats, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren. She told CNNMoney in a statement that Trump's selection of Clayton is another sign that "his administration will put Wall Street first and working families last." "Mr. Clayton's selection is great news if you happen to run a big bank or manage a hedge fund," Warren said, "but you're out of luck if you want to see tough rules on Wall Street and bankers held accountable when they break the law." The SEC is responsible for rooting out financial crime such as fraud as well as ensuring capital markets are fair for all investors. "Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority," the Trump statement said. Clayton is currently a partner at the powerful law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and has advised on a slew of major deals, including the record-breaking Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) IPO and the sale of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks. His law firm bio also notes that Clayton helped secure mortgage settlements on behalf of large financial institutions with the government. Related: Elizabeth Warren watchdog under siege It's not clear which specific banks Clayton defended. However, Sullivan & Cromwell's website said the firm represented Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays (BCS) and other banks against allegations that they fraudulently issued or underwrote hundreds of toxic mortgage deals prior to the subprime collapse. Sullivan & Cromwell similarly helped JPMorgan reach its $13 billion toxic mortgage settlement with the Department of Justice in 2013. Clayton also has ties to Bear Stearns, the investment bank that collapsed during the financial crisis as its toxic loan portfolio spiraled out of control. He represented Bear in its fire sale to JPMorgan (JPM). Additionally, Goldman Sachs (GS) hired Clayton to advise on the Wall Street firm's TARP bailout as well as the crucial $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) during the crisis. Clayton already has experience working with the SEC, albeit on the other side. In 2010, Clayton helped secure a $365 million bribery settlement with the SEC on behalf of Italian oil giant Eni (E). If confirmed, Clayton said he wants the SEC to strike a balance between providing oversight and helping the economy. "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs," Clayton said.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Business News | Wed Jan 4, 2017 | 6:27am EST Indonesia tries to assure banks they won't be penalized if research is 'credible' A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Hidayat Setiaji and Eveline Danubrata | JAKARTA JAKARTA Indonesia's finance ministry sought on Wednesday to assure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible". Indonesia cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) because its research was "not credible and not objective", Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told reporters. Some analysts have said that the decision has raised concern about whether the government would penalize other research providers for reports that are deemed to be negative. Nazara dismissed such worries. "There is no need to be afraid as long as it's credible," he said. "The point is, don't worry, go ahead with an analysis of Indonesia's economy that is as credible as possible, by using the available data and facts." In a note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan analysts downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight", citing higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Indonesia has dropped JPMorgan's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global markets, Nazara said. The U.S. bank is also no longer what Indonesia terms a perception bank. The government said in a 2006 decree that perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. JPMorgan is allowed to continue its business in the private sector, Nazara said. The government assurances are unlikely to dispel the worries. "This has made us more cautious although we'll still try our best to safeguard our research independence," said a Jakarta-based analyst at a foreign bank, who declined to be identified.

The ministry suspended JPMorgan as a primary dealer and underwriter of Indonesia’s bonds from Jan. 1 after the bank downgraded the country’s equities by two notches to underweight in November following Donald Trump’s election win. JPMorgan continues to operate as normal in Indonesia and is working with the finance ministry to resolve the matter, the New York-based bank said in e-mailed statement Tuesday. The biggest U.S. bank was part of a underwriting syndicate when Indonesia sold 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of bonds in June. The lender wasn’t listed as a member of syndicates for two more recent offerings denominated in yen and U.S. dollars, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   The government will find a replacement for JPMorgan as a primary dealer and bond underwriter if needed, Nazara said. “The message to all finance companies is be objective and credible,” he said. “The bigger the institution and reputation, the bigger the responsibility.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Yet it is no exaggeration to say that central banks’ exit from the ultra-loose monetary policies they have been pursuing for the last several years represents one of the most significant, and perilous, moments in the history of financial markets. This is, quite simply, the mother of all inflection points. To be sure, the exit has only just begun and is being mitigated by what are still extremely accommodative financial conditions, underpinned by the quantitative easing (QE) programmes of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) which are helping suppress bond yields. According to a report from JPMorgan published on December 1, the stock of negative-yielding government bonds still amounts to some $9 trillion. The share of sub-zero-yielding sovereign debt in JPMorgan’s benchmark developed market government bond index (GBI-DM) stands at 20 per cent. Yet this is already down from a peak of 32 per cent in July. Make no mistake, the “lower for longer” period of global interest rates has finally come to an end. The only question is how painful and disorderly the monetary policy normalisation process is likely to be. The last two months of 2016 provided a glimpse of what the post-QE era could look like. The Fed’s decision on December 14 to announce a faster-than-anticipated pace of monetary tightening next year, partly as a pre-emptive move in anticipation of the reflationary economic policies of president-elect Donald Trump, has fuelled a sell-off in the bond market. The US Federal Reserve is at the forefront of a much-discussed shift from monetary easing to fiscal expansion as the main source of stimulus for the global economy. The Fed’s decision on December 14 to announce a faster-than-anticipated pace of monetary tightening next year, partly as a pre-emptive move in anticipation of the reflationary economic policies of president-elect Donald Trump, has fuelled a sell-off in the bond market. The yield on benchmark US 10-year Treasury bonds has shot up 65 basis points since Trump’s victory to 2.5 per cent, its highest level since September 2014. Its 2-year equivalent, meanwhile, has surged 40 basis points to 1.2 per cent, its highest level since the end of 2009. While the rise in European and Japanese bond yields has been much less pronounced, even the BoJ and the ECB have moved away from unlimited asset purchases and are now focusing on managing the yield curve for short and long-term borrowing costs and improving the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The return on bonds in the last quarter of 2016 was the worst since the first quarter of 1994 when speculation, excessive leverage, and [Fed] rate hikes combined to create one of the worst years for bonds in modern history Wells Fargo Asset Management Although there is a significant divergence of views among investment strategists about where yields are heading, a regime change in financial markets is in the air – so much so that many market commentators have suddenly stopped using the 2008 global financial crisis as the starting point for assessing the performance of asset prices, and are instead looking at price action since Trump’s victory in the US election. The “Trumpflation” trade – a repositioning of investors’ portfolios favouring equities over bonds - is the prologue of the post-QE policy regime. International investors must now prepare themselves for the first chapter. From a market sentiment standpoint, the stakes could not be higher. Central banks’ ultra-accommodative monetary policies have distorted asset prices and desensitised investors to risks and vulnerabilities in the global economy. Markets have become used to central banks being, in the words of Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz, “the only game in town”. The exit from seven years of QE, which has only just begun, is bound to be a tumultuous one, particularly if Trump’s reflationary policies – now perceived by investors as the substitute for further monetary stimulus – are not as aggressive and effective as is currently being priced in. Even if Trump, who takes office on January 20, is able to get a hefty fiscal stimulus package approved by Congress, global equity markets – which have rallied spectacularly since the US election in anticipation of stronger growth – could start to wobble because of concerns about an even more hawkish Fed. Emerging markets (EM) will be particularly vulnerable as the post-QE era unfolds. The sharp deterioration in sentiment towards developing economies in the last two months of 2016 – EM equity and bond funds experienced six consecutive weeks of outflows following Trump’s victory – shows the extent to which the asset class suffers when central bank-driven volatility picks up. The world’s leading central banks used to have a stabilising effect on markets. In the coming years, they will be a source of intense volatility.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 4 January 2017 | MYT 6:45 AM Indonesia penalizes JPMorgan for negative report in latest emerging markets skirmish It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. JAKARTA/NEW YORK: Indonesia has cut some ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country, the latest in a series of skirmishes between Wall Street banks and governments in emerging markets. Indonesia will no longer use JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked a special designation that allows it to perform certain banking services, Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley <MS.N> in China to Banco Santander <SAN.MC> in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise." In 2015, Indonesia's then-finance minister said that JPMorgan had been "sanctioned" for a negative report recommending less exposure to government bonds, but did not explain what the sanctions involved. [http://reut.rs/2iF58uK] Banks have encountered a variety of problems managing conflicts in emerging markets. In another high-profile skirmish in 2006, Morgan Stanley's head economist in Asia, Andy Xie, left the bank after a critical email he sent about Singapore was leaked. In 2014, Banco Santander publicly fired an analyst who had published a critical note about Brazil's economic policies. Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> lost a lucrative underwriting mandate for South Korea's Kookmin Bank [KOOKM.UL] in 2008 after one of its analysts issued a sell recommendation on the shares. More recently, Goldman has been embroiled in a scandal regarding the way it courted Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, while JPMorgan has faced probes into its hiring children of Chinese officials to gain an edge in the country.- Reuters Tags / Keywords: Banking , Banking , Economy , Economy , Stocks , Foreign News , Corporate News , Investing , Indonesia You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Lucky start to the new year CIA director warns Trump to watch what he says, be careful on Russia Do we really need to fear China money?

The finance ministry will stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds, Robert Pakpahan, the ministry’s director-general for budget financing and risk management told reporters in Jakarta yesterday. He said a November research report issued by the bank was not “accurate or credible.” JPMorgan downgraded Indonesia by two notches to underweight from overweight in a Nov. 13 report as a “tactical response” to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil, while noting that both countries may provide a “better buying opportunity” later. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” it said. Any tax payments by Indonesian companies which were previously routed through JPMorgan will now be passed to the government via other banks, according to Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo. The government’s action illustrates some of the difficulties in producing balanced research reports, said Alan Richardson, an investment manager at Samsung Asset Management in Hong Kong. “I don’t think it will affect investor interest in Indonesia but it does reflect the difficulty of sell-side analysts to provide independent and objective opinions to their clients without upsetting the government officials and regulators,” Richardson said. Foreign investors sold a net USD2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policy makers to intervene to stabilize the currency. Banks should take responsibility for economic reports that “could influence fundamentals and psychology,” Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said yesterday, when asked to comment on the termination of the JPMorgan relationship. JPMorgan provides investment and commercial banking services to the public and private sectors in Indonesia, according to the bank’s website. It obtained an Indonesian banking license in 1968 in the name of Chase Manhattan, and opened a branch in Jakarta, followed by a representative office in 1978.

JPMorgan Chase downgraded Indonesia's stock market by two notches in November, citing powerful market forces set off by Donald Trump's election victory. Indonesia didn't take too well to the demotion, even though the same research report also downgraded the stock markets of Brazil and Turkey. An Indonesia official told reporters in Jakarta on Tuesday that the country will ban JPMorgan from being hired as a primary dealer and an underwriter of its government debt, according to several news reports. Indonesia also indicated JPMorgan will no longer serve as a bank that receives tax payments to the government. The Southeast Asian nation explained the decision to punish JPMorgan by pointing directly to the November research report, which it criticized as not "accurate or credible." "The institutions with big names have very high responsibility in creating positive psychology instead of doing [something] misleading," said Sri Mulyani, Indonesia's finance minister, according to The Wall Street Journal. JPMorgan (JPM), which has substantial business interests in Indonesia, said it is working with the country's Ministry of Finance to "resolve the matter," and that its business there "continues to operate as usual." Related: Stocks storm into 2017 as Trump rally resumes JPMorgan's ties to Indonesia go back a long way. The bank opened its first branch in Indonesia under the Chase Manhattan brand in 1968. Since 2012, JPMorgan has served as an underwriter on nearly $14 billion worth of Indonesian government bond sales, including $3.4 billion last year, according to Dealogic. Indonesia's retaliation against JPMorgan appears to be aimed at stifling criticism, even from firms that have a duty to provide unbiased research to their clients. "It makes me uncomfortable when I see a government trying to influence independent analysts," said Win Thin, head of emerging market currency strategy at investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman. "It's pretty thin skinned for Indonesia to do that and a little silly. It shows you how sensitive policymakers can be," he said. The November 13 research report from JPMorgan lowered the bank's rating on Indonesia to "underweight" from "overweight." "There are losers from Trumponomics," the report warned. Related: Goldman Sachs accounts for 24% of Dow's Trump rally Ironically, JPMorgan's assessment of Indonesia's economy was actually quite positive, saying it is "improving," and that investors will "get a better buying opportunity." The analysts said the downgrade was caused by a combination of the Trump election and rising U.S. rates, which tend to hurt emerging markets. Like other emerging markets, Indonesia did take a hit after Trump's victory. The MSCI Indonesia index plunged as much as 12% after the U.S. election. However, Indonesian stocks have since rebounded and the stock market is now just 5% below its Election Day level. Overall, the Indonesian market rose 12% last year, outperforming emerging markets broadly. "I'm not sure why Indonesia is so nervous. It's actually held up pretty well," said Thin.

"It has not yet been perfect but we will continue improving it professionally, accountably, and transparently while continuing to develop mutually respectful relations," she said in connection with the governments decision to cut its partnership with JPMorgan Chase Bank. She said any partnership with financial institutions will be based on good and mutually beneficial relations, but building a positive climate is important under the current circumstances. "We do not close ourselves, we will be open to all criticism and assessments, which is important for improvement. However, institutions with a big reputation also have a big responsibility to create positive psychological conditions instead of misleading," the former World Bank director said. In view of that she hoped that all government partners will be able to complete each other in managing and preserving national economic fundamentals through continuous and positive cooperation. "We respect all products of research institutes in terms of their accuracy, credibility, methodology or assessment. We wish all stakeholders have the same message. Let us work positively," she said. Sri Mulyani assured that the government had listened to voices within the economic community as well as institutions that have high credibility and had made improvements from within, for example, with regard to tax reform. "If we think the national budget is the problem we correct it. We will not hesitate to do it because we believe professional, accountable, credible, and beneficial relations are important," she said. The Indonesian government has decided to cut its partnership with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in connection with the results of the US banks research, which is believed to have the potential to disrupt the stability of the countrys financial system. The director general of risks and financing management of the finance ministry, Robert Pakpahan, said the partnership with the bank was cut because it had doubted the quality of Indonesian companies assets. "The results of its research are questionable because it seems they are not based on accurate and credible assessment. Therefore, we decided to just cut it as we considered it unprofessional," he said. With the decision, JPMorgan Chase Bank will no longer be a selling agent for government bonds, a participant in bidding of government securities (SBSN) bidding, joint lead underwriter for global bonds, and a perception bank for state receipts. "There used to be 20 SUN (state bond) dealers. The number is now minus one and totally there are now 19. Total participants of SBSN (shariah bond) bid is 22, now there are 21 left. We have also revoked its position as a partner in joint lead underwriter. With regard to perception banks, we now have more than 50. So, it would be no problem," he said.(*) Latest News Difficult to restrict purchase of subsidized gas: Minister 21 hours ago Household consumption key to achieving economic growth in 2018 21 hours ago Freeport, Amman hope status change would not disturb firm operation 22 hours ago Ministry to expedite agriculture development in border areas 13th January 2017 Indonesia expects more investment from Japan 13th January 2017 Bank Indonesia forecasts current account deficit at 1.8% of GDP 13th January 2017 Indonesian Agriculture Minister chairs meeting on food resilience in S.E.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Jan 04, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Jakarta ends JPMorgan partnerships after downgrade Bloomberg Indonesia’s government said it terminated all business partnerships with JPMorgan Chase & Co after the US bank downgraded its assessment of Southeast Asia’s largest economy following US president-elect Donald Trump’s victory. The Indonesian Ministry of Finance will stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds, Robert Pakpahan, the ministry’s director-general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters in Jakarta yesterday. He said a November research report issued by the bank was not “accurate or credible.” JPMorgan downgraded the Southeast Asian state by two notches to underweight from overweight in a Nov. 13 report as a “tactical response” to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil, but said both countries might provide a “better buying opportunity” later. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” it said. Any tax payments by Indonesian companies that were previously routed through JPMorgan are now be passed to the government via other banks, Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo said. The government’s action illustrates some of the difficulties in producing balanced research reports, said Alan Richardson, an investment manager at Samsung Asset Management in Hong Kong. “I don’t think it will affect investor interest in Indonesia, but it does reflect the difficulty of sell-side analysts to provide independent and objective opinions to their clients without upsetting the government officials and regulators,” Richardson said. Foreign investors sold a net US$2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter, dumping emerging-market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policymakers to intervene to stabilize the currency. Banks should take responsibility for economic reports that “could influence fundamentals and psychology,” Indonesian Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani Indrawati said, when asked to comment on the JPMorgan termination. JPMorgan provides investment and commercial banking services to the public and private sectors in Indonesia, according to the bank’s Web site. It obtained an Indonesian banking license in 1968 in the name of Chase Manhattan, and opened a branch in Jakarta, followed by a representative office in 1978. This story has been viewed 1920 times.

Posted 03 Jan 2017 14:25 Updated 03 Jan 2017 23:30 A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A JAKARTA: Indonesia will drop JPMorgan Chase & Co from providing some services to the government after the bank's research arm said investors should reduce their exposure to the country, senior finance ministry officials said on Tuesday. "After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan's services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank," Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan was already in effect. In an equities research note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan downgraded its investment recommendation on Indonesia to "underweight" from "overweight", citing higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. "Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit," the bank wrote, adding that the "spike in volatility" may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. The finance ministry's Nazara said the bank's analysis "did not make sense" because it recommended a "neutral" position for Brazil, which is better than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies," Nazara said. "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise". Primary dealers of Indonesian government bonds as of Nov. 25 included Citibank , Deutsche Bank AG , Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited and local lender PT Bank Central Asia Tbk , according to the finance ministry's website. (http://bit.ly/2iKae6n) Indonesia's 10-year credit default swap , a contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield on its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the U.S. election, though they have since dipped. Trump signaled more protective U.S. trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said Indonesia's economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia's lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. Indonesia's central bank said shortly after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates in December that it was on guard against "reversals" of capital flows into the country. However, Fitch Ratings revised in December Indonesia's credit rating outlook to positive, citing a relatively low government debt burden, favorable growth outlook and an improving business environment.

(JPM), citing the U.S. lender's recent downgrade of equities in Southeast Asia's largest economy. The government said that the downgrade has the potential to disrupt the stability of the national financial system. The Indonesian government's finance ministry said it will stop using JP Morgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked its status as a "perception bank." A perception bank is a bank that is appointed by the Indonesian government to receive payments of taxes and other sources of income on behalf of the government. Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati called the report by JP Morgan as "misleading." "A nation's economy is affected by fundamental and psychological factors. The government is open to critics, but JP Morgan cuts its recommendation... without a credible assessment," the minister said. JP Morgan has multiple business partnerships with the government of Indonesia. The lender was a traditional underwriter for Indonesian government's bonds. Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo reportedly said that tax payments by Indonesian companies that were earlier routed through JP Morgan will now be passed to the government through other banks. In a report dated November 13, JP Morgan's emerging markets equity strategists downgraded Indonesia's equity market by two notches to "underweight" from "overweight." The bank had also downgraded Brazil to "neutral" from "overweight." While JP Morgan did not elaborate its reasons for the downgrade, it said the move was a "tactical response" to Donald Trump's election win in the U.S. The company cited the spike in volatility of the bond market following Trump's win. "Post the U.S. elections 10-year bond yields moved from 1.85% to 2.15%. Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit. This spike in volatility increases EM risk premiums (i.e. Brazil, Indonesia CDS) and potentially stops/reverses flows into EM fixed income," JP Morgan said in the note. In contrast, Fitch Ratings said on December 21 that it has upgraded Indonesia's rating outook from "stable" to "positive," and affirmed its rating at BBB-. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

(ANTARA/Yudhi Mahatma) Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said all forms of partnership with financial agencies should be formed based on good relations and mutual benefit. However, under the prevailing condition, it would be better if positive psychological form is created and the countrys economy would continue to be managed professionally amid the global condition that shows no signs of improvement. "It does not mean everything is perfect, but we will seek improvement with professionalism, accountability, and transparency and would continue to create relations with mutual respect," Sri Mulyani said here on Tuesday. She was commenting on the breaking of all ties between the government and JP Morgan Chase Bank. "We would be open to criticism and assessment, as it is important to improve ourselves. However, an agency having big name carries big responsibility to create positive psychology instead of misleading," she said apparently referring to the U.S. bank. She said she hope all governments partners could contribute to maintaining the national economic fundamental through positive and sustainable cooperation. She said the government has paid good attention to the people and views of agencies having high credibility such as in the issue of tax reform. "If we think the state budget as a sources of problem, we are not hesitate to make correction as we believe professional, accountable and credible relations are important," she said. Earlier the Finance Ministry terminated all business partnerships with JPMorgan Chase & Co. after a survey by the bank is considered potential to destabilize the countrys financial system. The government decided to stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds. Robert Pakpahan, the ministrys director-general for budget financing and risk management told reporters here on Tuesday the research by JP Morgan cast doubt on the quality of the assets of Indonesian companies. Robert said the result of the research is "very much questionable based on not accurate and credible evaluation." He said JPMorgan will no longer serve as sales agent for government bonds and as joint lead underwriter for the government global bonds. Its position as perception bank for tax payments will be replaced by other bank, he added.

Even before the UK headed to the polls in June, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon warned that a Leave vote could leave the lender with "no choice" but to reorganise its business model, including potentially moving jobs overseas. Now, Dimon has indicated he's feeling uncertain about what a post-Brexit London will look like. "We’re just not going to know until the negotiations take place," he said in an interview with Financial News, which was published today. "My goal is that whatever it is, I want to be able to serve clients the next day. So we just want to make sure we’re prepared to serve the client the next day." Read more: Farage: Brexit indecision puts the UK on the back foot Dimon added: "I wish we could keep it all here [in London]." JP Morgan's chief exec, who was at one point reported to be in the running for the top spot in President-elect Donald Trump's treasury team, has previously estimated the bank may need to move around 4,000 staff away from the UK to continue serving clients following its departure from the EU. When asked about job movements by Financial News, Dimon said: We’ve been planning for a range of outcomes because it’s still as uncertain as a couple months ago. What we know now is that this will be a slow process, and all the staff moves would not happen at once but over a period of years. If there is not a clear transitional period decided early in the process, where passporting rules still apply for a few years after negotiations, then we’d likely have to accelerate our timetable in complying with new rules. Read more: Prepare to refight the referendum: How Brexit will dominate 2017 politics In a separate interview with Bloomberg, Arnaud de Bresson, managing director of Parisian lobbying outfit Europlace, said the city could easily win over thousands of British bankers, and expected to see some moving in the near future. "We feel decisions will be taken in the first semester of the new year," de Bresson said. "We see institutions are accelerating their process of thinking." Benoit de Juvigny, the head of France's financial regulator, said last month that "large international banks" were already in the process of looking into their options for moving to the French capital. Meanwhile, a report from think tank TheCityUK, published last October, warned the UK could lose 75,000 jobs should the government plump for a so-called hard Brexit.

"After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan's services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank," Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan (JPM.N) has already taken effect. The decision was taken after JPMorgan issued a note in November downgrading its rating for Indonesian bonds to "underweight" from "overweight", he said. The official said the bank's analysis "did not make sense" because it recommended a "neutral" position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies," Nazara said. "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. BUSINESS AS USUAL A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said in an email. In a note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan downgraded emerging markets including Indonesia and Brazil, citing higher risk premiums for their credit default swaps after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. "Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit," the bank wrote, adding that the "spike in volatility" may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. Indonesia's 10-year credit default swap (IDGV10YUSAC=MG), a swap contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield of its benchmark 10-year bonds (ID10YT=RR) spiked after the U.S. election, though they have since dipped. Trump signaled more protective U.S. trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said that Indonesia's economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia's lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. In 2015, then-Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said he had given JPMorgan a sanction that "will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable" after it recommended an "underweight" position on Indonesian bonds. He didn't say what the sanction was.

The finance ministry will stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds, Robert Pakpahan, the ministry’s director-general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters in Jakarta on Tuesday. He said a November research report issued by the bank was not “accurate or credible”. JPMorgan downgraded Indonesia by two notches to underweight from overweight in a November 13 report as a “tactical response” to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil, while noting that both countries may provide a “better buying opportunity” later. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” it said. Tax payments Any tax payments by Indonesian companies which were previously routed through JPMorgan will now be passed to the government via other banks, according to Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo. The government’s action illustrates some of the difficulties in producing balanced research reports, said Alan Richardson, an investment manager at Samsung Asset Management in Hong Kong. “I don’t think it will affect investor interest in Indonesia but it does reflect the difficulty of sell-side analysts to provide independent and objective opinions to their clients without upsetting the government officials and regulators,” Richardson said. Foreign investors sold a net $2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policymakers to intervene to stabilise the currency. Banks should take responsibility for economic reports that “could influence fundamentals and psychology”, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday, when asked to comment on the termination of the JPMorgan relationship. JPMorgan provides investment and commercial banking services to the public and private sectors in Indonesia, according to the bank’s website. It obtained an Indonesian banking licence in 1968 in the name of Chase Manhattan, and opened a branch in Jakarta, followed by a representative office in 1978.

Photo: Shutterstock Indonesia has penalised JPMorgan Chase & Co after the investment bank's research arm recommended a smaller exposure to the country's sovereign bonds, a senior finance ministry official said on Tuesday. "After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan's services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank," Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan has already taken effect. The decision was taken after JPMorgan issued a note in November downgrading its rating for Indonesian bonds to "underweight" from "overweight", he said. The official said the bank's analysis "did not make sense" because it recommended a "neutral" position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the South-east Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies," Nazara said. "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. BUSINESS AS USUAL A JPMorgan spokeswoman said that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said in an email. In a note dated November 13, JPMorgan downgraded emerging markets including Indonesia and Brazil, citing higher risk premiums for their credit default swaps after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. "Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit," the bank wrote, adding that the "spike in volatility" may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. Indonesia's 10-year credit default swap, a swap contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield of its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the US election, though they have since dipped. Trump signalled more protective US trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said that Indonesia's economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia's lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. In 2015, then-Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said he had given JPMorgan a sanction that "will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable" after it recommended an "underweight" position on Indonesian bonds. He didn't say what the sanction was. « ‘Equestrian princess’ leads Samsung at centre of scandal Asset Class performances in 2016 » Advert See our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

"After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan's services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank," Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan was already in effect. In an equities research note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan downgraded its investment recommendation on Indonesia to "underweight" from "overweight", citing higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. "Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit," the bank wrote, adding that the "spike in volatility" may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets.

"We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies," Nazara said. "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise". Primary dealers of Indonesian government bonds as of Nov. 25 included Citibank , Deutsche Bank AG , Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited and local lender PT Bank Central Asia Tbk , according to the finance ministry's website. (http://bit.ly/2iKae6n) Indonesia's 10-year credit default swap , a contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield on its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the U.S. election, though they have since dipped. Trump signaled more protective U.S. trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said Indonesia's economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia's lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. Indonesia's central bank said shortly after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates in December that it was on guard against "reversals" of capital flows into the country. However, Fitch Ratings revised in December Indonesia's credit rating outlook to positive, citing a relatively low government debt burden, favorable growth outlook and an improving business environment.

 The 2 big investing tips for 2017 from a JPMorgan strategy chief Lianna Brinded Jan. 3, 2017, 4:27 AM 12,737 facebook linkedin twitter email print Paramount Pictures The chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management has given clients two key tips on how to invest in 2017 — and they are pretty simple. In a brief client note, David Kelly provided two "brief financial resolutions" he said investors should consider this year: 1. Avoid home country bias — Kelly says that there is "the tendency of investors around the world to be over-invested in securities of their own country." 2. Don't focus on past performance — Kelly says investors should not stuff their portfolios with assets that have previously had a stellar run but instead should look at "current valuations and future prospects." "These valuations and prospects suggest more reasons for caution around U.S. stocks and optimism around international stocks than investors have demonstrated over the last few years and particularly over the last few weeks," he said. The FTSE 100, Britain's benchmark share index, hit a fresh closing high on the final trading day of 2016, marking the third time in three days in which the index had broken all-time highs. Google Finance In the US, the S&P 500 was up over 10% across the year: Markets Insider "Investors reflecting upon a politically tumultuous 2016 should actually be fairly pleased by the returns that global asset markets have delivered," Kelly said. "Global equities rose around 10% (with small caps far exceeding that) and global bonds eked out a modest return." Here is the chart from JPMAM: JPMAM Stocks in particular have performed strongly over the past year despite political upheaval from the Brexit vote, the election of a new US president, and a flurry of new elections happening across Europe. Kelly said commodities had been a key driver for the markets despite the shift in the political landscape. "A bounce in commodity prices has been a key driver for markets, helping emerging market equities and allowing credit markets to recover from the distressed levels seen a year ago," Kelly said. "The resilience of economic growth has also been important, pushing unemployment rates in most major countries below the levels at which they started 2016.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Funds News | Tue Jan 3, 2017 | 3:40am EST RPT-Britain avoids M&A collapse as foreign buyers go Brexit bargain hunting (Repeats story published on Dec. 30 with no changes to text) * UK M&A value down from 2015 but in trend * Foreign buyers snap up UK companies with dollars * Goldman, JPMorgan, Lazard top UK dealmaking league * SoftBank-ARM, Twenty-First Century Fox-Sky top two deals By Pamela Barbaglia and Guy Faulconbridge LONDON, Dec 30 Britain avoided a collapse in mergers and acquisitions activity after the shock Brexit vote as foreign companies used sterling's spectacular devaluation against the U.S. dollar to snap up British companies, Thomson Reuters data shows. British M&A totalled $177.5 billion in 2016, down sharply from the record $394.8 billion reached in 2015 - a year when the UK data was skewed by two of three biggest global deals - but was in line with the longer 5-year trend. Total annual mergers and acquisitions values averaged $139.3 billion for the five years to the start of 2015. Britain also retained its place as the third largest M&A market after the United States and China. Behind the headline numbers, there was another clear trend: foreign buyers - such as Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox - shopping with dollars for bargains while domestic UK-to-UK dealmaking fell off sharply. "Brexit should never have been talked up as an Armageddon moment for UK M&A, especially with such a sharp devaluation in the currency which has clearly been a stimulus for overseas buyers," Tim Gee, London-based M&A partner at law firm Baker & McKenzie, told Reuters. "Much of the activity in 2016 was skewed towards foreign buyers with less UK-to-UK activity," Gee said. "Total activity levels were not really knocked that much by Brexit but who was doing the buying did shift - deal values in 2016 are very similar to the historical trend." Inbound M&A was $143.7 billion, again down from 2015 but way above the $85.9 billion annual average for the 5 years to 2015, while domestic M&A was $33.7 billion, down from an average of $53.4 billion over the same period. There were just 1,355 domestic deals - the lowest figure in nearly two decades of Thomson Reuters data. 2015 was a record year for dealmaking involving UK-listed companies thanks to a series of jumbo deals including Anheuser-Busch Inbev's $110.3 billion acquisition of SABMiller and Shell's $53 billion merger with BG Group. BREXIT 'ARMAGEDDON'? The June 23 vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. On the day of the vote, sterling traded above $1.50 but is now trading below $1.23 and fell below $1.15 at one point in October. While opponents of leaving the EU had warned that the United Kingdom's economy would stall and investment stop if voters opted to exit, the data since the Brexit vote has shown the economy was resilient. Just a week after Theresa May entered Downing Street to replace David Cameron as British prime minister, Softbank founder Masayoshi Son made a $30.7 billion move for UK-based chip designer ARM Holdings. "I am one of the first people to bet with a big size on the UK after Brexit," Son, who is ranked by Forbes as Japan's second richest man with a $14.9 fortune, told reporters in London at the time. "Talking is easy. I am proving it...This is my big bet." The second biggest deal of the year was struck by Murdoch: a $14.6 billion deal to buy European pay-TV firm Sky. People familiar with the matter told Reuters the American media corporation pounced after the Brexit vote sent the pound down against the U.S. dollar and Sky's share price tumbling. "The worst predictions surrounding Brexit and its potential impact on our economy have so far failed to materialize," Derek Shakespeare, co-head of UK M&A at Barclays, told Reuters. "With the weaker pound UK businesses have become 10 to 20 percent cheaper." "But the devil is in the detail: we have several years ahead of us to understand what the trading relationship with the EU will look like. So there's a degree of caution when looking at transactions in Britain," he said. "BREXIT MEANS BREXIT" Goldman Sachs, the world's top dealmaker, was top again in Britain's league tables, followed by JPMorgan and Lazard which rose to third place in Britain above Deutsche Bank, UBS, Centerview Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley , Thomson Reuters data showed. "Geopolitical events such as Brexit have impacted CEO confidence for deal-making over the first part of the year and through the summer," said Gilberto Pozzi, co-head of global M&A at Goldman Sachs. "We are now seeing a rebound in M&A activity although boards remain quite cautious in reviewing the opportunities and the pros and cons of M&A transactions," Pozzi said. Barclays' Shakespeare said many private equity funds have recently sold assets and cashed out of high multiples thus boosting their ability to raise funds. So what will happen in 2017? Baker & McKenzie's Gee said he expected low levels of activity among financial institutions and basic materials, resources and commodities while M&A hot spots would include technology, innovation and healthcare. "It will be a mildly better performance next year than this years with overall uptick in deal value," Gee said. "There is a limit to how long you can sit on your hands." Prime Minister May, who has repeatedly used the example of Softbank's ARM purchase as evidence that investors are confident in Britain, has promised to trigger formal Brexit talks by the end of March. But May has given few details about what sort of exit deal she will seek to negotiate. "Investment coming into the UK is down amid uncertainty around Brexit and that uncertainty will linger into next year," said Dwayne Lysaght, head of UK M&A at JP Morgan. "That said, I think uncertainty is becoming the new norm, and the fundamentals for dealmaking remain intact," he said.

British M&A totalled $177.5 billion in 2016, down sharply from the record $394.8 billion reached in 2015 - a year when the UK data was skewed by two of three biggest global deals - but was in line with the longer 5-year trend. Total annual mergers and acquisitions values averaged $139.3 billion for the five years to the start of 2015. Britain also retained its place as the third largest M&A market after the United States and China. Behind the headline numbers, there was another clear trend: foreign buyers - such as Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox - shopping with dollars for bargains while domestic UK-to-UK dealmaking fell off sharply. "Brexit should never have been talked up as an Armageddon moment for UK M&A, especially with such a sharp devaluation in the currency which has clearly been a stimulus for overseas buyers," Tim Gee, London-based M&A partner at law firm Baker & McKenzie, told Reuters. "Much of the activity in 2016 was skewed towards foreign buyers with less UK-to-UK activity," Gee said. "Total activity levels were not really knocked that much by Brexit but who was doing the buying did shift - deal values in 2016 are very similar to the historical trend." Inbound M&A was $143.7 billion, again down from 2015 but way above the $85.9 billion annual average for the 5 years to 2015, while domestic M&A was $33.7 billion, down from an average of $53.4 billion over the same period. There were just 1,355 domestic deals - the lowest figure in nearly two decades of Thomson Reuters data. 2015 was a record year for dealmaking involving UK-listed companies thanks to a series of jumbo deals including Anheuser-Busch Inbev's $110.3 billion acquisition of SABMiller and Shell's $53 billion merger with BG Group. BREXIT 'ARMAGEDDON'? The June 23 vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. On the day of the vote, sterling traded above $1.50 but is now trading below $1.23 and fell below $1.15 at one point in October. While opponents of leaving the EU had warned that the United Kingdom's economy would stall and investment stop if voters opted to exit, the data since the Brexit vote has shown the economy was resilient. Just a week after Theresa May entered Downing Street to replace David Cameron as British prime minister, Softbank founder Masayoshi Son made a $30.7 billion move for UK-based chip designer ARM Holdings. "I am one of the first people to bet with a big size on the UK after Brexit," Son, who is ranked by Forbes as Japan's second richest man with a $14.9 fortune, told reporters in London at the time. "Talking is easy. I am proving it...This is my big bet." The second biggest deal of the year was struck by Murdoch: a $14.6 billion deal to buy European pay-TV firm Sky. People familiar with the matter told Reuters the American media corporation pounced after the Brexit vote sent the pound down against the U.S. dollar and Sky's share price tumbling. "The worst predictions surrounding Brexit and its potential impact on our economy have so far failed to materialize," Derek Shakespeare, co-head of UK M&A at Barclays, told Reuters. "With the weaker pound UK businesses have become 10 to 20 percent cheaper." "But the devil is in the detail: we have several years ahead of us to understand what the trading relationship with the EU will look like. So there's a degree of caution when looking at transactions in Britain," he said. "BREXIT MEANS BREXIT" Goldman Sachs, the world's top dealmaker, was top again in Britain's league tables, followed by JPMorgan and Lazard which rose to third place in Britain above Deutsche Bank, UBS, Centerview Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley , Thomson Reuters data showed. "Geopolitical events such as Brexit have impacted CEO confidence for deal-making over the first part of the year and through the summer," said Gilberto Pozzi, co-head of global M&A at Goldman Sachs. "We are now seeing a rebound in M&A activity although boards remain quite cautious in reviewing the opportunities and the pros and cons of M&A transactions," Pozzi said. Barclays' Shakespeare said many private equity funds have recently sold assets and cashed out of high multiples thus boosting their ability to raise funds. So what will happen in 2017? Baker & McKenzie's Gee said he expected low levels of activity among financial institutions and basic materials, resources and commodities while M&A hot spots would include technology, innovation and healthcare. "It will be a mildly better performance next year than this years with overall uptick in deal value," Gee said. "There is a limit to how long you can sit on your hands." Prime Minister May, who has repeatedly used the example of Softbank's ARM purchase as evidence that investors are confident in Britain, has promised to trigger formal Brexit talks by the end of March. But May has given few details about what sort of exit deal she will seek to negotiate. "Investment coming into the UK is down amid uncertainty around Brexit and that uncertainty will linger into next year," said Dwayne Lysaght, head of UK M&A at JP Morgan. "That said, I think uncertainty is becoming the new norm, and the fundamentals for dealmaking remain intact," he said.

"After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan's services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank," Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan has already taken effect. The decision was taken after JPMorgan issued a note in November downgrading its rating for Indonesian bonds to "underweight" from "overweight," he said. The official said the bank's analysis "did not make sense" because it recommended a "neutral" position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. Adek Berry | AFP | Getty Images "We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies," Nazara said. "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. Business as usual A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said in an email. In a note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan downgraded emerging markets, including Indonesia and Brazil, citing higher risk premiums for their credit default swaps after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. "Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit," the bank wrote, adding that the "spike in volatility" may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. Indonesia's 10-year credit default swap, a swap contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield of its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the U.S. election, though they have since dipped. Trump signaled more protective U.S. trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said that Indonesia's economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia's lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. In 2015, then-Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said he had given JPMorgan a sanction that "will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable" after it recommended an "underweight" position on Indonesian bonds. He didn't say what the sanction was. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook. Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change Indonesia 10-Year --- JPM ---

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 2:30 PM, January 3, 2017 Updated: 5:30 AM, January 4, 2017 JAKARTA/NEW YORK - Indonesia has cut some ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country, the latest in a series of skirmishes between Wall Street banks and governments in emerging markets. Indonesia will no longer use JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked a special designation that allows it to perform certain banking services, Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley <MS.N> in China to Banco Santander <SAN.MC> in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise."

REUTERS/Mike Segar/FilesMore By Nilufar Rizki, Eveline Danubrata and David Henry JAKARTA/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Indonesia has cut some ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country, the latest in a series of skirmishes between Wall Street banks and governments in emerging markets. Indonesia will no longer use JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked a special designation that allows it to perform certain banking services, Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley <MS.N> in China to Banco Santander <SAN.MC> in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise." In 2015, Indonesia's then-finance minister said that JPMorgan had been "sanctioned" for a negative report recommending less exposure to government bonds, but did not explain what the sanctions involved.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 3 January 2017 | MYT 1:51 PM Indonesia ends JPMorgan partnerships on downgrade JAKARTA: Indonesia terminated all business partnerships with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. after the U.S. bank downgraded its assessment of Southeast Asia’s largest economy following Donald Trump’s surprise U.S. election win, according to a report on the Okezone news portal. The finance ministry ended the partnerships from Jan. 1, saying the bank’s November research report downgrading Indonesia to underweight was potentially destabilizing to the nation’s financial system, Okezone reported, citing a letter from Marwanto Harjowiryono, the director general of treasury at the ministry. JPMorgan double-downgraded Indonesia to underweight from overweight in a Nov. 13 report as a “tactical response” to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil to neutral from overweight, while noting that both countries may provide a “better buying opportunity” later. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” it said. Suahasil Nazara, the head of fiscal agency at Indonesia’s finance ministry, didn’t immediately respond to calls to his mobile phone on Tuesday. Foreign investors sold a net $2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policy makers to intervene to stabilize the currency. - Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Indonesia , Economy You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Travel fair targets expats who holiday locally Lat warded for heart problem Do we really need to fear China money?

(Reuters Photo/Andrew Burton) By : Tabita Diela | on 8:28 PM January 02, 2017 Category : Business, Corporate News, Featured [Updated at 10:44 p.m on Monday, Jan 2, 2016 to add an official's comment on JP Morgan's dealing in Indonesia government bonds in sixth paragraph] Jakarta. The finance ministry has cut all partnerships with JP Morgan Chase after emerging markets equity strategists at the multinational banking and financial services company recommended investors to reduce their portfolio investment exposure in the biggest economy in southeast Asia. In a statement dated Dec. 9 and signed by Marwanto Harjowiryono, the director general of treasury at the Ministry of Finance, the ministry said the JP Morgan report can do damage to Indonesia's financial stability. In response, the ministry has revoked JP Morgan's "perception bank" status starting Sunday (01/01) and terminated all its cooperation with the ministry. The perception bank status is awarded to a bank that has been appointed by the finance minister to be a partner of the ministry, providing various banking services including receiving taxation, excise fees and other non-tax revenues. The New York-based investment banking company has also been a traditional underwriter for Indonesia's government bond sales. "In case of non existence of partnership, becoming [bonds main dealer or underwriter] is not possible," Loto Srinaita Ginting, the director for government debt securities at the Finance Ministry's directorate general of budget financing and risk management, told the Jakarta Globe. JP Morgan in November released a report that double downgraded the country to underweight from overweight, after reading a trend that the benchmark US 10-year treasuries offered more attractive yields, which in turn increased risks of fixed-income investment into emerging market countries like Indonesia. The investment banking company also cut Brazil from overweight to neutral and highlighted Turkey as another emerging market that is highly sensitive to such issue. This was the second time in just over a year that Indonesia's finance ministry was infuriated by a JP Morgan assessment. In August 2015, then finance minister Bambang Brodjonegoro issued a strong warning to the investment bank after it published a report that exacerbated panic in the local financial market amid steep US dollar appreciation and currency war concerns in the wake of China's yuan devaluation.  Show More Indonesia finance ministry JP Morgan Chase Indonesia investment outlook Indonesia Tries to Assure Banks They Won't Be Penalized If Research Is "Credible" Finance Ministry Regulation Following Tax Amnesty Program   Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Wall Street’s Favorite 2017 Animal is … the Bear? Posted on January 4, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann The bull has been running wild on Wall Street since Election Day. The Dow is within about 50 points of the vaunted 20,000 mark. And the mood beyond the markets appears to be a good one. In fact, consumer confidence is as high as it’s been in some 15 years. Yet despite the positive backdrop, Wall Street isn’t buying in. That’s the conclusion of a recent article at CNBC.com. It shows that even after post-election animal spirits boosted the S&P 500 to a near-double-digit annual return in 2016, Wall Street’s biggest firms are the most-bearish they’ve been on equities for 2017 since 2005. So, it seems like the favorite animal spirit on Wall Street for 2017 is the bear. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the average S&P 500 forecast among 16 top investment firms calls for a 4.05% gain in 2017. That’s the smallest yearly increase predicted since the beginning of 2005. So, why the relatively negative outlook on stocks here, especially given the current buying mood on the Street? Source: CNBC.com / Bespoke Investment Group The CNBC piece cites comments by JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Dubravko Lakos-Bujas. He is about in the middle of the pack of analysts here, calling for the S&P 500 to finish 2017 at 2,400. Per the CNBC piece: "The prospects of pro-growth policy reforms under the Trump administration (i.e., deregulation, tax reform, fiscal spending) should continue to push the market higher. … However, rising yields and (the U.S. dollar) are the main risks to our positive equity outlook." And there you have it — the push vs. pull of the potential for pro-growth policies from the Trump/Republican government vs. higher interest rates and a higher greenback. *** To that conflict, I would add the possibility of rising inflation. Especially if the aforementioned consumer confidence levels cause people to borrow and spend more money. Then we have the prospect of the Fed hiking rates at least a couple of times in 2017. And possibly more if the economy gets hot … and/or if there is a fiscal stimulus package that revs up GDP and inflation. On the flipside, we have the bullish outlook as articulated by RBC analyst Jonathan Golub. He is calling for a 10.1% move in the S&P 500 in 2017. Per the CNBC article: "Following two years of near-zero growth, we expect profits to re-accelerate … 2018 EPS growth (+9.4%) assumes a 2–3% impact from Trump policies. This placeholder for changes in taxes, regulation, and spending is quite modest, in our view, as an adjustment to corporate taxes alone could easily double this impact." As you can see, there are a lot of "what ifs" wafting about as we settle into the first week of 2017, as well as a lot of conflicting opinions. Fortunately, I don’t think it will take too long to begin finding out how bullish (or how bearish) the smart money is going to view the Trump/Republican administration. With Inauguration Day a little more than two weeks away, I think we’ll start to see this market solidify a bit more by month’s end … so stay sharp, and stay tuned in! *** What do you think the market will do in 2017? Do you think Wall Street is too bearish, not bearish enough, or just about right? I am curious to find out what you think, so please share your thoughts with me by leaving me a comment on our website or sending me an e-mail. *** The markets drifted higher today even as traders dissected the December Fed minutes, particularly the "considerable uncertainty" that the new administration presents. One group that analyzed the text of the minutes, named Prattle, scored the Fed’s language with an algorithm. They determined that the minutes were the most hawkish in two years. The Dow remained within striking distance of 20K in Wednesday’s session, ending the day at 19,942 (+0.3%). • A big post-holiday gain for Weight Watchers (WTW): Shares ballooned 21% after company spokesperson and shareholder Oprah discussed her recent 40-pound weight loss on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" last night. Plus, U.S. News & World Report just put Weight Watchers at the top of its 2017 Best Diets list — which it has done for the previous six years as well. • Final clearance sales, indeed: Macy’s (M) said it is closing 100 stores and eliminating about 10,000 jobs over the next few years. It also said that same-store sales fell 2.1% in November and December. Shares had gained 1.7% in today’s trade but are down more than 10% after-hours. • Kohl’s (KSS) crushed: The retailer also saw a slip in same-store sales over the holidays, and reined in its full-year earnings guidance. The stock gained 4.2% in today’s session but is down close to 14% in after-market trade. Good luck and happy investing, Brad Hoppmann Publisher Uncommon Wisdom Daily Your thoughts on “Wall Street’s Favorite 2017 Animal is … the Bear?” tommr says: January 4, 2017 at 7:31 pm As you all know, the DOW is an index of just 30 large cap stock and it is PRICE weighted! In other words, the DOW does NOT represent the Stock Market as a whole. It is almost meaningless except that it moves generally the same way as the rest of the Market. DOW 20,000 is even more meaningless. Well it is completely meaningless, really! Focus on this number is about as meaningless as the focus that was placed on the “Turn of the Century”! Did that take place with the arrival of the calendar year 2,000 or was it 2001? Didn’t matter. It was meaningless! The number doesn’t mean anything! Reply Frank says: January 4, 2017 at 7:59 pm I’ve been a technical trader for the last 50 years and almost everything I look at has been saying down for the last 12-15 months. Plus people like Bill Bonner, Doug Casey, and others have been saying a big decline is coming and these guys have been pretty good for a long time. Prechter has been saying the Dow is going to way down but I don’t see it happening, not with all the enthusiasm and optimism around the country about Trump’s election. I don’t know. Maybe after 200 years all this technical stuff doesn’t work anymore.

Korea are problematic…..and the dollar is rising to levels that are making American corporations unable to compete in world trade….Does this sound like a bullish scenario? Reply Billy says: January 4, 2017 at 11:05 pm Hi Brad, Interesting comments from Frank above, but the bottom line is technical and cyclical analysis CANNOT be denied long term. Frank, Bill Bonner, Doug Casey, Robert Prechter are ALL right that a major correction is coming. ALL the signs have been there for AT LEAST 15 months. All that is needed now is a rogue wave or black swan event. (anyone say Italian and European Bank Sovereign Debt Crisis???) That is just one of MANY black swans worldwide. The bottom line is that this Trump rally WILL be temporary. One man can simply not change what Larry Edelson has pointed out with technical and cyclical analysis that major problems are there. As Larry says, with $400 TRILLION IN WORLDWIDE DEBT AND LESS THAN 100 PEOPLE/FAMILIES HAVING MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE WORLDS POPULATION. You know the time is getting closer and closer. This next correction, by historical definition HAS TO BE MAJOR just to get back to a more stable and equal financial and capital market situation. We did not even get to the the ultra important DEMOGRAPHICS DISASTER that is spreading beyond Japan and hitting Germany very hard soon. If you don’t have enough marriages and families and children you will NOT be able to grow your economy and capital markets NO MATTER HOW MUCH QE and money printing is done. Go ask the Japanese if you have any doubts Reply mike bazylak says: January 5, 2017 at 2:52 pm I don’t believe that our big firms are factoring in the world and especially Euorpean situation. there is alot of out of country money that can change our situation quickly.

President-elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will nominate Wall Street lawyer, Jay Clayton, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. What’s Clayton’s background? As a defense attorney, he’s worked to get big banks out of trouble when they break the rules. Among others, Clayton has worked for JPMorgan Chase, big Trump lender Deutsche Bank, and, of course, Goldman Sachs—because a Goldman connection seems to be a Trump cabinet prerequisite. Clayton also worked for Bear Stearns, the failed company whose massive stack of toxic loans helped trigger the fiscal crisis. Clayton’s bio shows just how often he worked to arrange a settlement for banks found violating mortgage regulations by DOJ, HUD, FHFA and states. His previous experience with the SEC involves representing oil companies involved in a decade long bribery scandal that ended in a $365 million fine. There’s little doubt that Trump appointed Clayton because he wants to deregulate investment banking. That gave him a big edge over the competition. Clayton beat out former federal prosecutor Debra Wong Yang for the SEC job. While Yang is a star corporate lawyer like Clayton, she earned a reputation for toughness as a prosecutor by taking down a violent drug-dealing gang and investigating financial fraud. Toughness? Investigating financial fraud? Definitely not on the Trump check list. Still, there is something in Clayton’s resume that Trump might not have noticed. Clayton is the co-author of an article calling on the US to create a bipartisan 9-11 style commission on cyber attacks. Clayton’s cyber initiative is titled “We Don’t Need a Crisis to Act Unitedly Against Cyber Threats” and it calls on all parties to come together against the threat that cyber attacks represent. The U.S. President and Congress should appoint a 9-11-type Cyber Threat Commission. This Commission should: Convene the best minds and intents from all sectors and political parties –divorced from self-interest and outside influences — with sufficient power and authority to move quickly and effectively. … Cybercrime remains a “virtually” perfect crime and act of war. It is low risk and high reward. It is agile, cheap and remotely scalable. It morphs and innovates in ways that leave enforcement officials responding to yesterday’s battles. Victims have little or no recourse. And while Donald Trump may be anxious to find fault in those whose email was pilfered, his SEC nominee had a different take. Cyber-attack victims unfairly shoulder the blame. In the “Alice-in-Wonderland” aftermath of cyber-attacks, the perpetrators are often beyond the law and the victimized enterprise stands trial. As “defendants,” they are convicted of knowing that they were attractive, inviting the assault and then failing to fend-off their attackers. Of course, now that he has the whole of Wall Street regulations to play with, Clayton will likely be too busy with his other concerns. x I'm sure Trump campaigned on appointing a Wall Street attorney who represented Goldman Sachs to oversee Wall Street at SEC, right? https://t.co/0Gki9nxqg5— Jesse Ferguson (@JesseFFerguson) January 4, 2017 24 Comments Share this article 51 51 51 24 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Photo/ Bloomberg Photo by Mark Elias. Ever since the US presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face. He brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5 per cent more than anticipated. "My phone is ringing off the hook" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation in the Washington suburb of Manassas, Virginia. "Just the business climate feels like it's getting better." The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong an almost-decade-long sales slump. "You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet," said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business.

Related Content The battle for Obamacare National election promise to create recreational fishing-only zones running behind schedule Your views: Readers' letters Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12 per cent since November 2015, the bank said. More Economy The Economy Hub Business Videos Business Toolbox More Liam Dann It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since November 9, Textron gained 19 per cent, General Dynamics rose 12 per cent and Bombardier jumped 22 per cent. Aircraft sales amount to about 30 per cent of their revenue. "The Trump win looks positive for bizjet demand given the post-election stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-bizjet rhetoric," Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co, wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian planemaker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees "somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates." "Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure - it's all good for our business," he said. "So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic." Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the US Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kansas. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Georgia. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer SA manufactures planes in Melbourne, Florida. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multi-city visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup, which was getting US government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a US$50 million ($71.9m) Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation. In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing "disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation." But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it. "I've noticed that while there's still a huge amount of inventory, people just don't keep dropping the price every week," he said. "You can really feel the floor in the market right now." - Bloomberg Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Mr. Trump announced his nomination of Jay Clayton, a partner in the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, as chairman of the independent agency that oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. If confirmed by the Senate, his responsibilities will include enforcing the scores of rules already written by the agency under the 2010 law that reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 crisis. The law, known as Dodd-Frank, has long been scorned by Republicans and is high on Trump’s target list. Clayton has worked on many of the securities deals that the SEC regulates and has represented Wall Street powerhouses including Goldman Sachs (GS) and Barclays (BCS). Play Video CBS This Morning Trump Cabinet picks contrast Wall Street attacks during campaign As a candidate, Donald Trump was quick to criticize Wall Street, but that's where the president-elect found two key figures for his economic team... He is the latest Trump choice with Wall Street connections. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman executive and more recently ran OneWest bank. Mr. Trump also has tapped Gary Cohn, until recently Goldman’s president, to be his top economic adviser and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Clayton would succeed Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who also had worked as a corporate attorney before being named SEC chair by President Barack Obama. Clayton played a legal role in a raft of major deals. Some of the biggest came in the panicky days of 2008: He represented Goldman in billionaire Warren Buffett’s $5 billion investment in the Wall Street bank, and the teetering Bear Stearns in its rescue sale to JPMorgan Chase (JPM). He worked on a multitude of deals bringing companies public, notably the 2014 U.S. stock market debut of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) -- the biggest IPO ever. In announcing the appointment, Mr. Trump’s transition team said Clayton will encourage investment, “while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries.” “Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority,” the statement said. But some key Democrats were unimpressed with the choice of Clayton. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder,’” said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The committee, with a Republican majority, will conduct Clayton’s confirmation hearing. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis,” Brown said in a statement. Trump will be able to put an even broader stamp on the SEC. In addition to Clayton, he’ll have a chance to name two of the other four commissioners. The five-member body has been down two since December 2015. Two candidates Mr. Obama nominated to fill vacancies, one Democrat and one Republican, have been stalled in Congress over whether they support requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. Rather than offer quick remedies, the complex Dodd-Frank legislation laid down prescriptions for regulators to flesh out. The SEC was responsible for writing a large chunk of the nearly 400 required rules. Overall, federal regulators have completed about 70 percent of the rules more than six years after Dodd-Frank became law. With Mr. Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, a major overhaul of the law is expected, if not an outright dismantling. Republicans also have been pushing the SEC to ease the rules for smaller companies to raise capital in the markets -- an area related to Clayton’s experience. “We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a statement. © 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) ANDREW HARNIK , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By MARCY GORDON / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday chose a Wall Street attorney with experience in corporate mergers and public stock launches as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump announced his nomination of Jay Clayton, a partner in the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, as chairman of the independent agency that oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. If confirmed by the Senate, his responsibilities will include enforcing the scores of rules already written by the agency under the 2010 law that reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 crisis. The law, known as Dodd-Frank, has long been scorned by Republicans and is high on Trump’s target list. Clayton has worked on many of the securities deals the SEC regulates and has represented Wall Street powerhouses including Goldman Sachs and Barclays. He is the latest Trump choice with Wall Street connections. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman executive. Trump also has tapped Gary Cohn, until recently Goldman’s president, to be his top economic adviser, and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Clayton would succeed Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who also had worked as a corporate attorney before being named SEC chair by President Barack Obama. Clayton played a legal role in a raft of major deals. Some of the biggest came in the panicky days of 2008: He represented Goldman in billionaire Warren Buffett’s $5 billion investment in the Wall Street bank, and the teetering Bear Stearns in its rescue sale to JPMorgan Chase. He worked on a multitude of deals bringing companies public, notably the 2014 U.S. stock market debut of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba — the biggest IPO ever. In announcing the appointment, Trump’s transition team said Clayton will encourage investment, “while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries.” “Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority,” the statement said. But some key Democrats were unimpressed with the choice of Clayton. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder,“’ said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The committee, with a Republican majority, will conduct Clayton’s confirmation hearing. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis,” Brown said in a statement. Trump will be able to put an even broader stamp on the SEC. In addition to Clayton, he’ll have a chance to name two of the other four commissioners. The five-member body has been down two since December 2015. Two candidates nominated by Obama to fill vacancies, one Democrat and one Republican, have been stalled in Congress over whether they support requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. Rather than offer quick remedies, the complex Dodd-Frank legislation laid down prescriptions for regulators to flesh out. The SEC was responsible for writing a large chunk of the nearly 400 required rules. Overall, federal regulators have completed about 70 percent of the rules more than six years after Dodd-Frank became law. With Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, a major overhaul of the law is expected, if not an outright dismantling. Republicans also have been pushing the SEC to ease the rules for smaller companies to raise capital in the markets — an area related to Clayton’s experience. “We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a statement.

Economy Federal Reserve Capitol Report Economic Report Columns Darrell Delamaide Irwin Kellner Rex Nutting Tools Economic Calendar Real Estate Location Scouts realtor.com My MarketWatch Watchlist Alerts Games Log In Home Economy & Politics Capitol Report Get email alerts Trump pick for SEC chief may target foreign bribery enforcement By Steve Goldstein Published: Jan 4, 2017 5:13 p.m. ET Share By SteveGoldstein D.C. bureau chief Getty Images The Trump nominee to run the SEC helped list Chinese online retail giant Alibaba at the New York Stock Exchange. Jay Clayton, the Wall Street lawyer picked on Wednesday by President-elect Donald Trump as his nominee to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has such a small public presence that major wire services don’t even have a photograph of him. His public pronouncement at being nominated suggests he wants to ease regulations. “If confirmed, we are going to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America. We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a prepared statement. His profile at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm known in particular for its representation of J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.53% and other Wall Street titans, suggests one area of focus could be reforming the agency’s prosecution of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A 2011 paper Clayton was involved in drafting for the New York City Bar Association complains about the federal government’s broad enforcement of that law. The paper — titled “The FCPA and its Impact on International Business Transactions: Should Anything Be Done to Minimize the Consequences of the U.S.’s Unique Position on Combating Offshore Corruption?” — states that foreign companies are leery of deals that would bring them under the act’s jurisdiction, such as listing on a U.S. exchange in an initial public offering or acquiring a U.S. company in a stock-for-stock exchange. Related story: Trump’s SEC may take aim at corporate disclosure That hasn’t deterred them completely, of course. In 2015, foreign companies represented about 16% of all U.S. public offerings, according to data from S&P Capital IQ, and a similar percentage in 2016 through November. Clayton himself helped represent Alibaba BABA, +0.39% in its New York Stock Exchange listing, which was the largest IPO of all time, not to mention the largest Chinese listing in the U.S. But the SEC has been active in FCPA prosecution. Last year, 27 companies paid $2.48 billion to resolve FCPA cases, the biggest enforcement year in history, according to the FCPA blog. It’s also the types of cases the SEC has brought that have raised some eyebrows. One high-profile case that wrapped up in November was a $264 million fine brought against J.P. Morgan over its “sons and daughters” program in China, wherein the bank gave prestigious jobs to relatives and friends of Chinese government officials to win business. A number of other Wall Street banks — including Deutsche Bank DB, +2.46%  , an institution President-elect Trump does much of his business with — are facing similar charges, according to regulatory filings. Such conduct hasn’t until recently been a target of FCPA prosecutions. Clayton didn’t represent J.P. Morgan in that matter. He did represent Italian oil group Eni in an FCPA case over allegations that it bribed Nigerian government officials with cash-filled suitcases.

(Dick Duane via AP) WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday chose a Wall Street attorney with experience in corporate mergers and public stock launches as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump announced his nomination of Jay Clayton, a partner in the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, as chairman of the independent agency that oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. If confirmed by the Senate, his responsibilities will include enforcing the scores of rules already written by the agency under the 2010 law that reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 crisis. The law, known as Dodd-Frank, has long been scorned by Republicans and is high on Trump's target list. Clayton has worked on many of the securities deals that the SEC regulates and has represented Wall Street powerhouses including Goldman Sachs and Barclays. He is the latest Trump choice with Wall Street connections. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman executive. Trump also has tapped Gary Cohn, until recently Goldman's president, to be his top economic adviser, and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Clayton would succeed Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who also had worked as a corporate attorney before being named SEC chair by President Barack Obama. Clayton played a legal role in a raft of major deals. Some of the biggest came in the panicky days of 2008: He represented Goldman in billionaire Warren Buffett's $5 billion investment in the Wall Street bank, and the teetering Bear Stearns in its rescue sale to JPMorgan Chase. He worked on a multitude of deals bringing companies public, notably the 2014 U.S. stock market debut of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba — the biggest IPO ever. In announcing the appointment, Trump's transition team said Clayton will encourage investment, "while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries." "Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority," the statement said. But some key Democrats were unimpressed with the choice of Clayton. "It's hard to see how an attorney who's spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump's promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from 'getting away with murder,'" said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The committee, with a Republican majority, will conduct Clayton's confirmation hearing. "I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis," Brown said in a statement.

Trump will be able to put an even broader stamp on the SEC. In addition to Clayton, he'll have a chance to name two of the other four commissioners. The five-member body has been down two since December 2015. Two candidates nominated by Obama to fill vacancies, one Democrat and one Republican, have been stalled in Congress over whether they support requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. Rather than offer quick remedies, the complex Dodd-Frank legislation laid down prescriptions for regulators to flesh out. The SEC was responsible for writing a large chunk of the nearly 400 required rules. Overall, federal regulators have completed about 70 percent of the rules more than six years after Dodd-Frank became law. With Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, a major overhaul of the law is expected, if not an outright dismantling. Republicans also have been pushing the SEC to ease the rules for smaller companies to raise capital in the markets — an area related to Clayton's experience. "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs," Clayton said in a statement. __ This story has been corrected to show that Gary Cohn was until recently president of Goldman Sachs, not currently.

(Bill Denver For NY Daily News) BY Adam Edelman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Wednesday, January 4, 2017, 5:02 PM President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Bill Stepien — Chris Christie’s former campaign manager whom the New Jersey governor axed after becoming mired in the Bridgegate scandal — as his White House political director, his transition team said Wednesday. Stepien, who ran both of Christie’s gubernatorial campaigns and who the oversized guv fired after his name came up in emails related to the scandal over the George Washington Bridge lane closures, had been working with the Trump transition team in recent months and had previously worked on the presidential bids of George W. Bush and John McCain. While Stepien’s hire had been expected, it was nevertheless ironic, considering Christie — who had supported Trump quickly after he abandoned his own bid and who became a prominent surrogate for the mogul — will be awarded with no title or responsibilities in the incoming administration. Christie had fallen out of favor within Trump’s circle after he refused to offer a full-throated defense of the mogul following the emergence of a tape showing him making lewd comments about women.

Stepien, who court testimony showed was aware of the alleged plot to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for refusing to endorse Christie's reelection in 2013, was not charged in connection to the lane closures and has denied having any knowledge of them. His appointment Wednesday came amid a raft of other personnel announcements for Trump’s incoming administration, including Keith Schiller, a retired NYPD officer who had been running Trump's private security detail, as director of Oval Office operations. Trump’s transition team said the President-elect will nominate Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as his Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. (BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS) Schiller had led a private security team — which Trump had employed on top of his Secret Service detail — to help protect the President-elect. Vice President-elect Mike Pence promises early Obamacare action If Schiller brings his entire team to the White House, it would mark a radical departure from the standard protocol of having the President rely solely on the Secret Service for protection. Earlier Wednesday, Trump’s transition team announced he would nominate Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as his Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. Chris Christie was left with no role in Trump's administration. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) Clayton is a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who specializes in public and private mergers and offerings, an area that requires expertise on complex securities regulations and corporate governance. Throughout his legal career, Clayton worked on high-profile initial public offerings, and during the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, he worked on major deals involving big banks, including Barclays Capital's acquisition of Lehman Brothers' assets, the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, and the U.S. Treasury Department's capital investment in Goldman Sachs. President Obama addresses the troops one last time As SEC chairman, Clayton would be instrumental in helping to carry out Trump's vows to scale back on financial regulation.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) "Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time," Trump said in a statement. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers." Clayton will be the latest member of Trump's incoming cabinet and cabinet-level advisers whose career was on Wall Street, joining fellow investment honchos Steve Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs partner who is now the Treasury secretary designate; Stephen Bannon, a former Goldman banker who is Trump's chief White House strategist; Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary designate who enjoyed a decades-long career in private equity; and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, who will head Trump’s National Economic Council. Trump still has vacancies for the secretary of agriculture and secretary of veterans affairs posts.

Katz appeared in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, where he admitted to participating in a conspiracy with other bankers to manipulate emerging-market currency trades while working at three different financial institutions from 2007 to 2013. Separately, the Federal Reserve Board said it banned Katz from the banking industry. Katz’s conviction comes one day before five banks are scheduled to be sentenced in connection with the Justice Department’s three-year investigation. The banks -- Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc -- pleaded guilty in May 2015 to charges that their traders conspired to manipulate trading in U.S. dollars and euros. UBS Group AG also pleaded guilty to a related charge. Bloomberg previously reported that the currency-rigging investigation had ex panded to additional chatrooms involving trading in emerging market currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the South African rand. Katz was released on a $150,000 bond to be secured by property in New York’s Delaware County. His travel is limited to New York, Connecticut and London until April 1 when he is to turn over his passport and remain in the U.S. Trading History Katz spent a year as director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading at Barclays beginning in 2010, according to regulatory filings and his LinkedIn profile. He joined BNP Paribas in September 2011 as its director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading, before leaving for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. two years later, the documents show. Before joining Barclays, Katz spent more than nine years at Standard Bank, where he was head of foreign exchange, according to his LinkedIn profile. Prosecutors say Katz was a dealer of central and eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies and conspired to manipulate prices through "non-bona fide trades," coordinating the placement of bids and offers, and agreeing on currency prices quoted to specific customers. Katz has agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation. The conspiracy charge Katz admitted to has a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine, which may be increased based on the proceeds gained or the loss to investors.

It isn’t clear whether Katz had any interaction with Ashton or other members of The Cartel. Those chatroom discussions formed the basis of guilty pleas by four of the banks, which are scheduled to be sentenced Thursday in Connecticut. Barclays, JPMorgan and Citigroup provided evidence of a potential new antitrust conspiracy in the currency spot market that prosecutors say involves different currencies than the ones at the center of their 2015 guilty pleas.

WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday chose a Wall Street attorney with experience in corporate mergers and public stock launches as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump announced his nomination of Jay Clayton, a partner in the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, as chairman of the independent agency that oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. If confirmed by the Senate, his responsibilities will include enforcing the scores of rules already written by the agency under the 2010 law that reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 crisis. The law, known as Dodd-Frank, has long been scorned by Republicans and is high on Trump’s target list. Advertisement Continue reading Clayton has worked on many of the securities deals that the SEC regulates and has represented Wall Street powerhouses including Goldman Sachs and Barclays. He is the latest Trump choice with Wall Street connections. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman executive. Trump also has tapped Gary Cohn, until recently Goldman’s president, to be his top economic adviser, and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Clayton would succeed Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who also had worked as a corporate attorney before being named SEC chair by President Barack Obama. Clayton played a legal role in a raft of major deals. Some of the biggest came in the panicky days of 2008: He represented Goldman in billionaire Warren Buffett’s $5 billion investment in the Wall Street bank, and the teetering Bear Stearns in its rescue sale to JPMorgan Chase. He worked on a multitude of deals bringing companies public, notably the 2014 U.S. stock market debut of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba — the biggest IPO ever. In announcing the appointment, Trump’s transition team said Clayton will encourage investment, “while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries.” “Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority,” the statement said. But some key Democrats were unimpressed with the choice of Clayton. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder,'” said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The committee, with a Republican majority, will conduct Clayton’s confirmation hearing. Advertisement Continue reading “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis,” Brown said in a statement. Trump will be able to put an even broader stamp on the SEC. In addition to Clayton, he’ll have a chance to name two of the other four commissioners. The five-member body has been down two since December 2015. Two candidates nominated by Obama to fill vacancies, one Democrat and one Republican, have been stalled in Congress over whether they support requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. Rather than offer quick remedies, the complex Dodd-Frank legislation laid down prescriptions for regulators to flesh out. The SEC was responsible for writing a large chunk of the nearly 400 required rules. Overall, federal regulators have completed about 70 percent of the rules more than six years after Dodd-Frank became law. With Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, a major overhaul of the law is expected, if not an outright dismantling. Republicans also have been pushing the SEC to ease the rules for smaller companies to raise capital in the markets — an area related to Clayton’s experience. “We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a statement. __ This story has been corrected to show that Gary Cohn was until recently president of Goldman Sachs, not currently.

(Bill Denver For NY Daily News) BY Adam Edelman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Wednesday, January 4, 2017, 5:02 PM President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Bill Stepien — Chris Christie’s former campaign manager whom the New Jersey governor axed after becoming mired in the Bridgegate scandal — as his White House political director, his transition team said Wednesday. Stepien, who ran both of Christie’s gubernatorial campaigns and who the oversized guv fired after his name came up in emails related to the scandal over the George Washington Bridge lane closures, had been working with the Trump transition team in recent months and had previously worked on the presidential bids of George W. Bush and John McCain. While Stepien’s hire had been expected, it was nevertheless ironic, considering Christie — who had supported Trump quickly after he abandoned his own bid and who became a prominent surrogate for the mogul — will be awarded with no title or responsibilities in the incoming administration. Christie had fallen out of favor within Trump’s circle after he refused to offer a full-throated defense of the mogul following the emergence of a tape showing him making lewd comments about women.

Stepien, who court testimony showed was aware of the alleged plot to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for refusing to endorse Christie's reelection in 2013, was not charged in connection to the lane closures and has denied having any knowledge of them. His appointment Wednesday came amid a raft of other personnel announcements for Trump’s incoming administration, including Keith Schiller, a retired NYPD officer who had been running Trump's private security detail, as director of Oval Office operations. Trump’s transition team said the President-elect will nominate Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as his Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. (BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS) Schiller had led a private security team — which Trump had employed on top of his Secret Service detail — to help protect the President-elect. Vice President-elect Mike Pence promises early Obamacare action If Schiller brings his entire team to the White House, it would mark a radical departure from the standard protocol of having the President rely solely on the Secret Service for protection. Earlier Wednesday, Trump’s transition team announced he would nominate Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as his Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. Chris Christie was left with no role in Trump's administration. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) Clayton is a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who specializes in public and private mergers and offerings, an area that requires expertise on complex securities regulations and corporate governance. Throughout his legal career, Clayton worked on high-profile initial public offerings, and during the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, he worked on major deals involving big banks, including Barclays Capital's acquisition of Lehman Brothers' assets, the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, and the U.S. Treasury Department's capital investment in Goldman Sachs. President Obama addresses the troops one last time As SEC chairman, Clayton would be instrumental in helping to carry out Trump's vows to scale back on financial regulation.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) "Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time," Trump said in a statement. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers." Clayton will be the latest member of Trump's incoming cabinet and cabinet-level advisers whose career was on Wall Street, joining fellow investment honchos Steve Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs partner who is now the Treasury secretary designate; Stephen Bannon, a former Goldman banker who is Trump's chief White House strategist; Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary designate who enjoyed a decades-long career in private equity; and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, who will head Trump’s National Economic Council. Trump still has vacancies for the secretary of agriculture and secretary of veterans affairs posts.

The average card rate climbed to 15.36 percent Wednesday after ending 2016 at a record high of 15.29 percent.   It is the third consecutive week the average APR climbed to an all-time high, and all have been for the same reason: Multiple issuers adjusted APRs in response to a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. In mid-December, the Fed hiked its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percent, prompting issuers to increase rates by the same amount. Among the 100 cards tracked by CreditCards.com, 73 followed suit with 0.25 percent rate increases. One issuer, Pentagon Federal Credit Union, cut rates this week. The PenFed Promise Visa now advertises a minimum APR of 8.99 percent, while the PenFed Platinum Cash Rewards card charges a minimum rate of 9.24 percent. Issuers trim perks Consumers who are in the market for a new card may want to apply now before card offers drop in value in the New Year. In addition to hiking rates on new card offers, some credit card issuers are advertising fewer perks on their latest offers. J.P. Morgan Chase confirmed Monday to our sister site, ThePointsGuy.com, that it plans to dramatically size down the famously generous sign-up bonus on the Chase Sapphire Reserve card this month. For now, the super-premium card offers new applicants 100,000 bonus points – worth roughly $1,500 – in exchange for signing up. Beginning Jan. 12, the card issuer plans to halve the offer. New applicants will get 50,000 bonus points, an amount that’s more in line with the bonuses offered by its competitors in the luxe card field. Analysts predicted earlier this fall that the ultra-generous card offers that many consumers were seeing on a wide variety of cards were likely to deflate. According to an October 2016 survey by CreditCards.com, at least six major credit cards offered bonuses worth at least $1,000 or more while many others offered bonuses totaling several hundred dollars. The super generous offers indicated that card issuers were locked in a card rewards arms race for much of 2016; but analysts warned that the bubble in rewards promotions was too expensive to last. According to analysts at Credit Suisse, issuers are also being selective about which cardholders receive advertisements for new rewards. In November, Credit Suisse found that many issuers cut the number of card offers advertising some kind of rewards program. Card issuers also mailed fewer offers advertising a 0 percent APR on purchases, and cut the number of interest-free balance transfer offers consumers received. The average balance transfer promotion did get slightly longer in November, though, indicating that card issuers are still using lengthy promotions to lure customers. The average balance transfer period rose to 14.9 months in November, up from 13.9 months in November 2015. Credit Suisse also reported in a November 2016 research note that it expects card issuers to continue to spend heavily on rewards programs and overall marketing in 2017 as issuers try to attract a wider group of customers.  If so, cardholders could still see juicy rewards and lengthy promotions over the next year. However, the card offers may not be nearly as enticing as they were in the last few months of 2016. CreditCards.com's Weekly Rate Report   Avg.

Trump nominated prominent Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency responsible for enforcing securities laws and proposing new rules. “Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time,” Trump said in a statement, adding, ”We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers.” “If confirmed, we are going to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America. We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a statement. Advising Wall Street A partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP — a prestigious law firm that represents many corporations and financial firms — Clayton has advised companies on numerous mergers-and-acquisitions, private equity transactions, and initial public offerings. While at Sullivan & Cromwell, Clayton advised a number of high-profile deals during the height of the financial crisis. He advised Barclays in connection with its purchase of Lehman Brothers assets, Bear Sterns on its sale to JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs on its $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett, according to his bio. In the wake of the crisis, he represented an unnamed “large financial institution” in connection with the settlement of mortgage-related securities claims with the Federal Housing Finance Agency. He also advised a “large financial institution” in connection with the settlement of mortgage-related claims with the Department of Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and the FHFA. Other financial firms he’s worked with include Ally Financial, AMBAC, Oaktree Capital, Och-Ziff, and Moelis. He also advised Alibaba (BABA) on its $25 billion IPO, one of the largest public offerings ever. During his career, Clayton has received a number of accolades for being among the top lawyers in the business. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s in engineering in 1988. He earned his bachelor’s in economics from the University of Cambridge in 1990. He received his JD from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1993. After law school, he served as a law clerk for Judge Marvin Katz in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1993 until 1995. He was a lecturer for “M&A Through the Business Cycle” at this alma mater between 2009 and 2015. A Cybersecurity Commission One of the fascinating facets of Clayton’s career is his experience in cybersecurity. Clayton helps lead Sullivan & Cromwell’s cybersecurity practice, advising clients who are preparing for risks or responding to breaches. In 2015, he co-authored an opinion piece for Knowledge@Wharton that called for the creation of a Cyber Threat Commission that would be similar to the model of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. The idea would be for the commission to offer recommendations in advance of a crisis. The authors described cybersecurity as a “black elephant,” which is a combination of a “black swan,” an unexpected event with huge consequences, and the classic “elephant in the room” saying. Here’s an excerpt from their opinion piece on what the commission should do: The U.S. President and Congress should appoint a 9-11-type Cyber Threat Commission. This Commission should: Convene the best minds and intents from all sectors and political parties –divorced from self-interest and outside influences — with sufficient power and authority to move quickly and effectively. Recruit beyond national borders — reaching the leading authorities from around the world. Produce a report on the state of the digital union, including an assessment of the risks and a plan for addressing them in plain language that all can understand. Follow the lead of the 9-11 Commission and communications experts in offering the narrative — not a typical government report — that all will want to read and follow. Utilize social media to continue to communicate and gain feedback. There doesn’t have to be a cyber attack to start working on this, the authors noted. — Julia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Jayson Derrick , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} January 04, 2017 1:11pm   Comments Share: Walter "Jay" Clayton is a name many investors aren't familiar with, but this will change very quickly. The Wall Street attorney has been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Financial Experience As noted by Reuters, Clayton is a partner at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. He is an expert on mergers and acquisitions and capital-raising efforts, and he has advised many public and private companies. Clayton also focused his practice on advising clients on how to navigate regulatory and enforcement actions. Clayton has worked on many large deals involving the world's biggest banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Specifically, he worked on Barclays PLC (ADR) (NYSE: BCS)'s acquisition of Lehman Brothers' assets as well as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM)'s acquisition of Bear Stearns. Beyond The Financial Sector Clayton's experience outside of the financial sector include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA)'s initial public offering. "Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time," Trump said in a statement released on Wednesday. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers." Reuters suggested Clayton's appointment is a signal that Trump's administration will scale back regulations that may be counterproductive and restricting corporate growth. For example, CNBC suggested that Trump's administration will scale back on several banking and finance regulations such as Dodd-Frank. "In light of Jay's vast experience in capital formation, his appointment as SEC Chair is a strong positive signal the economy is a top priority of President-elect Trump and his team, and that the SEC will work together with Main Street to meet the country's economic goals of full employment and healthy growth," Jonathan Macey, a professor at the Yale Law School told Reuters.

Jay Clayton, the Wall Street lawyer picked on Wednesday by President-elect Donald Trump as his nominee to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has such a small public presence that major wire services don’t even have a photograph of him. His public pronouncement at being nominated suggests he wants to ease regulations. “If confirmed, we are going to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America. We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a prepared statement. His profile at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm known in particular for its representation of J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.53% and other Wall Street titans, suggests one area of focus could be reforming the agency’s prosecution of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A 2011 paper Clayton was involved in drafting for the New York City Bar Association complains about the federal government’s broad enforcement of that law. The paper — titled “The FCPA and its Impact on International Business Transactions: Should Anything Be Done to Minimize the Consequences of the U.S.’s Unique Position on Combating Offshore Corruption?” — states that foreign companies are leery of deals that would bring them under the act’s jurisdiction, such as listing on a U.S. exchange in an initial public offering or acquiring a U.S. company in a stock-for-stock exchange. Related story: Trump’s SEC may take aim at corporate disclosure That hasn’t deterred them completely, of course. In 2015, foreign companies represented about 16% of all U.S. public offerings, according to data from S&P Capital IQ, and a similar percentage in 2016 through November. Clayton himself helped represent Alibaba BABA, +0.39% in its New York Stock Exchange listing, which was the largest IPO of all time, not to mention the largest Chinese listing in the U.S. But the SEC has been active in FCPA prosecution. Last year, 27 companies paid $2.48 billion to resolve FCPA cases, the biggest enforcement year in history, according to the FCPA blog. It’s also the types of cases the SEC has brought that have raised some eyebrows. One high-profile case that wrapped up in November was a $264 million fine brought against J.P. Morgan over its “sons and daughters” program in China, wherein the bank gave prestigious jobs to relatives and friends of Chinese government officials to win business. A number of other Wall Street banks — including Deutsche Bank DB, +2.46%  , an institution President-elect Trump does much of his business with — are facing similar charges, according to regulatory filings. Such conduct hasn’t until recently been a target of FCPA prosecutions. Clayton didn’t represent J.P. Morgan in that matter. He did represent Italian oil group Eni in an FCPA case over allegations that it bribed Nigerian government officials with cash-filled suitcases.

The pan-European STOXX 600 closed 0.1 percent lower, pulling back from its highest level since December 2015, reached in the previous session. The index was dragged down by a 14.4 percent slump in shares of UK fashion retailer Next, making it the biggest percentage faller on the STOXX 600. The stock has lost nearly 40 percent over the past year. Next's warning put pressure on other high street retailers with UK exposure. Marks & Spencer slumped 6.1 percent and Primark-owner Associated British Foods fell 3.7 percent. The STOXX 600 retail index was down 1 percent, the biggest sectoral faller. "We are already seeing signs of inflation picking up as import prices rise in the wake of sterling's fall," said Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management. "Retailers are likely to respond with price competition, which is likely to put pressure on their margins ... The only question is how much of this is already in the price, given that retailers have underperformed since late 2015. My sense is that further pressure on real incomes is not yet fully discounted." The exception was B&M. The value retailer was the top STOXX 600 riser, up 9.5 percent after reporting record Christmas trading. The STOXX 600 is up nearly 12 percent in the seven weeks since lows hit following the U.S. presidential election, as investors bet that global growth and inflation will rise under President-elect Donald Trump. Euro zone services PMIs provided further evidence of economic strength, as businesses ended 2016 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace for five-and-a-half years. In financials, Credit Suisse rose 3.5 percent following a positive sector note by Barclays. European banks rose 0.6 percent, the top sectoral riser. "The calendar of political events remains full, and economic variables open to a wide range of outcomes, whose ebbs and flows should stimulate trading further in 2017, giving upside to investment bank revenues," Barclays analysts said in a note. UK-listed housebuilders were also among top sectoral gainers, after Deutsche Bank said there was close to 30 percent upside in the sector. Shares in Barratt Developments, Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon rose between 2.8 percent and 4.1 percent, also helped by UK mortgage approvals in November reaching an eight-month high, indicating a post-Brexit recovery. French pharma firm Ipsen hit a record high after Natixis upgraded the stock to "buy" from "hold". It closed 3 percent higher.

Details of the case against Katz haven’t been made public. According to the court documents, the case will be filed as a "criminal information," which is often part of a plea agreement with prosecutors. Bob Knuts, Katz’s lawyer, confirmed his client would appear in court but declined to provide further details. The Justice Department has spearheaded a global investigation into currency-rigging since at least the fall of 2013. In May 2015, four banks -- Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc -- pleaded guilty to charges that their traders conspired to manipulate trading in U.S. dollars and euros. UBS Group AG pleaded guilty to a related charge. Katz spent a year as director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading at Barclays beginning in 2010, according to regulatory filings and his LinkedIn profile. He joined BNP Paribas in September 2011 as its director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading, before leaving for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. two years later, the documents show. Before joining Barclays, Katz spent more than nine years at Standard Bank, where he was head of foreign exchange, according to his LinkedIn profile. The most important market news of the day.

Prosecutors have been investigating allegations that Ashton and a group of other traders participated in an electronic chatroom called The Cartel where they conspired to rig currency prices. Ashton was permanently banned from U.S. banking by the U.S. Federal Reserve in August. It isn’t clear whether Katz had any interaction with Ashton or other members of The Cartel. Those chatroom discussions formed the basis of guilty pleas by four of the banks, which are scheduled to be sentenced Thursday in Connecticut. Bloomberg reported in August 2015 that the U.S. currency-rigging investigation had expanded to emerging market currencies, including the Brazilian real and the Russian ruble.

Trump appeared disciplined -- much unlike past campaign rallies when he broke from his... By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Bank stocks soared after Donald Trump's victory in November. And the sector is off to a hot start in 2017 as investors continue to bet on an unwinding of some of President Obama's Wall Street reforms and more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase hit an all-time high Wednesday. So did shares of several other big and mid-sized banks: PNC, M&T Bank, First Republic, Citizens, Cullen/Frost and SVB -- a bank in California that does a lot of lending to tech startups. Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and even scandal ridden Wells Fargo have all shot up about 2% so far in 2017. So can the rally continue? Investors are clearly hoping that Trump and the Republican-led Congress may be kinder to Wall Street than Obama was. If some of the more onerous regulations of Dodd-Frank are rolled back, that could be good news for many big banks. Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, said that even though the stocks have already shot up on expectations of some regulatory relief, Wall Street's profits forecasts may still be too low for many big banks. "Earnings estimates are only starting to creep up. There is more room to run," Bailey said. He thinks that the likelihood of tax cuts from Trump and Congress will help. And unlike last year, when the Fed only raised rates once despite expectations at the start of 2016 for multiple increases, Bailey believes the Fed will hike rates two or three times this year. That would boost the profits that banks generate from loans. Bailey said PNC and Wells Fargo are two of his firm's top holdings -- even though he concedes that Wells Fargo is in the "middle innings" of cleaning up the fake account mess that hit the company last year and led to its CEO stepping down. Rob Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot Wealth Management, also thinks that big banks could go even higher. He said investors shouldn't be too concerned that the stocks have moved up so quickly. "The bigger issue is that banks have underperformed for a number of years. The strength of the rebound may be unusual, but not crazy. Is there still upside? Yes," he said. Lutts notes that Bank of America and Citigroup still trade below their book value for example -- a key measure for banks. He thinks both banks don't deserve to be that cheap anymore now that the financial crisis of 2008 is well behind them. Lutts added that all of the talk from Trump about boosting growth in the U.S. is another good sign for banks. "There's a new sheriff in town. Investors shouldn't underestimate the importance of that. If just one out of 10 corporate boards in America decides to do more deals because of Trump's policies, that would have a real positive impact for banks," he said. There's a flip side to this domestic focus -- and it may be a significant concern for larger banks. Bailey said Trump's populist rhetoric could pose a problem for big banks that have major operations outside of the U.S. United Technologies, Ford and GM have all been fodder for critical Trump tweets because of business they do in Mexico. It's hard to imagine how Wall Street giants would continue to thrive if Trump wants them to ignore growth potential in emerging markets -- or if, even worse, Trump's policies lead to trade wars. "Protectionism is a risk. Global banks would get squeezed," Bailey said. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(Bill Denver For NY Daily News) BY Adam Edelman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Wednesday, January 4, 2017, 5:02 PM President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Bill Stepien — Chris Christie’s former campaign manager whom the New Jersey governor axed after becoming mired in the Bridgegate scandal — as his White House political director, his transition team said Wednesday. Stepien, who ran both of Christie’s gubernatorial campaigns and who the oversized guv fired after his name came up in emails related to the scandal over the George Washington Bridge lane closures, had been working with the Trump transition team in recent months and had previously worked on the presidential bids of George W. Bush and John McCain. While Stepien’s hire had been expected, it was nevertheless ironic, considering Christie — who had supported Trump quickly after he abandoned his own bid and who became a prominent surrogate for the mogul — will be awarded with no title or responsibilities in the incoming administration. Christie had fallen out of favor within Trump’s circle after he refused to offer a full-throated defense of the mogul following the emergence of a tape showing him making lewd comments about women.

Stepien, who court testimony showed was aware of the alleged plot to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for refusing to endorse Christie's reelection in 2013, was not charged in connection to the lane closures and has denied having any knowledge of them. His appointment Wednesday came amid a raft of other personnel announcements for Trump’s incoming administration, including Keith Schiller, a retired NYPD officer who had been running Trump's private security detail, as director of Oval Office operations. Trump’s transition team said the President-elect will nominate Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as his Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. (BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS) Schiller had led a private security team — which Trump had employed on top of his Secret Service detail — to help protect the President-elect. Vice President-elect Mike Pence promises early Obamacare action If Schiller brings his entire team to the White House, it would mark a radical departure from the standard protocol of having the President rely solely on the Secret Service for protection. Earlier Wednesday, Trump’s transition team announced he would nominate Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as his Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. Chris Christie was left with no role in Trump's administration. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) Clayton is a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who specializes in public and private mergers and offerings, an area that requires expertise on complex securities regulations and corporate governance. Throughout his legal career, Clayton worked on high-profile initial public offerings, and during the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, he worked on major deals involving big banks, including Barclays Capital's acquisition of Lehman Brothers' assets, the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, and the U.S. Treasury Department's capital investment in Goldman Sachs. President Obama addresses the troops one last time As SEC chairman, Clayton would be instrumental in helping to carry out Trump's vows to scale back on financial regulation.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) "Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time," Trump said in a statement. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers." Clayton will be the latest member of Trump's incoming cabinet and cabinet-level advisers whose career was on Wall Street, joining fellow investment honchos Steve Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs partner who is now the Treasury secretary designate; Stephen Bannon, a former Goldman banker who is Trump's chief White House strategist; Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary designate who enjoyed a decades-long career in private equity; and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, who will head Trump’s National Economic Council. Trump still has vacancies for the secretary of agriculture and secretary of veterans affairs posts.

Mr Hazlewood will probably stay with Deutsche Bank in a different role, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public. Mr Hazlewood joined Deutsche Bank in July, after previously working at lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co and HSBC Holdings Plc. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Mr Hazlewood couldn't immediately be reached. Chief Executive Officer John Cryan is trying to resolve the bank's remaining legal battles, following a US$7.2 billion settlement with the US over its role in the sale of mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Deutsche Bank is still being probed by US and UK authorities over whether it failed to catch transactions that may have moved billions of dollars out of Russia from 2012 to 2015, people familiar with the matter have said.  After settling the US case last month, Cryan said in a memo to staff that an internal investigation by the bank had found "no indication of a breach of sanctions" in Russia. The probe did detect "deficiencies" in the bank's systems and controls that were being addressed, according to the memo. Mr Hazlewood currently reports to Deutsche Bank's chief regulatory officer, Sylvie Matherat. News that he was stepping down was reported earlier Wednesday by Manager Magazin.

 Trump's pick to head the SEC has a history of defending big banks Bob Bryan Jan. 4, 2017, 11:05 AM 4,311 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump will nominate Jay Clayton, a Wall Street lawyer, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to transition sources. Clayton, a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell, has represented numerous Wall Street giants and has even defended financial institutions against regulators. According to Clayton's biography on Sullivan and Cromwell's website, he represented multiple banks during the financial crisis including Barclays during its purchase of Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns in its sale of itself to JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs during its investment from Warren Buffett and the US TARP program. Clayton has also represented large financial institutions — as his website puts it — against government agencies such as the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and even the SEC. The various cases include: "A large financial institution in connection with the settlement of mortgage related claims with the DOJ, HUD and FHFA." "A hedge fund in connection with a regulatory review of various credit market transactions." "A large financial institution in connection with a regulatory review of transactions in government securities." Clayton also has experience in capital markets, advising on the initial public offerings of Alibaba, Ally Financial, Oaktree Capital Group, and Och-Ziff. "Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time," Trump said in a statement from the transition. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers." While Clayton, who also was quoted, did not mention rolling back regulation specifically, he emphasized encouraging investment from businesses. "If confirmed, we are going to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America," Clayton said in the statement. "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs." Want to get ahead on Wall Street?

Here are the 21 banks stocks on the S&P 500. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 4, 2017 at 8:48AM To figure out bank stocks, it helps to come up with ways to organize them. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. You can slice and dice bank stocks a number of different ways. In the past, I've done so based on their size, type, how much capital they have, and whether they're considered too big to fail. All of these are good ways to organize the bank industry in your head. There's another way that's also worth considering: looking at which bank stocks are on the S&P 500. S&P 500 selection criteria S&P 500 serves as a screen of the biggest and most profitable banks in the United States. You can get a sense for this by examining the S&P 500's selection criteria. To make the list, a company must, among other things: Have a market capitalization of at least $5.3 billion Have a liquid stock -- a quarter of a million of its shares must change hands each month Be based in the United States And be "financially viable" -- meaning that it must generally earn a profit over the preceding 12 months By using the S&P 500 as a screen for bank stocks, you all but eliminate the risk of investing in a new, untried bank that has yet to prove its mettle through different stages of a credit cycle. So, which bank stocks have made the cut and are included on the world's leading large-cap index? Here are the 21 bank stocks on the S&P 500: Name Total Assets (Millions) Return on Equity (TTM)* Bank of America $2,195,314 6.37% BB&T $222,622 9.09% Bank of New York Mellon $374,114 9.40% Citigroup $1,818,117 7.02% Citizens Financial $147,015 5.00% Comerica $74,124 5.61% Capital One $345,061 8.12% Fifth Third Bancorp $143,279 12.24% Goldman Sachs $879,987 7.68% Huntington Bancshares $100,765 9.40% JPMorgan Chase $2,521,029 10.47% KeyCorp $135,805 6.97% Morgan Stanley $813,891 7.61% M&T Bank $126,841 8.71% People's United $40,692 5.76% PNC Financial $369,348 8.60% SunTrust Banks $205,091 8.32% State Street $256,140 11.33% U.S. Bancorp $454,134 14.26% Wells Fargo $1,942,124 12.78% Zions Bancorp $61,039 6.39% *TTM = trailing 12 months. Data source: Finviz.com and YCharts.com. Banks of different shapes and sizes As you can see, the bank stocks on the S&P 500 come in different shapes and sizes, though, of course, they're all big. The smallest on the list, People's United, nevertheless has a $41 billion balance sheet. You have the nation's four megabanks, all of which have close to or over $2 trillion worth of assets on their balance sheets: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). You have the stand-alone investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Although these are formally bank holding companies, getting charters during the financial crisis in order to have access to the Federal Reserve's discount window, they're focused almost exclusively on investment banking. You have the nation's two biggest custodial banks, Bank of New York Mellon (what I consider to be the most interesting bank in America), and State Street, which serve large institutional customers. You have a smattering of regional banks, including BB&T, Citizens Financial, Comerica, Fifth Third, Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp, M&T Bank, People's United, PNC Financial, SunTrust Banks, U.S. Bancorp, and Zions. And you have Capital One, a monoline credit card company that's only recently transformed into a regional bank. An important caveat Inclusion on the S&P 500 is just one of many things investors should consider when selecting a bank stock for their portfolio. After all, stocks are both added to and subtracted from the index on a regular basis. Prior to the financial crisis, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, National City Corp., and Merrill Lynch were all members of the widely followed index. These banks have since either gone belly-up or were acquired by other banks at discounts to their pre-crisis share prices. Moreover, even banks that have remained on the list have dealt their shareholders serious losses. Bank of America and Citigroup come immediately to mind. Bank of America's stock is still down roughly 60% since its pre-crisis high; Citigroup's shares are off 90%. But for every Bank of America and Citigroup, there's a Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, shares of which have gone on to new highs even in the wake of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. In short, while using the S&P 500 to identify good banks stocks to invest in certainly isn't a panacea, it can be used as an initial screen for beginning investors who are thinking about investing in the sector.

But if you’re a financial stock lover, more of the same will do just fine, thank you very much. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) closed out 2016 in bullish fashion with bank stocks from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) soaring into the Christmas season. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr BAC stock closed out the year with an impressive 31% gain. What’s more, BofA scored the entirety of the gains after the November election. The first 10 months of the year were a bust for the entire financial sector. With higher rates and deregulation on the horizon, the denizens of the Street are buying up bank stocks with abandon. Bank of America has now climbed to an eight-year high. Indeed, the $20 level (which was breached during the post-election buying binge) has sat untouched since BAC shares plunged beneath it during the 2008 meltdown. With mega-resistance now shattered, BAC stock holders are hoping a new bull market has begun — one with the mustard to carry shares higher for years to come. At a minimum, spectators have to admit the weekly price chart of BofA looks better than at any time over the past decade.

Of course, the recent chop can’t be too surprising given how overbought the stock had become following the financial stock explosion. The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New Year Fortunately for would-be buyers, a lower-risk entry is now in the offing. How to Trade BAC Stock Here If you think the good times keep rolling for Bank of America, consider grabbing the BAC April 22 calls for $1.68 or better. Fear has fled in the wake of the rousing rally. And that means options can now be snatched up on the cheap. Your max loss is limited to the initial $1.68 and will be forfeited if BAC stock sits below $22 at expiration. The max gain is unlimited, which means you can continue banking coin on the back of BofA bulls. As of this writing, Tyler Craig owned bullish positions on XLF.

(AAPL) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU) 2 Trades to Play the Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Breakout (or Breakdown) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are on the rise again this morning, as Wall Street is once again on Dow 20K watch. The Dow Jones Industrial Average crept back above the 10,900 mark yesterday, and if investors like what they see in today’s release of last month’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, we could see the Dow challenge 20,000. What’s more, December auto sales will also begin to leak onto the Street today. Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.18%, S&P 500 futures have gained 0.19% and Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.15%. On the options front, volume finally returned to normal levels on Tuesday, with roughly 15.9 million calls and 11.2 million puts changing hands. The heavy skew toward call activity bled over into the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio hit retreated from one-week high to rest at 0.69. The 10-day moving average held at a one-month high of 0.67. Turning to Tuesday’s volume leaders, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) saw record short-term options volume on Tuesday ahead of today’s ex-dividend date and next Friday’s earnings report. Elsewhere, put activity ramped up on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) despite Citigroup’s upgrade to “buy,” while Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) received a bullish lift in sentiment after it cancelled its plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) JPM stock trades ex-dividend today, with shareholders of record as of the close last night receiving a payout of 48 cents per share on Jan. 31. As with all ex-dividend dates, JPM stock was flooded with deep-in-the-money call activity as traders implemented dividend capture strategies. The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New Year That said, some of yesterday’s VZ options volume may have been geared toward next week’s quarterly earnings report. Verizon is expected to post a profit of $1.42 per share on Friday next week, with revenue seen coming in at $23.87 billion. EarningsWhispers.com places the whisper number at $1.47 per share, though given President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of decreased regulation and the Federal Reserve’s threat of three interest rate hikes in 2017, guidance may well be the real driver for JPM stock next week. Still, don’t expect to see options volume similar to yesterday’s activity, where roughly 2.1 million contracts traded with calls snapping up 95% of the day’s take.

COURTESY BLOOMBERG Print Email Comment Tweet Posted: Wednesday, January 4, 2017 9:01 am By Martin Z. Braun Bloomberg News transportation They’re giddy in the private-jet industry at dawn of Trump era (Jan. 3, 2017) financial services Record run for company-bond sales seen screeching to a 2017 halt (Dec. 28, 2016) banking BofA’s Moynihan says businesses are friskier after Trump victory (Dec. 22, 2016) NEW YORK - Bank of America Corp. is extending its lead in the municipal-bond business. The Charlotte, N.C.-based bank held its spot as the top underwriter of U.S. state and local debt for a fifth straight year by overseeing $67.8 billion of sales in 2016, boosting its share of new issues by 2 percentage points to 15 percent, a bigger gain that any other bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup Inc. also captured a larger piece of the business, overtaking JPMorgan Chase & Co. to become the second-largest underwriter. The banks benefited from a record pace of municipal-securities sales after yields tumbled to the lowest on record in July, spurring governments to refinance or borrow for public works before the Federal Reserve resumed raising interest rates, as it did last month. Bank of America was the lead manager for the second-biggest issue of the year, a $2.74 billion sale by New Jersey’s Transportation Trust Fund Authority to finance roadwork. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. served as joint senior managers on the biggest deal of the year, a $2.95 billion general-obligation issue by the state of California, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan’s biggest deal was another $2.65 billion California sale, on which it served as a co-lead along with Bank of America. <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> Selena Morris, a Bank of America spokeswoman, declined to comment, as did Citigroup spokesman Scott Helfman. JPMorgan spokeswoman Jessica Francisco also declined to comment. The pace of municipal-bond offerings are largely projected to decline this year, with refinancing expected to slow because of higher interest rates. Even so, first time borrowing may increase “slightly” as governments whose finances have benefited from the more than seven-year economic expansion pour more money into infrastructure, according to a forecast from Barclays Plc. U.S. state and local governments won approval to sell at least $55 billion of bonds in November ballot measures, debt that governments may start issuing in 2017. The prices Wall Street banks charged U.S. cities and states to sell bonds in 2016 were little changed. Fees averaged $5.21 per $1,000 of long-term bonds compared with $5.08 in 2015. Among the 20 biggest underwriters of such debt, the weighted average disclosed fees ranged from $3.82 for Loop Capital Markets LLC to as much as $10.61 for Robert W. Baird & Co. About three-quarters of the long-term debt issued in 2016 was arranged through so-called negotiated offerings, in which banks are picked ahead of time instead of competing against each other in an auction. One of the firms that boosted its ranking the most was New York City-based Samuel A. Ramirez & Co. The dealer, which has about 80 people in its municipal securities division and was promoted to the ranks of New York City’s senior underwriters, rose 12 places to 14th by managing $6.9 billion of bonds in just 30 deals. In 2016, Ramirez hired Paula Dagen, Morgan Stanley’s former lead banker for New York City and plans to expand “selectively and opportunistically,” said Ted Sobel, head of municipal finance. New York, one of the largest issuers of municipal bonds, plans to sell about $29 billion of debt through June 2020, according to the city’s financial plan. “Our game plan has been very focused on providing great banking work -- ideas, solutions, service, to major clients in core regions and in core competencies,” said Sobel, who joined Ramirez in 2009 after 13 years at UBS Group AG. “We’ve found that’s been a pretty good path to success.” Keywords Bank of America, Rhode Island, Providence, Bank of America and municipal bonds Print Email Comment Tweet Comments No comments on this story | Please log in to comment by clicking here Please log in or register to add your comment Related Stories transportation They’re giddy in the private-jet industry at dawn of Trump era (Jan. 3, 2017) financial services Record run for company-bond sales seen screeching to a 2017 halt (Dec. 28, 2016) banking BofA’s Moynihan says businesses are friskier after Trump victory (Dec. 22, 2016) Popular Most Read 1.

JPMorgan finished 2016 in a dominant position when it comes to Wall Street dealmaking revenue, according to figures from Dealogic. The US bank earned the most in fees in global investment banking, US investment banking, and investment banking in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It also finished the year top of the table for debt capital markets revenue, equity capital markets revenue, and syndicated loans revenue, according to figures from Dealogic. It made more money than its rivals in seven of the 11 product areas and in eight of the 10 most important sectors. Only Goldman Sachs offered much resistance. The US investment bank ranked top for mergers and acquisitions revenue, and it generated the most fees from clients in the industrials and consumer and retail industries. Though based on estimates, these tables are the broadest possible and a closely watched indicator of who is up and who is down. Here's how the banks stacked up this time around.

Indonesia cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co because its research was "not credible and not objective", Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told reporters. Some analysts have said that the decision has raised concern about whether the government would penalise other research providers for reports that are deemed to be negative. Nazara dismissed such worries. "There is no need to be afraid as long as it's credible," he said. "The point is, don't worry, go ahead with an analysis of Indonesia's economy that is as credible as possible, by using the available data and facts." In a note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan analysts downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight", citing higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Indonesia has dropped JPMorgan's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global markets, Nazara said. The U.S. bank is also no longer what Indonesia terms a perception bank. The government said in a 2006 decree that perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. JPMorgan is allowed to continue its business in the private sector, Nazara said. The government assurances are unlikely to dispel the worries. "This has made us more cautious although we'll still try our best to safeguard our research independence," said a Jakarta-based analyst at a foreign bank, who declined to be identified.

Business Bankers in line for their biggest bonuses in years JIM ARMITAGE Wednesday 4 January 2017 10:34 BST Click to follow The Evening Standard Champagne lifestyles: City bankers could soon be celebrating — perhaps in the way depicted by the models posed above Getty Images As the rest of us dread returning to the office after the Christmas break, the feeling for many London bankers is a mixture of fear and excitement. Why? Because, for the City’s biggest US investment banks, back to school means bonus time — that moment when a long walk to the department boss’s office results in you being given your “number”, the figure of how much you’ve made for 2016. The “comp” (compensation) figure can dictate which car bankers will be driving for the next 12 months, the holidays they’ll be having, even what school the children will be attending. Traditionally, Goldman Sachs comes out of the blocks first after it announces full-year profits in the next week or two. It’s the biggest-paying, ballsiest bank in town, and — some say — it sets the bonus benchmark for Wall Street rivals.  After a shaky start, 2016 turned out to be a strong year for most departments, meaning bonuses should follow suit. Says one investment banker: “If you’d asked me nine months ago, you’d have got a pretty miserable response but since that horrible first quarter, things have picked up nicely.” For the first time in years, bond traders should be getting decent bonuses, while the suave investment bankers advising clients on takeovers also had a healthy second half of 2016. In the bond world — stuck since the early years of the financial crisis with what one trader describes as “shite” bonuses — confidence came back with a bang even before Donald Trump’s US presidential election victory triggered hopes of interest-rate rises and a borrowing boom. The Federal Reserve’s positive signals through much of the year gave credit investors a reason to bet again.  Donald Trump named Time's Person of the Year At last, bond traders aren’t cowed by feeling they’re lucky just to have a job. The old implied threat to the boss— pay me right or I’m going down the street to  our biggest competitor — just might re-emerge. As one veteran puts it: “In the old days, the best tactic when getting your number was always to be furious. Whatever it was, you’d say: ‘I don’t call that a bonus, I call that a tip’. You had the power to keep the boss on his toes. But then, for years, it was just ‘thank you for not firing me, sir’. This year, though, perhaps those old days might be coming back again.”  Banks say the percentage of profits they pay out in bonuses is sharply down on a decade ago, that they’ve been through a major retrenchment since the financial crisis, and that their trading arms have cut back on the risk-taking that spurred the bonuses of old. But recent profits suggest many traders should still expect some decent payola. At $2.7 billion (£2.2 billion), Goldman earned  $1 billion more in its market-making division in the third quarter of 2016 than a year earlier. JPMorgan’s markets arm surged by a fifth to $6.5 billion, fuelled by a 48% increase in bond trading revenues, while Morgan Stanley’s bond income leaped from $583 million to  $1.5 billion. So expect a $2 million-$5 million bonus for Goldman’s trading boss Isabelle Ealet, plus more for outgoing bond veteran Michael Sherwood, co-head of Europe, who should — for the sake of appearances — beat last year’s $21 million. Morgan Stanley’s fixed-income boss Jakob Horder will also be in for a big package, as will JP’s Charles Bristow. Some trickle-down economics to boost their staffs’ pay by hundreds of thousands is on the cards, too. Read more Jim Armitage: He ruffled feathers but London owes Goldman’s Woody A flurry of heavyweight mergers and acquisitions — perhaps spurred by Brexit — will be great news for the bank accounts of Goldman’s big dealmakers, including Karen Cook and Mark Sorrell — who can both bank on picking up a few million after advising on big deals such as the bumper Shell-BG merger, which completed during the year.  Paul Baker’s team at Morgan Stanley will have pulled in big money for advising Sainsbury’s on its takeover of Home Retail Group, while Jonathan Bewes’ crew at Bank of America Merrill Lynch will have been major earners after squeezing out a top price for the other side on that deal. Anthony Gutman, who with Sherwood was forced to testify to MPs over Goldman’s embarrassing entanglement with Sir Philip Green’s sale of BHS, will be set for another multi-million-dollar pay cheque for advising ARM Holdings on its takeover by SoftBank. At Morgan Stanley, second after Goldman in the Dealogic M&A league tables for Europe, headhunters predict top dollar for publicity-shy Irishman Colm Donlon. JPMorgan, number two for takeovers in the UK behind Goldman, had a decent year, too — expect heady bonuses for new European vice chair Isabelle Seillier and UK M&A chief Dwayne Lysaght. Notice how they’re all American banks in the roster? No surprise. When it comes to the bulge-bracket banks’ bonuses, Europe’s will be struggling to keep up. Deutsche Bank has been holding back in light of its US fines and Barclays is still sorting out its corporate and investment banking arm. UBS and Credit Suisse, meanwhile, may have been racing up the M&A league tables but they’re still in sackcloth and ashes where bonuses are concerned. Barclays is revamping its investment bank (AFP/Getty Images ) As one Brit working for a US firm says: “For the last few years, US banks have been eating the lunch of European firms in their own backyard. We’re gaining market share, and the share of customers’ wallets that goes with it.” Even in US firms, the poor folks running — or not — stock-market flotations will not have a bonus to remember this year. Revenues have been lousy as uncertainty before and since the Brexit vote has made investors wary of backing new share sales. Pity IPO bankers like Goldman’s Richard Cormack and JPMorgan’s Nicholas Hall, whose names were on the ticket for Misys and TI Fluid Systems, two of the big pulled floats of the year.  But they will be in the minority when it comes to the bonus season. For most, there will be plenty to cheer about as 2017 gets under way. And the taxman, with his 45% cut of all cash paid out, should be raising a glass as well. Boutiques eye rich pickings, too The UK mergers and acquisitions bonuses gold mine hasn’t all gone Wall Street’s way.  Boutique advisory firms set up by veteran investment bankers fleeing their old institutions (and the compliance burden that goes with them) have continued to make big gains on M&A mandates. That’s undoubtedly sucked some of the big European M&A fees from the Wall Street giants. Robey Warshaw, which advised Japan’s SoftBank on buying ARM and the London Stock Exchange  on its Deutsche Börse deal, is increasingly being joined in the rankings by Evercore, where Jane Gladstone’s team advised Michael Spencer on selling Icap’s voice broking business to Tullett, and Centerview, which is advising BAT on its Reynolds merger. A relatively new boutique team burst into town just before Christmas in the form of PJT Partners, where former Morgan Stanley rainmaker Scott Matlock’s long relationship with Sky led to his boutique being hired to advise on the Fox takeover. Says one boutique banker: “Robey Warshaw are brilliant, but it’s good that there’s some proper competition emerging to tackle their dominance on the London boutique scene.” More about: Business Investment Banking Banking Bonuses Goldman Sachs JPMorgan Morgan Stanley Barclays Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Sir Ivan Rogers, one of the UK’s most experienced negotiators, was said by colleagues to be “frustrated” that his warnings about Brexit’s complexity were being ignored by conservative politicians. In a letter to his staff he warned of “muddled thinking” on the EU and urged them to “speak truth to those in power”. Supporters of Brexit, who criticised what they said was Sir Ivan’s “gloomy pessimism” have wasted no time in urging prime minister Theresa May to appoint a pro-Brexit replacement for Sir Ivan. But former officials and diplomats warn it will be difficult to replace one of the country’s most experienced experts on the EU. (FT, Daily Mail, Guardian) In the news Tillerson payout deal Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state will receive a $180m payout to sever ties to ExxonMobil if his selection is confirmed. The pay deal is intended to clear concerns that Mr Tillerson, Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, would have an incentive to favour the company’s interests while serving as the most senior US diplomat. (FT) Backtracking on fracking Environmental charity Friends of the Earth has been forced to withdraw notices about the impact of fracking for shale gas after Britain’s advertising regulator found they could not be backed up with evidence. Energy companies called the decision a victory against “anti-fracking myths” propagated by opponents of the process. In Russia, though, Gazprom Neft, the oil division of Gazprom, the state-controlled gas giant, is going it alone when it comes to trying to deliver a Russian shale energy revolution. (FT) France takes long view on bonds With plans to this week tap an existing 50-year bond that matures in 2066, France is asking bond investors to take the long view in what is expected to be a challenging year for the eurozone’s second-largest economy, as the country braces for a bruising presidential election. (FT) Dolphins given higher porpoise In a last-ditch effort to save Mexico’s vaquita porpoises from extinction, US Navy-trained dolphins will use their sonar to locate the world’s smallest and most endangered porpoise species then advise their handlers of their location. (Guardian) Turkish attacker identified Turkey has identified the gunman who killed 39 people at a nightclub on New Year’s Eve, according to the country’s foreign minister. Mevlut Cavusoglu stopped short of identifying him but said the attack was staged by “professionals”. His comments came as the Turkish parliament is set to extend a state of emergency that has been in place since a coup attempt in July for another 90 days. (Jazeera, FT) It’s a big day for The Fed The US Federal Reserve will release minutes from its final meeting of 2016, during which it raised interest rates for the second time in a decade. Food for thought China’s economic future Fears last January that a plunging stock market and currency were the death knell for China’s economy in 2016 proved to be misplaced. Yet despite the likelihood GDP grew last year by close to the government’s target of 6.5 per cent, there are still concerns the country’s fundamental economic challenges have yet to be addressed. (FT) Investing in 2017 The overwhelming probability is that the world economy will grow in 2017, writes the FT’s Martin Wolf. But while political risk did not have a huge effect on economic outcomes in 2016, that could change in 2017. The full repercussions of Donald Trump’s win, Brexit, the oil market and China’s debt will all affect markets. FT reporters have compiled the most pressing market issues facing investors in 2017. (FT) Putting out fires with half the water Fires in Indonesia during 2015 were the worst since 1997, forcing the state-run airline Garuda Indonesia to cancel more than 400 flights. One Japanese soap maker is taking on the annual forest fires on by developing a foam agent that is easier on the environment by using less water. (NAR) Rethinking diet drinks If diet drinks are your new year solution to shedding excess weight, think again. Scientists have found that people who switch to sugar-free fizzy drinks may eat more because they feel that they are being healthy and still crave sweet foods. The academics criticised drinks companies for marketing sugar-free alternatives as healthy and encouraged people to stick to water. (Times) No elites here The word “elite” has become one of the most effective partisan political stereotypes of our age. But what started out as an aspirational concept was transformed thanks to a conservative movement to redefine the term away from class and towards culture.

Business Home LBoard Would you live near a cemetery? Robin Augustin Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Indonesia penalises JPMorgan for ‘underweight’ rating Reuters | January 4, 2017 The official said the bank's analysis "did not make sense" because it recommended a "neutral" position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. JAKARTA: Indonesia has penalised JPMorgan Chase & Co after the investment bank’s research arm recommended a smaller exposure to the country’s stocks. “After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan’s services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank,” Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry’s fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan has already taken effect. The decision was taken after JPMorgan issued a note in November downgrading its rating for Indonesia to “underweight” from “overweight,” he said. The official said the bank’s analysis “did not make sense” because it recommended a “neutral” position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. “We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They’ve explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It’s not that we think we’re so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries’ economies,” Nazara said. “Our mindset is, if you’re doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don’t create unnecessary volatility to create business,” he added. Business as usual A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” she said in an email. In the note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan equities analysts downgraded emerging markets including Indonesia and Brazil, citing higher risk premiums for their credit default swaps after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. “Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit,” the bank wrote, adding that the “spike in volatility” may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a “tactical” response to Trump’s victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. Indonesia’s 10-year credit default swap, a swap contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield of its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the US election, though they have since dipped. Trump signalled more protective US trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said that Indonesia’s economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia’s lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. In 2015, then-Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said he had given JPMorgan a sanction that “will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable” after it recommended an “underweight” position on Indonesian bonds. He didn’t say what the sanction was. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story. We welcome your opinions to allow a healthy debate.

Picture: Reuters London — Paris could lure as many as 20,000 workers from Britain’s finance industry with the exodus potentially starting within weeks as the UK begins its withdrawal from the EU, according to Europlace, the French capital’s lobby group. Paris will make its case to London-based executives in a series of February meetings as it competes for talent with rival cities such as Frankfurt. Europlace’s marketing materials show it will extol how Paris already employs more than 180,000 financiers, is home to the region’s biggest bond market and boasts the second-largest pool of asset managers. The continental race to take advantage of Brexit is heating up as British Prime Minister Theresa May plans to trigger the start of negotiations by the end of March. Global bank chiefs have warned they will soon start shifting operations and jobs from the UK to elsewhere in the EU unless she can protect their easy access to its market.

World 23 days ago Tis the season for talk of black swans, market trends and bold calls for 2017 It looks as if it will be up to governments to blow life back into the global economy. This is one of the ideas mooted as market pundits try to gauge ... Markets 25 days ago "We feel decisions will be taken in the first semester of the new year," Arnaud de Bresson, Europlace’s MD, said in an interview in London. "We see institutions are accelerating their process of thinking." With time at a premium, bankers say they want to establish new or expanded offices in the EU before the UK leaves, which is currently set for sometime in 2019. May says she wants to strike the best possible deal for banks, yet has not detailed what she will seek and has declined to fully endorse the transitional phase industry wants to smooth the departure. Selling Points In the run-up to the June referendum, HSBC Holdings said that it planned to move as many as 1,000 employees to Paris from London if voters backed Brexit, while Citigroup is now considering relocating some of its London-based equity and interest-rate derivatives traders to Frankfurt. TheCityUK lobby group warns that almost 70,000 jobs are up for grabs. JPMorgan Chase & Co could, in "some scenarios," move 4,000 jobs away from the UK because of Brexit, CEO Jamie Dimon said in an interview with Financial News published Tuesday, reiterating a figure he laid out before the vote. Dimon said the shift would take place over several years and could be accelerated if an interim agreement on banking services is not reached. Ireland Interest The state agency for winning investment in Ireland said on Tuesday the country is among a small number of European locations being studied by firms to mitigate risks from Brexit. IDA Ireland says it has received a "significant volume" of queries from firms in the UK, US, and Asia since the referendum vote. Europlace will argue Paris is better placed than other aspirants for London’s crown. It touts the city as the top hub in continental Europe for interest-rate swaps trading with some $141bn of the derivatives changing hands in France every day. That compares with $1.18-trillion in the UK. It will also promote itself as a city of requisite skills, contrasted with Frankfurt employing fewer than 100,000 people in finance and Dublin just 30,000. Another asset in its eyes is that French corporations are typically based in Paris, whereas German ones are sprayed around their country. Although it hosts some of Europe’s biggest banks, including Société Générale and BNP Paribas, France has nevertheless long lagged behind the UK and Germany as an international hub for banking. The country is perceived as hostile to financial companies and ranks 29th in the Global Financial Centres index, only one spot above Casablanca. Even its stock exchange, Euronext, is threatened by Deutsche Boerse’s planned takeover of London Stock Exchange Group, which would create Europe’s dominant market operator. France’s tight labour laws have also put off banks that value longer work weeks and an employment regime that allows easy hiring and firing. Bloomberg Please login or register to comment.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript U.S. stocks rose on the first trading day of 2017, extending the post-election rally. Tech and telecom stocks led the charge. Financials climbed after Barclays raised price targets on JPMorgan Chase and other banks. Wunderlich Securities' Art Hogan: SOUNDBITE: ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, WUNDERLICH SECURITIES (ENGLISH) SPEAKING: "The markets opened here this morning with a couple of tailwinds. Both Asian markets and European markets were doing better and we saw some economic data that came out today that was better than expected. So we still have some wind behind our backs in this market." Strong U.S. manufacturing data drove the dollar index to a new 14-year high. Factory activity rose to a two-year high in December. Construction spending increased in November. General Motors stock rose even though U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to slap what he called a "big border tax" for making some Chevy Cruze cars in Mexico. Ford's stock also rose. It's scrapping its plans to build a $1.6 billion plant In Mexico. The move comes after Trump harshly criticized the automaker for its Mexican investment plans. Sprinting higher: Nike. Jefferies named the stock of the athletic footwear maker its best new idea for 2017, anticipating a rebound in the basketball category. In Europe, financial and commodities stocks powered major indexes to new highs. But the German DAX finished flat.

Cramer said investors simply asked too much of stocks when they have already skyrocketed to new highs. Many will need to take a breather after running higher in 2016. "After year's remarkable run, many of the market's leaders have already given us all they've got," the "Mad Money" host said. The five top performers of the Dow in 2016 were Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth, JPMorgan, Chevron and Caterpillar. Caterpillar was up 36 percent last year. The company managed to gain control over its destiny through innovation, supply chain management and reining in its dealer network. However, Cramer fears that a strengthening dollar and China's growth could hurt Caterpillar. Timothy A. Clark | AFP | Getty Images JP Morgan Chase World Headquarters on Park Avenue in New York. "I think JPM's the biggest winner of the five, and it's the one I would bet on if you believe that the Trump rally is far from finished." -Jim Cramer "If you buy CAT here, you have to believe that numbers come up, not down, and as much as I have championed the stock, I think it has given you all it has to give, at least for now, unless Trump issues $500 billion in 50-year Make America Great Again bonds where the money is earmarked to purchase only U.S. made products," Cramer said. The second best performer was UnitedHealth, up 35 percent last year. While Cigna and Anthem, and Humana and Aetna were busy trying to merge, UnitedHealth stood out to Cramer as the one company to challenge the Affordable Care Act when it spoke publicly against the healthcare exchanges. Hence, Cramer expects President-elect Trump to call on UnitedHealth to help redo healthcare, which could be a great business opportunity. "UnitedHealth is the most likely to become a two-year dynasty," Cramer said. The third was Goldman Sachs, which rallied 32 percent, and Cramer thinks the stock could roar higher in 2017. He suspects that "Goldman can go back to being Goldman." Meaning, a company that makes money with its own money and gets a premium for being clever. And with the Republicans in full control of Congress, Cramer expects that criticism from anti-Wall Street Senators like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren won't have as much impact on the stock. Fourth was Chevron, which soared 30 percent last year. The company is viewed as the most aggressive of the major oil companies since it cut back on spending and maintained its dividend, and became the new blue chip of the group. "All I can tell you is that Chevron is the one trading in lockstep with oil, but I suspect that oil is stick here for a bit … So I wouldn't bet on a huge run beyond the stock's current recovery," Cramer said. The last winner on Cramer's list was JPMorgan, and it was also up 30 percent. This was Cramer's No. 1 stock for 2017, as it could benefit big time if the Fed raises interest rates multiple times in 2017. It could also be a beneficiary of deregulation. Even better, if the U.S. economy grows the way Trump promised, it will be one of the few stocks that can make profits without pressure on earnings from a strong dollar. "Suffice it to say, I think JPM's the biggest winner of the five, and it's the one I would bet on if you believe that the Trump rally is far from finished," Cramer said. Ultimately, Cramer was willing to bless Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth and JPMorgan as stocks that have more room to run, while Chevron and Caterpillar may need to pause. Questions for Cramer?

Xerox and Conduent split, begin trading separately By ANDREA DECKERT Rochester Business Journal January 3, 2017 Xerox Corp.’s decision to split into two public companies was the top local business story of 2016, Rochester Business Journal readers and staff agreed. Xerox Corp. on Tuesday reported the completion its separation of Conduent Inc., creating two publicly traded companies. The news, along with stock upgrades, resulted in a nearly 16 percent increase in Xerox’s stock price. Shares of Xerox (NYSE: XRX) were trading midday at $6.65, up from Friday’s close of $5.75, adjusted post-split. In Monroe County, Xerox employs some 5,500 workers; Conduent has slightly more than 600 local employees. Credit Suisse Group AG Tuesday upgraded Xerox stock to outperform from neutral; JP Morgan Chase & Co. upgraded the business to overweight from neutral. “Today is an historic day for Xerox,” CEO Jeff Jacobson said in a statement. “The successful completion of the separation sharpens our market focus and commitment to our customers.” Under the terms of the separation, on the distribution date of Dec. 31, Xerox shareholders received one share of Conduent common stock for every five shares of Xerox common stock they held as of the close of business on Dec. 15. In connection with the spinoff, Xerox received a cash transfer from Conduent of $1.8 billion, which it intends to use, along with cash on hand, to retire approximately $2 billion in debt, Xerox said. Members of the company’s executive leadership team, employees and customers are to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Conduent shares (NYSE: CNDT) were down roughly 6 percent at $14.01 in early afternoon trading. CEO Ashok Vemuri rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

Wall Street's consensus S&P 500 forecast calls for a little more than a 5 percent gain in 2017, the smallest increase predicted since a 2.8 percent forecast heading into 2005, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Source: Bespoke Investment Group (Note: The Bespoke table is from before the final trading day of the year. Adjusting for the S&P 500's actual 2016 close of 2,238.83, the consensus forecast equals a 5.5 rise.) The bearishness has many investors feeling good about the prospects for the new year. History bears that contrarian viewpoint out as the strategists' consensus forecast turned out to be too bearish for 6 of the last 8 annual periods during this bull market, according to the chart above. Here are the 2017 forecasts by firm: Source: Bespoke Investment Group JPMorgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas is near the middle predicting the S&P 500 will rise to just 2,400 by the end of the year. In his outlook note last month, the strategist captured the opposing forces causing Wall Street sages to be more cautious than the trading crowd: "The prospects of pro-growth policy reforms under the Trump administration (i.e., deregulation, tax reform, fiscal spending) should continue to push the market higher. ... However, rising yields and USD are the main risks to our positive equity outlook. This week's incrementally hawkish tone from the FOMC meeting is raising the hurdle for both expanding equity multiple and corporate profitability. ... Historically, a 6% rise in trade-weighted USD pressures S&P 500 EPS by roughly 2-3%." Bull markets tend to end with this group overly bullish, not bearish. For example, they expected an 11.1 percent increase in the S&P 500 in 2008, a year when a bull market ended with a plunge in the index of almost 40 percent because of the housing crisis, according to Bespoke. For the bullsish strategists, this year is a simple one to forecast. They argue that Trump's tax cuts and economic policies are going to lead to higher earnings and stock prices follow profits. Here's what RBC's Jonathan Golub, the only strategist calling for a 10 percent or greater S&P 500 gain this year, wrote in a note last month. "Following two years of near-zero growth, we expect profits to re-accelerate ... 2018 EPS growth (+9.4%) assumes a 2–3% impact from Trump policies. This placeholder for changes in taxes, regulation, and spending is quite modest, in our view, as an adjustment to corporate taxes alone could easily double this impact. ... We believe multiples will advance more quickly than earnings over the near term, as analysts wait for clarity on Trump policies before adjusting estimates." In a rare spot for the firm, Goldman Sachs is tied for being the most bearish on Wall Street. Goldman's David Kostin said in a note this weekend he doesn't believe Trump can deliver all that he has promised, even with a Republican-led Congress: "S&P 500 will rally to 2400 in 1Q 2017 alongside enthusiasm over corporate tax cuts, but budget constraints will limit the magnitude of tax reform and fiscal spending and the index will fade to 2300 by year-end." Bespoke doesn't just number crunch, it uses those historical figures to give a market outlook to clients as well. The firm is on the cautious side for 2017, believing that this bull market doesn't have the fundamental underpinnings to be one of the greatest of all time. What the firm wrote in its 2017 outlook note last month: "The S&P 500 has now been up on a total return basis for eight straight years of which we have been mostly bullish over that span. The all-time record for consecutive up years is nine (1991-1999), so another year of gains would tie that record, which would be great. We hope that 'Everything that's wonderful is sure to come your way,' but our concern is that there will at least be some trouble along the way. Markets typically climb a wall of worry, but right now there doesn't seem to be much of it around." For a group constantly accused of being perma-bulls, the 2017 outlooks are quite tepid. Recent history shows strategists have underestimated this bull market from the start. Given the gains on Tuesday, investors are betting they are doing it once again.

That's because credit card issuers have begun to respond to the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate hike last month by boosting rates on credit card offers. I began tracking variable rate offers in November on 14 cards from popular credit card issuers in anticipation of the rate increases. All of those cards now have higher rates -- both on the low and high end of the ranges you see when applying for a card. RATE SEARCH: Look now for a low-interest credit card offer. The issuer determines your interest rate within the range based on your creditworthiness at the time of application. Increased rates on both ends of the credit spectrum means excellent credit won't provide you an escape from higher APRs. Every issuer I surveyed that has increased annual percentage rates since the Fed meeting has done so by the same 0.25 percent the central bank increased its benchmark interest rate. Credit card interest rates on the rise Credit card APR range as of Nov. 28, 2016 APR range as of Jan. 3, 2017 American Express Blue Cash Everyday 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% BankAmericard Cash Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Venture Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Quicksilver Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Freedom 14.24% to 23.24% 14.49% to 23.49% Chase Slate 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Sapphire Reserve 16.24% to 23.24% 16.49% to 23.49% Citi Simplicity 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Double Cash 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Thank You Preferred 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Diamond Preferred 12.24% to 22.24% 12.49% to 22.49% Citi Prestige 15.49% 15.74% Discover it Card 11.24% to 23.24% 11.49% to 23.49% Wells Fargo Visa Signature 12.4% to 26.24% 12.65% to 26.49% Source: Issuer websites The only issuer among the ones I tracked not showing a rate change on its website: JPMorgan Chase. A spokeswoman for the bank's credit card division said its rates increased on Dec. 20, but had not yet been updated on marketing materials. Still, the impact of these rate increases across all cards hasn't yet been felt. Bankrate surveys 131 credit cards across 50 different issuers each week. As of the last week of 2016, the average variable interest rate was 16.27%, a slight increase over the previous week, although it's not even the high-water mark for the month. Impact on existing balances If you don't plan to apply for a new card in the new year, you're still not immune to a rate hike. While the Credit CARD Act of 2009 bans most retroactive rate increases, it does allow issuers to adjust APRs on variable rate cards tied to an index. Most cards are tied to the prime rate, which increases or decreases based on the Fed's own rate adjustments. CARD SEARCH: Delay your own personal interest rate hike by grabbing a good balance transfer card. Your credit card agreement will spell out how soon after the prime rate changes that you can expect a rate hike on your card. The most recent credit card agreements the issuers of the 14 credit cards I tracked filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau show generally you should feel the hike soon -- if you haven't already. The agreement for the Chase Freedom card, for example, says it will use the prime rate as published two business days before the end of each billing cycle. "If the U.S. Prime Rate changes, we’ll apply the new variable APR starting from the first day of the Billing Period when we take the U.S. Prime Rate from the (Wall Street Journal)," according to the agreement. My most recent American Express statement -- dated Dec. 22, little more than a week after the Fed increased rates -- already showed a change in my APR. The issuer bumped my interest rate from 17.49% APR to 17.74% APR. This isn't a big deal for me because I pay in full every month. But for others, this hike may pinch. Late payments could increase Prior to the rate hike, the credit bureau TransUnion calculated that a 0.25 percentage point rate hike would increase the average monthly payment on adjustable rate accounts by $6.45. Most consumers will be able to handle that additional cost, but 9.3 million Americans are expected to feel "payment shock" that could lead to late payments and defaults, TransUnion found.

By SueChang Markets reporter RyanVlastelica Markets reporter SueChang Markets reporter RyanVlastelica Markets reporter U.S. stocks on Tuesday started the first trading day of 2017 on a positive note but closed off of intraday highs as oil prices turned sharply lower, puncturing some of the initial exuberance that underpinned an early rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow DJIA, -0.03%  rose 119.16 points, or 0.6%, to close at 19,881.76. The blue-chip index had gained as much as 176 points at one point during the session. Nike Inc. NKE, +0.99%  and Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.25%  were among the biggest gainers while Travelers Cos. Inc. TRV, +0.26% and McDonald’s Corp. MCD, -0.49% were notable laggards. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.18% also finished off its best levels, adding 19 points, or 0.9%, to end at 2,257.83. The index had been up as much as 25 points in early morning action. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.48%  climbed 45.97 points, or 0.9%, to close at 5,429.08. “Stocks started with a bit of a rally as the market tried to make up for some of the losses from last week,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. However, the strong start out of the gate soon fizzled as oil turned weak. Crude futures CLG7, +0.29%  fell more than 2% after jumping as much as 2.6% as a deal by OPEC to limit output went into effect. The choppy action was the latest reminder of how the market has struggled in recent sessions with the Dow unable to break above 20,000, a key psychological milestone that some analysts see as a resistance level for the market. “Once you get closer to 20,000, historically it’s been hard to get through on the first pass,” said Kepner. Still, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion’s share of the market’s postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth. That thesis is still viewed as intact, although the size and speed of the recent rally could lead investors to take profits. “There are people who say things are getting pricey, but corporate fundamentals are there. Even if Trump’s policies don’t come to fruition, I think the fundamentals are strong enough to keep the market rising,” said Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co, who said he was “fairly optimistic” about U.S. stocks. Read: Stock-market bulls wary of new-year hangover In addition to Trump’s policies, investors will be monitoring the president-elect’s Twitter feed, which he has used to take shots at specific companies. On Tuesday, he criticized General Motors Co. GM, -0.45% in a tweet, writing that the company “is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” While the stock fell in premarket trading, it subsequently turned higher, rising 0.9%. The tweet followed similar statements against Boeing Co. BA, +0.34%  and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +0.76%   “Trump is making it both easy and difficult for stock pickers,” said Andersen. “We’re getting surgical precision when it comes to commentary on specific companies, but we’re still getting our sea legs with how to interpret this data. It could be more symbolic than concrete in its meaning, but we don’t know. We’re in a steep learning curve with him.” In other company news, Xerox Corp. XRX, +1.59%  jumped 20% after Credit Suisse upgraded the company to “outperform.” What Trump's North Korea tweets mean(1:36) U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter again to plant a foreign-policy flag—this time on North Korea. Other markets: Equities rose across the globe, with Asian markets higher after encouraging Chinese manufacturing data and European stocks building on their gains from Monday, when U.S. markets were closed for the New Year’s holiday. A key dollar index DXY, +0.10% traded 1% higher while gold futures GCG7, +0.38%  settled up 0.9%. Economic news: In the latest economic data, the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index climbed to 54.7% in December from 53.2%. The reading was higher than expected, and the highest level in two years. Separately, a read on construction spending rose 0.9% in November, above expectations and the sixth increase of the past seven months.

Morgan Chase & Co. "There will be more concerns about the yuan," said Andrew Sullivan, managing director of sales trading at Haitong International Securities. China set the yuan USDCNY, -0.0551%  0.2% weaker against the U.S. dollar Tuesday amid broad global gains for the greenback. Tuesday's yuan fixing was the first to incorporate an expanded foreign-currencies basket, which now includes the Korean won and Saudi riyal. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.50%  closed up 1.2%, Korea's Kospi SEU, -0.52%  edged up 0.9% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, -0.86%  closed up 0.7%. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average NIK, -0.75%  was closed for holiday. Chinese stocks jumped during trading Tuesday, buoyed by signs of economic recovery, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -0.79%  finishing up 1%. China's December Caixin manufacturing PMI came in at 51.9. This was up from 50.9 a month ago, and the strongest level since early 2013. However, the Chinese market is dogged by persistent concerns of capital flight — concerns that are evident in rounds of regulatory tweaking. The People's Bank of China recently tightened its supervision of money transfers by individuals in China as part of its anti-money-laundering efforts. The central bank also lowered the threshold on the size of transactions that banks need to disclose to the PBOC — a move that analysts said should help reduce outflows. Speculation was also percolating over the weekend that Beijing would sharply limit Chinese citizens' ability to use their US$50,000 annual quota to convert yuan into foreign currencies, if they intended to use the money to invest offshore or buy overseas property. China's foreign-currency regulator clarified that this was always the case, but that it would pay more attention to enforcement of the rule. The rules do not stop investing by Chinese in Hong Kong stocks through the Connect scheme. The Shanghai Stock Exchange on Tuesday halted trading of China's 50-year government bonds due to "abnormal fluctuations," shortly after its price tumbled more than 10%. The bond's price tumble was unusual but analysts refrained in reading too much into it, as the ultralong bond is illiquid. The last time this bond traded was in mid-December, according to Pin Ru Tan, director of Asia-Pacific rates strategy at HSBC in Singapore. "Is the news surprising? Yes, to a certain extent. But it's consistent with what we've seen with the selloff in the interbank market," said Ms. Tan, adding that there was "nothing particularly alarming" about this latest development. Indonesia's government on Tuesday cut its business partnerships with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.53%  , pointing to a recent country downgrade by the U.S. bank. Indonesia's Finance Ministry said in a letter that, effective Jan. 1, it was ending all partnerships with J.P. Morgan due to research that could "potentially create disturbances in national financial system stability." Indonesia's stock market dropped 0.4%. Macau casino shares saw selling Tuesday. Sands China 1928, -0.86%  was down 0.3% and Galaxy Entertainment 0027, -0.56%  was off 1.3%. Fresh data showed gambling revenue in the enclave fell 3.3% to 223.2 billion patacas ($27.9 billion) last year, though revenues rose about 8% year-on-year in December.

You may be surprised to learn how many Bank of America customers prefer smartphones over bank branches. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 3, 2017 at 12:42PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. One of the things Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) points out whenever it gets the opportunity to do so is that a growing share of its customers are using its mobile banking app to do things they once did at one of its branches. According to Bank of America's latest data, it has 34 million active digital accounts -- online plus mobile -- with more than 21 million of those being active mobile users. Given that the North Carolina-based bank serves approximately 47 million consumer and small business customers, this means that 45% of them actively use its mobile app. This is a big deal because it's significantly cheaper for a bank to service customers by way of a mobile app than it is to service them in a branch or even through an ATM. Bank of America estimates that an automated deposit costs 90% less than an assisted deposit. Figures from JPMorgan Chase back this up. The nation's biggest bank by assets says it costs $0.65 to handle a deposit transaction in a branch, $0.08 per transaction conducted on an ATM, and just $0.03 per mobile deposit. The fact that Bank of America's customers are so readily adopting its mobile banking app has thus allowed the bank to meaningfully cut its expense base. The average cost per $100 in deposits has dropped by 34% since 2010, the bank noted earlier this year, going from $2.61 to $1.71 as of the first quarter of 2016. The main way this helps Bank of America is by allowing it to close branches. Over the past seven years, since CEO Brian Moynihan took the reins, Bank of America's branch count as declined by 20%, going from just under 6,000 branches at the beginning of 2010 down to approximately 4,600 today. Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author. Not coincidentally, this has also enabled Bank of America to reduce the number of people it employs. At the beginning of 2011, it employed the equivalent at 288,000 people. Today, that's down to only 209,000. And both of these trends should continue, leading to further cost savings at Bank of America. In the third quarter of this year, active users of its mobile app grew by 15.8%. That's less than the nearly 20% growth rates from a few years ago, but it's still impressive given that nearly half of its customers already use the app. With all of this in mind, and given the fact that 68% of deposit transactions at Bank of America are now done either on a mobile app or ATM, it makes sense why the bank's executives are so confident that they can continue cutting expenses.

Investors should purchase JPMorgan Chase shares because its financial results will top expectations in 2017 due to a better business environment and Donald Trump's agenda, according to Barclays, which reiterated its overweight rating on the bank. "We are attracted to JPM's competitive positioning and believe it has addressed a great deal of its litigation concerns. We see the greatest sources of potential upside being driven by higher loan growth and capital markets," analyst Jason Goldberg wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. "JPM is our new top pick." Goldberg raised his JPMorgan Chase price target to $100 from $79, representing 16 percent upside from Friday's close. The shares rose more than 30 percent in 2016 with most of those gains coming after the election.

(Photo: American Club) The American P&I Club was founded in New York nearly a century ago. To celebrate its first 100 years, a book entitled The American Club: A Centennial History has just been published.   The book tells the story of the Club across ten decades of maritime and marine insurance history both within the United States and across the world. Its author is Richard Blodgett, a former Wall Street Journal reporter whose previous credits include histories of the New York Stock Exchange, Kohler and Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.   The American Club was founded in February, 1917. War was raging in Europe when the Club began. At that time, P&I insurance was available primarily from clubs in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. In consequence of UK government trade-related sanctions which had been imposed on certain US shipowners in 1916, the American Club was established to provide a reliable source of coverage in the United States.   The Club was the brainchild of W. H. LaBoyteaux, President of Johnson & Higgins, the leading US marine insurance broker in the United States at that time. The Club was an immediate success, enjoying the support of many of the foremost US steamship companies.   The size of the American merchant marine fluctuated in the 1920s and 1930s. It grew during World War II, but entered a prolonged period of decline thereafter. In the decades from 1950 onward, the worldwide merchant fleet grew steadily. But nearly all that growth was taking place outside the United States.   Although the Club only admitted its first foreign-flagged member in 1980, it had ambitions of further international growth over the years which followed. These ambitions gained momentum in 1995 when the Club implemented a major strategy for growth and diversification.   Entitled Vision 2000, it called for new leadership, the expansion of the Club’s membership internationally, the establishment of overseas offices, the development of new insurance lines and many other initiatives designed to place the Club at the forefront of its industry peers.   In 1998 the American Club became a full member of the International Group of P&I Clubs. This alliance of leading insurers provides outstanding security and technical resources to the maritime community. It also supports the industry's broader interests as one of shipping's most influential voices.   Today, the American Club is thoroughly international in scope, offers the broadest range of marine insurance products and is larger and more successful than ever. On the threshold of its centennial year, Members domiciled outside North America account for about 85% of the Club’s insured tonnage.   Joe Hughes, Chairman and CEO of the American Club’s managers, Shipowners Claims Bureau, Inc., also commented: “Today the American Club is thoroughly international in scope, offers a broad range of marine insurance products and is larger and more successful than ever. At present, members domiciled outside North America account for some 85 percent of the Club’s insured tonnage. What was founded in 1917 as an American Club serving the American steamship industry has successfully recast itself as an American Club serving the global maritime community, building on the enduring values of its long traditions.” Email Related News REINTJES to Debut Hybrid Step-up Gearbox Power train specialist REINTJES will kick off 2017 by demonstrating its new BAE HybriGen Zero system during the Electric… Prysmian: CNP-1 Subsea Link Launched in Philippines Prysmian Group, world leader in the energy and telecom cable systems industry, announces the successful commissioning of… Initial EU Ship Recycling List Shows Clear Need for Global Mind-set The European Commission recently published its first edition of the EU list of approved ship recycling facilities.

News Trump Has Private-Jet Makers Feeling Optimistic About Market Private jet makers are optimistic that business will take off under President-elect Trump. (©Maksym Dragunov - Fotolia/stock.adobe.com) BLOOMBERG NEWS 1/03/2017 Reprints Ever since the U.S. presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face. Dahlberg brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5% more than anticipated. "My phone is ringing off the hook" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation Inc. in Manassas, Va. "Just the business climate feels like it's getting better." The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong a sales slump of almost a decade. "You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet," said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business. Bigger Sales In 2008 Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12% since November 2015, the bank said. It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron (TXT) gained 19%, General Dynamics (GD) rose 12% and Bombardier Inc. jumped 22%. Aircraft sales amount to about 30% of their revenue. "The Trump win looks positive for (business) jet demand given the postelection stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-(business) jet rhetoric," Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian plane maker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees "somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates." "Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure — it's all good for our business," he said. "So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic." North America Jobs Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kan. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Ga. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer (ERJ) manufactures planes in Melbourne, Fla. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multicity visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup (C), which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation (DASTY). In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing "disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation." But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it. "I've noticed that while there's still a huge amount of inventory, people just don't keep dropping the price every week," he said. "You can really feel the floor in the market right now."

Home Market Wall Street opens 2017 with big gains as banks surge Wall Street opens 2017 with big gains as banks surge Wall Street made big gains on Tuesday, its first day of trading in 2017, with all eyes on the Dow Jones Industrial Average as it zeroes in on the historic 20,000 mark. By: Reuters | Published: January 3, 2017 10:05 PM   Wall Street opens 2017 with big gains as banks surge. (Reuters) * Brent crude nears $60 as output cut deal takes effect * Banks stocks gain on Barclays price target raise * Xerox top gainer on S&P after separation of Conduent * Indexes up: Dow 0.72 pct, S&P 0.72 pct, Nasdaq 0.71 pct Wall Street made big gains on Tuesday, its first day of trading in 2017, with all eyes on the Dow Jones Industrial Average as it zeroes in on the historic 20,000 mark. After coming within a hair’s breadth of the milestone in December as part of a post-election rally, the Dow was trading just 0.46 percent shy of the psychological milestone. The Dow rose 13.4 percent in 2016 – its best performance in three years – registering strong gains in the past two months as investors bet that Presidential-elect Donald Trump would introduce market friendly policies such as tax cuts and simpler regulation. Banks were the main drivers of the gains on Wall Street on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 financial sector rising 1.33 percent. Barclays raised price targets on several Wall Street banks including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. Goldman Sachs rose 1.5 percent to $243.50 and was the top stock on the Dow. Feeding Wall Street’s gains were oil prices, which hit an 18-month high as a deal to cut output took effect on Sunday, and upbeat China factory data. The dollar index was on a tear, notching its best day in nearly three weeks at 103.37, while higher inflation data sent European stocks to a one-year high.

No pricing details were given in the filing, but the offering is valued up to $150 million. The company intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol BBRX. The underwriters for the offering are JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank. This year has been dismal for IPOs, but prospects could pick up next year. With 2017 just around the corner and markets reaching new highs, it looks like even more IPOs are coming. This is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel long-acting medications for serious disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). Braeburn’s proprietary implantable and injectable delivery mechanisms provide differentiated solutions for chronic diseases with high unmet medical needs. The company’s specialty CNS focus is on fast-growing therapeutic areas recognized as serious public health crises, where long-acting technologies offer important benefits such as increased medication compliance, improved patient convenience, reduced risk of abuse and relapse and reduced public health and societal costs. Braeburn’s lead therapeutic area is opioid addiction, which affects 2.6 million people in the United States across all socioeconomic groups. A 2016 survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates that nearly half of all Americans know someone who suffers from opioid addiction. The company has one approved product, Probuphine, a six-month buprenorphine implant for the maintenance treatment of opioid addiction, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2016. In November 2016, the company reported positive top-line results from a Phase 3 trial of weekly and monthly CAM2038, an injectable formulation of buprenorphine, for opioid addiction. CAM2038 achieved non-inferiority compared to oral daily buprenorphine based on the primary endpoint and superiority to oral daily buprenorphine based on a secondary endpoint. Other therapeutic areas of focus are pain, schizophrenia and spasticity, which refers to feelings of stiffness and a wide range of involuntary muscle spasms. The company has four additional late-stage product candidates in its pipeline across different therapeutic areas, as well as two earlier-stage product candidates. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for the commercialization of Probuphine, and the advancement of product candidates in clinical development. The remainder will fund ongoing research and development activities, working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 3 January 2017 | MYT 11:09 PM Wall St opens 2017 with big gains as banks surge At 9:40am ET (Tuesday), the Dow was up 143.1 points, or 0.72%, at 19,905.7. The Reuters photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan. NEW YORK: Wall Street made big gains on Tuesday, its first day of trading in 2017, with all eyes on the Dow Jones Industrial Average as it zeroes in on the historic 20,000 mark. After coming within a hair’s breadth of the milestone in December as part of a post-election rally, the Dow was trading just 0.46% shy of the psychological milestone. The Dow rose 13.4% in 2016 - its best performance in three years - registering strong gains in the past two months as investors bet that Presidential-elect Donald Trump would introduce market friendly policies such as tax cuts and simpler regulation. Banks were the main drivers of the gains on Wall Street on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 financial sector rising 1.33%. Barclays raised price targets on several Wall Street banks including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. Goldman Sachs rose 1.5% to US$243.50 and was the top stock on the Dow. Feeding Wall Street’s gains were oil prices, which hit an 18-month high as a deal to cut output took effect on Sunday, and upbeat China factory data. The dollar index was on a tear, notching its best day in nearly three weeks at 103.37, while higher inflation data sent European stocks to a one-year high. At 9:40am ET (1440 GMT), the Dow was up 143.1 points, or 0.72%, at 19,905.7, the S&P 500 was up 16.11 points, or 0.72%, at 2,254.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 38.05 points, or 0.71%, at 5,421.16. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 indexes were higher, with the defensive real estate and consumer staples sectors bringing up the rear. Utilities, another defensive sector, was the only one in the red.
