 A bunch of cycling enthusiasts just helped Peloton Cycle raise $325 million — betting it could be 'the Apple of fitness' Matt Turner May 24, 2017, 5:40 PM 4,084 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson Peloton, the indoor-fitness company, has raised $325 million from investors including Wellington Management, Fidelity Investments, Kleiner Perkins, and Comcast NBCUniversal. The deal, likely to be the last financing round before the company goes public, was put together by a number of cycling enthusiasts. The company is on a steep-growth curve: It has tripled annual revenue, to $170 million, in just a year, and has 100,000 paying subscribers. Noah Wintroub picked up the phone and cold-called Peloton Cycle founder and CEO John Foley. A vice-chairman at JPMorgan, Wintroub had ordered a Peloton Cycle indoor bike. Convinced that Foley had built a great product, he wanted to get to know the company better. "If you've used the product, you get it, innately," Wintroub told Business Insider. "It's like 'Oh my god, these guys are the Apple of fitness.'" Fast forward 18 months or so, and Peloton Cycle closed a $325 million financing round, with the likes of Wellington Management, Fidelity Investments, Kleiner Perkins, and Comcast NBCUniversal pouring money into the company. JPMorgan was sole placement agent for the offering. Wintroub worked on the deal with another cycling enthusiast, Eric Stein, who is head of North American investment banking at JPMorgan. The Series E financing round valued the company at around $1.25 billion, making it a unicorn. Peloton Cycle is built around indoor cycling from the home. It has 22 showrooms around the country, and two studios — a flagship in Manhattan and a studio in Chicago. Customers can choose from a variety of live classes and archived classes. The bike costs $1,995, and unlimited classes cost $39 a month. Some Business Insider employees have tried the bike. The company is vertically integrated, making its own hardware, producing a tablet computer and the bike it sits on, and software, with 75 software engineers in New York City. It produces 12 hours of live television content a day, and sells through its own retail stores. It also delivers its own bikes in some cities. “Peloton is a cultural phenomenon and has redefined what it means to build a connected experience disrupting multiple industries simultaneously: in home fitness, boutique class fitness and connected media devices," said Jon Callaghan, cofounder of True Ventures, another investor in the firm. The new funds will go towards upping the number of retail stores it has, toward 40 by the end of the year, according to Foley, and extending in-house delivery to 10 markets, up from three right now. It also plans to sign a lease on a 30,000 square foot space in Midtown or Downtown Manhattan in the next few months, and to turn it into a fitness facility. "We believe Peloton is the leader in a new business that has significant potential – Physical Interactive Media,” Mary Meeker, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, said in a statement. The $325 million fundraiser was bigger than expected and included the sale of both primary equity, or new shares, and existing shares. Foley said he didn't expect there to be another placement, but that that didn't mean an initial public offering was on the immediate horizon. "We're very well capitalized to have options over the next several quarters," he told Business Insider.

The robo-adviser—the largest among independent digital advice startups that popped up after the 2008 financial collapse—has overhauled its entire brand. The shift in marketing and advertising strategy is aimed at attracting more affluent customers just now becoming aware of the option. It’s also not a coincidence that Betterment’s pivot comes as more traditional players such as Vanguard Group Inc., Charles Schwab Corp., and even JPMorgan Chase & Co. are starting to use more technology when offering investment advice. In other words, the robo-adviser pie is about to expand, and Betterment wants to make sure it gets a bigger piece. “These are fundamental decisions about who we are as a company,” Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jon Stein said in an interview. “We’re attracting a lot of affluent customers already, but I think our voice—as we speak to that person—has to show we are established.” Late last year, Citigroup, which has invested in Betterment through its venture capital arm, sent clients a research report voicing skepticism about just how large assets under management could grow for robo-advisers when it comes to wealthier individuals. “Higher net-worth or more sophisticated investors will, in our view, always demand face-to-face advice,” wrote Citi analysts led by Ronit Ghose. But Betterment says that’s not the case, explaining it already has a number of customers with more than $10 million under management each. On top of its redesign, the firm is thinking about adding access to more exclusive products. “People do want access to alternatives, and that’s something we see demand for among the mass affluent,” Stein said. Betterment doesn’t disclose how many of its accounts are held by accredited investors (who would be allowed by regulators to participate in complex investments such as hedge funds, venture capital, or private equity) but said it’s well more than 25,000 of its 250,000 customers. Some on Wall Street are already moving to stake a claim. Although JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon didn’t say last year how much money the bank has put into building its robo-adviser, he did say roughly $600 million was devoted to “emerging fintech solutions” and that technology is an extremely important part of the company’s future strategies. For Betterment, this is the second big change in 2017. Earlier this year it introduced a new fee structure and added more certified advisers, also in an attempt to draw in wealthy customers as well as younger individuals who will have major financial decisions to make in the next 5 to 10 years, such as buying a home. While affluent individuals are a big part of this new push, the firm said its mission is still to attract people spanning the financial spectrum, and that was a part of the research process that went into the redesign. “We looked at people across the range in age and income,” said Elyssa Gray, vice president in charge of brand at Betterment. “Regardless of the level of experience or the amount of money they had, there were a number of common denominators when it comes to financial services.” A big part of that was taking out financial jargon the firm said irked some customers.

 JPMorgan: Geopolitical fear is at its highest point since the Arab Spring due to Trump Oscar Williams-Grut May 24, 2017, 4:56 AM 889 facebook linkedin twitter email print In this May 10, 2017 file photo, President Donald Trump talks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Associated Press/Evan Vucci "Geopolitical anxiety looks extremely high," JPMorgan said in a note sent to clients on Tuesday. The investment bank said that: "Since President Trump's election, news coverage around topics such as war, terrorism and cyberattacks has surged, reflecting perceptions that Republican Presidents are more assertive abroad than Democrats, and President Trump's call for a rethink on his predecessor's foreign policy." JPMorgan proposed: "a daily Geopolitical Anxiety Index (GAI) to measure complacency and fear, and to recommend tactical positioning at the extremes (hedge when anxiety/volatility are low, fade when fear/volatility are high)." The GAI index measures the number of news stories about ten different geopolitical risk topics and the current reading shows that anxiety is at its highest point since the Arab Spring in 2011: JPMorgan JPMorgan analyst John Normand looked at how geopolitics tends to affect asset performance by examining historical data back to the 1980s and found four key takeaways: "geopolitics impacts global markets materially about twice a decade but local/regional markets more frequently; "retracements of crisis-induced price moves come within one to three months on average, but can be much longer when oil supply disruptions are larger; "volatility surges pre-crisis and does not always collapse on Day 1; "sample averages obscure huge ranges for various events." While geopolitical anxiety is not quite as high as it was during the Iraq War or September 11th, JPMorgan says it still looks high by historical standards. Despite this, the VIX — a volatility measure often called the "fear index" — is at its lowest level in years. This suggests traders aren't paying much mind to the increase in reports about geopolitical risks. Normand says that crisis cycles are inconsistent and usually have "dynamics which are unique and therefore difficult to model based on the apparent, historical norm." As a result, he doesn't recommend using the GAI on its own as a basis for making trades. Instead, he says, investors should use the GAI to "distill history, construct an intuitive hedging/trading rule, but overlay judgment." In short, it's a useful data point but you shouldn't blindly follow it. NOW WATCH: Crocs has a new comeback plan — here's why it could actually work Loading video...

However, with innovative entrepreneurs making moves and an economy that is ready to reclaim its former glory, the Motor City is poised for an impressive resurgence. And if you need some convincing, JPMorgan Chase as 150 million reasons to believe in this Michigan gem. In tandem with Detroit Startup Week powered by Chase for Business, JPMorgan Chase has announced they will be increasing their initial investment in the economic recovery of Detroit to $150 million by 2019. This announcement comes after the original $100 million, five-year investment turned out to be two years ahead of schedule. Pretty impressive for a place once known as the largest US city to ever declare of bankruptcy. “Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase, in a press release. “This collaboration allowed us to speed up our investment and extend our commitment over the next two years. Going forward, I hope business, government and nonprofit leaders will see Detroit’s comeback as a shining example of how to put aside differences and work to find meaningful and innovative solutions to our most pressing economic problems.” The goal of this investment is to build upon the city’s progress, create livable, inclusive, and sustainable neighborhoods, arm residents with the skills needed for high-quality, well-paying careers, and provide small businesses with the capital they need to succeed. JPMorgan Chase has invested $107 million in loans and grants in Detroit’s economic recovery, including $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small business expansion, and $6.9 million in additional transformative investments. “JPMorgan Chase has been a true partner in our work to restore economic growth and opportunity in Detroit,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. “The firm’s investments have enabled thousands of Detroiters to receive training, created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and revitalized neighborhoods. There is more work to do, and I hope our continued partnership will build a thriving economy for all Detroiters.” Economic challenges are no stranger to Detroit. But this investment, along with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Motor City, is another step in the right direction. It will utilize everything in Chase’s arsenal to strengthen underlying organizations and create system-wide changes that will improve citywide workforce development strategy. Before you know it, this Michigan city will be the thriving economy we all know and love.

Madrigal May 24, 2017 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Over the last 20 years, the technology industry has become the most powerful industry in the world, boasting seven of the 20 most profitable companies. Last year, Apple literally doubled the profits ($53.4 billion) of the second-most profitable company, J.P. Morgan Chase ($24.4 billion). And when it comes to market value, tech companies sweep the top five: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. These companies are not only huge and profitable; they’re also growing. By most measures, though not all, this power is concentrated in one specific region, the Pacific Coast, and even more tightly centralized in the San Francisco Bay Area. Incredibly, three of those five most valuable companies are located in three adjacent little towns in Silicon Valley. The total distance from Facebook in Menlo Park to Alphabet (née Google) in Mountain View to Apple in Cupertino is just 15 miles. These companies—with apologies to Intel, Oracle, and Cisco—have become the Big Three of Silicon Valley. Detroit had a Big Three for decades: General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. They were also amazingly profitable, industry-leading, and birthed a global industry. In the late 1950s, these three companies had over 90 percent market share in the U.S. car market, which was also the world’s largest. Now, companies from a similarly small region occupy a similarly dominant role in the economy, which has powered economic growth over the last several decades. But a comparison between Detroit’s Big Three and Silicon Valley’s shows how much the economy around any individual company or place has changed. * * * Investors now value tech as they once valued automotive (and oil) companies. It was the IPO of the decade. Thousands of people flocked to brokers hoping to get their hands on some of the paper from one of the century’s most innovative and respected companies. Finally, finally, the common person could share in the wealth generated by the genius of … Ford. The year was 1956, and Ford, privately held since its inception by the Ford family and (later) the Ford Foundation, was accessing the public markets. More than 10 million shares went on the market and were immediately snatched up by hundreds of thousands of investors at an opening price of $64.50. The Ford Foundation made $642.6 million in the sale. It was the biggest IPO ever, as befit the automotive industry, which was the biggest in everything around the mid-century. Likewise, at the time Ford went public, the true behemoth of the American economy, General Motors, was the nation’s most valuable stock, running $263.27. And for good reason. These companies make a ton of money. In the second (1956) edition of the Fortune 500, Ford held the third slot in revenue and profit. That year, the company made $437 million dollars. General Motors took the top spot by becoming the first company to break $1 billion in profit that year ($1.19 to be exact). Only 16 companies even made $100 million in 1956. Chrysler was the least profitable of those companies, eking into the echelon with $100.1 million in profits. The only rival the car industry had was the oil industry, which had the number-two company on Fortune’s list, Exxon Mobil, as well as seven others in the top 20 most profitable companies. All this to say: making cars and fueling them dominated the American profit-making enterprise. Hell, even the two big tire manufacturers were among the top 35 profit-makers of 1956. Cars were national. Tech is global. But there are crucial differences between Detroit’s Big Three and Silicon Valley’s. One is that Silicon Valley’s companies are fully global enterprises. Since 2015, the majority of Facebook’s ad revenue comes from overseas. Apple crossed that threshold in the first quarter of 2010, and now roughly two-thirds of the company’s revenue comes from abroad. Google, too, has long made a majority of its money outside the U.S., though its home country represents nearly half its revenue. In fact, all the money that these companies are making overseas is one reason why they are valued so highly, Harvard Business School’s Shane Greenstein told me. “Since the election, the markets have factored in a presumed ‘tax holiday’ that allows firms to repatriate their foreign earnings without U.S. taxes,” Greenstein said. “That especially shapes the values of Apple and Google.” Since the election, Facebook is up 11 percent, Google is up 21 percent, and Apple is up a gobsmacking 34 percent. Perhaps this is even more remarkable, given that tech company employees gave Hillary Clinton 60 times the money they gave to Donald Trump ($3 million to $50,000). The tech labor force is a tiny fraction of the automotive industry’s. The other crucial difference is that tech’s leading companies employee far fewer people than Detroit’s Big Three did. This point can be made in the single chart above,  but it’s worth unpacking in three ways. One, even though the big industrial giants did employ a lot of people, by the 1950s they were already automating away some of the jobs that they’d just created by building huge factories. “Between 1948 and 1967—when the auto industry was at its economic peak—Detroit lost more than 130,000 manufacturing jobs,” the historian Thomas J. Sugrue has written. To me, that’s startling. This was the absolute golden age of manufacturing, yet in the seat of the most important industry, companies were shedding jobs. Two, the car companies’ employees were far more concentrated in Detroit and the surrounding cities than the tech companies’. Apple only has 25,000 employees in the “Santa Clara Valley.” Google likely has around 20,000 at its home. And let’s call it at around 6,000 Facebook folks in Menlo Park. Three, the tech companies have many, many, many subcontractors, from content moderators in the Philippines to manufacturing people at Foxconn in China to custodians on their own campuses to bus drivers dragging people up and down from San Francisco. The way modern companies work, they try to keep employees off their own balance sheets unless absolutely necessary, especially lower-wage workers. The original Big Three were the motive power for a whole region’s economy. By employing so many people at decent wages, they created broad-based prosperity. In Silicon Valley, the wealth that the Big Three create goes to a much smaller slice of the population, building wealth for thousands instead of hundreds of thousands of workers. In 2016, Facebook generated $600,000 of net income per employee. That is to say, the tech world, for all its disruptions, is a supercharged example of how the American economy as a whole works right now: The skilled and the already rich make huge amounts of money, and everyone else gets the leftovers.

I was 11, a typical American kid, before I realized who she was. The ashes filled a black plastic box about the size of a toaster. It weighed three and a half pounds. I put it in a canvas tote bag and packed it in my suitcase this past July for the transpacific flight to Manila. From there I would travel by car to a rural village. When I arrived, I would hand over all that was left of the woman who had spent 56 years as a slave in my family’s household.

But a new clinical approach offers hope. This is a good day, Samantha tells me: 10 on a scale of 10. We’re sitting in a conference room at the San Marcos Treatment Center, just south of Austin, Texas, a space that has witnessed countless difficult conversations between troubled children, their worried parents, and clinical therapists. But today promises unalloyed joy. Samantha’s mother is visiting from Idaho, as she does every six weeks, which means lunch off campus and an excursion to Target. The girl needs supplies: new jeans, yoga pants, nail polish. Listen to the audio version of this article:Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles. At 11, Samantha is just over 5 feet tall and has wavy black hair and a steady gaze. She flashes a smile when I ask about her favorite subject (history), and grimaces when I ask about her least favorite (math). She seems poised and cheerful, a normal preteen. But when we steer into uncomfortable territory—the events that led her to this juvenile-treatment facility nearly 2,000 miles from her family—Samantha hesitates and looks down at her hands. “I wanted the whole world to myself,” she says. “So I made a whole entire book about how to hurt people.” Continue Reading Shannon Stapleton / Reuters The Trump Organization Says It's 'Not Practical' to Comply With the Emoluments Clause Russell Berman The president’s business tells lawmakers it is too difficult to track all its foreign revenue in accordance with constitutional requirements, and it hasn’t asked Congress for a permission slip. Days before taking office, Donald Trump said his company would donate all profits from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury, part of an effort to avoid even the appearance of a conflict with the Constitution’s emoluments clause. Now, however, the Trump Organization is telling Congress that determining exactly how much of its profits come from foreign governments is simply more trouble than it’s worth. In response to a document request from the House Oversight Committee, Trump’s company sent a copy of an eight-page pamphlet detailing how it plans to track payments it receives from foreign governments at the firm’s many hotels, golf courses, and restaurants across the globe. But while the Trump Organization said it would set aside all money it collects from customers that identify themselves as representing a foreign government, it would not undertake a more intensive effort to determine if a payment would violate the Constitution’s prohibition on public office holders accepting an “emolument” from a foreign state. Continue Reading Corbis Historical / Getty Why American Workers Now Dress So Casually Deirdre Clemente The office was, until a few decades ago, the last stronghold of fashion formality. Silicon Valley changed that. Americans began the 20th century in bustles and bowler hats and ended it in velour sweatsuits and flannel shirts—the most radical shift in dress standards in human history. At the center of this sartorial revolution was business casual, a genre of dress that broke the last bastion of formality—office attire—to redefine the American wardrobe. Born in Silicon Valley in the early 1980s, business casual consists of khaki pants, sensible shoes, and button-down collared shirts. By the time it was mainstream, in the 1990s, it flummoxed HR managers and employees alike. “Welcome to the confusing world of business casual,” declared a fashion writer for the Chicago Tribune in 1995. With time and some coaching, people caught on. Today, though, the term “business casual” is nearly obsolete for describing the clothing of a workforce that includes many who work from home in yoga pants, put on a clean T-shirt for a Skype meeting, and don’t always go into the office.

Marvel Comics has been having a rough time lately. Readers and critics met last year’s Civil War 2—a blockbuster crossover event (and a spiritual tie-in to the year’s big Marvel movie)—with disinterest and scorn. Two years of plummeting print comics sales culminated in a February during which only one series managed to sell over 50,000 copies. Three crossover events designed to pump up excitement came and went with little fanfare, while the lead-up to 2017’s blockbuster crossover Secret Empire—where a fascist Captain America subverts and conquers the United States—sparked such a negative response that the company later put out a statement imploring readers to buy the whole thing before judging it. On March 30, a battered Marvel decided to try and get to the bottom of the problem with a retailer summit—and promptly stuck its foot in its mouth.

Go down into the long tail of Grand Canyon videos, and you’ll eventually find a two-part, 35-minute lecture by Andrew Snelling. The first sign this isn’t a typical geology lecture comes about a minute in, when Snelling proclaims, “The Grand Canyon does provide a testament to the biblical account of Earth’s history.” Snelling is a prominent young-Earth creationist. For years, he has given lectures, guided biblical-themed Grand Canyon rafting tours, and worked for the nonprofit Answers in Genesis. (The CEO of Answers in Genesis, Ken Ham, is also behind the Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter theme park.) Young-Earth creationism, in contrast to other forms of creationism, specifically holds that the Earth is only thousands of years old. Snelling believes that the Grand Canyon formed after Noah’s flood—and he now claims the U.S. government is blocking his research in the canyon because of his religious views. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs, among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Here’s what that means for its strategy—and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from, and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving, and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December, The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata, the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East, admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic State’s appeal. “We have not defeated the idea,” he said. “We do not even understand the idea.” In the past year, President Obama has referred to the Islamic State, variously, as “not Islamic” and as al-Qaeda’s “jayvee team,” statements that reflected confusion about the group, and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

Inside ABC’s tonally bizarro update of the seminal 1987 romantic drama Dirty Dancing are about four different projects trying to get out. There’s the most obvious one, a frame-by-frame remake of the original that’s as awkward and ill-conceived as Gus Van Sant’s 1997 carbon copy of Psycho. There’s the one Abigail Breslin’s starring in, an emotionally textured and realistic coming-of-age story about a clumsy but engaging wallflower. There’s a musical, in which Breslin and Nicole Scherzinger mime along to their own singing voices in a strange dance rehearsal while half-heartedly exploring the idea that power emanates from the vagina. And there’s the most compelling story, a Wide Sargasso Sea-inspired spinoff starring Debra Messing as a lonely housewife coming to terms with the turbulent depths of her own desire.

JPMorgan Cazenove cut its rating from Overweight to Neutral as it said the bus and train operator’s rail profits in the medium-term “could conceivably be near zero”. “Though we had hoped that the worst of industrial action was past at [Southern operator] GTR, this appears less certain now, with the RMT and Aslef announcing new actions recently,” said analyst Samuel Bland. He thinks a pay settlement could lower margins at GTR from 1.5% to 1% on top of a £15 million hit from negotiations with the Department for Transport. “We are also concerned about the impact of GTR on Go-Ahead’s ability to win other rail franchises, from a purely PR point of view,” Bland added. That could be a problem given contracts to run London Midland and Southeastern, its two profitable rail franchises, expire in 18 months. Shares went into reverse, falling 55.4p, or 3%, to 1796.6p. It was a different story for rival National Express, which sped 15.3p higher to 378.2p. It took the Overweight slot vacated by Go-Ahead as JPMorgan upgraded from Neutral. The broker said concerns about Spanish retendering were overdone and factored in a £30 million foreign exchange and fuel boost. The FTSE 100 rose 10.45 points to 7495.74 but was held back by miners after Moody’s downgraded China’s rating for the first time since 1989, changing its outlook from stable to negative. Rio Tinto fell 60.5p to 3132p and Anglo American slipped 12p to 1063p on concerns about growth in China, the world’s largest consumer of raw materials.

He said once the Yahoo deal closes, the platform would be in place for an OTT kind of play, but he quickly added that there’s no commitment to a launch date. No further details, but previous reports have suggested such an offering will be independent of Go90. — Comcast continues to be extremely consistent with its view that there isn’t a business model for it to offer a video-only OTT product outside its footprint. It was CFO Mike Cavanagh’s turn to deliver that sermon at an investor conference Monday. “We obviously see the benefit of bundling economics with other products we can deliver,” he said, questioning OTT players who only have video and are thus probably at best at breakeven plus or minus a little bit and facing the same programming cost challenges as traditional players. “We like our own game in terms of segmenting customers, providing a great video experience through X1, integrating Netflix, integrating YouTube, making it better and better as time passes.” share this article previous storyPeople next storyCable One’s Tom Might – Video Interview Featured Stories <   > Featured Stories Screenster Verizon, Comcast Talk OTT At JP Morgan Conference Technology Virtual MVPDs: Charter, AT&T Don’t Call Them Replacement… Screenster Effros: Oh, Wu!

A spokesman for that hand-picked panel, Steve Schwarzman, praised Trump as a leader who wants to "do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans." Wait a minute... Steve Schwarzman? Isn't he a billionaire hedge-fund huckster on Wall Street? Yes — and Holy Money Bags! — there's Jamie Dimon, head of scandal-ridden JPMorgan Chase. Working-class champions? Trump's whole "jobs" panel is made up of Wall Street banksters and corporate powers like Walmart that instead are notorious for laying off and ripping off workers. Trump-the-candidate fulminated against such moneyed elites, calling them "responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class." But now, in a spectacular flip-flop as president, he has brought these robbers directly inside his presidency, asking them to be architects of his economic strategy. He’s brought these robbers directly inside his presidency. click to tweet Worse, he's doing this in the name of helping workers. Hello!!! To develop policies beneficial to working stiffs, bring in some working stiffs! But not a single labor advocate is on his policy council, in his Cabinet, or anywhere near his White House. Thus, the so-called "job-creation plan" announced by Trump and his corporate cohorts doesn't create any jobs, but calls instead for — Ta-dah! — deregulating Wall Street. The truth is, these flim-flammers actually want us rubes to believe that "freeing" banksters to return to casino-style speculation and consumer scams will give them more money that they "can" invest in American jobs. Do they think we have sucker wrappers around our heads? Trump's scheme will let banks make a killing, but it doesn't require them to invest in jobs — so they won't. There's a name for this: Fraud.

The survey by financial publishers Euromoney showed overall market share among the top five banks in the $5 trillion a day market falling to 41 percent from just under 45 percent a year ago. JP Morgan was again placed second in overall market share, followed by Swiss bank UBS in third. Deutsche Bank fell again, to fifth, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch climbed to fourth. Euromoney's annual poll, watched closely by participants in the world's biggest financial market, has traditionally been dominated by the big banks. In 2009 the top five banks commanded a 61.5 percent share and the top 10 close to 80 percent. While the top ten players in Wednesday's survey were again all lenders - displacing non-bank liquidity provider XTX Markets - the spread of market share was far more even than in previous years. Citi's share fell from 12.93 percent a year ago to 10.74 percent while Deutsche's fell sharply for a second year - to 5.68 percent from 7.88 percent. Euromoney said there were now seven non-bank providers in the top 50.

Bloomberg News reports that total revenue from investment banking and trading at five of the world’s biggest investment banks will probably fall 2 percent to about $18.1 billion, driven by a 5 percent drop in fixed-income trading and a 6 percent slide in equities, analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. Barclays will probably post the biggest drop among the five banks, while Morgan Stanley is likely to report a gain, according to the note. Some of the world’s biggest banks have relied on a rebound in fixed-income trading to drive results over the past year as clients moved to make more wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates. A decline in bond-trading could compound the challenges already facing some European lenders that are pushing through overhauls, from Deutsche Bank to Credit Suisse.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 24, 2017 1:36pm   Comments Share: Related 25 Stocks Moving In Wednesday's Pre-Market Session 15 Biggest Mid-Day Gainers For Tuesday Puma Biotechnology Inc (NASDAQ: PBYI) traders are eagerly-anticipating the end of the trading halt for Puma on Wednesday after the company received a positive recommendation for approval of neratinib from the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee. The advisory committee voted 12-4 to recommend approval of neratinib for treatment of patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. The stock is scheduled to resume trading at 1:50 p.m. ET. When the stock resumes trading, it could make a huge jump. Shares spiked 39.1 percent on Monday after the FDA’s initial review of neratinib was let critical than investors had anticipated. JPMorgan said this week that the options market was pricing in a 60 percent implied volatility in Puma stock this week, suggesting the stock could be in for a big move one trading resumes. Short sellers were hoping that concerns over neratinib’s diarrhea risk and changes made to the pivotal clinical trial would discourage the panel from recommending approval. “The tolerability of neratinib in this patient population is a concern given the frequent dose interruptions, reductions and discontinuations observed, mostly due to diarrhea,” the FDA wrote on Monday. Nearly 40 percent of the patients treated with neratinib reportedly experienced at least grade-3 diarrhea. Related Link: Puma Biotech Makes Big Breakthrough In Breast Cancer Treatment In March 2016, the FDA recommended Puma delay its approval application for neratinib due to design changes made to the neratinib study, but the company went ahead with the application anyway. The committee vote was a major binary trading event for the market. A vote to reject the application would have sent shares tumbling. While buying and a potential short squeeze in the wake of the positive outcome could send shares skyrocketing. Puma currently has an extremely high 33.1 short percent of float.

Credit agency Moody's lowered China's foreign currency and long-term local credit rating by one notch to A1, citing slowing growth and mounting debt in the world's second-largest economy. The cut to China's credit rating - its first in nearly three decades - initially rocked Asian markets, sending China mainland benchmark stock indexes more than 1 percent lower and weighing on the yuan. But Chinese stocks ended the session broadly flat, while the overall MSCI benchmark recovered to trade flat after suffering losses earlier in the session. JPMorgan's benchmark emerging market debt index only ground marginally wider, with spreads over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries edging out one basis point. "The reaction has been pretty muted," said Kaan Nazli, senior economist emerging market debt at Neuberger Berman, noting that recent China data had already contributed to a pullback on commodity focused emerging markets. "The Chinese infrastructure programme was what helped push metals prices higher in the first quarter of this year and the last quarter of last year - there is an expectation that this has run out of steam," he said. Moody's downgrade of China is just the latest to affect big emerging markets, with several recently having their outlooks or ratings cut. South Africa's rating tumbled into junk in April, while a graft scandal engulfing Brazilian President Michel Temer prompted a number of agencies to warn of credit rating implications. S&amp;P revised its credit outlook to negative on Tuesday. Investors were bracing for more to come, said Neuberger Berman's Nazli. "However, six months from now that could very well change," he added. Fitch has made eight EM sovereign cuts this year and has negative outlooks on 13, from Brazil and Mexico to Nigeria and Zambia, while Moody's holds a negative outlook on some 25 countries. On currency markets, oil exporters Russia and Kazakhstan saw the rouble and tenge strengthen against the dollar, supported by oil prices nudging higher on confidence that OPEC-led output cut will be extended into early next year at the group's meeting this week. Despite the China downgrade hitting metals and copper prices , South Africa's rand strengthened 0.5 percent to its firmest level in a month as data showed that consumer inflation slowed more than expected. The rand has strengthened for the fourth consecutive session, also helped by media reports that ruling African National Congress (ANC) would discuss removing President Jacob Zuma at a weekend meeting. The ANC has rejected the reports.

One bullish analyst runs numbers that show how Tesla could trade over $500. By Ben Levisohn Updated May 24, 2017 9:37 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of Tesla (TSLA) have taken a break following their rapid rise above $300 this year. So how much upside is left? Illustration: Getty Images If you listen to the bears, not much. The average analyst price target for Tesla is about $275, pulled down by targets in the mid-to-high $100s from Cowen, Barclays, UBS, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Berenberg. The bulls, however, see much more upside potential. Baird's Ben Kallo and team, for instance, have a $368 price target on Tesla. But they do the math to arrive at a "blue sky" target of $566: Our blue-sky valuation indicates a potential share price of $566, a ~86% upside based on the May 23 closing price of $303.86. We model 1M units sold in 2020 (including a combination of Model S, 3, X, and Y), in line with TSLA’s target of 1M vehicles in 2020, at an ASP of ~$52k. Additionally, we model ~15 GWh of battery production sold at an average ASP of $500/kWh and 800 MW sold and deployed by Solar City at a 20% gross margin, and arrive at total revenue of ~$62.4B and total gross margin of ~$15.8B (equal to 25%). We assume OpEx of ~$8.4B (~14% of sales), which we believe is feasible as TSLA improves manufacturing efficiency and streamlines production, and provides an operating margin of ~11% (below TSLA’s long-term target of mid-teens). Additionally, we model ~190M shares, which allows for ~25M shares of potential future equity raises and/or the impact of convertible debt. We apply a 32x multiple to our 2020 EPS estimate of ~$30, discounted to YE:17 at a 20% rate, to arrive at a $566 price target. A pipe dream? Perhaps. But many would have said the same thing about Tesla at $300. Shares of Tesla have gained 1.3% to $307.71 at 9:31 a.m. today.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo (Copyright Reuters 2017) Nearly three months into its life as a public company, Snap (SNAP) – the parent company of popular disappearing messaging app Snapchat – has seen its fair share of market volatility as Wall Street tries to get a handle on its growth trajectory. Continue Reading Below The Venice, Calif.-based company’s shares have dropped more than 10% so far this month after disappointing investors with its first-quarter earnings results that showed a $2.2 billion loss for the first three months of the year and slower-than-expected user growth. Immediately following the May 11 results, investors sent the stock plunging 23%. But at the JPMorgan (JPM) Global Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in Boston Wednesday morning, Snap Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said he’s learned to “never get surprised by market reactions,” and, pointing to positive gains in content creation and time spent per user – which fueled a 286% gain in revenue from the year prior, said he was pleased with first-quarter performance, Dow Jones reported. After the disappointing earnings, Stifel analysts said Wall Street shouldn’t count the company out just yet. More from FOXBusiness.com Should investors put new money to work in stocks? Why stocks are unfazed by Manchester terrorist attack 'Amazon-proof' retail stocks “We continue to think Snap carries the potential to be a significant player in the digital media landscape over a long time period provided steady execution, and we are cautious to extrapolate too much from its first quarterly results as a public company,” said analysts at Stifel following Snap’s earnings results. Snap said more than three billion snaps were sent each day in the first quarter on average, up from 2.5 billion in the third quarter, as users spent about 30 minutes per day on the app. The Stifel analysts pointed to new tools and availability of creative content that likely fueled that growth. Indeed, the company has felt increased pressure from competitors including Facebook’s (FB) Instagram app, which has, over the last year, rolled out its own Snap-like stories platform that lets users post pictures and video that disappear after 24 hours.

As the company continues to add features and products, Khan said he believes the age of its users will increase, though its strength among its current active user base of 18 to 34 year olds, has been a plus to advertisers. “I think the biggest mistake we can do is build a product for a specific age group because that is not how you create a product with universal appeal,” Khan reportedly said. Snap shares traded up 1.6% to $20.35 on Wednesday afternoon.  Related Content Target Shares Rise on 1Q Earnings but CEO Not Ready to ‘High Five’ Yet Slowing Sales Growth at TJMaxx, Marshalls Parent Stokes Retail-Industry Concern Rue21 Joins Growing List of Retailers in Bankruptcy Sears CEO 'Taking a Stand' Against Craftsman Supplier, Shares Drop JCPenney Shares Drop Again as Wall Street Loses Faith in Turnaround What do you think?

The company has private equity investors, including Mayfield, Bessemer and JPMorgan Asset Management, invested in its business. JP Morgan Asset Management bought out the stake in the company from Canaan Partners in 2015. The investors together hold over 40 per cent of the equity in the company. Bessemer is expected to sell around six per cent stake, keeping a small amount of shares in the company, while Mayfield, which has a 10 per cent stake, will sell a small amount and JP Morgan, which has around 20 per cent stake, will sell close to one-third of its holding, according to Murugavel Janakiraman, promoter and managing director of Matrimony.com. The company is planning an offer for sale of up to 3,767,254 equity shares. The offer includes 1.46 million shares by Bessemer India, 155,000  shares by Mayfield, 1.68 million shares by CMDB II, 384,000  shares by Janakiraman, and 82,834 shares by Indrani Jankiraman, a member of the promoter group. The primary offering in its previous draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) was to the tune of Rs 350 crore. This has been scaled down to Rs 130 crore in the second DRHP filed recently because the company has posted a profit and will not be looking for more funding towards marketing from the IPO. “We are planning to construct an office in Chennai and Rs 40 crore out of the funds raised through the IPO will be used for purchasing land. Another Rs 20 crore will be used for marketing expenses, Rs 40 crore towards an overdraft facility and the balance for contingency purposes,” said Janakiraman. The company has a few offices in Chennai, but they are rented. There are close to 1,500 associates in these premises and an office building will improve coordination. Janakiraman said the company had made a profit of Rs 43 crore even after one-time IPO expenses of around Rs 4 crore. Considering that it is making profit, the company has decided not to raise money for marketing, which has brought down the primary offering from the previous Rs 350 crore to Rs 130 crore now. The company had filed a DRHP to raise around Rs 550 crore last year but it did not complete the process owing to unfavourable market conditions.

President and CEO Tony Thomas said Tuesday that recent acquisitions with former rival Earthlink and Broadview Networks will bolster the Little Rock telco’s future earnings and revenue growth as the industry transitions to cloud computing and software-defined network technology (SD-Wan). “As we look at the evolution of the communications business, the ability to provide specific applications on what Broadview enabled with their Office Suit products …, we think being able to couple that technology with SD-Wan is going to be where this industry heads,” Thomas said. Thomas made his forward-looking comments at the three-day J.P. Morgan’s 45th Annual Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference in Boston, where top executives from many of the nation’s established technology corporations and emerging growth firms are hosting fireside chats and one-on-one meeting with key investors and money managers. Thomas’ commentary was prompted mostly by a series of technical and financial questions concerning Windstream’s operations by Wall Street analyst Philip Cusick, who is managing director and senior telecom analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase. Much of the conversation centered around Windstream’s recently announced acquisitions of Earthlink Holdings Corp. of Atlanta and Broadview Networks in upstate New York. On Feb. 27, Windstream completed its acquisition of former rival EarthLink Holdings Corp. of Atlanta after both companies’ shareholders approved the $1.1 billion deal over the weekend. Windstream officials said the company expects to achieve more than $150 million in annual operating and capital expense synergies within 36 months of closing, an increase of $25 million over its initial estimates. Then nearly a month ago, Windstream announced a deal to acquire Broadview Networks Holdings Inc., in an all-cash deal worth $227.5 million. Broadview is based in Rye Brook, N.Y., where it provides cloud-based solutions to small and medium-sized businesses under the “OfficeSuite” brand. “When you think about the movement, the biggest change in the industry, regardless if you’re in communications or technology apt for this conference here is the movement to the cloud. I mean it literally is the single biggest change,” Thomas said. “I like to say I have been in communications too long, and this is one of the most pivotal moments in communications in terms of how technology is morphing. The Office Suite is an ‘over the top’ product, meaning that enabled and provisioned to customers in a matter of minutes, instead of the historical provision cycle of 60-120 days.” Besides the Office Suite product, Thomas said the benefits of the Broadview acquisition also include synergies of more than $30 million and a talented bench of executives. “Many of their senior leaders have announced they’ll be joining the Windstream team on the other end of the merger and we are excited about bringing them aboard,” he said. “So we’ve got great strategic application, and we get all the financial benefits that you would want in a team that’s actually executed on this strategy on a smaller scale that we’re confident, we can do it on a larger one.” EARTHLINK, BROADVIEW ACQUISITIONS WILL JUMPSTART WINDSTREAM GROWTH Concerning revenue projections in the short-term, Thomas said all of the company’s operations will be exposed to the dynamic changes that are taking place in the industry. As a so-called incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC), the company has spent $1.7 billion on last-mile upgrades to legacy networks. “As we look at business, we recognize that we have to be investing in having the assets to make this transition. And with the combination of Broadview and (Earthlink) in terms of them jumpstarting our … capabilities, we are going to be really well-positioned for that transition,” he said. Following the close of the Broadview merger in the third quarter, Thomas said Windstream is looking to ramp up its investment in SD-Wan technology, which has emerged as an important solution for businesses that are increasingly dependent on the cloud and looking to digitally transform onsite. He said Earthlink was six to nine months ahead of Windstream in adopting this technology. “So, we literally took the fantastic front-end portal, and we cloned it, and drop in into the Windstream IT infrastructure,” he said. “We have a major release going on in the month of July where we bring the full set of capabilities of the combined SD-Wan platforms together. So July is a big month for us to bring SD-Wan across the entire Windstream footprint – Earthlink had those capabilities already.” Thomas also mentioned the company is currently connecting data centers across the U.S. that will have an “Amazon-like” experience in their ability to turn up new broadband services. “I think it will be one of the biggest changes to take place is this ability to have an ‘Amazon-like’ experience with bandwidth,” he said. “We’ve connected major data centers across five cities, and we’ll go to another 50 markets this year and this will be very powerful for those folks who need this bandwidth and they need it not in 60 days … but they literally want it in seconds and we’ll be able to do that.” To illustrate his point, Thomas mentioned the company’s announcement on Tuesday for a major expansion of its advanced metro fiber network in Knoxville, Tenn. He said Windstream is currently expanding its metro fiber networks in a number of major cities across the U.S., which will allow businesses, local data centers and commercial buildings with Windstream’s high-speed, nationwide fiber network. At the end of Thomas’ 30-minute onstage interview with the J.P. Morgan telecom analyst, Thomas talked about the company’s revenue goals over the next five years as the company goes through its technology transition. He also talked about Windstream’s disappointing stock price and the value of the company. Over the past year, Windstream’s stock price is off more than 40% and has traded in the range of $4.28 and $10.46 per share on the Nasdaq stock exchange. As a result, Windstream’s market capitalization has dropped well below $1 billion to $871.5 million. Thomas promised returns will improve soon. “(It) drives me nuts, honestly, I don’t have a kinder way to say that. We do think the stock is undervalued and we look at our focus areas and hey, we know we have to continue to show trajectory on (earnings),” Thomas said. “Undoubtedly … we understand the top line is important to a lot of investors, that will take a little longer at Windstream. But when you think about our ability to generate (earnings) through interconnection cost takeout as well as the synergies that are coming from EarthLink and Broadview, we think we’re just in a dramatically different place.” Thomas will continue to make rounds on Wall Street next week, where he will speak at the Cowen and Company Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in New York City on May 31.

The robo-adviser—the largest among independent digital advice startups that popped up after the 2008 financial collapse—has overhauled its entire brand. The shift in marketing and advertising strategy is aimed at attracting more affluent customers just now becoming aware of the option. It’s also not a coincidence that Betterment’s pivot comes as more traditional players such as Vanguard Group Inc., Charles Schwab Corp., and even JPMorgan Chase & Co. are starting to use more technology when offering investment advice. In other words, the robo-adviser pie is about to expand, and Betterment wants to make sure it gets a bigger piece. “These are fundamental decisions about who we are as a company,” Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jon Stein said in an interview. “We’re attracting a lot of affluent customers already, but I think our voice—as we speak to that person—has to show we are established.” Late last year, Citigroup, which has invested in Betterment through its venture capital arm, sent clients a research report voicing skepticism about just how large assets under management could grow for robo-advisers when it comes to wealthier individuals. “Higher net-worth or more sophisticated investors will, in our view, always demand face-to-face advice,” wrote Citi analysts led by Ronit Ghose.

Sign Up But Betterment says that’s not the case, explaining it already has a number of customers with more than $10 million under management each. On top of its redesign, the firm is thinking about adding access to more exclusive products. “People do want access to alternatives, and that’s something we see demand for among the mass affluent,” Stein said. Betterment doesn’t disclose how many of its accounts are held by accredited investors (who would be allowed by regulators to participate in complex investments such as hedge funds, venture capital, or private equity) but said it’s well more than 25,000 of its 250,000 customers. Some on Wall Street are already moving to stake a claim. Although JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon didn’t say last year how much money the bank has put into building its robo-adviser, he did say roughly $600 million was devoted to “emerging fintech solutions” and that technology is an extremely important part of the company’s future strategies. Betterment LLC For Betterment, this is the second big change in 2017. Earlier this year it introduced a new fee structure and added more certified advisers, also in an attempt to draw in wealthy customers as well as younger individuals who will have major financial decisions to make in the next 5 to 10 years, such as buying a home. While affluent individuals are a big part of this new push, the firm said its mission is still to attract people spanning the financial spectrum, and that was a part of the research process that went into the redesign. “We looked at people across the range in age and income,” said Elyssa Gray, vice president in charge of brand at Betterment. “Regardless of the level of experience or the amount of money they had, there were a number of common denominators when it comes to financial services.” A big part of that was taking out financial jargon the firm said irked some customers. “We heard over and over again: ‘Start talking to us like a person,’” said Sarah Kaufman, director of brand and content. “It’s really about how we are telling this story, too, not just the design.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The PIF’s deal-making has quickened this year as it seeks to increase the proportion of foreign holdings to 50% from 5 %. Published: 15:59 May 24, 2017 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai: Saudi Arabia plans to expand its sovereign wealth fund into the world’s largest. The kingdom took a huge step toward that goal on Saturday when it signed billions of dollars of deals with Blackstone Group LP and SoftBank Group Corp. The Public Investment Fund, or PIF, is at the centre of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to diversify revenue away from oil under an economic transformation plan known as Vision 2030. The fund could eventually control more than $2 trillion (Dh7.3 trillion), according to Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman. The sale of a less than 5 per cent stake in oil giant Aramco to the public will provide funds for investment. “We want to be an investment powerhouse,” PIF managing director Yasir Alrumayyan said in a rare public appearance on Saturday during an event that gathered top Saudi officials and American corporate titans including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and Citigroup Inc. CEO Mike Corbat, in Riyadh. “Most of the investments we announced and will announce soon are international, but they will be in parallel with our investments in Saudi.” The PIF’s deal-making has quickened this year as it seeks to increase the proportion of foreign holdings to 50 per cent from 5 per cent, excluding Aramco. Here’s some of the fund’s biggest investments so far: Blackstone infrastructure fund The PIF agreed to commit $20 billion to an infrastructure investment fund with Blackstone, the world’s biggest private-equity manager. Blackstone plans to raise the same amount from other investors and with leverage, the New York-based asset manager expects to have more than $100 billion in purchasing power for infrastructure projects, primarily in the US. The agreement is non-binding and terms are still being negotiated. The potential investment reflects the PIF’s “positive views around the ambitious infrastructure initiatives being undertaken in the United States as announced by President Trump,” and will allow the PIF to “achieve long-term returns given historical investment shortfalls,” Alrumayyan said. SoftBank Vision Fund Saudi Arabia and SoftBank formally announced the first close of fund-raising for the largest-ever technology investment fund on Saturday. More than $93 billion has been secured from backers led by the PIF and the Japanese company, and the fund could grow to $100 billion. The PIF didn’t disclose the size of its investment, but Salman agreed to potentially invest up to $45 billion in the fund over five years after a meeting with SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son. Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Foxconn Technology Group and Sharp Corp. also put in capital. “We are building a portfolio that is diversified across sectors, asset classes and geographies, and expect the Vision Fund to act as a platform to access a range of exciting, emerging opportunities in the technology sector,” Alrumayyan said in a statement announcing the deal. Uber Technologies Inc. The PIF invested $3.5 billion in US ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. last June, marking its arrival as a major global investor. The deal valued Uber at $62.5 billion and gave Alrumayyan a board seat at the San Francisco-based company. Saudi Arabian military industries The PIF earlier this month set up a defence company — Saudi Arabian Military Industries (Sami) — to help reduce the kingdom’s reliance on foreign purchases of military equipment and create a domestic manufacturing industry. The wealth fund said Sami will directly contribute around 14 billion riyals (Dh13 billion) to the Saudi economy by 2030, invest more than 6 billion riyals in research and development and create more than 40,000 jobs in the engineering and technical fields. “Sami is a big thing,” Alrumayyan said. “We are the third-largest spender on military in the world, so by 2030 we want to bring in 50 per cent of our procurement into Saudi Arabia.” Mohammad Alabbar The PIF was among investors contributing to start Middle East e-commerce venture Noon last November. Led by Dubai-based business tycoon Alabbar, the fund pledged to invest $500 million — half of Noon’s capital — and will be an active participant in its board. The Saudi fund deepened ties with Alabbar, who is also chairman of Dubai’s largest real estate developer Emaar Properties PJSC, later that month when it took a 50 per cent stake in his investment vehicle Adeptio AD Investments SPC Ltd. Adeptio bought Kuwait Food Co., which operates KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in the Middle East and North Africa. Posco The PIF’s investment in Korea’s Posco Engineering & Construction Co. was one of the fund’s first overseas deals. The fund paid $1.1 billion for a 38 per cent stake and got the right to appoint two board members. At home Domestically, the PIF has listed assets worth about $106 billion, including stakes in companies such as Saudi Basic Industries Corp., the world’s second-biggest chemicals manufacturer, and National Commercial Bank, the kingdom’s largest lender. In addition. the fund owns about 60 private companies, Alrumayyan said at the Riyadh conference. The fund’s assets totalled 587 billion riyals ($157 billion) at the end of June 2016, according to the prospectus for the government’s $9 billion Islamic bond sale published in April. The transfer of about $27 billion from the kingdom’s foreign reserves held at the central bank to the PIF was approved in November. The government also plans to transfer ownership of many state assets to the fund while they are being privatised, including the Saudi stock exchange and flour mills. The PIF is the main investor in a planned 334 square-kilometre sports and entertainment city that will be built south of Riyadh, the government said in April. The plans will include a safari area and a Six Flags Entertainment Corp. theme park.

Tech Search Search CybersecurityNewly Discovered Vulnerability Raises Fears of Another WannaCry Cyber Attack Harley-DavidsonHarley-Davidson Is Building a Factory in Thailand to Serve Southeast Asia FacebookFacebook Reportedly Signs BuzzFeed, Vox and Others for Original Video Shows Career AdviceWhy You Should Take a Sabbatical From Work Serena Williams Tennis Star Serena Williams Joins This Tech Company’s Board Leena Rao May 24, 2017 Tennis superstar Serena Williams is making her first foray into the technology world by joining the board of online survey giant SurveyMonkey, the company announced on Wednesday. While it may seem like an odd pairing, the match was made through Facebook chief operating officer and SurveyMonkey board member Sheryl Sandberg. Sandberg and her late husband, Dave Goldberg, SurveyMonkey's former CEO, were longtime friends of Williams. SurveyMonkey CEO Zander Lurie was looking to add more outside board members, especially from other industries. The two hit it off at a dinner party at Sandberg's house last fall, and it started the conversation about how they could work together. "Everything just came together easily," Williams said in an interview with Fortune. Williams isn't a stranger to entrepreneurship. She has built a massive business around her tennis achievements, which includes winning 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most in the open era. She's the world's highest paid female athlete, with $77.6 million in career prize money, more than twice as much as any other female athlete in history, according to Forbes. That doesn't include endorsement deals withNike and J.P. Morgan Chase. She also has a clothing business she promotes on TV shopping network HSN. For Williams, joining SurveyMonkey's board is an opportunity to put to use her experiences as a player and entrepreneur. "I want to spread this knowledge," she said. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. For Lurie and SurveyMonkey, Williams brings her marketing knowledge and keen expertise for competition. "Silicon Valley is super competitive and there's no winner like Serena in any sport in any decade," he said, calling Williams a "mentor." He added that Williams brings a different, outside voice to the boardroom, and that's a good thing for the company. Founded in 1999, SurveyMonkey provides online surveys to companies to get feedback from customers, potential customers, and employees. Ninety-nine percent of Fortune 500 companies, including Kraft Foods, Facebook, and Samsung, use SurveyMonkey either internally or for marketing purposes. The company, which was last valued at $2 billion, has raised over $1 billion in debt and equity, and an initial public offering is possible in the future. SurveyMonkey competes against fellow online survey upstart Qualtrics. For both Williams and Lurie, the appointment has a touch of emotion as they both lost a dear friend when Goldberg suddenly passed away in 2015. Williams said that Goldberg was a "loving and inspirational person" and "it's clear his legacy continues to live on at SurveyMonkey," where he served as CEO starting in 2009. "He would give me a huge hug for bringing Serena Williams into the company he built," said Lurie. Williams is currently on leave from professional tennis while awaiting the birth of her first child. She is engaged to Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of online message board Reddit. SurveyMonkey also announced that Intuit CEO Brad Smith would also join its board.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. NEW YORK — Stocks rose for the fourth day in a row Tuesday as they continued to recover the ground they lost last week. Major indexes approached record highs again. Most of the gains went to banks, which surged as bond yields jumped. That will allow them to charge higher rates on loans. Banks took steep losses last Wednesday, when stocks had their worst day since September. Scientific instrument companies and drugmakers also rose. However auto parts companies were hammered after poor third-quarter results from AutoZone and home builders fell after sales of new homes sank in April. The four-day rally has restored most of the market's losses and the Standard & Poor's 500 index is almost back to record highs. “The market was simply reminded that there's political risk out there and it reacted to that reminder,” said Matthew Peterson, chief wealth strategist for LPL Financial. Peterson said he doesn't think long-term investors have made big changes to their portfolios in response to last week's drop, which followed allegations President Trump asked the FBI to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Peterson says high stock prices and the calm market makes stocks more vulnerable to surprises from the political arena. The S&P 500 added 4.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,398.42. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 43.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,937.91. The Nasdaq composite rose 5.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,138.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 3.84 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,380.98. Bond prices turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.28 percent from 2.25 percent. That helped bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase, which gained $1.06, or 1.3 percent, to $85.76 and BB&T, which rose 63 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $43.03. Scientific instrument maker Agilent Technologies raised its annual profit forecast after its second-quarter profit and sales beat Wall Street estimates. Its shares gained $2.58, or 4.6 percent, to $58.66. Industrial and medical device maker Danaher picked up $1.04, or 1.3 percent, to $83.95. Auto parts retailer AutoZone took its worst one-day loss in eight and a half years as high costs and lower sales at older locations hurt its results. Its stock fell $78.09, or 11.8 percent, to $581.40. O'Reilly Automotive sank $8.28, or 3.3 percent, to $240.18 and Advance Auto Parts gave up $6.71, or 4.6 percent, to $140.66. All have tumbled this year as investors worried about slowing car sales. Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software jumped after its fourth-quarter profit and sales surpassed analysts' expectations. The company's games include the “Grand Theft Auto” “NBA2K” and “Sid Meier's Civilization” franchises. Take-Two stock jumped $3.79, or 5.5 percent, to $72.83, and it has doubled over the last year. Rival Activision Blizzard added 68 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $57.80 and Electronic Arts rose 62 cents to $109.01. Sales of new homes fell 11 percent in April from the month before, the biggest drop in more than two years. Sales had reached a nine-year high in March, and experts said the decline was most likely a blip. Homebuilder NVR fell $61.27, or 2.6 percent, to $2,296 and D.R. Horton lost 54 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $33.37. Home improvement retailer Lowe's lost $1.71, or 2 percent, to $82.34 and Home Depot also slipped. Nokia climbed after the company said it settled its legal disputes with Apple. The two companies said they will work together and that Nokia will get a cash payment from Apple. The Finnish company was once the biggest cellphone maker in the world, but it sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft in 2014 and is now a network infrastructure provider. Its U.S. shares rose 33 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $6.54. Fiat Chrysler sank after the government sued the automaker, saying some of diesel pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs included software that cheated emissions tests. The Department of Justice said the software let the vehicles' engines emit more pollution on the road than during Environmental Protection Agency lab testing. Fiat Chrysler stock lost 44 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $10.32. Benchmark U.S. crude oil added 34 cents to $51.47 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, picked up 28 cents to $54.15 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline remained at $1.66 a gallon and heating oil finished where it started, at $1.61 a gallon. Natural gas sank 11 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $5.90 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 5 cents to $17.14 an ounce. Copper remained at $2.60 a pound. The dollar rose to 111.76 yen from 111.20 yen. The euro declined to $1.1185 from $1.1234. European stocks traded slightly higher. The CAC 40 in France rose 0.5 percent. Germany's DAX and the FTSE 100 index in Britain both added 0.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.3 percent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.1 percent. The South Korean Kospi gained 0.7 percent.

By Shahien Nasiripour Stanford University’s business school has produced at least four self-made billionaires and 244 active chief executive officers, but Ross Pedersen, class of 2016, wakes up around 2 a.m. up to four days a week to clean toilets. Until early February, the 25-year-old was a vice president at Dallas-based hedge fund Verdad Advisers, where he says he helped pick securities to purchase and companies worthy of investment. He started the job in his last months at Stanford, part-time, then joined full-time about a week after graduation. Pedersen had around $55,000 of student loans to repay, and Verdad offered him an annual six-figure compensation package. But within a few months of starting, a desire to do public service started “eating away at me,” Pedersen says. Soon after, with his boss’s blessing, he took a yearlong leave to join the U.S. Army and prepare to become a national guardsman. Ross’s choice helps to explain why Stanford MBAs out-earn their peers. While he’s training in Fort Benning, Georgia, to become an infantry officer, many, if not most, of his former classmates are holding jobs, from consulting to private equity, that pull six figure salaries, some as much as $450,000 a year. At Stanford, which Bloomberg Businessweek ranks as the second best MBA program in the U.S., after Harvard, students are encouraged to pursue their passions rather than settle for traditional gigs. “We have a culture where you are encouraged to do whatever you want, to explore the things you want to do that others may think is crazy,” Pedersen says. At Stanford, past failures are celebrated, and students are known to skip reading assignments in favor of meetings with venture capitalists in the hope that their fledgling ideas may get funded. Highly ambitious students at other top-ranked business schools normally seek lucrative jobs in private equity and other well-paid sectors. At Stanford, those kinds of jobs generally elicit “snores” from fellow students, he says, because so-called gunners chase riskier ventures. Employers happily pay a little bit extra for the chance that their newly minted Stanford MBA will bring that attitude to their company. Stanford business school alumni receive the highest compensation one year out of school than other business school graduates, edging out Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, Bloomberg Businessweek survey data show. Six to eight years out, the typical recent Stanford MBA earns $285,000, tied with Harvard for the highest earnings among MBA programs. Recruiters, school officials, former students and other MBAs say Stanford’s prestige, location in the high-cost San Francisco Bay Area, and proximity to Silicon Valley companies—Google’s and Facebook’s headquarters are less than seven miles away—all contribute to the generous pay. “It’s the sense that Stanford gets the absolute very best of the best,” says John Challenger, chief executive officer of Chicago outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The school’s low admissions rate and relatively small class sizes also help boost alumni earnings, says Jay Bhatti, a New York-based venture capitalist, co-founder of BrandProject, and member of Wharton’s Class of 2002, in part because companies often trust that schools already have winnowed the pool of prospective hires. “The reality for MBA programs is that we have to rely on the admissions standards of the various schools to measure the level of quality,” says Michelle Bucaria, head of campus recruiting for JPMorgan Chase. Stanford admitted just 5.1 percent of applicants for its Class of 2018, just under half Harvard's admission rate (9.6 percent) and slightly more than half of Wharton's (12.7 percent), according to the schools’ websites. “When people go to recruit at Stanford, they recognize they’re getting candidates who probably got offers from Harvard and Wharton,” says Bhatti, who attended Wharton with Neel Kashkari, who leads the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. There’s also the fact that so many alumni end up in and around San Francisco, Challenger says, where workers receive some of the highest wages in the country, thanks to the technology industry. Four of the 15 counties with the highest average adjusted gross incomes in the U.S. are in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to data maintained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Silicon Valley’s culture and Stanford’s apparent success in making that culture its own may be the biggest reasons that Stanford grads out-earn their peers. For example, students at Stanford are more likely to celebrate a classmate who previously launched a startup and then failed than one who completes all of their schoolwork, Pedersen says. Among top-50 MBA programs, Stanford has the highest rate of entrepreneurship, Bloomberg Businessweek survey data show. At the typical business school, some 3 percent of recent MBAs start a business upon graduation. At Stanford, it’s about 16 percent, a rate that’s held relatively steady over the last five years, says Maeve Richard, an assistant dean and director of the school’s career center. As a result, when JPMorgan, for example, wants to recruit MBAs with entrepreneurial talents, it turns to Stanford, says Bucaria. It’s unclear how long the school's reputation will last. When the dot-com bubble burst, entrepreneurship rates among recent Stanford business school grads plummeted. “So long as Silicon Valley continues to shine brightly, Stanford grads are going to carry some of that sheen,” Challenger says.

US Treasury bond yields extended their rise in late trading after a solid 2-year debt auction while euro zone shares closed higher on strong growth data. Oil prices rose slightly in volatile trading as expectations of an extension to Opec-led supply cuts and another drop in US crude inventories offset the proposal in Trump’s budget plan to roll out sales of petroleum reserves over 10 years. US crude rose 0.84 per cent to US$51.56 (RM221.37) per barrel and Brent was last at US$54.26, up 0.72 per cent on the day. Trump’s first full budget plan calls for an increase in military and infrastructure spending but also a raft of cuts, including healthcare and food assistance. “People will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending,” said Nadia Lovell, US equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.08 points, or 0.21 per cent, to end at 20,937.91, the S&P 500 gained 4.4 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 2,398.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.09 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 6,138.71. “There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that,” said Wade Balliet, chief investment strategist at Bank of the West in Denver, Colorado. Trump’s tax and spending plan in its current form is unlikely to be approved by Congress, which will craft its own. Across the euro zone, businesses showed their strongest run since 2011, according to IHS Markit’s Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for May. It matched the previous month’s 56.8, its highest since April 2011. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.25 per cent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.09 per cent. Sterling was subdued after reports showing sluggishness in the UK economy and a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester Monday night that killed 22 people and wounded dozens. “Increasingly the markets are just more and more numb to these. As bad as they are and as horrific as they are, the market immediately looks through these things and uses these as buying opportunities more than anything else,” said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York. The pound was last 0.25 per cent lower at US$1.2968. Treasury debt yields rose, with some investors paring bond positions to make room for this week’s federal and corporate supply while others reduced safe-haven bond holdings in favor of stocks. There was solid demand at a US$26 billion auction of a new two-year note issue, the first part of the US$88 billion in coupon-bearing government debt supply this week. Some traders also turned cautious ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve’s minutes of its May 2-3 meeting today. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury note yield was 2.287 per cent, up three basis points from late on Monday, while the 30-year bond yield was more than three basis points higher at 2.949 per cent. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies as its worst week of losses in a year drove some profit taking, and as investors turned their attention to today’s Fed minutes. The index rose 0.41 per cent after falling to a more than six-month low on Monday. “We haven’t heard from any Fed members clarifying or warning the market that they are on the wrong side. That’s a positive sign that June is still a go (for an interest rate hike),” said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Auto industry to recover slowly this year, BMI Research says Ringgit opens at 4.2760/2810 against US dollar KL shares open higher, tracking trend on regional bourses Asian markets rally after Fed minutes, Opec meeting in focus Dollar on defensive after Fed minutes, euro resumes rise Singapore court fines ex-broker for corruption in 1MDB probe IRB hits Magnum, subsidiary with RM476m penalty Chinese automaker Geely takes 49.9pc stake in Proton PM: Malaysia and Indonesia will retaliate against countries which boycott palm oil Bank Negara’s MyClear merges with MEPS to form PayNet Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: Expedia enables hotel booking in Cuba Reuters Video: 'I didn't expect that to happen,' says Manchester bomber's father Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles US funding cuts would make it ‘impossible’ for UN to do its work Oil prices rise as market expects extended production cut Highlights of Trump’s budget proposal Wall Street edges up at open ahead Trump’s budget plan Trump’s budget proposes converting some military grants to loans Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

"There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that,” Wade Balliet, chief investment strategist at Bank of the West, told Reuters. In 3.27pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index eked out a 0.03 percent gain. In 3.12pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.2 percent. The Dow rose, led by gains in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, up 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Home Depot and those of Walt Disney, recently down 0.7 percent and 0.5 percent respectively for the biggest percentage drops in the Dow. A Commerce Department report showed new home sales sank 11.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,00 units in April, compared with an upwardly revised 642,000 units in March. While that was a bigger slide than economists had expected, the outlook for the housing market remains solid. "Demand for housing remains strong and the usual list of support factors hasn't changed, with the key items being job growth and wage gains," Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, told Reuters. Indeed, fed fund futures showed that traders are cementing bets that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, according to Bloomberg. Minutes from the Fed’s May 2-3 meeting, slated for release on Wednesday, will be scoured for fresh clues on the timing and pace of rate hikes. Meanwhile, shares of Bunge soared, up 15.8 percent as of 3.28pm in New York, after Glencore said it “made an informal approach to Bunge Limited regarding a possible consensual business combination.” “Discussions may or may not materialise and there is no certainty that any transaction will occur,” Glencore said in the statement. In Europe the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.2 percent gain from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index climbed 0.5 percent. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.2 percent. Germany, the euro-zone’s largest economy, offered fresh reasons to be optimistic about the region’s outlook. Separate reports showed that the nation’s economic growth increased to 0.6 percent in the first quarter, while business confidence as measured by the Ifo institute climbed to 114.6 in May, the highest level in more than 25 years. Oil prices rose amid fresh indications that OPEC and its partners are likely to extend production cuts for another nine months when they meet on Thursday in Vienna. "Six and nine months are both proposals on the table ... we will support the majority, probably the nine months," Ecuador Oil Minister Carlos Perez told reporters after arriving in Vienna on Tuesday, according to Reuters.

The investors are still waiting for their first checks, though. The Justice Department disclosed its payments to Richard Breeden, the Madoff Victim Fund administrator, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from Bloomberg News. Breeden's fees, which are being paid from cash in the fund, cover his work through 2016. The delay highlights how, 8½ years after Madoff's arrest, investors are still scrambling to recover money from a U.S. fund that was announced with great fanfare. Victims have recovered billions of dollars from another fund, but they have yet to be made whole. 'Very frustrating' "It's very frustrating that people are making money off us like this, using money that was recovered for victims," said Daphne Brogdon, a Food Network personality, whose family lost about $5 million in the Madoff scam. "They're eating away at whatever percentage we could possibly get." Messages left with a representative of Breeden's firm, RCB Fund Services, weren't returned. Justice Department spokeswoman Dawn Dearden declined to comment on the fees or claims process but pointed to information on the fund's website.

United confronts other issues at annual "We now expect that the initial distribution will take place sometime in 2017 and will be larger than we originally had anticipated," Breeden, a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote on the website. The compensation fund was created in December 2012 to repay thousands of Madoff's victims after the U.S. seized $2.4 billion from the estate of one of his biggest investors, the late Jeffry Picower. The fund grew by $1.7 billion following a 2014 forfeiture deal with Madoff's bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co., which was accused of turning a blind eye to the scam. Breeden's hiring came months after he handed out more than $728 million to about 8,500 Adelphia Communications victims, which he described as "the largest single distribution of forfeited assets to victims in Department of Justice history." Breeden, 67, estimated in February 2016 that as many as 40,000 victims would get initial payments by the end of that year. They didn't. An update on the website in January cited the time-consuming claims process and issues with inadequate paperwork from some victims. The Justice Department is "notoriously slow" making decisions on forfeited assets, said Jon Barooshian, a white-collar defense lawyer in Boston who has dealt with forfeiture issues. "I'm surprised it's taking so long, but I don't know if the fault will fall at Richard Breeden's feet. It might be more of an internal DOJ issue," said Barooshian, who isn't involved in the Madoff case. Another's success By comparison, Irving Picard, who is overseeing the liquidation of Madoff's firm, has paid out more than $9 billion since 2009. Picard, a lawyer at Baker & Hostetler, brought numerous lawsuits to recover assets, and his fund is administered separately from Breeden's under different U.S. laws. Picard has racked up considerable fees himself, telling ABC News in 2015 that his firm might collect as much as $1 billion when all is done. He called it a "very good return on an investment." His fees are paid by the industry-financed Securities Investor Protection Corp. rather than from money recovered for victims. Breeden will eventually make recommendations to the Justice Department's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section on which claims to pay and which to deny. His firm has already been paid the $38.8 million in fees, the Justice Department said. Feeder funds Picard accepted claims only from Madoff's direct account holders. That meant customers of so-called feeder funds, which directed cash to Madoff's firm for years, weren't eligible. Feeder funds could, however, file claims with Picard and repay their investors if they received payments from the trustee. Breeden accepted claims from all Madoff investors, including feeder funds. That increased the amount of work, particularly because Madoff's records don't have any information about feeder-fund customers that could be used to verify claims. Madoff, 79, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence. His victims lost a combined $17.5 billion in principal, though their final account statements totaled about $64 billion including profit from bogus trades. Two TV movies His downfall has been the subject of two TV films. In February 2016, an ABC docudrama starred Richard Dreyfuss as Madoff and Blythe Danner as his wife Ruth. This month HBO is presenting "Madoff: The Wizard of Lies." Robert De Niro is Madoff and Michelle Pfeiffer is Ruth.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Economy Companies Markets Finance Regulation Business Markets US equities mark 4-session gains streak as concerns over Trump ease Tuesday's gains come less than a week after US stocks posted their worst daily decline in months. By Nicole Rojas May 24, 2017 01:24 BST Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, on 18 May 2017REUTERS/Brendan McDermid US equities closed higher Tuesday (23 May) as investors' optimism about the Trump administration rose following the White House's release of its 2018 budget proposal. The stock-index benchmarks marked their fourth straight session in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 43.08 points, or 0.2%, to close at 20,937.91. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JP Morgan Chase & Co, which suffered losses earlier in the session, added 32 points to the blue-chips gauge, MarketWatch reported. Meanwhile, a 1.3% rise in Caterpillar Inc added another nine points to the Dow. The S&P 500 index rose 4.40 points, or 0.2%, to end at 2,398.42. Gains were led by the financial and healthcare sectors, with 10 of the S&P's 11 sectors closing higher, MarketWatch reported. The Nasdaq Composite Index, meanwhile, inched up 5.09 points, or less than 0.1%, to settle at 6,138.71. The tech-heavy index marked its longest winning streak since 10 May, despite Apple shares dropping. Tuesday's gains come less than a week after equities dropped more than 1% on fears that US President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda was at risk, CNBC noted. News that Trump allegedly attempted to interfere in a federal investigation into his former national security adviser sent shockwaves throughout Wall Street. "As we get temporary spikes in volatility, ... these will continue to be buying opportunities because the fundamentals have been so strong," Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, told CNBC. Frederick noted that economic data has been solid and the latest earnings season surpassed expectations. Investors are keeping an eye on Trump's first overseas trip since becoming president. After stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel and Palestine, the president will be in Europe for the remainder of his trip. Trump's "trip overseas is definitely helping. Not so much because of what he'd done, but because he is tied up and doesn't have time to cause problems," Frederick added. The president's 2018 budget is also being eyed by investors. Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, told MarketWatch that Trump's budget is a "non-issue" as it is unlikely to pass Congress in its current form. "The market doesn't know what to make of it," Pavlik said. "If you're trading stocks on this budget proposal, then you're an idiot." In economic news, US flash PMI reading for services and manufacturing for May were mixed, MarketWatch reported. Manufacturing PMI dropped to an 8-month low, but services PMI jumped to a 4-month high. Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell to about 2.28% as investors prepare for the probability that tax reform may not come as soon as expected. Gold prices dropped 0.5% to settle at $1,255.50 an ounce, while the dollar traded 0.4% higher.

Check out what some of its cousins are up to. The market capitalization of digital currencies has soared over 50 per cent to more than US$90 billion (S$124.6 billion) in just the past seven days as the frenzy around cryptocurrencies reaches a fever pitch. Demand is swelling as more companies embrace the technology backing the method of exchange and some investors see it as a haven from political uncertainty across the globe. Numerous alternative cryptocurrencies, or "altcoins," have emerged since bitcoin broke into public consciousness in 2013. Companies can sell new tokens through initial coin offerings, or ICOs. Ether, a digital currency linked to the Ethereum blockchain, has more than doubled its worth in the last week and is currently the second most valuable cryptocurrency, behind bitcoin. The value of zcash, the cryptocurrency that announced a partnership with JPMorgan Chase & Co on Monday, has grown by nearly 200 per cent. Bitcoin's slice of the pie has shrunk recently as its peers have gained share. It now dominates about 45 per cent of the overall digital currency market, down from around 85 per cent in February, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. Meanwhile, Ethereum's share has increased to more than 20 per cent from 7 per cent in February. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up As for bitcoin, it smashed the US$2,000 mark on May 20 after soaring nearly 65 per cent in the last month. CNBC pointed out on Monday that if you bought US$100 in bitcoin seven years ago at the 0.003 cent price on May 22, 2010, it would now be worth almost US$73 million.

ROS LBoard 1 Repeating police report for publication is no defamation, rules court. V Anbalagan Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Maybank leads 14 Malaysian firms on Forbes Global 2000 list FMT Reporters | May 25, 2017 China and US companies continue to hold the top positions in the list of the world’s largest and most powerful public-listed companies. KUALA LUMPUR: Malayan Banking Bhd leads the 14 Malaysian companies that have made it into this year’s Forbes Global 2000 list. Worldwide, firms based in China have done very well to make it to the Forbes list, with Industrial & Commercial Bank of China taking top spot on the list. Maybank was ranked 390, with Tenaga Nasional following at 490 and Public Bank at 632. Maybank, which was also the highest ranked company from Malaysia in last year’s list, however, dropped from last year’s position of 362. Other Malaysian firms on the list this year: CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (671), Sime Darby Bhd (791), Genting Bhd (1,259), Petronas Chemical Group Bhd (1,319), RHB Bank Bhd (1,405), Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd (1,472), Axiata Group Bhd (1,510), MISC Bhd (1,543), Maxis Bhd (1,596), AmBank Group (1,771) and Petronas Gas Bhd (1,881). In the 2016 ranking, 15 Malaysian companies had made it to the list, while in 2015, there were 16 firms on the list. Forbes had earlier listed Malaysia as the 44th best country in the world for business. The top 10 companies on the list are: Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of America, Bank of China, Apple and Toyota Motor. Forbes said in a statement that the ranking was based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profits, assets and market value. Forbes noted that the list was prepared at a time of unsteady geopolitical climates and slowing economies. “Despite slowing gross domestic product figures, China and the US, whose companies make up more than 40% of the list, continue to dominate the top 10 list with financial giants,” Forbes said.

While Chinese companies’ foreign-currency debt is only a fraction of the US$9 trillion (RM38.64 trillion) local bond market, China Inc is on pace for record dollar bond sales this year after the authorities’ crackdown on financial leverage drove up borrowing costs at home. Overseas borrowing has also been part of the government’s strategy to encourage capital inflows in a bid to ease the depreciation pressure on the yuan. Airlines and shipping companies, which finance the costs of new aircraft and vessels with debt, are particularly vulnerable to higher borrowing costs, according to Corrine Png, chief executive officer of Crucial Perspective in Singapore. Khoon Goh, head of Asia research for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, sees state-owned enterprises and property developers feeling the biggest impact. Companies including State Grid Corp and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp raised US$23 billion in bond sales in April, an increase of 141 per cent from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With additional US$8.9 billion issuance so far in May, the sales this year totaled US$69 billion, representing 71 per cent of the record US$98 billion in 2016. Moody’s lowered China’s rating to A1 from Aa3 on Wednesday, citing a worsening debt outlook. Moody’s also downgraded the ratings of 26 non-financial corporate and infrastructure government-related issuers by one level. China’s Finance Ministry blasted the move as “absolutely groundless,” saying the ratings company has underestimated the capability of the government to deepen reform and boost demand. ‘Higher Leverage’ “The economy is dependent on policy stimulus and with that comes higher leverage,” Marie Diron, associate managing director, Moody’s Sovereign Risk Group, said on Bloomberg Television after the announcement. “Corporate debt is really the big part.” Market reaction has been muted. The yield premium on investment-grade notes from Chinese firms over government securities rose one to two basis points Wednesday, according to credit traders who aren’t authorized to speak publicly. Those spreads had already increased 10 basis points this quarter to 268.3, up from a decade-low of 257 in March, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co indexes. For major Chinese airlines, every per centage-point increase in average borrowing costs can cut net profit by 5 per cent to 9 per cent, said Crucial Perspective’s Png. For shipping companies, cuts to net profit may reach 15 per cent to 30 per cent. Reducing Exposure Hainan Airlines, controlled by conglomerate HNA Group Co, plans to buy 19 Boeing aircraft, using the proceeds of a convertible bond sale of up to 15 billion yuan, according to a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange on May 19. HNA itself has been one of China’s most acquisitive companies, with more than US$30 billion worth of announced and completed deals since 2016. Aircraft- and ship-leasing companies like COSCO Shipping Development Co, China Development Bank Financial Leasing Co and China Aircraft Leasing will also “try to pass on their higher financing cost to the airlines and shipping companies via higher aircraft and ship leasing rates,” Png said. Some of the country’s biggest companies, including China’s three major state-owned airlines, have been reducing their dollar debt exposure and borrowing more onshore. Sales of yuan bonds by Air China Ltd., China Eastern Airlines Corp and China Southern Airlines Co jumped more than threefold last year to 135.4 billion yuan (RM85.86 billion), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Air China said the carrier hasn’t issued US dollar bonds overseas for a while and its aircraft leasing and buying isn’t funded by the securities. Representatives for China Eastern, China Southern and Cosco didn’t respond to requests seeking comment, while a representative for China Aircraft Leasing said the rating downgrade would have no impact on the lessor. Starving for yields, investors have been scooping up the Chinese dollar bonds. The yields on the corporate dollar-denominated bonds have dropped to 5.05 per cent, from 5.18 per cent at the end of last year, according to JPMorgan. In comparison, China’s five-year AA rated onshore bonds increased to 5.73 per cent from 4.63 per cent, according to Chinabond data. Still, some high-leveraged firms may be affected by Moody’s downgrade. Yields on bonds sold by Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Investment due in 2020 rose six basis points to 8.72 per cent today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Auto industry to recover slowly this year, BMI Research says Ringgit opens at 4.2760/2810 against US dollar KL shares open higher, tracking trend on regional bourses Asian markets rally after Fed minutes, Opec meeting in focus Dollar on defensive after Fed minutes, euro resumes rise Singapore court fines ex-broker for corruption in 1MDB probe IRB hits Magnum, subsidiary with RM476m penalty Chinese automaker Geely takes 49.9pc stake in Proton PM: Malaysia and Indonesia will retaliate against countries which boycott palm oil Bank Negara’s MyClear merges with MEPS to form PayNet Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: Expedia enables hotel booking in Cuba Reuters Video: 'I didn't expect that to happen,' says Manchester bomber's father Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

For many Detroiters, these are wardrobe staples, but as the city evolves, so has its style. Detroit native Bernard Bentley is part of a new wave of young fashion designers who are redefining the Motor City’s style. Bentley, a former banker, sees his brand as a unifying force that can merge the energy and style of both native Detroiters and the city’s new transplants. “With Detroit’s new birth, the city has so many opportunities and LoveLifeSwagger showcases where Detroit was and where it’s going,” said Bentley. Established in 2009, LoveLifeSwagger is a lifestyle brand that tells a story of love, passion and hustle all while embodying ­Detroit’s grit and resilience. “Detroit has one of the fastest growing small business communities in the country. I wanted to start LoveLifeSwagger, a lifestyle streetwear brand, because Detroit has such an amazing story. It’s a love story. It’s a story of hustle. It’s a story of individuality and a story of style.” The line came out of Bentley’s passion for success beyond the typical 9 to 5 life. “Working as a banker in the mortgage industry, I was unhappy and wanted to quit every day,” he recalled. “One day I went to work and didn’t do any work. I just sat and pondered all day about what makes me happy and I figured out it was three words — love, life and swagger.” While deciding how to make this dream tangible, Bentley created a logo and promotional t-shirt that inadvertently gave birth to LoveLifeSwagger. “People really liked it and wanted to buy it. I saw people wearing the t-shirts with Gucci shoes and other luxury brand accessories and I knew at that point I had something special. From there, it evolved into a full clothing line,” he said. As the popularity of the brand grew, so did Bentley’s desire to expand. After acquiring retail space at 277 Gratiot Ave. in Detroit, he began to seek out ways to raise more capital for expansion. Bentley was able to grow his business with the help of programs like the JP Morgan Chase Bank Entrepreneur of Color Fund and Motor City Match. Both provided the access to capital that Bentley needed to renovate the retail space and the financial boost the brand needed. “I’ve been able to galvanize and get a lot of financial support from different businesses and non-profits. Detroit has a certain connotation that it doesn’t have the proper resources. But, the entrepreneurial spirit here is really strong. There are a lot of people getting behind that, donating and investing money in helping small business owners like myself get started and keep going,” he said.

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up While Chinese companies’ foreign-currency debt is only a fraction of the $9 trillion local bond market, China Inc. is on pace for record dollar bond sales this year after the authorities’ crackdown on financial leverage drove up borrowing costs at home. Overseas borrowing has also been part of the government’s strategy to encourage capital inflows in a bid to ease the depreciation pressure on the yuan. Airlines and shipping companies, which finance the costs of new aircraft and vessels with debt, are particularly vulnerable to higher borrowing costs, according to Corrine Png, chief executive officer of Crucial Perspective in Singapore. Khoon Goh, head of Asia research for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, sees state-owned enterprises among firms feeling the biggest impact. Companies including State Grid Corp. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp raised $23 billion in bond sales in April, an increase of 141 percent from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With additional $8.9 billion issuance so far in May, the sales this year totaled $69 billion, representing 71 percent of the record $98 billion in 2016. Moody’s lowered China’s rating to A1 from Aa3 on Wednesday, citing a worsening debt outlook. Moody’s also downgraded the ratings of 26 non-financial corporate and infrastructure government-related issuers by one level. China’s Finance Ministry blasted the move as “absolutely groundless,” saying the ratings company has underestimated the capability of the government to deepen reform and boost demand. ‘Higher Leverage’ “The economy is dependent on policy stimulus and with that comes higher leverage,” Marie Diron, associate managing director, Moody’s Sovereign Risk Group, said on Bloomberg Television after the announcement. “Corporate debt is really the big part.” Market reaction has been muted. The yield premium on investment-grade notes from Chinese firms over government securities rose one to two basis points Wednesday, according to credit traders who aren’t authorized to speak publicly. Those spreads had already increased 10 basis points this quarter to 268.3, up from a decade-low of 257 in March, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes. For major Chinese airlines, every percentage-point increase in average borrowing costs can cut net profit by 5 percent to 9 percent, said Crucial Perspective’s Png. For shipping companies, cuts to net profit may reach 15 percent to 30 percent. Reducing Exposure Hainan Airlines, controlled by conglomerate HNA Group Co., plans to buy 19 Boeing aircraft, using the proceeds of a convertible bond sale of up to 15 billion yuan ($2.2 billion), according to a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange on May 19. HNA itself has been one of China’s most acquisitive companies, with more than $30 billion worth of announced and completed deals since 2016. Aircraft- and ship-leasing companies like COSCO Shipping Development Co., China Development Bank Financial Leasing Co. and China Aircraft Leasing will also “try to pass on their higher financing cost to the airlines and shipping companies via higher aircraft and ship leasing rates,” Png said. Some of the country’s biggest companies, including China’s three major state-owned airlines, have been reducing their dollar debt exposure and borrowing more onshore. Sales of yuan bonds by Air China Ltd., China Eastern Airlines Corp. and China Southern Airlines Co. jumped more than threefold last year to 135.4 billion yuan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Air China said the carrier hasn’t issued U.S. dollar bonds overseas for a while and its aircraft leasing and buying isn’t funded by the securities. Representatives for China Eastern, China Southern and Cosco didn’t respond to requests seeking comment, while a representative for China Aircraft Leasing said the rating downgrade would have no impact on the lessor. Starving for yields, investors have been scooping up the Chinese dollar bonds. The yields on the corporate dollar-denominated bonds have dropped to 5.05 percent, from 5.18 percent at the end of last year, according to JPMorgan. In comparison, China’s five-year AA rated onshore bonds increased to 5.73 percent from 4.63 percent, according to Chinabond data. Still, some high-leveraged firms may be affected by Moody’s downgrade. Yields on bonds sold by Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Investment due in 2020 rose six basis points to 8.72 percent today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. — With assistance by Kenneth Pringle Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Europe's finding it's not that simple Wells Fargo CEO Sloan sees B of A's Moynihan as crisis management role model Regtech startup's mission: Find real terrorists, avoid false alarms Slideshow The evolution of the ATM search goes here BBVA and B of A move to make data sharing safer, less painful By Mary Wisniewski Brian Patrick Eha Published May 24 2017, 3:01pm EDT More in APIs Data sharing Mobile banking Bank technology BBVA Bank of America Print Email Reprints Share Share on Our app-driven world runs on data. If consumers want convenience and quality of service—and they do—that increasingly means sharing their personal information with third parties. Banks have begun making it easier and more appealing for them to do so. Among those at the forefront are BBVA and Bank of America, both of which this week announced new efforts to provide a rich supply of customer data to third-party companies and developers. The news comes as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is evaluating the myriad issues associated with data sharing, and the Center for Financial Services Innovation is studying the potential collateral damage that one-off data deals could cause. The European Union, meanwhile, is determining whether screen scraping—the method that requires consumers to share bank credentials—will be permitted in upcoming regulation. On Wednesday, BBVA struck a blow for open banking by launching a market to make eight of its application programming interfaces available to businesses for the first time. By accessing customers' financial data—with their permission, of course—and integrating it into applications, developers will be able to create new services and provide better user experiences around payments management, identity verification and more. The Spanish bank is "aiming to become the best platform on which to build new digital experiences," Derek White, BBVA's global head of customer solutions, said in a news release. "This is a customer-led business opportunity." BBVA's partners so far include the geomarketing startups Geoblink, Carto and Bismart, the software vendors SAGE, Anfix and Simplygest and companies on the IBEX 35, an index of the 35 most liquid stocks on Spain's primary stock exchange. During the API market's test phase last year, more than 1,500 businesses and developers registered to try it out. User-centric "For customers who use data aggregation services, we are making it more transparent and simpler for them to see who they're sharing data with and to turn it off when they want," says Bank of America's Michelle Moore. Earlier this week, Bank of America announced that it was working with two data aggregators on a new data-sharing model that will also use APIs. The experience is expected to work like this: Customers log in to the data aggregation service they use and are asked to verify or add a Bank of America account. They will then be connected to the Bank of America site to acknowledge their consent to share data. A spokeswoman declined to identify the two partners and said only that the bank is working with "all the major aggregators" to test this data-sharing model. "We value customer choice and want customers to securely access their information when and where they want," Michelle Moore, head of digital banking at Bank of America, said in a statement. "For customers who use data aggregation services, we are making it more transparent and simpler for them to see who they're sharing data with and to turn it off when they want." The model is similar to the ones other large banks have been making in recent months. Wells Fargo made a splash in April by welcoming an API partnership with Finicity, a data aggregator that supplies financial data to apps ranging from online lending to money management, in addition to making API deals with Intuit and Xero. A number of other banks have also struck data deals with technology companies. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, has partnered with Intuit. The idea of all such deals is to help bank customers share their data with apps in a safer way than by sharing their actual bank credentials, which is what personal finance apps such as Mint currently require of users. BBVA, too, says it is committed to customer privacy. Applications built using its APIs will be granted access to a customer's information only if that customer expressly allows it. The single exception, according to BBVA, is Paystat, which works with anonymized data in the aggregate pertaining to card transactions. Despite BBVA's talk of making open banking a reality, its API market initially will serve only the bank's Spanish customers, though plans call for it to be rolled out to American customers later this year. The bank intends eventually to open the market to Turkey, Mexico and the rest of Latin America. Banks such as BBVA, which says it aspires to become "the innovation engine" for third-party companies, have reason to hope that regulators won't come down too hard on data sharing. According to its news release, the Spanish bank expects that opening up its APIs could lead to new customers and loan originations. Its loan API, for instance, could be integrated into a third-party app in such a way that a BBVA customer could finance the purchase of a product or service at the point of sale with a BBVA loan. "The great thing about this business is that we can think up some basic uses, and build a service around those," Raúl Lucas, the bank's head of open APIs in Spain, said in a statement. "But when we make them available to third parties—the ones who really know their businesses—they come up with uses which would never even have occurred to us."

The administration's potential ties to Russia, and questions over whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the election, have shaken the White House since Trump's inauguration. The intrigue has led to the firing of Trump's national security advisor and the FBI director, investigations from Congress and a special counsel, and it has curdled market sentiment in the process. The lawmakers said that Deutsche Bank has failed to provide any detail publicly on the findings of internal reviews into the money-laundering scandal — a so-called "mirror trading" scheme that allegedly shuffled $10 billion out of Russia from 2011 to 2015 — and the personal accounts at the bank held by Trump and his family. "As a result, there is no transparency regarding who participated in, or benefited from, the Russian mirror trading scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia," according to a letter to Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan dated Tuesday. "Likewise," the letter continued, "Congress remains in the dark on whether loans Deutsche Bank made to President Trump were guaranteed by the Russian government, or were in any way connected to Russia." The lawmakers also called on the bank to appoint an independent auditor to review the Trumps' accounts. They also asked the bank to provide information on due diligence it conducted regarding "Trump's potential ties to senior Russian political leaders, oligarchs, and organized crime leaders, as well as potential violations of U.S. sanctions and anti-bribery statutes." U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank were down 1.6% at 18.94 in the stock market today, losing some ground after setting up for a potential breakout from a consolidation. Among other bank giants, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) dipped 0.1%. Citigroup (C) rose 0.9% to 62.27, nearing a 62.63 buy point. The letter also noted Deutsche Bank has two internal reviews of its own: one on the money-laundering scheme and another on Trump's as well as his family members' accounts at the lender. "At a time when nearly all other financial institutions refused to lend to Trump after his businesses repeatedly declared bankruptcy, Deutsche Bank continued to do so — even after the President sued the bank and defaulted on a prior loan from the Bank — to the point where his companies now owe your institution an estimated $340 million," the letter said. The legal scrutiny follows the $2.5 billion in fines Deutsche Bank racked up after it pleaded guilty in 2015 to rigging the Libor, and a $7.2 settlement the company agreed to last year with the Justice Department over precrisis mortgage investments gone bad.

(Flickr / CC 2.0) In normal times, Dee from New York would have ordered her copy of The Handmaid’s Tale from Amazon, but these are not normal times. Amazon is on the Grab Your Wallet list, a campaign to boycott retailers that sell Trump family products, which began as a response to the video revealing our now-president’s penchant for grabbing women “by the pussy.” Dee bought her book from a smaller retailer instead. Since Donald Trump’s election in November, and especially since his January inauguration, hundreds of small and not-so-small organizations have sprung up to oppose the president.  They joined the ranks of established left-leaning and liberal groups already revving up their engines to fight the administration. Among all the ways you can now voice your dissent, though, there’s one tactic that this president will surely understand: economic resistance aimed at his own businesses and those of his children. He may not be swayed by protesters filling the streets, but he does speak the language of money. Through a host of tactics—including boycotting stores that carry Trump products, punishing corporations and advertisers that underwrite the administration’s agenda, and disrupting business-as-usual at Trump companies—protesters are using the power of the purse to demonstrate their opposition and have planned a day of resistance against his brand on June 14th. Such economic dissent may prove to be an especially apt path of resistance, especially for the millions of Americans who reside in blue states and have struggled with a sense of powerlessness following the election. After all, it’s not immediately obvious how to take effective political action in the usual American way when your legislators already agree with you. But what blue-state dwellers lack in political sway they make up for in economic clout, since blue states have, on average, greater household incomes and more purchasing power than their red-state compatriots. The impact of coordinated blue-state boycotts could be enormous. That’s why Grab Your Wallet, along with Color of Change, a racial-justice group, and numerous other organizations are encouraging individuals to see their purchasing power as political muscle. Advertisement Square, Site wide “It was close at the polls, but it’s not close at the cash register,” Shannon Coulter, a founder of Grab Your Wallet, told me recently. And yet, even as throngs of organizations and hundreds of thousands of individuals throw their energy into economic tactics intended to weaken the president, it’s still an open question whether this type of resistance—or, more specifically, its current implementation—can precipitate anything in the way of meaningful change. “A Sprawling Landscape of Resistance” At first glance, Grab Your Wallet is a modest website: a Google spreadsheet that lists about 50 companies to boycott.  Included are the department stores Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, and Lord & Taylor, as well as online retailers like Overstock.com, Zappos, and Amazon, all of which sell some type of Trump swag. (The precise number of companies listed continues to decline, as retailers dump the Trump brand.) The site gets an impressive two million unique visitors every month, and when I spoke with Coulter, she told me that 22 retailers had dropped Trump products since the start of the boycott. She believes that this is just the beginning. “I don’t think we’ll see the full impact of the boycott until summer, because of how the retail cycle works,” she explained. The department store Nordstrom, for instance, the biggest company to date to drop the Ivanka Trump brand, sold through its existing inventory before indicating that it would not reorder. That announcement even attracted attention from the president, who tweeted: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person—always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” Color of Change has long deployed strategies of economic resistance, specifically by going after advertisers who underwrite hate. Now that Trump is in the White House, Rashad Robinson, the group’s executive director, told me that they’re focusing on the role of corporate enablers “who’ve made this administration possible.” He described a strategy in which his organization carefully selects a corporate target and then rallies its million-plus members to participate in a campaign designed to tarnish the company’s brand—unless its executives make more ethical advertising choices. Color of Change played a role in the recent ouster of Bill O’Reilly from Fox News by helping to influence some of the more than 50 major advertisers who pulled their financial support from his top-rated program. After advertisers fled, Fox gave O’Reilly the boot. Progressive groups are proving increasingly savvy when it comes to designing such consumer-driven tactics. The Center for Popular Democracy and the immigrant-rights group Make the Road New York recently co-launched a campaign called Corporate Backers of Hate, which targets Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, The Walt Disney Company, and a handful of other corporations that have provided various forms of support for Trump and his agenda. Wells Fargo, for instance, has lent millions of dollars to the president’s companies, is an investor in immigrant detention centers run by private, for-profit contractors, and has loaned money to developers for the Dakota Access Pipeline, the 1,172-mile oil pipe that would cross Standing Rock Sioux Tribe lands in North Dakota. (Trump signed a memo authorizing that pipeline within days of taking office.) The Corporate Backers of Hate website allows protesters to bypass customer service staff at these corporations and send messages directly to top executives and board members to express their disapproval. This strategy of going after the funding underlying Trump’s network has won some early victories. Several groups have been trying to cut off the flow of advertising dollars to Breitbart, the xenophobic pseudo-news site formerly run by White House strategist Steve Bannon. Leading the charge in this work is a Twitter-based group, Sleeping Giants, with a relatively simple proposition: it asks followers to take screenshots of ads on Breitbart—preferably next to an offensive headline—and then tweet that screenshot to the company in the ad along with a polite message asking it to stop underwriting hate. This approach has been wildly successful; according to Sleeping Giants, thousands of advertisers have pulled out of Breitbart. Nicholas Reville is a seasoned online organizer who has become a leading figure in the campaign to, as he says, make “hate unprofitable.” He believes that the Sleeping Giants model of digital resistance represents a new and important type of political action. “It’s very, very rare that you have an activism campaign where people are doing something other than signing a petition, showing up to a rally, [or] donating money,” he told me. Instead, he pointed out, an individual can now take a discrete action on his or her personal device and actually help win a victory when an advertiser pulls out of Breitbart. Some activists are going beyond screenshots and tweets. Journalist Naomi Klein recently released a video highlighting the fact that Trump’s brand is one of his most important sources of revenue and suggesting that “jamming” the brand—by turning it from a money-maker into a money-loser—would be a powerful form of resistance. She mentions tactics like clogging phone lines at Trump companies or making, and then canceling, reservations at his hotels. One activist who has been working on jamming those Trump phone lines, and who spoke with me on condition of anonymity, said that resisters like her had discovered that it was surprisingly easy to disrupt the president’s businesses. “The phone lines do not have the capacity to handle even medium-volume call traffic,” she said, and assured me that there was more phone jamming planned for the future. When I asked what she hoped to achieve through this tactic, she responded that the goal was to weaken President Trump financially, politically, and in every way imaginable. “These strategies are complements to other kinds of organizing,” she went on. “None of these tactics alone are going to bring down the Trump administration… that’s not how it works. This is part of a sprawling landscape of resistance.” Easy to Resist, Hard to Win The multitude of groups, campaigns, and individuals going after Donald Trump, Trump businesses, and companies supporting him or his political agenda do indeed form a sprawling, often chaotic landscape of resistance. I receive a dozen different, mostly uncoordinated action-alert messages in my inbox daily. In the weeks immediately following the inauguration, I found all that frenetic energy strangely appealing. After a couple of months of diffuse efforts, however, I began to wonder whether such efforts would be better spent on fewer, more coordinated campaigns. While Trump oppositionists undoubtedly feel a thrill of satisfaction when Nordstrom drops Ivanka’s product line and legions of advertisers pull out of Breitbart, it’s unclear whether these are steps on the path to a revised political landscape, or whether they are just feel-good wins leading nowhere in particular. This dilemma is perhaps best exemplified by the Boycott Trump app, which has been downloaded 350,000 times. The concept behind it is similar to the one that animates Grab Your Wallet. The app is essentially a list of companies to boycott, though it includes more than 250 of them, rather than the dozens on Grab Your Wallet, many because they sponsored Trump’s NBC show The Apprentice back in 2011. I asked Nathan Lerner, who heads an organization called the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, which is responsible for the app, what qualifies a company to be listed, and he said that any company connected to the president was worth listing. I then asked if his group was collaborating with other boycott efforts. “We’ve been a little frustrated with partnering,” Lerner told me. “Right now we’re seeing a ton of enthusiasm around boycotting Trump, but it’s fragmented. Folks are popping up doing great work, but they’re doing it on their own.” That seemed like a remarkably on-target summary of the situation, and Lerner’s group seemed to be an example of those working “on their own.” In search of answers, I called up Marshall Ganz, who would surely be in the hall of fame of community organizing if there were one. He worked with Cesar Chavez in the 1960s to organize California farmworkers and was an architect of Barack Obama’s organizing strategy for his presidential run in 2007. A professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School (and, full disclosure, once my professor), Ganz defines “strategy” as “how we turn what we have into what we need to get what we want.” That applies nicely to the Trump boycott concept, in which activists are trying to turn their discrete consumer power into collective influence great enough to change where our country is headed. 1   2   NEXT PAGE >>> TAGS: boycott business donald trump economy grab your wallet national politics president trump tomdispatch trump brand usa Watch a selection of Wibbitz videos based on Truthdig stories: Related Entries Why the Streets of Saudi Arabia Were So Quiet During Trump’s Visit Economist Joseph Stiglitz on Trump’s Budget: ‘It Doesn’t Make Any Economic Sense’ Defender of Chemical Companies Takes Charge of EPA Unit Overseeing Toxins Evidence of the Core Allegations Is Lacking in ‘Russiagate’ Email to a friend Get truth delivered to your inbox every day.

Given that European economies are seemingly turning the corner, the dollar might have some weakness ahead. This week's share watch places focus on five US shares and how they might possibly react during dollar weakness. Wells Fargo Wells Fargo is an American and International bank headquartered in San Francisco. Wells Fargo delivers around $21bn net income per annum. The interest rate normalisation cycle in the United States, should be positive for Wells Fargo earnings. Growing the loan book to $967.7, Wells Fargo will benefit from the increasing rates. The weakening dollar has meant that the Wells Fargo share price has pulled back a bit. Early in 2017 Wells Fargo was trading at $58 per share. Currently it is trading at $52 per share. Johnson & Johnson Johnson & Johnson is one of the most recognised brands in the world. This American -born multinational was founded in 1886 and produces medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer goods. In 2016, the company had an annual turnover of $72bn. About $38bn of those sales were in the US and $34bn outside of the US. Johnson & Johnson has seen its share price surge since late 2015. In September 2015, Johnson & Johnson was trading at $91 per share. Today it is trading at $127 per share. With about half of Johnson & Johnson's revenue being generated outside the US, the weakening dollar will have a minimal impact on the company’s top line. Exxon Mobil Exxon Mobil is the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. Exxon Mobil's upstream division is the largest contributor to revenue, contributing around 70% of total revenue.  Downstream production and chemicals make up the rest of the revenue. Shareholders in Exxon Mobil have had a hard time since the middle of 2014. June 2014 saw Exxon Mobil's share price at $103 per share. It is currently trading at around $80 per share. The low oil prices are likely to continue for a while so Exxon Mobil will use various hedging strategies. The weakening dollar will add much needed support for the oil price. Amazon Amazon is the world’s largest internet based retailer by total sales. The company started as an online book retailer in 1994 and has grown since to become one of the most well-known online retailers worldwide. The company has also ventured into hardware production like tablets and smart TVs. Amazon has seen its share price increase from $290 in January 2015 to $968 to date. This is an increase of 345% in just over two years. Currently Amazon is trading on a price earnings ratio of over a 100. Like Tencent in China (Naspers in South Africa), Amazon's earnings need to grow very aggressively to justify the share price. JP Morgan Chase JP Morgan Chase was formed in 2000, with the merger of Chase Manhattan Corporation and JP Morgan & Co. It is one of the biggest financial services firms in the US. The company is operating across 60 countries and has assets of $2.5trn. Last year has been an excellent year for JP Morgan Chase shareholders with a one year return of 36%. Companies like JP Morgan Chase are very sensitive to currency movements and policy uncertainty. The recent weakening dollar has led to a slight pullback in the share price. The share pulled back from $93 in March to $84 today. Do you agree with Kirk's stock picks?

Moody’s cuts its China rating for the first time since 1989 May, 24 2017 Author: Thema Newsroom A cause for concern? Related 22-year-old who lives with his parents stops the cyber attacks! Saudi King orders that women no longer need a man’s… China launches first domestically built aircraft carrier Moody’s Investors Service cut China’s sovereign credit rating for the first time in nearly three decades, citing expectations that the country’s financial strength will deteriorate in the coming years as debt keeps rising and the economy slows. In a Wednesday statement, Moody’s said it downgraded China’s rating to A1 from Aa3, while changing its outlook to stable from negative. In March of last year, it cut China’s outlook to negative from stable. Moody’s last cut its China credit rating in November 1989, not long after the bloody crackdown on mass protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square rocked the nation. Moody’s now rates China’s credit alongside that of countries such as Japan, Saudi Arabia and Israel. The news triggered an early selloff in Chinese stocks, with shares in Shanghai falling more than 1% before recovering, in addition to modest losses for the Chinese currency in the freely traded offshore market. The impact on the heavily-controlled domestic currency and bond markets was muted. China’s Ministry of Finance said the downgrade was based on an “inappropriate” procyclical method. In a statement posted to its website Wednesday, the ministry said the ratings agency’s decision “overestimated the difficulties in the Chinese economy, while underestimated the ability of the Chinese government to deepen supply-side reforms and reasonably expand total demand.” The move comes as Beijing has intensified a campaign in recent months to rein in risky investment and financing practices that pose a serious threat to the stability of the world’s second-largest economy. The People’s Bank of China has raised a suite of key short-term interest rates twice since early February, while the banking regulator cracked down on investment products with highly leveraged bets in capital markets. The central bank’s tightening efforts precede a key political conclave in fall, during which a number of top leadership changes are expected. Beijing has been eager to ensure economic stability in the run-up to that meeting. China posted economic growth of 6.9% in the first quarter. Still, a number of analysts are concerned that China’s economy has become too reliant on ever-rising levels of credit, much of which has been provided by the country’s expanding shadow banking sector. China’s total debt reached 253% of its gross domestic product last year, up from 213% in 2013 and 149% in 2008, according to J.P. Morgan. The rise in debt, which started in earnest with a massive stimulus program during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, has increasingly weighed on the world’s second-largest economy. Accommodative monetary policy and robust state spending over many years have also fueled excess production capacity in industries such as glass and steel, which has diverted funding to “zombie” companies rather than to promising firms in the real economy. “The downgrade reflects Moody’s expectation that China’s financial strength will erode somewhat over the coming years, with economy-wide debt continuing to rise as potential growth slows,” Moody’s said in the statement. “While ongoing progress on reforms is likely to transform the economy and financial system over time, it is not likely to prevent a further material rise in economy-wide debt, and the consequent increase in contingent liabilities for the government,” it added. Another ratings firm, Fitch Ratings, downgraded China’s debt in 2013 to A+, a rating that is on a par with Moody’s after the downgrade. S&P rates China’s debt at AA-, equivalent to a notch higher. The U.S. also saw its sovereign debt downgraded in August 2011 when S&P cut its rating to AA+ from AAA, the first such move in 70 years. S&P said the move was driven by the U.S. budget deal, which the ratings agency said hadn’t done enough to address the gloomy outlook for America’s finances. S&P affirmed its AA+ rating on the U.S. in June 2016; Moody’s and Fitch both maintain a triple-A rating for the country. Since the S&P rating cut, aggregate debt levels in the U.S. have remained fairly constant. Its ratio of debt to GDP stood at 252% in 2011, edging up to 256% as of the third quarter of 2016, according to the Bank for International Settlements—almost exactly the same level as in China now. The timing of Moody’s downgrade coincides with increased investor nerves about China. While China’s economy had held up well at the start of the year, surprising investors who had been bracing for a slowdown, more recent indicators point to weakening activity. The tightening of credit in China was the biggest risk cited by global fund managers surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch in May, and foreign investor interest in a range of Chinese assets has waned recently. “Investors are not that keen on Chinese bonds anyway,” said Ben Sy, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Hong Kong. The Moody’s downgrade could have an impact on China’s exchange rate and economy over the longer term as it could weaken Chinese companies’ ability to raise new debt or repay existing loans in global markets, said Zhu Chaoping, a China economist at UOB Kay Hian Holdings, a Singapore investment bank. “Once Chinese companies run into trouble with their overseas debt, the yuan will be under pressure,” Mr. Zhu said. In the freely traded offshore market, the U.S. dollar was recently at 6.8843 against the yuan, up slightly from 6.8808 at Tuesday’s close. In the onshore yuan market, where the central bank has a firm grip, the pair is up at 6.8932 from 6.8897 Tuesday. The yuan’s steady performance in the wake of the downgrade prompted some market participants to suspect intervention from the country’s central bank. “I would say that, without the PBOC’s heavy hand, Moody’s downgrade would have pushed the yuan down to at least 6.9100 this morning,” said a Shanghai-based senior currency trader at a domestic bank. China’s domestic bond market, which has fallen sharply in recent months due to Beijing’s efforts to reduce leverage and financial risk, appeared to shrug off the rating action. The yield on the 10-year Chinese government bond was recently unchanged at 3.67%. “This is because the onshore bond market remains dominated by local investors, especially banks and insurance companies, who are unlikely to take such news into consideration,” Mr. Zhu said. Chinese banks account for about two thirds of all trading in China’s $8 trillion bond market. Still, the downgrade could make foreign investors even more cautious about entering China’s onshore bond market, said Ken Cheung, Asia currency strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. The downgrade comes as China is planning to launch a bond connect program with Hong Kong that would allow foreign investors to more easily access the mainland market.

Deerfield-based Walgreens Boots Alliance ranked the highest among suburban-based firms, at No. 94. Other companies making the list were North Chicago-based AbbVie (143), Northbrook-based Allstate Corporation (200), Deerfield-based Mondlez International (213), Oak Brook-based McDonald's Corp. (215), Libertyville Township-based Abbott Laboratories (242), Riverwoods-based Discover Financial Services (317), Glenview-based Illinois Tool Works (465), and Deerfield-based Baxter International (520). Chicago-based Boeing Co. was the highest ranked Illinois-based company at No. 73, while Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway was the highest-ranked U.S. company at No. 3. Two China-based financial companies were ranked 1 and 2. Caterpillar Inc., which recently announced it is moving its headquarters from Peoria to Northbrook, dropped to No. 503 on the list. It was ranked at 155 last year. The annual list of the top 2,000 companies is based a mix of sales, profits, assets and market value. Forbes uses an equal weighting of all four metrics to rank companies according to size. Each company receives a separate score for each metric. Forbes adds up the scores to compile a composite score. The highest composite score gets the highest rank. In addition to Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Apple were the U.S. companies on the Top 10 list. "Forbes' 2017 Global 2000 list faces much pressure amid unsteady geopolitical climates and slowing economies. Yet, in aggregate, these 2,000 companies have managed to come out stronger than last year, with increased sales, profits, assets and market values," said Halah Touryalai, deputy editor of investing at Forbes Media. "Despite slowing GDP figures, China and the U.S., whose companies make up more than 40 percent of the list, continue to dominate the top 10 list with financial giants, "This list illustrates that in spite of headwinds, the world's dominant companies remain a steady force in an unpredictable and challenging environment," Touryalai added.
