Morgan Chase and Bank of America shares peaked at multidecade highs two months ago Everett Collection In 1976’s “Marathon Man,” Laurence Olivier (L) asks Dustin Hoffman (R), “Is it safe?” By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor If you’re wondering if it’s still safe to buy bank stocks, as earnings beats pushed J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. shares into record territory Friday, a bearish pattern in the charts suggests don’t do it — at least not for a while. J.P. Morgan’s stock JPM, +0.53%  closed up 0.5% on Friday, paring earlier gains of as much as 2.2% to an all-time intraday high of $88.17. The blue-chip bank reported before the market opened fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surged past expectations. B. of A.’s stock BAC, +0.39%  tacked on 0.4%, but was up 2.1% at a more than 8-year high of $23.41 earlier, as better-than-expected earnings offset a revenue miss. See also: The Trump question and 4 other things to know about this earnings season. Technicians like to say that there is nothing more bullish than a new high, unless of course the underlying technical indicators fail to validate the gains, which is a condition referred to as “bearish divergence.” And for the stocks of both JPMorgan and B. of A., a closely watched measure of momentum have actually been trending lower the past two months. FactSet For JPMorgan, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that tracks how the magnitude of recent price gains compare with the magnitude of declines, reached an all-time high of 87.42 on Nov. 14. Many chart watchers view readings above 70 as suggesting an overbought condition. Although the stock has run up 9% since then, amid optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-business and antiregulation policy promises, the RSI has declined to 62.60 on Friday. B. of A’s RSI peaked at a 34-year high of 88.57 on Nov. 15, and has since fallen to 62.86 despite a 14% surge in the stock price. FactSet The SPDR Financial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLF, +0.56% which houses both stocks, is also suffering from a bearish technical divergence. Don’t miss: Financial ETF nears highest level since 2008 after bullish bank results. Contrary to popular belief, overbought readings don’t mean a stock’s rally is close to over. As Constance Brown so proficiently pointed out in “Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional,” the ability to become overbought is actually a bullish sign. What can be bearish, however, is when technical oscillators such as RSI, which travel between zero and 100, fall below their overbought thresholds, and are unable to cross back above them despite continued gains in the stock price. Although JPMorgan and B. of A. shares have run up to new long-term intraday highs on Friday, JPMorgan’s RSI hasn’t peeked above 70 since Jan. 3, and B. of A.’s RSI hasn’t been above 70 since Dec. 15. Bearish divergences don’t always lead to long-term or even medium-term price tops, but they can, so they warn investors to wait until prices and technicals start telling the same story again. FactSet The sharp selloff in bank stocks in early 2014—JPMorgan’s tumbled 13% from late March to mid May that year and B. of A.’s plunged 19%—was preceded by bearish RSI divergences, as was JPMorgan’s pre-financial crisis peak in early May 2007 and B. of A.’s peak in late November 2006. For those looking to buy those stocks after a dip, don’t wait for the RSI to fall below the oversold threshold of 30, because if it does, it might suggest a longer-term downtrend may have started. For stocks in bull markets, Brown said “the 40 level is never broken.” FactSet For JPMorgan, some downside stock price levels to watch include the late December low of $85.04, previous resistance around $80.50, and the big one is the price gap between the Nov. 8 high of $70.54 and the Nov. 9 low of $71.32. Potential support levels for B. of A.’s stock include the late December low of $21.77, and the price gaps between Nov. 11 high and Nov. 12 low—$19.03 to $19.40—and between the Nov. 8 high and the Nov. 9 low—$17.10 to $17.40.

Updated: January 15, 2017 @ 10:55 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Classifieds AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Updated Jan 13, 2017 ___ Millennials are falling behind their boomer parents SOUTH MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin (AP) — Baby Boomers: your millennial children are worse off than you. Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Areas of freezing rain possible. Low 18F. Winds light and variable. Updated: January 15, 2017 @ 3:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Updated Jan 13, 2017 0 ___ Millennials are falling behind their boomer parents SOUTH MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin (AP) — Baby Boomers: your millennial children are worse off than you. Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Joyce M. Rosenberg, AP Business Writer Leave a comment In this Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, photo, Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis poses for photos in his home, in Los Angeles. When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) NEW YORK (AP) — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. “Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it’s not really your money till you pay your taxes,” says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. “At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped.” Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous’ cash reserves. “Cash is king” is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn’t coming in, and owners can’t get loans or investors, there’s no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they’d have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It’s especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. “They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy,” Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. “The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks,” JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he’s willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company’s more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company’s busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company’s cash position. “If everything went south, we’d probably have enough cash for two or three months,” he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They’ve given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They’ve also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that’s a sign of trouble to Basilo — they’re not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. “That’s how they think when they start their business. They’re very unprepared,” he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores’ down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor’s ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don’t want to tap them for cash flow. “We pretend that the savings doesn’t exist,” Dan Robinson says. _____ Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank’s CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America’s fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation’s largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts’ expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation’s largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts’ forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market’s big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.’s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance.

Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. --- The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The Associated Press Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 5:38PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 5:38PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print ___ Millennials are falling behind their boomer parents SOUTH MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin (AP) — Baby Boomers: your millennial children are worse off than you. Millennials earn 20 per cent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent, following a small 0.2 per cent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 per cent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 per cent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 per cent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 per cent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp.

The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,574.12.

Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. [auth] Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank’s CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America’s fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation’s largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts’ expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation’s largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts’ forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market’s big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.’s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman’s head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint’s founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it’s the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan’s Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet.

U.S. stock indexes moved higher in early trading Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 as investors pored over earnings reports from several big lenders. Banks and other financial companies were up the most. Utilities were the biggest laggard. Energy stocks also fell as crude oil prices headed lower. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday’s crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. “We all thought financials would do well,” said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade’s chief strategist. “Now how about the other areas of the economy?” The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. “If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it’s not an impressive number,” Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new “Call of Duty” and “Titanfall” games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany’s DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France’s CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) " JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) " Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) " The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) " Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp.

Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73.

Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) " Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect.

The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012.

Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp.

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. Most Read Stories Michael Bennett explodes at reporter following Seahawks-Falcons game Anti-Trumper John Kasich to doubters: I'm no lame duck Can’t make it to D.C.? Seattle will have own women’s march Man arrested after Bellevue mosque damaged in suspected arson  VIEW Seattle’s Mayor Murray kills city-run bike-share programUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank’s CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America’s fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation’s largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts’ expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation’s largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts’ forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market’s big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.’s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman’s head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint’s founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it’s the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan’s Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. The Associated Press Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03%, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2%, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5%, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8%, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5%, to 86.70 dollars. Bank of America rose nine cents, or 0.4%, to 23.01 dollars. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5%, to 55.31 dollars. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of US retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6% overall in December, mainly due to a pick-up in online shopping and sales of vehicles and petrol. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp, home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid 3.82 dollars, or 4.1%, to 89.31 dollars. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8%, to 44.20 dollars.

Pandora Media climbed 6.3% after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7% of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to 12.765 dollars. HomeStreet fell 6% after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid 1.85 dollars to 29.10 dollars. GameStop tumbled 8.1% after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new Call of Duty and Titanfall games. The stock shed 1.99 dollars to 22.73 dollars.

The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher today, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which will lead to higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard.

As expected, commentary on what the investment community really wanted to hear — 2017 guidance — was light. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon did say, "The U.S. economy may be building momentum. Looking ahead, there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities, and we are well positioned to play our part." On the conference call, Dimon, when asked about signs of that "building momentum," characteristically downplayed forecasting, saying "we don't react that much to the weather." But he said he was basing his observation "on a broad range of things, and it looks like growth may have done a little better in the fourth quarter, plus if you take a walk around the world, Japan's doing a little bit better, Europe's doing a little bit better. ..." As for the issue on everyone's mind — tax cuts and fewer regulations — Dimon said that regulatory relief may help banks open new branches and seek out clients they don't have "so I'm hoping you'll see a little bit of that." A lower tax rate would be "good for growth in the country in general." The bottom line on the impact of lower taxes and less regulation: "You have to see the whole package before you can see what the net impact is, but ultimately ... it's good for our franchise broadly." CFO Marianne Lake said the bank would provide details on 2017 guidance at its Investor Day, which is scheduled for Feb. 28. Bank of America's CFO Paul Donofrio said, "While the recent rise in interest rates came too late to impact fourth-quarter results, we expect to see a significant increase in net interest income in the first quarter of 2017." While they did not give guidance about how the combination of lower taxes and less regulations might impact earnings, Mr. Donofrio said they expected a similar tax rate of 31 percent for the average for 2017 excluding unusual items.

Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

JP Morgan Chase's net income rose 24 percent to $6.73 billion, from $5.43 billion the same quarter of 2015. Revenues were also up 2.4 percent to $24.33 billion during the October-December period of 2016, from $23.75 billion the same period in the previous year. After the release of the results, share value of JP Morgan Chase increased 1.6 percent on Wall Street to as high as $87.95. At Bank of America, net income increased 43 percent to $4.69 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was up from $3.28 billion from the same quarter the previous year. Revenues also increased, by 2.1 percent, to reach $19.99 billion from $19.58 billion during the same period. Shares of the bank gained 1.7 percent to $23.32 in the stock market after positive results. Stirred with illegal banking activities, Wells Fargo's earnings were highly anticipated. The bank said Friday its net income fell 5.3 percent to $5.3 billion in fourth quarter of 2016, from $5.6 billion the same quarter of 2015.  Revenues remained unchanged at $21.6 billion year-over-year. Despite the decline in net income, Wells Fargo earnings beat market expectations, which expected the bank to post less profits. Wells Fargo stock price gained 2.4 percent Friday morning to reach $56.01 in the stock market. "We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders," President and CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement, and added the bank is "fulfilling our regulatory requirements for sales practices matters." The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a $185 million fine in September for the illegal banking practices at Wells Fargo that dated to 2011, after employees opened millions of accounts and applied for half a million credit card accounts that were not authorized by customers, in order to boost sales figures and meet sales targets. Wells Fargo fired 5,300 of its employees involved in the scandal. Then-CEO John Stumpf agreed in September to forfeit his equity awards valued at $41 million and retired from the company.

Morgan Chase and Bank of America shares peaked at multidecade highs two months ago Everett Collection In 1976’s “Marathon Man,” Laurence Olivier (L) asks Dustin Hoffman (R), “Is it safe?” By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor If you’re wondering if it’s still safe to buy bank stocks, as earnings beats pushed J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. shares into record territory Friday, a bearish pattern in the charts suggests don’t do it — at least not for a while. J.P. Morgan’s stock JPM, +0.53%  closed up 0.5% on Friday, paring earlier gains of as much as 2.2% to an all-time intraday high of $88.17. The blue-chip bank reported before the market opened fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surged past expectations. B. of A.’s stock BAC, +0.39%  tacked on 0.4%, but was up 2.1% at a more than 8-year high of $23.41 earlier, as better-than-expected earnings offset a revenue miss. See also: The Trump question and 4 other things to know about this earnings season. Technicians like to say that there is nothing more bullish than a new high, unless of course the underlying technical indicators fail to validate the gains, which is a condition referred to as “bearish divergence.” And for the stocks of both JPMorgan and B. of A., a closely watched measure of momentum have actually been trending lower the past two months. FactSet For JPMorgan, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that tracks how the magnitude of recent price gains compare with the magnitude of declines, reached an all-time high of 87.42 on Nov. 14. Many chart watchers view readings above 70 as suggesting an overbought condition. Although the stock has run up 9% since then, amid optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-business and antiregulation policy promises, the RSI has declined to 62.60 on Friday. B. of A’s RSI peaked at a 34-year high of 88.57 on Nov. 15, and has since fallen to 62.86 despite a 14% surge in the stock price. FactSet The SPDR Financial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLF, +0.56% which houses both stocks, is also suffering from a bearish technical divergence. Don’t miss: Financial ETF nears highest level since 2008 after bullish bank results. Contrary to popular belief, overbought readings don’t mean a stock’s rally is close to over. As Constance Brown so proficiently pointed out in “Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional,” the ability to become overbought is actually a bullish sign. What can be bearish, however, is when technical oscillators such as RSI, which travel between zero and 100, fall below their overbought thresholds, and are unable to cross back above them despite continued gains in the stock price. Although JPMorgan and B. of A. shares have run up to new long-term intraday highs on Friday, JPMorgan’s RSI hasn’t peeked above 70 since Jan. 3, and B. of A.’s RSI hasn’t been above 70 since Dec. 15. Bearish divergences don’t always lead to long-term or even medium-term price tops, but they can, so they warn investors to wait until prices and technicals start telling the same story again. FactSet The sharp selloff in bank stocks in early 2014—JPMorgan’s tumbled 13% from late March to mid May that year and B. of A.’s plunged 19%—was preceded by bearish RSI divergences, as was JPMorgan’s pre-financial crisis peak in early May 2007 and B. of A.’s peak in late November 2006. For those looking to buy those stocks after a dip, don’t wait for the RSI to fall below the oversold threshold of 30, because if it does, it might suggest a longer-term downtrend may have started. For stocks in bull markets, Brown said “the 40 level is never broken.” FactSet For JPMorgan, some downside stock price levels to watch include the late December low of $85.04, previous resistance around $80.50, and the big one is the price gap between the Nov. 8 high of $70.54 and the Nov. 9 low of $71.32. Potential support levels for B. of A.’s stock include the late December low of $21.77, and the price gaps between Nov. 11 high and Nov. 12 low—$19.03 to $19.40—and between the Nov. 8 high and the Nov. 9 low—$17.10 to $17.40.

Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 per cent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 per cent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 per cent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 per cent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 per cent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 per cent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 per cent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 per cent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 per cent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 per cent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 per cent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 per cent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 per cent, to $15.48.

Morgan Chase and Bank of America shares peaked at multidecade highs two months ago Everett Collection In 1976’s “Marathon Man,” Laurence Olivier (L) asks Dustin Hoffman (R), “Is it safe?” By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor If you’re wondering if it’s still safe to buy bank stocks, as earnings beats pushed J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. shares into record territory Friday, a bearish pattern in the charts suggests don’t do it — at least not for a while. J.P. Morgan’s stock JPM, +0.53%  closed up 0.5% on Friday, paring earlier gains of as much as 2.2% to an all-time intraday high of $88.17. The blue-chip bank reported before the market opened fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surged past expectations. B. of A.’s stock BAC, +0.39%  tacked on 0.4%, but was up 2.1% at a more than 8-year high of $23.41 earlier, as better-than-expected earnings offset a revenue miss. See also: The Trump question and 4 other things to know about this earnings season. Technicians like to say that there is nothing more bullish than a new high, unless of course the underlying technical indicators fail to validate the gains, which is a condition referred to as “bearish divergence.” And for the stocks of both JPMorgan and B. of A., a closely watched measure of momentum have actually been trending lower the past two months. FactSet For JPMorgan, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that tracks how the magnitude of recent price gains compare with the magnitude of declines, reached an all-time high of 87.42 on Nov. 14. Many chart watchers view readings above 70 as suggesting an overbought condition. Although the stock has run up 9% since then, amid optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-business and antiregulation policy promises, the RSI has declined to 62.60 on Friday. B. of A’s RSI peaked at a 34-year high of 88.57 on Nov. 15, and has since fallen to 62.86 despite a 14% surge in the stock price. FactSet The SPDR Financial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLF, +0.56% which houses both stocks, is also suffering from a bearish technical divergence. Don’t miss: Financial ETF nears highest level since 2008 after bullish bank results. Contrary to popular belief, overbought readings don’t mean a stock’s rally is close to over. As Constance Brown so proficiently pointed out in “Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional,” the ability to become overbought is actually a bullish sign. What can be bearish, however, is when technical oscillators such as RSI, which travel between zero and 100, fall below their overbought thresholds, and are unable to cross back above them despite continued gains in the stock price. Although JPMorgan and B. of A. shares have run up to new long-term intraday highs on Friday, JPMorgan’s RSI hasn’t peeked above 70 since Jan. 3, and B. of A.’s RSI hasn’t been above 70 since Dec. 15. Bearish divergences don’t always lead to long-term or even medium-term price tops, but they can, so they warn investors to wait until prices and technicals start telling the same story again. FactSet The sharp selloff in bank stocks in early 2014—JPMorgan’s tumbled 13% from late March to mid May that year and B. of A.’s plunged 19%—was preceded by bearish RSI divergences, as was JPMorgan’s pre-financial crisis peak in early May 2007 and B. of A.’s peak in late November 2006. For those looking to buy those stocks after a dip, don’t wait for the RSI to fall below the oversold threshold of 30, because if it does, it might suggest a longer-term downtrend may have started. For stocks in bull markets, Brown said “the 40 level is never broken.” FactSet For JPMorgan, some downside stock price levels to watch include the late December low of $85.04, previous resistance around $80.50, and the big one is the price gap between the Nov. 8 high of $70.54 and the Nov. 9 low of $71.32. Potential support levels for B. of A.’s stock include the late December low of $21.77, and the price gaps between Nov. 11 high and Nov. 12 low—$19.03 to $19.40—and between the Nov. 8 high and the Nov. 9 low—$17.10 to $17.40.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Renae Merle January 13 Follow @renaemerle Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, walks through the halls between sessions during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in 2015. (Jason Alden/Bloomberg News) NEW YORK — Profits at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America surged last year, the banks said Friday, as the industry received a boost from a stock market rally that accelerated after the presidential election. The industry is entering what analysts say could be a period of renewed growth, with rising interest rates making it easier for banks to earn a profit and President-elect Donald Trump having said he will roll back regulations put in place after the financial crisis that have hampered industry profits. Increased trading levels across U.S. markets, which are near record levels, has also boosted the industry. JPMorgan and Bank of America, two of the largest banks in the world, both beat analysts’ profit expectations and gave positive forecasts for the future. “The optimism for positive change here at Bank of America and among our customers is palpable,” Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan said on a conference call with analysts. The new administration has raised the prospect of  corporate tax reform and regulatory changes, Moynihan said. “We’ll have to see how these topics play out, but we are optimistic,” he said. The North Carolina bank reported its largest yearly profit, nearly $18 billion, or $1.50 a share, since the financial crisis. During the fourth quarter, net income jumped 43 percent to $4.7 billion, or 40 cents a share, compared to the same period in 2015 as Bank of America continued to cut costs. Revenue increased about 2 percent during the quarter to $20 billion. At JPMorgan, chief executive Jamie Dimon also expressed optimism. “The U.S. economy may be building momentum,” he said in a statement. “Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth.” In a conference call, Dimon said he is “comforted” that Trump has picked “professionals” for his administration, including Treasury Department nominee Steven Mnuchin. “Give him some time,” said Dimon, who is serving on Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. JPMorgan’s profits jumped 24 percent during the fourth quarter to $6.73 billion, or $1.71 a share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 a share, during the same period a year ago. For the entire year, profits were up about 1 percent to $24.7 billion ($6.18 a share) while revenue reached more than $95 billion. “Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year,” Dimon said in a statement. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo lagged its competitors as it continues to recover from a sales scandal that put it in the crosshairs of lawmakers and sparked several federal investigations. In September, the bank admitted that thousands of low-level employees had set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas.  In some cases, the customers were charged various fees for accounts they did not know existed. The bank has apologized repeatedly and refunded more than $3 million to customers for fees they were charged on accounts they didn’t ask for. Earlier this week, the company announced a new pay plan that replaces the sales goals. But the scandal appears to be weighing on its bottom line. Wells Fargo opened 40 percent fewer checking accounts and 43 percent fewer credit cards in December compared with the same period in 2015. It reported a 4 percent dip in profits last year, $21.9 billion, or $3.99 a share, compared with $22.9 billion, or $4.12 a share, in 2015. Revenue increased about 3 percent to $88.3 billion. During the fourth quarter, net income dipped to $5.3 billion, or 96 cents a share, at the San Francisco bank compared with $5.6 billion ($1.03) during the same period in 2015. Revenue was flat during the quarter at about $21 billion. “We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders,” chief executive Tim Sloan said in a statement. “While we have more work to do, I am proud of the effort of our entire team to make things right for our customers and team members and to continue building a better Wells Fargo for the future.” business business true Please provide a valid email address.

Getty/Win McNamee Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours. Wall Street banks kicked off fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, and the tone was pretty optimistic. Two of the largest banks in the US, JPMorgan and Bank of America, beat analyst expectations, and JPMorgan beat on revenue expectations as well. Wells Fargo meanwhile missed on earnings in its first full quarter since its accounts scandal. The brightest spot was the firms' — and their CEOs' — commentary on the outlook for 2017. Here's the memo the CEO of JPMorgan's giant investment bank just sent to staff. Morgan Stanley just named 140 new managing directors. The US bank also laid off a number of senior investment bankers last week and cut bonuses by roughly 15% because of a decline in revenue from dealmaking. And Deutsche Bank plans to put its home German market and corporate customers at the center of its plans when it spells out more of its future strategy. Elsewhere on Wall Street,  Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, is headed to the White House. In markets news, Trump's tweets are driving millennials to make a rookie investing mistake. And inexperienced traders and electronic trading systems helped cause the pound's "flash crash," according to a new report from the Bank of International Settlements. In the tech sector, the first big tech IPO of 2017 is already showing a worrisome sign. Bets that Fitbit is in trouble are piling up. Snapchat is making its app less confusing as it prepares to IPO. And Pandora said it is laying off 7% of its workforce. Business Insider announced Friday that Pedro da Costa is joining as senior correspondent covering markets and finance, with a particular focus on the Federal Reserve. You can follow him on Twitter here.  Lastly, this is the final word on whether you can wear a dress shirt without a tie. Here are the top Wall Street headlines from the past 24 hours Americans have never been this conflicted about the economy's direction —The partisan difference in opinion on the US economy has never been this wide in the history of at least one major survey. Retail sales jump in December on strong car and online shopping — US retail sales rose roughly in line with expectations in December, according to the Commerce Department.  BARCLAYS: "Markets may have taken the wrong lessons from Donald Trump and Brexit" —Barclays believes traders and finance firms have "thrown the baby out with the bathwater" in the wake of Trump and Brexit, and are now overestimating the populist risk in the French election. There was a "moment of drama" at the first major gathering of OPEC ministers since the agreement to cut production —Gulf Cooperation Council oil ministers expressed confidence that sovereign producers would live up to their commitments to cut output at theGlobal Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi on Thursday — the first major gathering of key OPEC oil ministers since the November agreement to cut production. Asset manager BlackRock's quarterly profit falls 1.2% — BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, reported a 1.2%fall in quarterly profit on Friday as investors rushed into low-cost funds. It's time to start positioning your portfolio for rising interest rates —As Trumponomics get closer in the side mirror for the United States, fixed income investors would be wise to focus on allocations.  Goldman Sachs says millennials didn't inherit a spending habit companies have capitalized on for years — Millennials tend to do a lot of things differently than their parents. They'd rather pay for an Uber than a new outfit. They're cutting cable. And, apparently, they hate napkins. Lexus just unveiled a gorgeous yacht concept that's perfect for tech tycoons— Lexus is trying its hand at designing more than just cars.  Here's a first look at Mercedes' new 1,000 horsepower hybrid supercar —Mercedes-Benz and its AMG performance division announced on January 12 that it is set to introduce a new 1,000 horsepower hybrid hypercar. The 10 best islands for honeymooning —A honeymoon should be a trip to remember, but choosing a destination can be tough.

JPMorgan Chase led the pack with a 24 percent increase in profit, to $6.73 billion from $5.43 billion during the same period a year ago. Net income totaled $1.71 a share, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.43. JPMorgan shares were recently up 1.2 percent at $87.29. The Dow Jones industrial average — which has retreated this week after peaking last Friday at 19,999.63, just shy of the 20,000-point milestone — was little changed following the banks’ results, recently up 12.85 at 19,903.85. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon made a pitch during a Friday conference call for the deregulation of Wall Street, arguing that the Obama-era rules had held back economic growth. “No rational person that I know could possible say that all the things done were accurate, coordinated, consistent, proper and made it a safer system,” he said during a call with journalists. “It’s time to take a look at that. I hope the new administration does.” JPMorgan’s bond trading revenue rose 31 percent, to $3.37 billion, boosting the bank’s bottom line. The final three months of the year were rollercoaster of major financial events, with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, Trump’s election sparking a trading frenzy, and the fallout from Wells Fargo’s fake-accounts scandal taking hold. The year had begun with one of the sector’s worst quarters ever as stocks cratered on plummeting oil prices and weakness in the Chinese economy. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s CEO, pushed a narrative of “responsible growth” during a conference call as the bank reported an uneven quarter. Profit was up 43 percent on a nearly $1 billion cut in non-interest expenses, as $19.9 billion in revenue missed analysts’ expectations. The bank also projected it would buy back about $1.8 billion in stock during the first half of the year. “The optimism for positive change here at BofA and among our customers is palpable and has driven prices higher,” Moynihan said during a conference call. Friday was the first earnings announcement for Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, who stepped into the role in October after John Stumpf buckled under intense pressure to resign in the wake of the bank’s fake-accounts scandal. It wasn’t good. The bank’s profits slipped 5.4 percent to $5.27 billion, or 96 cents a share. Analysts expected a buck a share. Mortgage revenue fell by 15 percent to $1.42 billion, missing some analyts’ forecasts. Overall revenue was flat at $21.6 billion. Legal costs rose by 19 percent to $984 million amid the fake-accounts fracas. “We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders,” Sloan said in a statement.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. stocks were higher in morning trading on Friday, boosted by bank stocks after better-then-expected quarterly profits from Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, which bode well for the rest of the earnings season. Bank of America jumped 2.1 percent to $23.41, their highest since the financial crisis. JPMorgan surged 2.2 percent at a record high of $88.17 and Wells Fargo gained 3.1 percent to $56.20. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index's 1.04 percent rise leading the advancers. The KBW Bank index was up 2 percent, set for their best day since Dec. 1. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is a lot of optimism regarding the financial sector but any kind of cautious statement from them might cause a bit of a pullback," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. "All the changes that are being proposed for the sector is going to take some time, it's not going to happen right away." U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies to boost infrastructure spending and reform corporate taxes will benefit the economy. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise, boosted by hopes of deregulation and increased interest rates. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Trump's policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. Blackrock Chief Executive Larry Fink told CNBC that if the roll out of growth initiatives by Trump are slower, then the markets are ahead of themselves. Shares of the world's largest asset manager were up 1.7 percent at $384.56 after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Highlighting bank earnings: - Wells Fargo & Co., the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, said it believes it has reimbursed the customers it needs to in order to comply with at least one of three settlements over a bogus-accounts scandal. The San Francisco-based bank has been dealing with multiple lawsuits and a sharp drop in account openings after it settled with the Los Angeles City Attorney, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in September over charges that its employees created 2 million accounts without customers' consent. Chief Executive Timothy Sloan - who took over after John Stumpf resigned in the wake of the scandal - said he was pleased with the progress the bank has made in customer remediation, as well as its ongoing review of sales practices across the company. The bank disclosed the new details as it posted its fifth straight decline in quarterly earnings on Friday, results that diverged from rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N). Both posted significantly higher earnings on Friday on the back of higher interest rates and market gains since the U.S. election in November. Net income applicable to shareholders fell 6.4 percent to $4.87 billion, or 96 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $5.20 billion, or $1.00 per share, a year earlier. It said it has made $3.2 million of refunds for potentially unauthorized accounts that incurred fees and charges, which it believes fulfills its repayment requirements under the settlement to the L.A. City Attorney. It could not be determined whether the bank has reimbursement requirements under the other two settlements. A spokesman for Wells Fargo had no immediate response and a call to the Los Angeles City Attorney was not immediately returned. - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) reported a 24 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits on Friday, beating analyst expectations, as its Wall Street business benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, said earnings rose to $6.7 billion, or $1.71 per share, from $5.4 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding an atypical tax benefit, the bank earned $1.58 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan has one of the largest global investment banks, which affects its earnings significantly when market activity picks up or declines. Along with other big banks, it was widely expected to benefit from a wave of trading in stocks and bonds following Donald Trump's stunning victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. Revenue from fixed-income trading – JPMorgan's most volatile business – rose 31 percent to $3.4 billion, while stock trading revenue increased 8 percent to $1.2 billion. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), which reported results earlier on Friday, also said trading revenue surged last quarter. In a statement discussing results, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon cited those market trends, as well as growth in deposits and loans, higher credit card sales and competitive gains in "virtually all" of JPMorgan's businesses. The bank also kept a tight lid on expenses, he said. - BlackRock Inc, the world's biggest asset manager, reported better-than-expected quarterly profits on Friday as it clamped down on expenses and investors stormed into lower-cost funds to take advantage of a year-end rally. Investors poured $88 billion into the company's market-tracking index investments and its iShares exchange-traded funds during the quarter, while pulling $546 million from funds managed actively by portfolio managers, underscoring a stark dichotomy of investors favoring lower-cost, passive investments. "We're the big beneficiary of that change, but we'll be a beneficiary if there's a rebound into active," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told Reuters. - Bank of America Corp reported a 46.8 percent rise in quarterly profit on Friday, kicking off what is expected to be a strong period for U.S. banks following an upswing in market activity in the wake of the U.S. presidential election. Also helped by a sharp fall in expenses, net income attributable to shareholders of the No. 2 U.S. bank by assets rose to $4.34 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31 from $2.95 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share jumped to 40 cents from 27 cents. Analysts on an average had expected earnings of 38 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, although it was not immediately clear if the reported figures were comparable. Excluding a debt valuation adjustment, total sales and trading revenue rose 11 percent in the quarter, spurred by a surge in activity in stock and bond markets following Donald Trump's surprise victory on Nov. 8.   © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Posted 13 Jan 2017 20:35 Updated 14 Jan 2017 08:55 Traders work on the floor at the close of trading at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., December 28, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: An increase in Facebook pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 also rose after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook , which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

The Reuters photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: US stocks were higher in morning trading on Friday, boosted by bank stocks after better-then-expected quarterly profits from Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, which bode well for the rest of the earnings season. Bank of America jumped 2.1% to US$23.41, their highest since the financial crisis. JPMorgan surged 2.2% at a record high of US$88.17 and Wells Fargo gained 3.1% to US$56.20. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index’s 1.04% rise leading the advancers. The KBW Bank index was up 2%, set for their best day since Dec 1.

Shares of the world’s largest asset manager were up 1.7% at US$384.56 after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. US retail sales rose solidly in December amid strong demand for automobiles, with data showing retail sales increased 0.6% last month, slightly below the 0.7% increase expected by economists. A separate report at 10am ET is expected to show US consumer sentiment improved to 98.5 in January from 98.2. Pandora Media was up 8.2% at US$12.98 after the online radio service said it would reduce its US workforce and that it expects to surpass its fourth-quarter revenue forecast. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,769 to 810. On the Nasdaq, 1,722 issues rose and 544 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 15 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and four new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories US stocks off to worst start in 2017 after Trump speech S&P, Nasdaq flat; Goldman leads Dow lower Banks, oil stocks weigh on Wall St, keep Dow from 20,000 Wall St flat as banks, discretionary stocks fall, tech rises Wall St opens 2017 with big gains as banks surge You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read An odorous problem in OUG Lucky start to the new year Do we really need to fear China money?

Scott Gamm Jan 13, 2017 9:27 AM EST JPMorgan Chase's  (JPM)  fourth-quarter results justified the rally in the financials sector since the election. That's the assessment from Michael Ingram, a market analyst with BGC Partners, based in London. The bank reported fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Trading revenue rose 24%, while fixed income revenue surged 31%, thanks to market volatility following Donald Trump's election victory in November. Ingram said the only disappointment was a lack of movement in net interest margins during the quarter.  If you liked this article you might like Trifecta Stocks: Now It Gets Really Interesting Earnings season heats up next week as Donald Trump is sworn in as president.

 Wall Street is back Portia Crowe Jan. 13, 2017, 10:08 AM 10,769 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Getty/Mark Wilson Wall Street banks kicked off fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, and the tone was pretty optimistic. Two of the largest banks in the US, JPMorgan and Bank of America, beat analyst expectations, and JPMorgan beat on revenue expectations as well. But the brightest spot was the firms' — and their CEOs' — commentary on the outlook for 2017. "With strong leadership positions in our businesses against a backdrop of rising interest rates, we are well-positioned to continue to grow and deliver for our shareholders in 2017," Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement. His CFO, Paul Donofrio, referred to the December 2016 rise in interest rates and said, "We expect to see a significant increase in net interest income in the first quarter of 2017." The bank said it is expecting its net interest income to increase by about $600 million in the first quarter of 2017, "assuming rates remain at current levels and modest growth in loans and deposits." Bank of America is also increasing its buyback program for the first half of the year to $4.3 billion from $2.5 billion. Over at JPMorgan, CEO Jamie Dimon was candidly bullish on the US economy. "The US economy may be building momentum," he said in a statement. "Looking ahead, there is opportunity for good, rational, and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum, and help communities, and we are well-positioned to play our part." In a presentation, his firm also said it expects net interest income to be up modestly in the first quarter because of interest rate increases. JPMorgan's share price hit an all-time high shortly after the bank published results. Meanwhile, the business that had for years been killing Wall Street banks continued to bounce back. Both firms saw continued pickups in fixed income, currencies, and commodities trading revenues. At JPMorgan, FICC revenues were up 12% from the year-ago quarter, helping the bank post record fourth-quarter markets revenues. BAML's FICC revenues increased 31%. Bank stocks have also seen a massive postelection rally. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF is up 24% since Donald Trump's election win largely because of expectations that his administration will reduce financial regulations and boost dealmaking and economic activity. In other words, it looks as though there are good things to come for Wall Street banks.

"The issue that I have is that the bank stocks, if you give them price-to-earnings multiple, they're the cheapest of any group in the stock market. I would sell Procter & Gamble and buy JPMorgan right now, " Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street." Cramer said, "JPMorgan is a totally defensible buy because it doesn't sell at a high multiple to earnings." Bank stocks have rallied in recent months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will eliminate regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. On Friday, JPMorgan's quarterly earnings pushed well past analysts' expectations, helped by double-digit growth in deposits and record credit card sales. Its stock price was up 1.4 percent in early trading Friday. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a earnings release there is an opportunity this year for "good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented."

The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is a lot of optimism regarding the financial sector but any kind of cautious statement from them might cause a bit of a pullback," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. "All the changes that are being proposed for the sector is going to take some time, it's not going to happen right away." At 9:37 a.m. ET (1437 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 52.59 points, or 0.26 percent, at 19,943.59. The S&P 500 was up 5.77 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,276.21 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 22.46 points, or 0.4 percent, at 5,569.95. U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies to boost infrastructure spending and reform corporate taxes will benefit the economy. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise, boosted by hopes of deregulation and increased interest rates. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Trump's policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. Blackrock Chief Executive Larry Fink told CNBC that if the roll out of growth initiatives by Trump are slower, then the markets are ahead of themselves. Shares of the world's largest asset manager were up 1.7 percent at $384.56 after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. U.S. retail sales rose solidly in December amid strong demand for automobiles, with data showing retail sales increased 0.6 percent last month, slightly below the 0.7 percent increase expected by economists. A separate report at 10 a.m. ET is expected to show U.S. consumer sentiment improved to 98.5 in January from 98.2. Pandora Media was up 8.2 percent at $12.98 after the online radio service said it would reduce its U.S. workforce and that it expects to surpass its fourth-quarter revenue forecast. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,769 to 810. On the Nasdaq, 1,722 issues rose and 544 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 15 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and four new lows.

And with expected economic stimulus and tax cuts likely to bring interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve, banks are expected to see continued profitability this year. JPMorgan Chase announced record profits for 2016, boosted by a “dynamic” US economy and a surge in brokerage activities.  Annual net profit rose 1.2 per cent to US$27.7 billion (RM123.6 billion), including US$6.73 billion in the fourth quarter alone. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of US$6.19 for the year which was above analysts’ expectations. Bank of America said higher interest rates and an increase in consumer loans boosted earnings, but its business grew less than expected.  Net profit in 2016 jumped 13 per cent year-on-year to US$16.2 billion, marked by a 46.8 jump in the fourth quarter. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of US$1.50 for the year.  Bank of America, which had gained 35 per cent on Wall Street since the November 8 election, fell 0.17 per cent at 1225 GMT in pre-opening trading — reflecting the disappointment of investors who expected the post-election euphoria to boost earnings further.  While revenues from consumer loans increased as expected following the interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in December, revenues from market activities were not as strong as hoped. “If the recent rate hike occurred too late to boost fourth quarter results, we anticipate a higher profit growth in the first quarter of 2017,” chief financial officer Paul Donofrio said in a press release.  The Fed has suggested it could raise rates three times this year, given that the Trump administration promises deregulation of the financial sector, massive tax cuts and large investments in infrastructure.  Meanwhile, troubled Wells Fargo reported lower-than-expected 2016 results, hit by the scandal over thousands of fictitious accounts created without the knowledge of its clients. In the fallout the bank paid a fine of US$185 million and the CEO resigned under pressure. Net profit fell 4.2 per cent to US$21.94 billion last year, including a drop of 5.4 per cent in the fourth quarter alone due to a series of costly measures the bank implemented to regain consumer confidence.

Finance Search Major US banks post strong 2016 earningsAFP – Fri, Jan 13, 2017 8:51 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo JPMorgan Chase announced record profits for 2016, boosted by a "dynamic" US economy and a surge in brokerage activities Wells Fargo reported lower fourth-quarter earnings Friday, underperforming two large rivals, following its bogus accounts scandal, but the firms were upbeat about the outlook. The banks said they were hopeful higher interest rates and a potentially more favorable regulatory climate under President-elect Donald Trump could boost the industry. Wells Fargo, which has been under pressure following revelations last fall that it opened some two million accounts without their customers' knowledge, said it refunded $3.2 million in fees resulting from the fake accounts, up from the prior $2.6 million. Research also showed more than 175,000 customers who had unauthorized credit cards opened received a lower credit rating from a credit bureau, the bank said. However, some of the data released by the bank suggested clients are beginning to move past the debacle. Total branch interactions in December rose 11 percent from November, although they were still down six percent from the year-ago period. Wells chief executive Tim Sloan said on an analyst conference call the bank welcomed signs of a possible ?inflection point,? although it was too soon to know. Net profit fell 4.2 percent to $21.94 billion last year, including a drop of 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter alone due to a series of costly measures the bank implemented to regain consumer confidence. Despite the woes over Wells Fargo accounts, the banking sector is viewed as having strong prospects, boosted by the recovering economy and booming financial market that followed the Trump's election. And with expected economic stimulus and tax cuts likely to bring interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve, banks are likely to see continued profitability this year. The Dow Jones US Banks Index has risen about 25 percent since November 8. Investors cheered the earnings reports, lifting shares of Wells Fargo 2.4 percent to $55.80, Bank of America 1.0 percent to $23.17 and JPMorgan Chase 1.2 percent to $87.28 in midday trading. - Dimon hopeful on Trump - JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, announced record profits for 2016, boosted by a "dynamic" US economy and a surge in brokerage activities. Annual net profit rose 1.2 percent to $27.7 billion, including $6.73 billion in the fourth quarter alone. Executives with JPMorgan described US consumer activity as resilient and the US economy as generally solid. Total loans were $894.8 billion, up seven percent from the year-ago period. Chief executive Jamie Dimon said he was encouraged by Trump's selection of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and Steven Mnuchin as secretary of treasury. He also said he was hopeful the president-elect's broadsides against free trade were political rhetoric and would be followed up with more reasonable policies. ?I have some confidence he'll do the right thing for America,? Dimon said on a conference call with reporters. ?Give him some time.? Bank of America said higher interest rates and an increase in consumer loans boosted earnings, but its business grew less than expected. Net profit in 2016 jumped 13 percent year-on-year to $16.2 billion, marked by a 46.8 jump in the fourth quarter. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 for the year. While revenues from consumer loans increased as expected following the Federal Reserve interest rate hike in December, revenues from market activities were not as strong as hoped. "If the recent rate hike occurred too late to boost fourth quarter results, we anticipate a higher profit growth in the first quarter of 2017," chief financial officer Paul Donofrio said in a press release. The Fed has suggested it could raise rates three times this year, given the Trump administration promises of massive tax cuts and large investments in infrastructure, which could fuel inflation.

While Dimon wouldn't defend the trades, he repeatedly called the $2 billion loss "purely management's mistakes," refusing to yield any... By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon seems hopeful that better times for the economy lie ahead under President-elect Donald Trump. The bank reported better than expected profit for the fourth quarter Friday. And in its earnings release, Dimon suggested more good news could be coming for banks -- and for Americans -- in the months ahead. "The U.S. economy may be building momentum," Dimon said. "Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities." Dimon didn't mention Trump by name or cite specifics about the possibility of Trump and the Republican-led Congress unwinding some of President Obama's financial reforms. During a conference call with reporters, Dimon tempered his enthusiasm. "I'm usually an optimist. But I'm neither euphoric nor depressed," he said, adding that he is hopeful there will be more regulatory and tax reform. He added that it's too soon to tell what, if anything, will change in Washington. Dimon will clearly have a key role in helping the new president's economic policy though. Dimon is one of 16 CEOs on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group that also includes IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, Disney CEO Bob Iger, GM CEO Mary Barra and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. Asked during the media call what advice he would whisper in Trump's ear, Dimon quipped, "I don't whisper." He declined to give specifics about what specifically he would suggest, saying there is no one big thing that must be addressed first. Answering a question from CNNMoney, Dimon said he was not overly worried about Trump's attacks against companies for doing business in Mexico or about his protectionist rhetoric -- even though JPMorgan Chase does business around the globe. Dimon said he's putting aside the Trump one-liners and is "comforted" that Trump has put "professionals" in the administration such as treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs exec, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary and former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. "Give him some time," Dimon said of Trump. Even though Dimon said there are still questions about what's next for banks, Wall Street seemed pleased with the results. JPMorgan Chase's stock was up nearly 2% in early trading Friday following its earnings. The stock, along with that of other banks, has been on a tear since the election -- largely because of hopes for fewer regulations and rising interest rates, which would boost profits. Shares of JPMorgan Chase are up 23% since the election. Bank of America has also risen sharply, and it, too, reported solid earnings Friday morning. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan didn't mention Trump either in his bank's earnings release. But he pointed out that the Fed, which raised interest rates last month and is expected to do so several more times this year, will help BofA. JPMorgan Chase CFO Marianne Lake echoed that during her bank's earnings call with reporters. She said the company was excited about more rate hikes but that it will take time for them to improve profits. "We are still at absolutely very low levels of rates," she noted. Scandal-ridden Wells Fargo also reported its latest results on Friday morning. The bank, which was forced to admit last year that it opened up millions of fake accounts, disappointed Wall Street with earnings and sales that missed forecasts. But shares of both BofA and Wells Fargo rallied Friday along with JPMorgan Chase. Several other big banks, including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, will report their latest results next week. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

News Week In Review: Trump Murders Drug Stocks; Apple Breaks Out; GM Bullish President-elect Donald Trump accused drugmakers of "getting away with murder" and took aim at the costly F-35 fighter jet again at this week's press conference. (AP) IBD STAFF 1/13/2017 Reprints President-elect Donald Trump slammed the high cost of drugs and the F-35 once again, pressuring related stocks. But General Motors (GM), Amazon (AMZN), consumers and small businesses are bullish. Apple (AAPL) hit a buy point, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other bank stocks reported earnings. Nasdaq Hits High As Apple Trumps Drugs Donald Trump continued to go after companies and industries and he didn't talk much about tax cuts or other stimulus, but the major averages held up well. The Nasdaq rose 1% to all-time highs. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.4% and the S&P 500 0.1%. Drug and biotech stocks tumbled on Trump's pledge to go after high prices. But Apple broke out of a base, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix (NFLX). Bank stocks rose modestly Friday after JPMorgan, BofA and Wells Fargo reported earnings and Treasury yields rebounded. Trump: Drugmakers 'Getting Away With Murder' President-elect Trump doubled-down on his criticism of high drug prices, saying Wednesday that the industry is "getting away with murder." He said that "new bidding procedures" are needed, suggesting support for legislation traditionally favored by Democrats, not Republicans. Drug and biotech stocks sold off hard on the comments. Trump also returned to attacking the costly Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet, saying he'll save billions of dollars as he pushes more competition. Lockheed, which has said that it is reducing per-jet costs after years of overruns and delays, said that it's promised to "aggressively" reduce F-35 expenses. Lockheed's CEO met with Trump on Friday, their second such meeting since the election. Lockheed rose modestly Friday, but fell 1.3% for the week. RELATED: Trump Says Drugmakers 'Getting Away With Murder', Cites F-35, Ford, Fiat Trump Vows Fighter-Jet Competition, 'Big Things' On Lockheed F-35 JPMorgan Beats, BofA Mixed, Wells Misses Three banking giants kicked off earnings season for the sector on Friday with differing results. JPMorgan Chase beat on earnings and revenue while Bank of America (BAC) topped on earnings but fell short on revenue. Wells Fargo (WFC), still dealing with the fallout from its false accounts scandal, missed on the top and bottom line. All three rose modestly on Friday. RELATED: JPMorgan Beats, Bank Of America Q4 Results Mixed; Wells Fargo Misses Consumers, Business Optimism Soaring The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose 0.8 point in January to 55.6, a fresh 10-year high after soaring 3.4 points in December. Americans have become much more upbeat since the presidential election, as stock markets have soared on hopes that Donald Trump will cut taxes and regulation and ramp up infrastructure spending to boost economic growth. Meanwhile, the NFIB's small business optimism index spiked in December to a 12-year best. A net 50% of small firms see business conditions improving vs. -7% in October. RELATED: Economic Optimism Hits New 10-Year High As Trump Rally Continues Trump Bump: Small Business Optimism Soars To 12-Year High General Motors, Ford Bullish On Future General Motors sees 2017 EPS of $6-$6.50 up from its 2016 target of $5.50-$6.00. Analysts have expected $6.01 for 2016, but then a decline to $5.71 this year. GM, which recently reported a surprisingly strong 10% gain in U.S. sales for December, also added $5 billion to its stock buyback program. Ford, meanwhile, added $200 million — or 5 cents a share — to its regular quarterly dividend. Ford sees earnings falling this year amid heavy investments, but "improved profitability" in 2018. GM shares rose 3.75% for the week, hitting their best levels in nearly two years. Ford fell 1%. Fiat Chrysler Slammed On Diesel Emissions The EPA accused Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) of cheating diesel emissions standards in some 104,000 recent trucks and SUVs. Fiat Chrysler denied any wrongdoing, but shares fell 10% Thursday after hitting a record high earlier that day. Earlier in the week, Volkswagen (VLKAY) pleaded guilty in relation to its diesel emissions testing, agreeing to pay a $4.3 billion fine. Prosecutors charged 5 VW officials living in Germany. Tesla Motors (TSLA) hired two Apple execs, one of whom will head up the automaker's Autopilot software efforts. CEO Elon Musk once mocked Apple, which has its own unconfirmed "Project Titan" electric car initiative, as a "Tesla graveyard." Tesla also sketched out how it will charge fees for using its Supercharger fees, but only for drivers who order after Jan. 15. Tesla shares rose 3.8% to seven-month highs. RELATED: General Motors Soars On Bullish Earnings Forecast; Ford Looks To 2018 Walgreens-Rite Aid Approval Soon The Federal Trade Commission is expected to approve the drugstore merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) before the Obama administration ends on Jan. 20, the New York Post reported, citing sources. Walgreens announced the $9-a-share deal back in October 2015. Shares of Walgreens rose 0.9% while Rite Aid climbed 3.1% to 8.66. Smaller rival Fred's (FRED), which is buying 865 Rite Aid stores as part of the effort to ease antitrust concerns, fell 8.6%. RELATED: Walgreens-Rite Aid Merger OK Seen Before Trump Takes Office Amazon Will Add 100,000 U.S. Jobs Fresh off another strong holiday season for the e-commerce giant, Amazon said it would expand its "full-time, full-benefit" U.S.-based workforce to 280,000 by mid-2018, from 180,000 last year. Amazon's workforce was 30,000 in 2011. Amazon is adding positions "from engineers and software developers to those seeking entry-level positions and on-the-job training." Amazon's gain is likely to come at the expense of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and other rivals. Amazon rose 2.7% for the week, closing in on all-time highs. RELATED: Amazon Plants A 'We're Hiring' Sign To Reach 100,000 New Jobs Holidays Weren't Just For Amazon The holidays were rough on retailers not named Amazon.com (AMZN), as online shopping and subdued store traffic hung heavy. But it wasn't all bad: Morgan Stanley analysts called Lululemon (LULU), which lifted the low end of guidance, a holiday "standout" following its appearance of the annual ICR conference. Francesca's (FRAN) and Genesco (GCO) now expect results toward the upper end of previously announced guidance, and Ollie's Bargain Outlets (OLLI) raised its outlook. Wells Fargo analysts like Lululemon and off-price retailers such as TJX Cos. (TJX), but said the said the retail sector is generally almost "uninvestable." Retail sales rose 0.6% in December, slightly below views, and just 0.2% excluding autos. Nonstore sales, including Amazon, led the way while department stores struggled. Oil Prices Swing On U.S. Gains, OPEC Cuts Oil prices fell hard early in the week, then bounced back somewhat as traders try to balance current and future U.S. production gains against OPEC output curbs. But crude futures closed down 3% to $52.37 a barrel, their biggest drop since early November. North American oil companies' spending on exploration and production will rise 27% this year after falling the prior two years, but higher oilfield service costs will account for some of the increase, according to Barclays analysts. Hess Corp. (HES) and Parsley Energy (PE) said they would boost spending this year. The EIA said U.S. crude stockpiles increased by 4.1 million barrels, well above the 1.2 million-barrel increase analysts expected. U.S. production rose 1.9% to 8.95 million barrels per day, the biggest increase in 20 months, with total production level hitting an eight-month high. Russia and Kazakhstan are cutting back output and Saudi Arabia has reduced deliveries to Asia as part of the OPEC deal, but Iraq is reportedly trying to boost exports even further.

The company said margin pressure from higher fuel and labor costs "is likely to peak" in Q1, but that margins should begin expanding by the second half of the year. Delta also said that Donald Trump's victory has already boosted demand and hopes a Trump administration will bring opportunities for tax and regulatory reform, infrastructure improvement, and greater consideration of its case against Middle East rivals. The big U.S. airlines say those carriers have expanded in the U.S. on their governments' dime, an accusation those carriers have denied. Meanwhile, American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) also lifted their Q1 unit-revenue forecasts.

Analysts said Applied Optoelectronics has been boosted by demand from Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB). Demand from China has also been driving revenue growth for fiber-optic component makers, but there's been speculation demand has softened. Oclaro stock rose after it said business in China has been strong as normal at a Needham & Co. conference while shares in Acacia Communications (ACIA) fell on more cautious comments.

(MDCO) announced strong interim data on an LDL buster different enough to avoid a patent battle with No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN). But Trump's harsh rhetoric vs. the drug industry and prices chilled optimism. Chipotle Trending, Jack In The Box Customers 'Forgiving' Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) forecast fourth-quarter EPS and revenue below Wall Street expectations. However, improvements in same-store sales trends helped lift shares during the week. Jack in the Box (JACK) said at the 2017 ICR Conference that its late-night delivery customers, which in San Francisco can have the burger chain's food delivered through a partnership with DoorDash, were more "forgiving" on food quality. Burgers and fries tend not to hold up as well in takeout containers as tacos — Jack's best-selling item — and pizza. Other restaurants are assessing how takeout services from GrubHub (GRUB), DoorDash, Uber Eats and others fit into their business. Gaming-and-sports bar chain Dave & Buster's (PLAY) said it provided an experience that "can't be duplicated at home," while Domino's Pizza (DPZ) touted its digital ordering platform and international growth potential.

(TSM) earned 61 cents per American depositary receipt, up 42% year over year, on sales of nearly $8.25 billion, up 32%. Analysts expected 59 cents and $8.16 billion for TSMC's Q4. But for the current Q1, TSMC sees revenue of $7.44 billion at the midpoint of its guidance. It did not give an earnings target. Wall Street has been modeling TSMC to earn 51 cents per ADR, up 34% year over year, on sales of $7.67 billion, up 25%, in the March quarter.

The company on Friday reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.71 per share on revenue of $24.333 billion. Its stock price edged higher in premarket trading. Analysts expected JPMorgan Chase to report a profit of $1.44 per share on revenue of $23.949 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. The stock has been near 52-week highs since mid-December. Fridays' report marks the bank's first results since the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate target in a year. The Fed is expected to raise them again three times this year. JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said as the U.S. economy builds momentum, there is opportunity for "good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented." David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jamie Dimon "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year, reflecting our intense client focus and solid performance across our businesses," Dimon said in a release. "In the Consumer business, we had double digit growth in deposits and core loan balances, our credit card sales volume was a record, and for the year we had over $1 trillion of merchant processing volume," he said. Bank stocks have rallied in recent months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will eliminate regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan's return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 12.2 percent in the latest quarter. The bank's full year net income came in at $24.7 billion, or $6.19 per share. The bank also said it returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Total noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $13.83 billion, primarily driven by lower legal expenses. Last year, JPMorgan surpassed Wells Fargo to become the world's most valuable bank by market capitalization. That change came as JPMorgan rose slightly and Wells suffered the fallout of a phony customer account scandal. On Friday, Wells Fargo posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed on the top and bottom lines, sending shares lower nearly 1 percent in premarket trading. —Reuters contributed to this report.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad JPMorgan profit climbs 24 percent, beating forecasts, on trading surge By Reuters Published: 09:34 EST, 13 January 2017 | Updated: 09:34 EST, 13 January 2017 e-mail By David Henry and Sweta Singh Jan 13 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a 24 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits on Friday, beating analyst expectations, as its Wall Street business benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, said earnings rose to $6.7 billion, or $1.71 per share, from $5.4 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding an atypical tax benefit, the bank earned $1.58 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan has one of the largest global investment banks, which affects its earnings significantly when market activity picks up or declines. Along with other big banks, it was widely expected to benefit from a wave of trading in stocks and bonds following Donald Trump's stunning victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. Revenue from fixed-income trading - JPMorgan's most volatile business - rose 31 percent to $3.4 billion, while stock trading revenue increased 8 percent to $1.2 billion. Bank of America Corp, which reported results earlier on Friday, also said trading revenue surged last quarter. In a statement discussing results, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon cited those market trends, as well as growth in deposits and loans, higher credit card sales and competitive gains in "virtually all" of JPMorgan's businesses. The bank also kept a tight lid on expenses, he said. JPMorgan's shares were little changed in premarket trading. Like other banks, its stock has seen big gains since the election on expectations that Trump's plans to cut taxes, ease regulations and boost infrastructure spending will help profits. JPMorgan's stock had risen 23 percent from the election through Thursday's close. Wells Fargo & Co also reported earnings on Friday, but its much smaller trading business did not benefit from post-election market enthusiasm. Its results were also hurt by the fallout from a sales scandal. Looking ahead, big banks are expected to benefit this year from rising interest rates, which allow them to charge more money for loans. The Federal Reserve, which raised a key rate target by a quarter of a percentage point in December, is expected to raise them again three times in 2017. JPMorgan said its net interest income rose 5 percent during the fourth quarter to $12.1 billion, thanks to an uptick in rates, as well as more lending. The bank's total net revenue rose 2.5 percent to $24.33 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $23.95 billion.

The bank's net income rose to $6.73 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31 from $5.43 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to $1.71 from $1.32. (http://bit.ly/2jeHFAY) Analysts had expected earnings of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the reported results were comparable. The earnings for both the latest and year-earlier periods included special items. Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank, kicked off the quarterly earnings period for big U.S. lenders earlier on Friday, announcing a 46.8 percent rise in profit. The stunning election of Donald Trump on Nov. 8 set off a wave of trading in stocks and bonds during what is normally a slow period for trading desks at big banks. JPMorgan and BofA were also reporting their first results since the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate target for the second time since 2006 on Dec. 14. Higher interest rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to charge higher rates on loans.

 JPMorgan beats, has a record-breaking quarter Portia Crowe Jan. 13, 2017, 7:30 AM 4,135 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Getty/Win McNamee JPMorgan just reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations. The firm on Friday reported earnings per share of $1.71 on revenue of $24.33 billion. Analysts were expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $24.17 billion, according to Bloomberg. "2016 demonstrated the strength and depth of our platform with record net income and EPS in an increasingly complex global environment," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. The corporate and investment bank had its best revenue on record for a fourth quarter, according to chief financial officer Marianne Lake. The markets business — including both fixed income and equities trading — also had its highest revenues on record for the fourth quarter. Here's the breakdown: Total trading revenue for the quarter came in at $4.52 billion ($4.34 billion expected), up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Within trading, fixed-income revenue was $3.37 billion ($3.09 billion expected), up 31% year-over-year. That was driven by stronger performance across products, according to the firm. Equities were $1.15 billion ($1.29 billion expected), up 8% from the year-ago quarter thanks to stronger performance in derivatives. Investment-banking revenue came in at $1.49 billion ($1.59 billion expected), up 1% from the prior-year quarter thanks to higher debt-underwriting fees, the firm said. That was offset by lower advisory and equity-underwriting fees. Dimon also commented on the US political and economic environment: "The U.S. economy may be building momentum. Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities, and we are wellpositioned to play our part. Business plays a critical positive role in society, and in collaboration with nonprofits, governments and educational institutions, it can help strengthen our economy and our country." In the same quarter last year, JPMorgan beat expectations, reporting earnings per share of $1.32 on revenue of $23.74 billion. In the third quarter, the firm had a record-breaking quarter, reporting earnings per share of $1.58 on adjusted revenue of $24.67 billion. The corporate and investment bank had its best reported performance for a third quarter on record, as well as the highest fees on record for a third quarter, according to CFO Marianne Lake. Bank of America reported Q4 earnings earlier Friday. Wells Fargo also reports at about 8 a.m. ET on Friday, followed by Morgan Stanley on Tuesday.

Investors largely shrugged off figures that showed Chinese exports fell the most last year since 2009, and will look to earnings reports from U.S. banks JP Morgan Chase (>> JPMorgan Chase & Co.), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (>> Bank of America Corp) and Wells Fargo (>> Wells Fargo & Co) later in the day for direction. “The banking sector will be the major focus,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK. “With rising interest rates and hopes of more friendly regulation, the shares of these banks have a lot of upside in the coming days.” Bank stocks led the charge in European trading, rising 1 percent <.SX7P> to lift the FTSEuroFirst 300 <.FTEU3> 0.5 percent. The broader index was still down slightly on the week though, its first weekly fall in six. Shares in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (>> Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV) rose 6 percent, recouping some of the previous session’s 16 percent slump triggered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) accusations that the car maker illegally masked excess diesel emissions. Germany’s DAX <.GDAXI> was up 0.5 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 <.FTSE> rose 0.4 percent, on course for its 12th record high close and 14th consecutive daily gain. U.S. futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Wall Street <ESc1>. Thursday’s slip into the red marked yet another failed attempt to lift the Dow Jones through the magical 20,000 points barrier <.DJI>. Wall Street was chilled by president-elect Donald Trump’s failure to address economic policy plans at his first news conference since winning the Nov. 8 election, and growing fears that his proposed protectionist trade policies will choke global trade. Chinese trade data on Friday poured oil onto those flames. December exports fell by 6.1 percent from a year earlier, meaning the overall fall in exports last year was the biggest since the depths of the crisis in 2009. As the world’s largest trading nation, China could come under pressure from protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on his campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on the country’s imports. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> slipped 0.1 percent, after rising to its highest levels since late October in the previous session. It was up 1.8 percent for the week. Japan’s Nikkei stock index <.N225> finished up 0.8 percent, though it still ended the week down 0.9 percent.   BOND YIELD RETRACEMENT The symbiotic dance between the dollar and U.S. Treasury bond yields held firm on Friday. Both headed lower to end a week in which has seen the dollar fall almost 1 percent and yields extend their longest downturn since last summer. The 10-year yield <US10YT=RR> was flat at 2.36 percent, recovering from a six-week low hit on Thursday. But it’s down more than 5 basis points on the week and around 30 bps since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in mid-December. The dollar wallowed around five-week lows against a currency basket <.DXY> at 101.29, and down 0.9 percent for the week. The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.0635, well above last week’s 14-year low of $1.0340 <EUR=> and poised to gain 0.9 percent for the week, while the dollar was steady against the yen at 114.75 yen <JPY=>. The dollar index had scaled 14-year peaks this month, on speculation that Trump’s policies would spur growth and inflation, and prompt the Fed to raise interest rates at a faster pace than previously expected. But doubts have crept in. “Bond markets continue to retrace from the yield highs set in the middle of last month,” RBC Capital markets rates strategists wrote in a note to clients on Friday. “The latest move (is) seen as a typical ‘buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact’ reaction as Donald Trump’s pre-inauguration press conference proved to be a disappointment in terms of forthcoming growth boosting policies,” they said. The overnight rise in crude oil prices, bolstered by the weaker dollar as well as news that Saudi Arabia has cut oil output to its lowest in almost two years and plans further reductions, fizzled out in early European trading. Brent crude <LCOc1> was down 0.1 percent at $55.95 a barrel, while U.S. crude <CLc1> was also down 0.1 percent at $52.97. Spot gold <XAU=> held steady at $1,195.87 an ounce, as investors locked in gains on its overnight surge to seven-week highs above $1,200.

Slowing inflation and a recovery in trade are among the reasons why Indonesian stocks are a preferred investment for Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which oversees $420 billion. Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group, is buying Jakarta-listed firms that sell to Indonesia’s swelling middle class, as well as mining and plantation companies benefiting from a rally in commodities. For Mobius, this month’s research crackdown is just another reminder to do his own sums. Indonesia’s finance ministry ended commercial ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co. starting Jan. 1 after the firm downgraded the country’s equity market to underweight from overweight, and is introducing new rules that penalize primary government bond dealers if they don’t uphold the nation’s interest. “We have seen this kind of development in other countries and thus we always need to make our own decisions based on our own analysis of the facts,” Mobius said. Foreign investors have added about $300 million to aggregate investments in the nation’s stocks and bonds this year, suggesting Mobius and Aberdeen’s Bharat Joshi aren’t alone in their sanguine stance. The rupiah was the year’s best-performing Asian currency as of Jan. 11, while yield on government debt has drop 23 basis points and the Jakarta Composite Index is little changed. The Jakarta Composite Index rose as much as 0.3 percent in Jakarta on Friday, ending a four-day losing streak. The rupiah fell 0.1 percent, paring its gain this week to 0.5 percent. Cyclical sectors like banking, retail and cement -- the “dogs in the past two years” -- have valuations that are “most appealing” to Aberdeen, said Joshi, who oversees the firm’s investments in the Southeast Asian nation. The consumer discretionary sub-index in the MSCI Indonesia benchmark dropped to an average 17 times of projected earnings, compared with 20 times in August. Indonesian banks traded at an average 2.1 times of book value, compared with 2.9 times in the past decade. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

JPMorgan’s decision to downgrade Indonesian stocks by two notches was unusual and was the main flash point with Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, according to Norico Gaman, head of research at BNI Securities in Jakarta. For some investors, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump looms as the largest risk. His election win triggered dollar gains and emerging-market outflows. Similar to any emerging countries, Indonesia would undoubtedly “feel the brunt” of a possible rise in U.S. interest rates, Joshi said. “Trump is still a relative unknown and one would expect some volatility until his policies become clearer,” he said. Still, faster growth in the U.S. will lead to more investment money available for emerging markets, including Indonesia, according to Mobius. Federico Parenti, a Milan-based fund manager at Sempione Sim Spa, said he has been increasing his holdings on some Indonesian stocks in recent months and the disagreement between the government and JPMorgan has not caused any concerns for him. “This news did not change my positive point of view on Indonesia. Money can go in and go out very, very fast from almost any asset classes,” Parenti said. “The Indonesian government should treat such matters carefully so they don’t scare investors.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The agreement follows on the heels of two separate Justice Department settlements last year of financial crisis-era fraud with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup.  Of BoA’s total tab, about $10 billion will go to settle federal and state civil claims and $7 billion to consumer relief, including principal reduction on underwater loans, new loans to creditworthy but struggling borrowers, community assistance, and affordable rental housing. In addition, the bank will accept an independent monitor to oversee compliance with the agreement. BoA had engaged in a drawn-out battle with the Justice Department over the settlement, balking at taking a big hit for Countrywide Financial Corporation and Merrill Lynch’s pre-2008 activities prior to BoA’s acquisition of the two. For many weeks, BoA held its offer below Justice Department demands until a July 30 ruling from Manhattan U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff precipitated a breakthrough, according to press reports. Later the same day as Rakoff’s negative ruling against Countrywide in a separate mortgage-related fraud case, Attorney General Eric Holder called BoA CEO Brian Moynihan, threatening to file suit against BoA the next day if the bank did not raise its settlement offer, press reports noted. BoA relented and then entered into the final stretch of negotiations with the government. In its settlement, BoA acknowledges that it, Countrywide and Merrill Lynch sold residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) to investors without disclosing the deteriorating quality of the underlying loans in the securitized packages, leading eventually to huge investor losses. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) were among those misled by BoA’s failure to disclose accurate information.  “… the part [of the BoA settlement] that is consumer relief will not cost nearly as much as the headline number would suggest.” –Krista Schwarz Too Big to Jail For Holder, the record settlement could help quell some of the criticism lobbed at him for not going after big banks at the center of the 2008 credit crisis more aggressively. Last year, Holder said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that some banks are too big for prosecutors to pursue without considering the impact on the economic system — a phenomenon mocked as “too big to jail” by critics. To date, the Justice Department has pursued few civil or criminal cases against individuals responsible for mortgage-related fraud in the financial crisis.  For his part, BoA CEO Moynihan says settlement of the Justice Department case, which he has spent his four and a half years at the helm fighting, puts the bank’s crisis-era problems behind it. The U.S. Federal Reserve this year accepted the bank’s new capital plan, allowing it to pay dividends again, and Moynihan is ready to chart BoA’s future. As for Wall Street, “though this is a larger dollar value than the J.P. Morgan Chase deal, these settlements are generally well received by financial markets,” says Wharton finance professor Krista Schwarz. “Financial markets just want to get the uncertainty behind them.” Missing the Target Sponsored Content: At a record $16.65 billion, is the BoA settlement as fierce as it sounds? Wharton and University of Pennsylvania Law School experts say that in many ways, the settlement misses the mark. For one, says Schwarz, “the part that is consumer relief will not cost nearly as much as the headline number would suggest. For example, it includes principal write-downs on mortgages that Bank of America holds, but that is generally going to be writing off money that Bank of America could never have collected anyway.” What’s more, the settlement doesn’t directly compensate those hurt and punish those accountable, say experts.“In this settlement, the core is defrauding the investors in securitization transactions,” notes David Skeel, a University of Pennsylvania Law School corporate law professor. “I understand the desire to help homeowners, but litigation based on other wrongs seems to be a really indirect way to them. It’s very political and a bit arbitrary.” Kent Smetters, a Wharton professor of business economics and public policy, points out that those punished by the big-dollar settlement — BoA’s current shareholders — aren’t necessarily the ones who violated the law. “Probably my biggest concern is the conflict of interest faced by both parties negotiating. The government has the incentive to collect a lot of fine revenue, and bank executives have the incentive to write large checks, especially if there is an implicit understanding that the government won’t really pursue additional civil or criminal charges. But I am concerned that the bank’s shareholders are not being properly represented.” In addition, consumers who suffered from by BoA’s relaxed crisis-era practices on mortgage underwriting standards are likely out of luck, while a different set of consumers altogether could benefit. “The people who held subprime mortgages that they could not sustain and who lost their homes in connection to the pre-2008 mortgage market are lost from the picture” by now, says William Bratton, deputy dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School and co-director of the Institute for Law and Economics, a joint research center of the law school, Wharton and the University of Pennsylvania’s economics department. “The bum debt papers were generated by large institutions on a mechanized basis. The CEOs were far away from the operations. They made bad business decisions, but they are not criminal.” –William Bratton Still others who were hurt are also left without compensation, adds Catherine M. Schrand, a Wharton accounting professor. “To the extent that Bank of America’s activities contributed to the [overall economic] crisis, many more people were indirectly harmed, and the settlement cannot help them.”   To achieve more perfect payback, many, including prominent Justice Department critic U.S. District Court Judge Rakoff, say the agency should pursue individuals at banks responsible for dubious underwriting and disclosure practices. That may sound right in theory, but the cases are often difficult to bring, say University of Pennsylvania law experts. “These cases [against individuals] are the big missing piece of the aftermath of the financial crisis,” acknowledges Skeel. But “often, the most visible executives at the banks weren’t directly involved in any of the misbehavior. In the normal mortgage securitization process, it’s not obvious that someone like Jamie Dimon committed a crime.”  Bratton agrees: “The bum debt papers were generated by large institutions on a mechanized basis. The CEOs were far away from the operations. They made bad business decisions, but they are not criminal.” Turning Bad to Good  Still, is it possible that big-dollar settlements could provide some deterrent to future bad behavior? It’s unlikely, as it’s difficult to change human behavior, but possible in some ways, says Schrand. Her research shows that “many frauds occur because managers slide down a slippery slope.” Even though Bank of America managers likely realized that the mortgage pool risk was increasing, “they sold the pools anyway, thinking that the increased risk wasn’t that significant, so they were able to justify it in their minds,” she notes. “Then the risk grew but by then, BoA was in too deep. They [had to] continue not disclosing.” Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania law school professor and co-director of the Institute for Law and Economics, agrees: “Given the pervasiveness of practices, it’s hard to imagine that people at the time would have been swayed by the prospect of financial liability. There are hundreds of thousands of individual mortgage bankers and traders, and [other] people who had a huge role, that this settlement does not in any way directly come to terms with.” Yet, large settlements like BoA’s could encourage banks to increase monitoring of employee behavior, says Schrand. “While individuals may still have a natural tendency to behave badly, the firm has internal controls that can detect or prevent such behavior.”  Notes Bratton: “After passage of the Dodd Frank Act, it’s very important to take aggressive government enforcement action if any of this regulation is to be taken seriously. As the magnitude of settlements continues to increase and become more serious, there will be an effect, though no prevention.” Onward and Upward Whether through law enforcement or other means, a transformation in banking culture is sorely needed, say experts. “The impact of enforcement action in the mortgage arena [and in other financial areas] is a profound loss of confidence in the integrity of financial system,” says Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, a bank consulting firm in Washington, D.C. “The challenge is to establish cultures in financial services firms that protect the customer, but it’s very difficult to mandate good behavior. It’s going to take a long time to come up with a renewed balance built into the marrow of the financial system, which is controlled through the trading side of the business, which is focused on the short-term.” “We actually don’t want too much confidence in the banking sector. Rather, we want the right amount based on market fundamentals.” –Kent Smetters Smetters says that a lack of public confidence in the banks may help financial institutions find their way: “We actually don’t want too much confidence in the banking sector. Rather, we want the right amount based on market fundamentals. Twitter  The market believes that the government will bail out the bigger banks that are deemed to be Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI’s). Instead, the efficient solution is for the market to do its own due diligence, precisely because they don’t have the confidence that the government will bail out the SIFI’s.” Despite the shortcomings of the Bank of America settlement in mismatching compensation to victims and punishments to wrongdoers, the government action may still help incentivize better behavior in the banking sector. “The harm done by lending and securitization practices before the crisis was so broad that there is no practical way of precisely identifying who was harmed, by whom, and by how much,” says Schwarz. “So, maybe a settlement of this sort is the closest thing to justice that is feasible in the real world.” Twitter  Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "What the BoA Settlement Means for the Bank – and for Banking."

If it’s used to fund positions that the House and Senate did not fund, then it’s an inappropriate use of money. alice cranford Where is the relief money (settlement) for the homeowners from the settlement?

Traders are also digesting reports on weekly jobless claims and import and export prices. Nonetheless, traders may continue to look ahead to tomorrow's more closely watched reports on producer prices and retail sales. Financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also due to report their quarterly results before the start of trading on Friday. Stocks saw considerable volatility over the course of the trading session on Wednesday before managing the end the day modestly higher. The major averages moved to the upside going into the close, with the S&P 500 reaching a new high for the session. The Dow climbed 98.75 points or 0.5 percent to 19,954.28, the Nasdaq edged up 11.83 points or 0.2 percent to 5,563.65 and the S&P 500 rose 6.42 points or 0.3 percent to 2,275.32. The volatility seen on Wall Street was partly in reaction to President-elect Donald Trump's comments during his first press conference in several months. In his opening remarks, Trump called for new bidding procedures for the drug industry in order to lower prices, claiming the industry is "getting away with murder." The comments led to a sell-off by drug stocks, which initially contributed to a sharp pullback by the major averages. During the press conference, Trump also indicated he would hand over control of his companies to his sons Eric and Donald Jr. but not divest from his wide business holdings. Ahead of the press conference, the World Bank said Trump's proposed tax cuts and spending plans could boost U.S. and global growth but noted uncertainty about his trade policies adds to risks. The focus on the comments from Trump came amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front, with traders looking ahead to closely watched reports on producer prices and retail sales on Friday. Financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also scheduled to release their quarterly results later this week. Steel stocks showed a strong move to the upside as the day progressed, resulting in a 1.9 percent jump by the NYSE Arca Steel Index. Considerable strength was also visible among energy stocks, which rebounded along with the price of crude oil. While software and railroad stocks also saw notable strength, biotechnology stocks posted steep losses following the comments by Trump. The NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index plunged by 3.5 percent, pulling back off its best closing level in well over a month. Significant weakness also emerged among pharmaceutical stocks, as reflected by the 1.7 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are climbing $0.86 to $53.11 a barrel after surging up $1.43 to $52.25 a barrel on Wednesday. An ounce of gold is trading at $1,202, up $5.40 from the previous session's close of $1,196.60. On Wednesday, gold jumped $11.10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 114.50 yen compared to the 115.41 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0646 compared to yesterday's $1.0582. Asia Asian stocks gave up early gains to close mostly lower on Thursday, with investor sentiment dampened by a strengthening yen, oil price volatility and a lack of clarity from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his proposed fiscal spending plans. While energy shares gained ground following an overnight rebound in oil prices, healthcare stocks suffered heavy losses after Trump said he is going to negotiate drug pricing. Chinese stocks fell for a third day as investors moved to the sidelines ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays starting on January 27th. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 17.46 points or 0.56 percent to 3,119.29, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 106.33 points or 0.46 percent to 22,829.02. Japanese shares tumbled as a stronger yen weighed on exporters' shares and drug makers also came under heavy selling pressure following Trump's comments on drug pricing. The Nikkei 225 Index slumped 229.97 points or 1.19 percent to 19,134.70, while the broader Topix index closed 0.97 percent lower at 1,535.41. Automakers Mazda, Nissan and Toyota fell around 1 percent each as the yen strengthened versus the dollar for the fourth day. Takeda Pharmaceutical lost 2.6 percent and rival Astellas slumped 4.2 percent. Toshiba plunged 5.4 percent on a report that it is facing heavier losses at its U.S. nuclear unit. Australian shares closed marginally lower even as rising stocks outnumbered the decliners. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index erased early gains to end 4.60 points or 0.08 percent lower at 5,766.90 as losses in the healthcare and consumer staple sectors offset gains by mining and energy stocks. The broader All Ordinaries Index closed 2.10 points or 0.04 percent lower at 5,821.60. Bellamy's Australia shares slumped nearly 18 percent to extend Wednesday's decline after the infant formula maker cut its 2017 revenue forecast and replaced its chief executive. Europe The major European markets have turned mixed on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.1 percent and the German DAX Index is down by 0.6 percent. As risk appetite wanes, investors largely ignored positive data releases. While the German economy expanded at the fastest pace in five years in 2016, Eurozone industrial production grew much more than expected in November, separate reports showed today. Sodexo shares have fallen after the French food services and facilities management company reported a drop in first-quarter consolidated revenues, reflecting weakness in its energy and resources unit. Barratt Developments has also tumbled in London. The homebuilder reported that it completed 367 homes in London during the six months ended in December, down 56 percent from the same period last year. Associated British Food also came under pressure after reporting a drop in like-for-like sales over the Christmas trading period at discount fashion store Primark in Germany and the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Compagnie Financiere Richemont shares have soared after the Swiss luxury goods group posted 6 percent growth in third-quarter sales. German sugar producer Südzucker rallied after lifting its full-year operating result outlook. Shares of JD Sports Fashion have also jumped. The British sportswear firm expects full-year headline pre-tax profit to be ahead of market expectations by up to 15 percent. Department store Debenhams has also moved notably higher as it beat forecasts with a five percent rise in like-for-like sales during the seven-week Christmas period. U.S. Economic Reports The Labor Department released a report showing a modest rebound in initial jobless claims in the week ended January 7th. The report said initial jobless claims rose to 247,000, an increase of 10,000 from the previous week's revised level of 237,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to climb to 255,000. A separate Labor Department report showed a smaller than expected rebound in import prices in the month of December. The Labor Department said import prices climbed by 0.4 percent in December after edging down by a revised 0.2 percent in November. Economists had expected import prices to increase by 0.7 percent. The report also said export prices rose by 0.3 percent in December after slipping by 0.1 percent in November. Export prices had been expected to inch up by 0.2 percent. At 12:30 pm ET, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart is due to repeat a January 9th speech at the Naples Chamber of Commerce, with audience Q&A. The Treasury Department is also scheduled to announce the results of its auction of $12 billion worth of thirty-year bonds at 1 pm ET. Shortly afterward, St. Louis Fed President Bullard is due to present about the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy at the Forecasters Club of New York, with audience and media Q&A. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is also scheduled to host a town hall meeting with educators in Washington, D.C. and nationwide via webcast at 7 pm ET. Stocks in Focus Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings that came in line with analyst estimates on revenues that exceeded expectations. The airline also said it expects margins to expand beginning in the second half of the year. QVC (QVC) reported third quarter U.S. sales that fell 6 percent year-over-year, reflecting the first drop in sales by the home shopping channel in seven years. Homebuilder KB Home (KBH) reported fourth quarter earnings that declined year-over-year but came in slightly above analyst estimates. The company also reported better than expected revenues. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

"At Bank of America, as a federal regulated financial institution, we abide by federal law and do not bank marijuana-related businesses," the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank said in December 2015. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase have all made similar comments to the press in recent years. These blanket denials have helped the megabanks keep a low profile on a sensitive issue: the cannabis industry's touch-and-go relationship with the U.S. banking system. But the reality inside of big banks is murkier than their public statements suggest. Newly examined records show that numerous marijuana-related entities have had accounts at the four biggest U.S. banks in recent years. The records, which are publicly available from the state of Massachusetts, were analyzed for American Banker by MRB Monitor, a Chicago-based firm that helps financial institutions identify the risks associated with the marijuana industry. The analysis found that out of 84 applicants to operate medical marijuana dispensaries in Massachusetts, 29 reported having access to funds in at least one account at Bank of America, Citi, Wells or JPMorgan, or at one of their subsidiaries. Of the 29 applicants that had access to funds at one of the four big banks, 17 had a connection to B of A. The analysis covered applications filed between June 2015 and September 2016. For 19 of the 29 applicants, these bank accounts were in the names of individuals who were involved in efforts to open pot dispensaries, whose connection to the cannabis industry may not have been obvious to bankers. But in other instances, the accounts were in the names of well-known cannabis firms that were operating in other states. The findings raise questions about the extent to which the big banks are screening customers to determine whether they are part of the cannabis industry. The Obama administration has not made the enforcement of federal marijuana law a top priority, which has reduced pressure on banks. But that could change under the incoming Trump administration, whose attorney general nominee has expressed hostility to pot. The Massachusetts records also complicate two frequently told narratives about the U.S. pot industry. One is that marijuana businesses cannot get bank accounts, and are forced to operate as cash-only businesses. The other is that to the extent that marijuana businesses can get bank accounts, only small financial institutions will work with them. "A commonly held belief seems to be that small institutions are more likely than large institutions to have marijuana-related accounts, knowingly or otherwise," said Steven Kemmerling, the CEO of MRB Monitor. "The data seems to challenge those assumptions and raises the question of whether any financial institution is adequately prepared to identify and manage this particular risk." In 2015, a firm called Mass Organic Therapy applied to the state of Massachusetts to sell medical marijuana. One of the documents that the company submitted to the state asked prospective business owners to show that they had at least $500,000 available and in their control. Mass Organic Therapy listed funds in the name of a company called PalliaTech Inc., which had committed 62% of the initial capital for the venture. The filing includes a letter from a Citibank banker in Sea Cliff, N.Y. The letter was addressed to PalliaTech, and stated that PalliaTech had a Citi account with a balance of just over $1 million as of Oct. 14, 2015. The address listed on the PalliaTech account is right across the street from Citi's branch in Sea Cliff, a village in the town of Oyster Bay on Long Island. "Please let me know if you need any additional information and thank you as always for being a fantastic client," the Citi banker's letter stated. "We appreciate it!" At the time, Long Island-based PalliaTech had signed a lease to operate a medical pot dispensary in Brooklyn; had identified locations for dispensaries in Utica, Rochester and Newburgh, N.Y.; and had leased a production facility in Plattsburgh, N.Y. By late 2015, PalliaTech had also opened a lab in Colorado, had a license for a dispensary in Illinois, and was approved to open a dispensary in New Jersey through an affiliated company. PalliaTech did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Citi terminated the PalliaTech account after a review in early 2016, according to a source familiar with the matter. The New York-based bank said in a statement: "Citi abides by federal law and does not provide financial services to customers that engage in activities prohibited by federal law." A second applicant was a firm called Mission Massachusetts Inc., which recently received preliminary approval to open a medical pot dispensary in Worcester. The company's CEO and two of its directors were shareholders in 4Front Ventures, a cannabis firm in Phoenix. On a document submitted to the state, Mission Massachusetts listed funds in the name of 4Front Ventures. As of May 2015, 4Front Ventures had $1.8 million in a Bank of America business checking account, according to the document. By 2015, 4Front had been operating in the medical marijuana industry in Arizona, Illinois, Nevada and California, according to a document filed in Massachusetts. And the company does not appear to have tried to hide its involvement in the industry from the general public. "Defeat prohibition through sensible regulation," 4Front's website read in 2015. A spokesman for 4Front Ventures did not respond to requests for comment. A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment on specific customers, but did say: "We're a nationally chartered financial institution that complies with federal law." It is not clear whether bankers at either Citi or Bank of America knew that the accounts discussed in this article were connected to the marijuana industry. Given the scrutiny that cannabis firms generally face from financial institutions, they may have an incentive to obscure their business plans. "If they tell the truth, they will either have to pay high fees and endure enhanced due diligence or they'll likely lose an account," Kemmerling said. "But if they are opaque, they may be able to fly under the radar for a period of time, if not indefinitely." At the same time, banks have long-standing obligations to conduct customer due diligence. For customers that are classified as higher risk, banks are expected to take additional steps, such as asking about the purpose of the account both when it is opened and throughout the relationship. Spokesmen for Citi and Bank of America declined to comment on steps those banks take to ensure that marijuana businesses cannot open or maintain accounts. JPMorgan Chase uses a combination of risk-based methods to comply with regulations related to knowing its customers and combating money laundering, according to a spokeswoman, who declined to provide more specific information. Wells Fargo's policy is not to discuss internal practices and procedures that are confidential and proprietary, a spokeswoman said. The Federal Reserve Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. declined to comment on the record for this article. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which in 2014 issued guidance designed to encourage more banks to serve the pot industry, also declined to comment. Federal data last year showed that 301 U.S. financial institutions had relationships with marijuana-related businesses, up from 51 around the time the guidance was released. Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said that the agency expects the banks it regulates to follow applicable guidance, including the 2014 document from Fincen, which mentions red flags that banks can consider. One pot industry source said that he knows of certain marijuana businesses that are banking with large financial institutions, in some cases because they have a relationship with a branch manager who is allowing the account to remain open. "A lot of these larger national banks are actually doing it," said Lance Ott, a principal at Guardian Data Systems, a firm that helps marijuana dispensaries with their financial management. Most of the financial institutions that have publicly acknowledged their willingness to serve the cannabis industry are small banks and credit unions. Sundie Seefried is the CEO of one of those institutions, Partners Colorado Credit Union. She is also the author of a 2016 book titled Navigating Safe Harbor: Cannabis Banking in a Time of Uncertainty. Seefried said that her credit union has developed an extensive process for vetting potential clients in the pot business, which includes a three-phase interview process prior to due diligence work. She speculated that big banks may be taking on certain marijuana clients in an effort to better understand the industry. "It's probably a smart move on their part to learn the business, and learn from somebody who's a trusted customer." Massachusetts represents only a small fraction of the U.S. pot industry, but there is reason to believe that marijuana businesses elsewhere generally have access to the banking system. Rick Riccobono, the former director of banks at the Department of Financial Institutions in Washington state, said last year that the idea that pot businesses are forced to rely on physical cash is largely a myth. He noted that approximately 90% of the fees and taxes paid by the industry come into state coffers electronically. "People say it's a total cash business in Colorado and Washington," Riccobono told a reporter. "Quite the opposite. We've actually gotten this thing pretty far along." (Riccobono left the agency late last year). Still, the pot industry's access to the banking system often comes at a steep financial cost — industry sources said in 2015 that marijuana businesses were routinely paying as much as $3,000 a month for basic checking accounts — which may help to explain why industry officials continue to agitate for a change in federal law that would normalize the pot sector. Today there are fears that the incoming Trump administration will move in the opposite direction and crack down on violations of federal law. At a Senate hearing Tuesday, Sen. Jeff Sessions, the president-elect's nominee for attorney general, noted that Congress has made the possession and distribution of marijuana illegal in every state. "If that's something that's not desired any longer, Congress should pass a law," Sessions, R-Ala., said. "It's not so much the attorney general's job to decide what laws to enforce."

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook, which jumped 1.4 per cent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. Photo: Bloomberg With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 per cent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.4-per cent higher and JPMorgan added 0.5 per cent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 per cent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-per cent rise. Advertisement "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of US Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed US retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.5 per cent to a record-high close of 5574.12 points, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 per cent to 19,885.73 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to 2274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 per cent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 1 per cent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook, which jumped 1.4 per cent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions. Advertisement HuffPost Australia Health Minister Sussan Ley Resigns Over ...

U.S. stock indexes moved higher in early trading Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 as investors pored over earnings reports from several big lenders. Banks and other financial companies were up the most. Utilities were the biggest laggard. Energy stocks also fell as crude oil prices headed lower. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) Posted: Friday, January 13, 2017 12:16 pm | Updated: 12:34 pm, Fri Jan 13, 2017. US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Associated Press | 0 comments Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 5:24PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 5:26PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article U.S. banks benefit from postelection trading surge Robust gains in fixed income trading revenue at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. are an early sign that a surge in activity after the U.S. election was felt across bond markets. And those strong fourth-quarter results are buttressing expectations that Canadian banks also benefited from that trend. U.S. banks were expected to handle more trading orders during the three months that ended Dec. 31, as their clients adjusted their portfolios after Donald Trump’s surprise presidential election victory in November triggered a selloff of U.S. government bonds. Story Scotiabank energy banker launches oil and gas PE fund Over the past few years, energy company executives have been telling Adam Waterous that despite the negative headlines, there has never been a better time to be exploring for oil and gas. The global head of investment banking at Bank of Nova Scotia heard this advice so many times that he decided to act on it: Mr. Waterous plans to leave the bank next month to launch a Calgary-based $400-million private equity fund that will invest in up-and-coming North American oil and gas plays. Story A Trump-induced euphoria for banks? Not so fast Less than two weeks left of this tyranny. Then we’ll be free from the socialists, the overreaching regulators, the long arm of government. That’s the subtext to the euphoria on Wall Street and in the American banking sector since Donald Trump was elected president. The KBW Regional Bank Index, which tracks 50 U.S. banks, is up an astonishing 27 per cent since Nov. 8. With the inauguration approaching, investors are assuming a Republican-led Congress will free banks from the shackles imposed by U.S. President Barack Obama and other policy makers after the 2008 financial crisis. Story MEG boosts stock deal to $450-million MEG Energy Corp.’s chief executive officer says the company has turned a corner with a deal to refinance its hefty debt load and plans to restart growth in the oil sands using proceeds from an upsized share sale. The Calgary-based company issued $450-million in stock on Thursday, selling 58.1 million subscription receipts at $7.75 apiece. The syndicate is co-led by BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., Barclays PLC and RBC Dominion Securities Inc.

The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 5:24PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 5:26PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article U.S. banks benefit from postelection trading surge Robust gains in fixed income trading revenue at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. are an early sign that a surge in activity after the U.S. election was felt across bond markets. And those strong fourth-quarter results are buttressing expectations that Canadian banks also benefited from that trend. U.S. banks were expected to handle more trading orders during the three months that ended Dec. 31, as their clients adjusted their portfolios after Donald Trump’s surprise presidential election victory in November triggered a selloff of U.S. government bonds. Story Scotiabank energy banker launches oil and gas PE fund Over the past few years, energy company executives have been telling Adam Waterous that despite the negative headlines, there has never been a better time to be exploring for oil and gas. The global head of investment banking at Bank of Nova Scotia heard this advice so many times that he decided to act on it: Mr. Waterous plans to leave the bank next month to launch a Calgary-based $400-million private equity fund that will invest in up-and-coming North American oil and gas plays. Story A Trump-induced euphoria for banks? Not so fast Less than two weeks left of this tyranny. Then we’ll be free from the socialists, the overreaching regulators, the long arm of government. That’s the subtext to the euphoria on Wall Street and in the American banking sector since Donald Trump was elected president. The KBW Regional Bank Index, which tracks 50 U.S. banks, is up an astonishing 27 per cent since Nov. 8. With the inauguration approaching, investors are assuming a Republican-led Congress will free banks from the shackles imposed by U.S. President Barack Obama and other policy makers after the 2008 financial crisis. Story MEG boosts stock deal to $450-million MEG Energy Corp.’s chief executive officer says the company has turned a corner with a deal to refinance its hefty debt load and plans to restart growth in the oil sands using proceeds from an upsized share sale. The Calgary-based company issued $450-million in stock on Thursday, selling 58.1 million subscription receipts at $7.75 apiece. The syndicate is co-led by BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., Barclays PLC and RBC Dominion Securities Inc.

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business Profits at big banks surged last year as ‘Trump rally’ boosts bottom line FRIDAY, JAN. 13, 2017, 2 P.M. By Renae Merle The Washington Post Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS NEW YORK – Profits at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America surged last year, the banks said Friday as the industry receives a boost from a stock market rally that accelerated after the presidential election. The industry is entering what analysts say could be a period of renewed growth as rising interest rates make it easier for banks to earn a profit and President-elect Donald Trump has said he would roll back regulations put in place after the financial crisis that have hampered industry profits. Increased trading levels across U.S. markets, which are near record levels, has also boosted the industry. JPMorgan and Bank of America, two of the largest banks in the world, both beat analysts profit expectations and gave positive forecasts for the future. “The optimism for positive change here at Bank of America and among our customers is palpable,” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said on a conference call with analysts. The new administration has raised the prospect of corporate tax reform and regulatory changes, Moynihan said. “We’ll have to see how these topics play out but that we are optimistic,” he said. The North Carolina bank reported its largest yearly profit, nearly $18 billion, or $1.50 a share, since the financial crisis. During the fourth quarter, net income jumped 43 percent to $4.7 billion, or 40 cents a share, compared to the same period in 2015 as Bank of America continued to cut costs. Revenue increased about 2 percent during the quarter to $20 billion. At JPMorgan, CEO, Jamie Dimon, also expressed optimism. “The U.S. economy may be building momentum,” he said in a statement. “Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth.” In a conference call, Dimon said he is “comforted” that Trump has picked “professionals” for his administration, including Treasury Department nominee Steven Mnuchin. “Give him some time,” said Dimon, who is serving on Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. JPMorgan’s profits jumped 24 percent during the fourth quarter to $6.73 billion, or $1.71 a share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 a share, during the same period a year ago. For the entire year, profits were up about 1 percent to $24.7 ($6.18 a share) billion while revenue reached more than $95 billion. “Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year,” Dimon said in a statement. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo lagged its competitors as it continues to recover from a sales scandal that put it in the crosshairs of lawmakers and sparked several federal investigations. Last September, the bank admitted that thousands of low-level employees had set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas. In some cases, the customers were charged various fees for accounts they did not know existed. The bank has apologized repeatedly and refunded more than $3 million to customers for fees they were charged on accounts they didn’t ask for. Earlier this week, the company announced a new pay plan which replaces the sales goals. But the scandal appears to still be weighing on its bottom line. Wells Fargo opened 40 percent fewer checking accounts and 43 percent fewer credit cards in December compared with the same period in 2015. It reported a 4 percent dip in profits last year, $21.9 billion, or $3.99 a share, compared with $22.9 billion, or $4.12 a share, in 2015. Revenue increased about 3 percent to $88.3 billion. During the fourth quarter, net income dipped to $5.3 billion, or 96 cents a share, at the San Francisco bank compared with $5.6 billion ($1.03) during the same period in 2015. Revenue was flat during the quarter at about $21 billion. “We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders,” CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. “While we have more work to do, I am proud of the effort of our entire team to make things right for our customers and team members and to continue building a better Wells Fargo for the future.” Published: Jan. 13, 2017, 2 p.m.  Tags: banking, banking regulations, Bank of America, bank profits, banks, Donald Trump, financial crisis, interest rates, JPMorgan Chase, stock market rally Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Posted 13 Jan 2017 20:35 Updated 14 Jan 2017 08:55 Traders work on the floor at the close of trading at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., December 28, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: An increase in Facebook pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 also rose after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook , which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

(JPM) reported record earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16) driven by: core loan growth of 12%, record card sales volume growth of 14%, record fourth quarter markets activity, reserve releases in consumer and wholesale portfolios, and continued expense controls, according to Fitch Ratings. Returns on equity and tangible equity were 11% and 14% in the quarter, respectively, which is above average for the peer group. Full-year results for 2016 were also at record levels, with reported earnings up about 1.2% year-over-year. Adjusted expenses were in-line with management guidance, at about $56.1 billion, which was relatively flat with the prior year as strategic cost savings programs largely offset investments in controls. Net charge-offs for the year met Fitch's expectations, at $4.7 billion. Charge-offs were up about 14.8% from 2015, driven by loan growth, portfolio seasoning, and about $270 million of losses from oil & gas and metals & mining portfolios. JPM recorded a $400 million net reserve release in 4Q16, consisting of a $250 million release in consumer portfolios, largely mortgage, and a $150 million release related to oil & gas and metals and mining portfolios in the wholesale book. Fourth quarter net revenues in the corporate and investment bank (CIB) were up 19.7% year-over-year, driven by a record fourth quarter in the markets business. Overall markets revenue was up 24.2% annually, with nearly 31% growth in fixed-income products, driven by spread products and more active hedging in commodities products. Equities were up 8%, led by stronger derivatives activity. Investment banking fees were up about 5% as declines in advisory and equity underwriting was more than offset by stronger debt underwriting, given a relatively weak 4Q15. JPM maintained its leading market share in a variety of product categories for the year and was the only top five bank to gain share in investment banking in 2016, according to the company. Segment earnings nearly doubled given reserve releases in energy-portfolios, reduced compensation expenses, tight operating costs controls, and a $475 million tax benefit related to the use of deferred tax assets. The compensation expense ratio was 20% in the quarter and 27% for the full-year, which was an improvement over 2015. Revenue and earnings in the Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment were down modestly year over year, as strong loan and deposit growth, record card sales volume, declines in credit costs, and continued expense discipline were offset by higher account origination costs in card and the absence of a gain on the IPO of Square, recognized in 4Q15. Segment credit quality remained strong and drove $425 million of reserve releases in the mortgage book and $25 million of releases in the student loan portfolio, which were only partially offset by a build in card and business banking. The commercial banking segment reported record revenue, supported by continued loan growth and higher investment banking revenue. Average loan balances were up 13.9% year over year, led by growth in commercial & industrial loans and commercial real estate (CRE). Growth in these portfolios is outpacing the peer group, but segment credit quality remained relatively benign, with net charge-offs of 11 basis points in the quarter. Management indicated that about 75% of the CRE portfolio was multifamily lending, in strong properties and underserved markets, while the remaining 25% was to real estate developers the firm knows well. The CRE book has had no net losses. Segment investment banking revenue was a record for the year, at $2.3 billion, which was up 4.9% from 2015. Asset management remained a solid contributor to overall results, with revenues up and expenses down modestly. Flows into long-term products were negative in the quarter, but positive for the year. Assets under management were up 2.8% annually, with higher markets and overall net inflows. From a liquidity perspective, JPM's high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) remained strong, at $524 billion. Loans-to-deposits were down modestly from a year ago, to 65.1%, despite strong loan growth, and remains below the peer average. JPM's Basel III Tier 1 Common equity (CET1) ratio was up 30 basis points in the quarter, to 12.2%, given strong earnings and a decline in risk-weighted assets. The bank's capital ratio was 12.3% under the fully phased-in standardized approach and JPM believes the standardized ratio will eventually be the binding constraint. The supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) was 6.5% and 6.6% at the firm and bank level, respectively. JPM paid a dividend of $0.48 per share in the quarter, equating to a payout of about 28%. The bank repurchased $2.25 billion of equity in the quarter, leaving approximately $6.1 billion of repurchase authority for the next two quarters, based on the results of last year's CCAR process. Including share repurchases, the total payout in the quarter was about 65%.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 4:14PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 4:17PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index ended higher on Friday, to finish a tumultuous week almost unchanged, as higher bond yields and solid U.S. bank earnings helped boost the index’s heavyweight financials sector. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index unofficially closed up 79.12 points, or 0.51 per cent, at 15,497.28. Eight of its main sectors rose. Some of the most influential movers on the index were banks, with Royal Bank of Canada climbing 0.8 per cent and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce up 0.3 per cent. Gains for Canadian bank stocks came as some major U.S. banks reported quarterly profits that beat expectations and bond yields rose after data showed U.S. retail sales rose solidly in December. Higher bond yields increase net interest margins of banks and reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities. Manulife Financial Corprose rose 0.4 per cent to $24.81, while the overall financials group gained 0.5 per cent. The S&P 500 rose on Friday after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results, making investors more confident about heady valuations after a recent market rally, while the Nasdaq closed at a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.34 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 19,885.66, the S&P 500 gained 4.2 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 2,274.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.63 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 5,574.12. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump’s unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at valuations well above historic averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts’ expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Mr. Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 per cent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo was 1.5 per cent higher and JPMorgan added 0.5 per cent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 per cent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500’s 6.1-per-cent rise. “Earnings are key going forward, and we’re off to a decent start,” said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow declined, with McDonald’s and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’ve come a long way very quickly so there’s scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Oil prices fell on Friday and ended the week 3 per cent lower on lingering doubts over the extent of OPEC cuts, with sentiment worsened by concerns over the economic health of the world’s second-largest oil consumer, China, after it reported the steepest falls in overall exports since 2009. Record Chinese crude imports of 8.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in December helped to buoy prices somewhat, traders said, but they could not hide underlying fears over the overall health of the world’s second-biggest economy. Brent crude futures settled 56 cents lower at $55.45 a barrel, ending the week with a loss of about 3 per cent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell by 64 cents to close at $52.37 also notching a weekly drop of nearly 3 per cent. “China right now seems more interested in keeping capital in the country than focusing on growth overall,” Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago said. “We have to watch this situation develop because this is one threat to what is an otherwise wildly bullish scenario for oil in the coming year.” On the supply side, there was some market support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said that its output had fallen below 10 million bpd to levels last seen in February 2015 and that it expects to make even deeper cuts next month. However, hard evidence of export reductions has yet to emerge, two weeks into the month in which the cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, such as Russia, were supposed to start. “Compliance won’t be 100 percent; it never is,” an OPEC source told Reuters, adding that an overall rate of 50 percent to 60 percent would be good enough, based on past compliance levels. Although, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo told Reuters he was sure countries would follow through on the deal. Libya’s oil production increased to 750,000 barrels per day (bpd), the deputy leader of the U.N.-backed government said, a rise of about 50,000 bpd from last week. “I think the bigger issues for oil are less about demand right now and a lot more about the supply condition,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. “EIA data and our own government policies have to leave you thinking that a U.S. production response may unwind all the production cuts Saudi Arabia and others are planning.” Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed crude production rose notably last week, particularly in the lower 48 states. Overall production was 8.95 million bpd last week, the most since April of last year. Saudi Arabia is likely to cut heavy oil production rather than light in order to maximize revenues, and as U.S. supply comes back, more light barrels will likely enter the market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36-percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12 points, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook, which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP) 3 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company's income taxes had to be paid. "Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it's not really your money till you pay your taxes," says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. "At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped." Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous' cash reserves. "Cash is king" is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn't coming in, and owners can't get loans or investors, there's no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they'd have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It's especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. "They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy," Solomon says. USA TODAY Abrams: 7 steps to small-business success in 2017 Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50% drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. "The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks," JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he's willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company's more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company's busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20% of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. USA TODAY Abrams: Entrepreneurs! On your marks, get set ... shred When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company's cash position. "If everything went south, we'd probably have enough cash for two or three months," he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They've given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They've also gotten better terms from lenders.

That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid.  (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP) Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that's a sign of trouble to Basilo — they're not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. "That's how they think when they start their business. They're very unprepared," he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores' down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor's ability to negotiate better prices.

(LUCAS JACKSON/REUTERS) The close: Financials lead TSX’s broad gains to end choppy week Add to ... Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 4:14PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 4:17PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index ended higher on Friday, to finish a tumultuous week almost unchanged, as higher bond yields and solid U.S. bank earnings helped boost the index’s heavyweight financials sector. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index unofficially closed up 79.12 points, or 0.51 per cent, at 15,497.28. Eight of its main sectors rose. Some of the most influential movers on the index were banks, with Royal Bank of Canada climbing 0.8 per cent and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce up 0.3 per cent. Gains for Canadian bank stocks came as some major U.S. banks reported quarterly profits that beat expectations and bond yields rose after data showed U.S. retail sales rose solidly in December. Higher bond yields increase net interest margins of banks and reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities. Manulife Financial Corprose rose 0.4 per cent to $24.81, while the overall financials group gained 0.5 per cent. The S&P 500 rose on Friday after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results, making investors more confident about heady valuations after a recent market rally, while the Nasdaq closed at a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.34 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 19,885.66, the S&P 500 gained 4.2 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 2,274.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.63 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 5,574.12. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump’s unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at valuations well above historic averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts’ expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Mr. Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 per cent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo was 1.5 per cent higher and JPMorgan added 0.5 per cent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 per cent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500’s 6.1-per-cent rise. “Earnings are key going forward, and we’re off to a decent start,” said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow declined, with McDonald’s and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’ve come a long way very quickly so there’s scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Oil prices fell on Friday and ended the week 3 per cent lower on lingering doubts over the extent of OPEC cuts, with sentiment worsened by concerns over the economic health of the world’s second-largest oil consumer, China, after it reported the steepest falls in overall exports since 2009. Record Chinese crude imports of 8.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in December helped to buoy prices somewhat, traders said, but they could not hide underlying fears over the overall health of the world’s second-biggest economy. Brent crude futures settled 56 cents lower at $55.45 a barrel, ending the week with a loss of about 3 per cent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell by 64 cents to close at $52.37 also notching a weekly drop of nearly 3 per cent. “China right now seems more interested in keeping capital in the country than focusing on growth overall,” Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago said. “We have to watch this situation develop because this is one threat to what is an otherwise wildly bullish scenario for oil in the coming year.” On the supply side, there was some market support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said that its output had fallen below 10 million bpd to levels last seen in February 2015 and that it expects to make even deeper cuts next month. However, hard evidence of export reductions has yet to emerge, two weeks into the month in which the cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, such as Russia, were supposed to start. “Compliance won’t be 100 percent; it never is,” an OPEC source told Reuters, adding that an overall rate of 50 percent to 60 percent would be good enough, based on past compliance levels. Although, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo told Reuters he was sure countries would follow through on the deal. Libya’s oil production increased to 750,000 barrels per day (bpd), the deputy leader of the U.N.-backed government said, a rise of about 50,000 bpd from last week. “I think the bigger issues for oil are less about demand right now and a lot more about the supply condition,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. “EIA data and our own government policies have to leave you thinking that a U.S. production response may unwind all the production cuts Saudi Arabia and others are planning.” Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed crude production rose notably last week, particularly in the lower 48 states. Overall production was 8.95 million bpd last week, the most since April of last year. Saudi Arabia is likely to cut heavy oil production rather than light in order to maximize revenues, and as U.S. supply comes back, more light barrels will likely enter the market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note. U.S. oil drillers cut rigs this week for only the second week in the last seven months, seen by traders as a pause in a recovery expected to last into 2018.

Rosenberg, The Associated Press 4:04 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2017 Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis poses for photos in his home, in Los Angeles. When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP) 3 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company's income taxes had to be paid. "Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it's not really your money till you pay your taxes," says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. "At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped." Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous' cash reserves. "Cash is king" is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn't coming in, and owners can't get loans or investors, there's no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they'd have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It's especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. "They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy," Solomon says. USA TODAY Abrams: 7 steps to small-business success in 2017 Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50% drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. "The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks," JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he's willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company's more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company's busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20% of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. USA TODAY Abrams: Entrepreneurs! On your marks, get set ... shred When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company's cash position. "If everything went south, we'd probably have enough cash for two or three months," he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They've given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They've also gotten better terms from lenders. Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis poses for photos in his home, in Los Angeles. When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid.  (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP) Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that's a sign of trouble to Basilo — they're not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. "That's how they think when they start their business. They're very unprepared," he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores' down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor's ability to negotiate better prices. USA TODAY 6 key resolutions for your small business While they do have savings, they don't want to tap them for cash flow. "We pretend that the savings doesn't exist," Dan Robinson says.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at valuations well above historic averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America <BAC.N>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo was 1.04-percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.43 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow declined, with McDonald's <MCD.N> and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. At 2:42 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was down 0.14 percent at 19,863.26 points, while the S&P 500 <.SPX> had gained 0.10 percent to 2,272.67. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.39 percent to 5,569.18. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq was from Facebook <FB.O>, which jumped 1.6 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 113 new highs and 10 new lows.

DiStefano, Staff Writer Twitter icon @PhillyJoeD Close icon Mail icon Email Twitter icon @PhillyJoeD     Joseph N. DiStefano Staff Writer Joseph N. DiStefano writes about Philadelphia-area enterprise, and the people and money that make it go.  More by Joseph N. DiStefano Trump and the economy: How fast is enough? Jan 11 Fed chief advises youth to follow the Ben Franklin model Jan 13 Card deals: Amazon wants buyers to borrow Jan 13 More from Joseph N. DiStefano Arrow icon Amazon's giveaway deal with JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s giant credit card operation -- which is largely based in Delaware -- sounds so generous, you wonder how the partners are making any money. "We’ve expanded benefits on the existing Amazon Rewards Card, and launched a new Amazon Prime Rewards Card that provides 5% back on Amazon.com purchases" for Amazon Prime members, who will be "automatically upgraded," Chase spokeswoman Maria Martinez told me.  Chase has also cut foreign exchange fees, encouraging foreign buyers. Amazon invited banks to bid for the new program in mid-November, an industry source told me. Chase already offered an Amazon card and was able to launch the new program fast. Amazon's reported profits from credit cards are still small, but growing quickly. In its most recent quarterly report, Amazon said it earned $372 million in North American profits from "other income," including credit cards and certain unnamed advertising services, during the fall quarter, up from $249 million a year earlier. That 53% one-year increase is double Amazon's overall sales growth rate (27%).  If Amazon keeps up that pace, it's possible credit card income will in the next few years begin contributing significantly to its profits, which totalled $1 billion a month in 2016 for the first time. How long will Amazon grow rich from consumers' borrowed money? Old-fashioned retailers have a long, and not always happy, history with credit cards. Sears, Montgomery Ward, JCPenney, Federated/Macy's, and most recently Cabela's boosted sales for years by adding both branded cards through their own banks and "cobranded" deals with partners like Chase.   Those arrangements, particularly the store-owned cards, followed a familar cycle: First, shoppers flocked to open card accounts, drawn by bonuses like Amazon's discounts. The new cardholders spent more, boosting sales reports. They ran up card debts, juicing company profits as consumers posted monthly interest payments. And then, as the loans "matured" over a few years, the issuers booked rising losses, sometimes leading to the sale of the portfolio and a writedown or fall in profits. Cabela's sold its card bank to Capital One Inc. as the chain faced bankruptcy reorganization and was sold to Bass Pro Shops last year. Has Amazon and its partners learned from others' credit adventures? "From Amazon's point of view, they can't lose," insists Bill Keenan, chairman and CEO of Wilmington-based credit card advertising agency and consulting group DeNovo Corp.  Amazon issues cards through two different bank partners -- GE's former Synchrony unit, and Chase. "They don't own the infrastructure, they don't own the assets, they aren't burdened by the bank regulators," Keenan said. How can Chase and Amazon share profits after a 5 percent upfront discount? "Chase is looking for low cost of account acquisition, which can significantly compensate" for finance costs, Keenan told me. "The Amazon card is a reminder in your pocket." Like a portable ad, offering an instant discount. "You can bet Chase is funding a good portion of that incentive," Keenan added. Martinez said Chase won't comment on how large Amazon's program has grown. Keenan says Chase and Amazon have plenty of customer spending and targeting data to help maximize sales -- especially to customers who can be counted on to run up a tab and make lucrative double-digit interest payments every month -- while minimizing losses to fraud and people unable to pay. "The big challenge is the customer who doesn't revolve (borrow)," consumers who can afford to pay off what they owe every month, and are disciplined enough to do so, Keenan added. Amazon has shown before it's willing to wait, deferring profits if it can boost market share in the meantime.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at valuations well above historic averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo was 1.04-percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.43 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow declined, with McDonald's and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. At 2:42 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.14 percent at 19,863.26 points, while the S&P 500 had gained 0.10 percent to 2,272.67. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.39 percent to 5,569.18. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq was from Facebook, which jumped 1.6 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at valuations well above historic averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo was 1.04-percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.43 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow declined, with McDonald's and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. At 2:42 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.14 percent at 19,863.26 points, while the S&P 500 had gained 0.10 percent to 2,272.67. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.39 percent to 5,569.18. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq was from Facebook, which jumped 1.6 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management.

He's not the only one who should feel that way. The nagging question on the tip of every investor's tongue is whether or not the Trump stock market rally had gone too far, too fast. The market has been flat since mid- December. But after seeing the earnings reports from our nation's biggest banks on Friday, the answer is no. And the feeling of relief to those who follow financial markets closely is difficult to overstate. "Ask any market veteran if they think it is a positive when banks lead rallies, they'll say yes, in unison." Why? Bank stocks have led the rally since last November's presidential election, going from unloved by investors to becoming anchor positions in many a portfolio. After years of suffering the indignity of massive fines, increased regulatory oversight and receiving the blame for the Great Recession, bank stocks have replaced consumer staples and utilities as the must-own stocks. Ask any market veteran if they think it is a positive when banks lead rallies, they'll say yes, in unison. Simply put, when banks lead a stock market rally, it is an indicator that loan demand is rising, that business is percolating and that the economy is on firmer footing. It's also the go-to investment choice if one believes interest rates are heading higher. Banks make more money on their net interest margin, meaning they make more money on their massive customer deposits. show chapters Wall Street reacts to busy day of bank earnings    Friday, 13 Jan 2017 | 9:00 AM ET | 04:03 But today was the moment of truth for the Trump rally because JPMorgan, Bank of America and scandal-plagued Wells Fargo reported quarterly earnings for the first time since the election. Investors were worried these banks wouldn't be able to live up to their elevated expectations. JPMorgan takes the title as the best beat on both earnings and revenues and otherwise, a squeaky clean quarter from the nation's biggest bank. Bank of America beat the bottom line, with a small miss on the top line and an optimistic forecast going forward. Wells Fargo had a tough quarter, but based on how the stock is performing today, investors are obviously pleased that it didn't do worse in spite of its recent scandal. JPMorgan and Bank of America touched new 52-week highs on Friday. Additionally, the quarterly reports from the aforementioned banks corroborate other glowing news on the economy. Consumer sentiment, holiday sales, wage growth and automobile sales have been either elevated or improving as of late. Yet interest rates and inflation remain historically low. This is about as Goldilocks for investors as it gets. No one could, or should, rule out future stock market volatility, which has always been a normal occurrence. But if you view banks as the economy's canary in the coalmine, as I do, then you've got some pretty darn healthy canaries. Stop doubting the rally. It's the real deal. — By Mitch Goldberg, president of ClientFirst Strategy Read more from Mitch Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change JPM --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

REUTERS/Larry Downing/File Photo    5421439 CEO of JP Morgan Chase Jamie Dimon said Friday that he thinks President-elect Donald Trump will do the right thing for the United States. After discussing the bank’s fourth quarter earnings, Dimon told reporters that he is comforted by the fact that Trump is appointing experienced people to his cabinet. Dimon joined Trump’s economic advisory team in December, 2016. “I am a patriot — I want to help my country and help it grow,” Dimon said after Trump made the announcement. The move by Trump to bring on Dimon raised more than a few eyebrows, given his statements about Dimon in 2013. “I’m not Jamie Dimon, who pays $13 billion to settle a case and then pays $11 billion to settle a case and who I think is the worst banker in the United States,” Trump told reporters. Stocks in the banking and financial sectors have skyrocketed in recent weeks, as banks and investors believe the president-elect will usher in a new era of deregulation and lower taxes. Banks earning reports gave a significant boost to the S&P 500 and NASDAQ indexes Friday. (RELATED: A Comprehensive Look At Donald Trump’s Tax Plan) After defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump tapped former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin has since made public statements expressing his distaste for the 2,300 page Dodd-Frank Act, a view that has many investors elated. The former Goldman banker also wants to privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two of the largest names in the U.S. mortgage market. (RELATED: Mnuchin Wants To Privatize Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac) JP Morgan’s quarterly earnings report was well past what analysts expected, showing quarterly revenue of over $24 billion. “Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year, reflecting our intense client focus and solid performance across our businesses,” Dimon said in a Friday press release.

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith By David Henry and Dan Freed | NEW YORK NEW YORK Executives of big U.S. banks expressed optimism on Friday about the outlook for 2017 in their first public comments about quarterly earnings since the U.S. presidential election in November. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the two largest U.S. banks, kicked off the corporate reporting season on a rosy note, each with healthy increases in fourth-quarter profit. Those improvements came on the back of trading revenue gains, higher interest rates, healthy loan growth and cost controls. On the flip side, the earnings of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which also reported on Friday, were hurt by the fallout of a sales scandal and a loss related to accounting, both of which are particular to the San Francisco-based lender. Results at regional lender PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) were better than expected, with Chief Financial Officer Rob Reilly predicting the bank will be able to increase revenue faster than expenses this year. Shares of all four banks climbed Friday afternoon, with JPMorgan up 0.5 percent at $86.64, Bank of America up 0.4 percent at $23.01, Wells Fargo up 1.1 percent at $55.15 and PNC up 0.4 percent at $118.39. On conference calls with reporters and analysts, top executives were sanguine about topics ranging from interest rates and loan growth, to regulation and the incoming administration of President-Elect Donald Trump. OPTIMISTIC "We are very optimistic about the future, optimistic about new policies which could spur growth," Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said. The bank's finance chief, Paul Donofrio, predicted BofA will be able to produce an additional $600 million in the current quarter from higher interest rates, with further gains throughout the year. He also cited customers' "high credit quality" and positive trends in auto, home and middle-market loans, as being supportive of earnings. In the fourth quarter, BofA benefited from an aggressive cost-cutting programme Moynihan detailed last summer, as well as a pickup in trading revenue. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon was slightly more circumspect, but said he was comforted by the fact that Trump was selecting people with experience to join his team. Dimon also cited several positive economic trends that suggest the global economy is headed in the right direction, which will help buoy bank earnings. "The economy is getting a little bit better," he said. "Interest rates help and looking forward, you probably have a better political, legal and regulatory environment." The bank is sticking by its loan growth forecast of 10 to 15 percent for 2017, though Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said it might be towards the lower end of the range. 'SOLID PERFORMANCE' Despite Wells Fargo's unique troubles, its chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry, also said the bank had a "solid underlying performance," citing loan growth, good credit quality and higher interest rates. The idea that banks will benefit from lighter regulation, rising interest rates and lower taxes under Trump has driven bank stocks up nearly 25 percent since the election. Nearly all the executives commented on the enthusiasm evident in markets, but were hesitant to fully endorse it. For instance, Dimon noted that it may take a full year for the new government in Washington to decide exactly how it will tackle complex issues like corporate tax reform. And, he said, increased competition means lenders may just "compete away" any tax benefits they receive. "We've all heard that the new administration in Washington supports tax reform, regulatory relief and other pro-growth policies," said PNC Chief Executive Bill Demchak. "But, so far, a move in interest rates is the only thing that has actually happened." Other big banks, including Citigroup Inc (C.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), will report results next week.

Morgan results hint at bank renaissance in Trump era By Mark DeCambre Published: Jan 13, 2017 1:45 p.m. ET Share Dimon sees an end to lackluster fixed-income trading, a key business for Wall Street banks CNBC By MarkDeCambre J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon struck an upbeat tone on Friday in the wake of the bank’s quarterly earnings, raising expectations that the era under the coming Donald Trump administration could be a resurgent one for the financial sector. Read also: Stock market buoyed by better-than-expected bank earnings The bank’s business tied to helping its clients buy and sell stocks, bonds and other securities, saw a 24% rise in revenue to $4.5 billion from $3.6 billion a year ago, with fixed-income specifically enjoying a more than 30% pop in revenue compared with the same period a year earlier. Those results helped the U.S.’s biggest bank by assets ring up a record annual profit of $24.73 billion, beating the previous record of $24.44 billion set in 2015. See also: Bank ETFs still favored as investors see growth and Trump bump ahead Earnings were bolstered by a jump in trading, following Trump’s surprise election victory on Nov. 8, and reinforced Wall Street’s expectation that the president-elect’s proposals of looser regulations, lower taxes and a ramp-up in fiscal spending would usher in a new age of stratospheric growth for banks. The sector has seen stocks, if not profits, languish since the 2008-09 crisis rocked global markets and led to a raft of stringent policy measures to rein in bad actors across the world. But Friday’s results appeared to signal that shift may be at hand in some of the most profitable areas. “The fixed-income market is going to go up, and needs for [currencies] is going up, and the needs for hedging is going up” Dimon said, during a Friday conference call with investors. CEOs Share Their Top Advice for Women(1:30) Mary T. Barra and Jamie Dimon share some parting words of advice for working women, at The Wall Street Journal’s Women in the Workplace event. The J.P. Morgan JPM, +0.53%  chief also said he believed a secular, or long-term, decline in the fixed-income business, may be coming to an end with volatility—a boon to Wall Street trading—on the rise. Some market observers have argued that a slowdown in trade has hampered some of Wall Street’s most prominent banks, including Goldman Sachs Group GS, +0.19% and Morgan Stanley MS, +0.41% Bank stocks have soared since the November election, spurred by the hopes outlined above, ending a period of weakness caused by a combination of worries about bank loans to embattled energy companies and ultralow interest rates. A popular ETF tracking the banking sector, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF, +0.56% is up nearly 18% since the election, while J.P. Morgan shares, which touched a fresh record high Friday, have risen by about 24%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  has climbed about 10% in the last three months. The following chart shows some of J.P. Morgan’s moves since the financial crisis, including its 2009 low and its Feb. 11, 2016 nadir: J.P. Morgan’s shares are rebounding. But will it last? Also helping to lift bank shares is an expectation that Trump will roll back hard-hitting banking Dodd-Frank bank reform rules, that critics say have made it harder and more expensive for banks to operate. Overall, Dimon, who will be a member of Trump’s CEO brain trust, sounded bullish on the U.S. and global economy. “If you take a walk around the world, Japan’s doing a little bit better, Europe’s doing a little bit better,” he said on the analyst call. He said he was happy with the trend for the U.S. economy and optimistic that tax cuts could be good for the economy and markets. Dimon also said he was not fearful that Trump’s trade policies would be protectionist.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Executives of big U.S. banks expressed optimism on Friday about the outlook for 2017 in their first public comments about quarterly earnings since the U.S. presidential election in November. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, the two largest U.S. banks, kicked off the corporate reporting season on a rosy note, each with healthy increases in fourth-quarter profit. Those improvements came on the back of trading revenue gains, higher interest rates, healthy loan growth and cost controls. On the flip side, the earnings of Wells Fargo & Co, which also reported on Friday, were hurt by the fallout of a sales scandal and a loss related to accounting, both of which are particular to the San Francisco-based lender. Results at regional lender PNC Financial Services Group Inc were better than expected, with Chief Financial Officer Rob Reilly predicting the bank will be able to increase revenue faster than expenses this year. Shares of all four banks climbed Friday afternoon, with JPMorgan up 0.5 percent at US$86.64, Bank of America up 0.4 percent at US$23.01, Wells Fargo up 1.1 percent at US$55.15 and PNC up 0.4 percent at US$118.39. On conference calls with reporters and analysts, top executives were sanguine about topics ranging from interest rates and loan growth, to regulation and the incoming administration of President-Elect Donald Trump. OPTIMISTIC "We are very optimistic about the future, optimistic about new policies which could spur growth," Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said. The bank's finance chief, Paul Donofrio, predicted BofA will be able to produce an additional US$600 million in the current quarter from higher interest rates, with further gains throughout the year. He also cited customers' "high credit quality" and positive trends in auto, home and middle-market loans, as being supportive of earnings. In the fourth quarter, BofA benefited from an aggressive cost-cutting program Moynihan detailed last summer, as well as a pickup in trading revenue. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon was slightly more circumspect, but said he was comforted by the fact that Trump was selecting people with experience to join his team. Dimon also cited several positive economic trends that suggest the global economy is headed in the right direction, which will help buoy bank earnings. "The economy is getting a little bit better," he said. "Interest rates help and looking forward, you probably have a better political, legal and regulatory environment." The bank is sticking by its loan growth forecast of 10 to 15 percent for 2017, though Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said it might be toward the lower end of the range. 'SOLID PERFORMANCE' Despite Wells Fargo's unique troubles, its chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry, also said the bank had a "solid underlying performance," citing loan growth, good credit quality and higher interest rates. The idea that banks will benefit from lighter regulation, rising interest rates and lower taxes under Trump has driven bank stocks up nearly 25 percent since the election. Nearly all the executives commented on the enthusiasm evident in markets, but were hesitant to fully endorse it. For instance, Dimon noted that it may take a full year for the new government in Washington to decide exactly how it will tackle complex issues like corporate tax reform. And, he said, increased competition means lenders may just "compete away" any tax benefits they receive. "We've all heard that the new administration in Washington supports tax reform, regulatory relief and other pro-growth policies," said PNC Chief Executive Bill Demchak. "But, so far, a move in interest rates is the only thing that has actually happened." Other big banks, including Citigroup Inc, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, will report results next week.

Morgan results hint at bank renaissance in Trump era By Mark DeCambre Published: Jan 13, 2017 1:45 p.m. ET Share Dimon sees an end to lackluster fixed-income trading, a key business for Wall Street banks CNBC By MarkDeCambre J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon struck an upbeat tone on Friday in the wake of the bank’s quarterly earnings, raising expectations that the era under the coming Donald Trump administration could be a resurgent one for the financial sector. Read also: Stock market buoyed by better-than-expected bank earnings The bank’s business tied to helping its clients buy and sell stocks, bonds and other securities, saw a 24% rise in revenue to $4.5 billion from $3.6 billion a year ago, with fixed-income specifically enjoying a more than 30% pop in revenue compared with the same period a year earlier. Those results helped the U.S.’s biggest bank by assets ring up a record annual profit of $24.73 billion, beating the previous record of $24.44 billion set in 2015. See also: Bank ETFs still favored as investors see growth and Trump bump ahead Earnings were bolstered by a jump in trading, following Trump’s surprise election victory on Nov. 8, and reinforced Wall Street’s expectation that the president-elect’s proposals of looser regulations, lower taxes and a ramp-up in fiscal spending would usher in a new age of stratospheric growth for banks. The sector has seen stocks, if not profits, languish since the 2008-09 crisis rocked global markets and led to a raft of stringent policy measures to rein in bad actors across the world. But Friday’s results appeared to signal that shift may be at hand in some of the most profitable areas. “The fixed-income market is going to go up, and needs for [currencies] is going up, and the needs for hedging is going up” Dimon said, during a Friday conference call with investors. CEOs Share Their Top Advice for Women(1:30) Mary T. Barra and Jamie Dimon share some parting words of advice for working women, at The Wall Street Journal’s Women in the Workplace event. The J.P. Morgan JPM, +0.53%  chief also said he believed a secular, or long-term, decline in the fixed-income business, may be coming to an end with volatility—a boon to Wall Street trading—on the rise. Some market observers have argued that a slowdown in trade has hampered some of Wall Street’s most prominent banks, including Goldman Sachs Group GS, +0.19% and Morgan Stanley MS, +0.41% Bank stocks have soared since the November election, spurred by the hopes outlined above, ending a period of weakness caused by a combination of worries about bank loans to embattled energy companies and ultralow interest rates. A popular ETF tracking the banking sector, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF, +0.56% is up nearly 18% since the election, while J.P. Morgan shares, which touched a fresh record high Friday, have risen by about 24%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  has climbed about 10% in the last three months. The following chart shows some of J.P. Morgan’s moves since the financial crisis, including its 2009 low and its Feb. 11, 2016 nadir: J.P. Morgan’s shares are rebounding. But will it last? Also helping to lift bank shares is an expectation that Trump will roll back hard-hitting banking Dodd-Frank bank reform rules, that critics say have made it harder and more expensive for banks to operate. Overall, Dimon, who will be a member of Trump’s CEO brain trust, sounded bullish on the U.S. and global economy. “If you take a walk around the world, Japan’s doing a little bit better, Europe’s doing a little bit better,” he said on the analyst call. He said he was happy with the trend for the U.S. economy and optimistic that tax cuts could be good for the economy and markets. Dimon also said he was not fearful that Trump’s trade policies would be protectionist. However, said that he didn’t want to go to extremes in his reaction to the coming Trump presidency. “I’m neither euphoric nor depressed” about the economic prospects under Trump. “Give him some time,” he said later.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Bank profits boost S&P, Nasdaq; consumer stocks weigh on Dow By Reuters Published: 13:02 EST, 13 January 2017 | Updated: 13:02 EST, 13 January 2017 e-mail By Tanya Agrawal Jan 13 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq trimmed early gains, but remained higher in early afternoon trading on Friday after strong earnings from large U.S. lenders that bode well for the rest of the earnings season. The Dow was little changed, held back by a drop in consumer stocks after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all reported quarterly profits that beat analysts' expectations and expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since the U.S. presidential election. Bank of America jumped as much as 2.1 percent to $23.41, their highest since the financial crisis. JPMorgan surged 2.2 percent at a record high of $88.17 and Wells Fargo gained 3.1 percent to $56.20. Goldman Sachs hit a more than nine-year high, while Morgan Stanley touched a more than eight-year high. Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index's 0.45 percent rise leading the advancers. The KBW Bank index was up 0.60 percent. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "Financials have had a very good run post election and the data we've gotten today from the big banks has been very good and we do expect this sector to post strong earnings mostly due to the rising interest rate environment," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. At 12:42 p.m. ET (1742 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.15 points, or 0.05 percent, at 19,881.85. The S&P 500 was up 4.55 points, or 0.20 percent, at 2,274.99 The Nasdaq Composite was up 29.85 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,577.34. It had hit a record high earlier in the day. The biggest boost was from Facebook, which jumped 1.6 percent to $128.65 after Raymond James upgraded the stock. U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies will benefit the economy. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Trump's policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. "There is a lot of optimism baked in 2017 as far as earnings go and we've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Adams. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,780 to 1,039. On the Nasdaq, 2,017 issues rose and 784 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 29 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 109 new highs and seven new lows.

Joyce M. Rosenberg, AP Business Writer Leave a comment 3 reads In this Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, photo, Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis poses for photos in his home, in Los Angeles. When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) NEW YORK (AP) — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. “Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it’s not really your money till you pay your taxes,” says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. “At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped.” Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous’ cash reserves. “Cash is king” is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn’t coming in, and owners can’t get loans or investors, there’s no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they’d have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It’s especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. “They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy,” Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. “The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks,” JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he’s willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company’s more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company’s busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company’s cash position. “If everything went south, we’d probably have enough cash for two or three months,” he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They’ve given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They’ve also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that’s a sign of trouble to Basilo — they’re not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. “That’s how they think when they start their business. They’re very unprepared,” he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores’ down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor’s ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don’t want to tap them for cash flow. “We pretend that the savings doesn’t exist,” Dan Robinson says. _____ Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on Friday he thinks President-elect Donald Trump's administration will do the right thing for the U.S. He just needs time, Dimon said, according to Reuters. Dimon, speaking with reporters following the bank's fourth-quarter earnings release, said he is comforted that Trump is appointing experienced people to his administration, Reuters reported. Bank stocks have rallied on expectations that the president-elect will eliminate financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Following Trump's election victory, the president-elect tapped former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin said the Dodd-Frank banking regulations are too complicated and a headwind to lending. Trump once called Dimon "the worst banker in the United States." Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. show chapters JPM posts earnings beat of $1.71 vs. $1.44 est.    Friday, 13 Jan 2017 | 8:06 AM ET | 01:49 On Friday, JPMorgan's quarterly earnings pushed well past analysts' expectations, helped by double-digit growth in deposits and record credit card sales.

Photos of the weekend SUBSCRIBE An Amazon.com package awaits delivery from UPS in Palo Alto, Ca. in October 2010. The online retailer giant has released a new credit card for its Prime members. Paul Sakuma/AP Photo/File | Caption Mengqi Sun Staff January 13, 2017 —The online retail giant Amazon is rolling out another product to lure its loyal customers. This time, it’s a credit card with appealing terms. The search company collaborated with JP Morgan Chase for the new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card, announced on Wednesday. The new card rewards its cardmembers as much as five percent on any purchase from the website, according to a press release from the company – while, for Amazon and Chase, it represents one more way to capitalize on the website's massive customer base. The idea of the card, which targets Amazon Prime members, is not brand new. It is built upon the existing Amazon Rewards Visa Signature card, which currently offers a three-percent reward. Cardholders who are also Prime members will be automatically upgraded, according to Amazon.   “What's new is accelerating and improving the rewards process to make it a more enticing proposition to cardholders,” David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a trade publication on credit card industry, tells The Christian Science Monitor. “And that's really where the game is these days and for the last two years or more…And there's a real battle to try to become first or top in wallet.” In addition to five percent back on all purchases from Amazon’s website, the card offers a two-percent cash reward at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores, and one percent everywhere else. It does not charge an annual fee or a foreign transaction fee; to be eligible, however, customers must pay $99 per year to join the company’s Prime membership.  The most expensive items on Amazon “We are adding even more value to Prime by offering rewards on Amazon and everywhere else you shop,” Max Bardon, a vice president at Amazon, said in a statement.  Zack Friedman, founder of Make Lemonade, a finance platform that offers financial advice, said this card is Amazon’s strategy to increase its Prime membership. “Clearly, Amazon wants to increase its Prime membership base, which has been a major profitability and growth engine for Amazon …and an effective strategy to retain its customer base,” he wrote in a piece on Forbes. Created in 2005 as a way to offer free two-day shipping, an Amazon Prime membership now includes streaming music, TV shows, and movies, among other benefits.  “It’s interesting for Amazon in that they keep layering on more and more things to make that Prime membership more and more attractive,” Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst at Creditcards.com, tells the Monitor. “It’s interesting to see how they’ve expanded that to grow the loyalty.”  Mr. Robertson says offering credit is also Amazon’s way to generate additional profits from its existing customer base. “At some point, you get to the top end of what your potential customer base is, and then what you have to do is to mine your existing customer base for additional profits, and that's where revolving credit cards come in,” he says. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, nearly half of households had a Prime membership in early 2016, reaching 54 million – a customer base that represents potential for Chase, as well.  “Hundreds of millions of people shop at Amazon.com and there is no better way to earn rewards for their purchases than Chase’s new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card,” Kevin Watters, the chief executive of Chase card services, said in a statement. “We are thrilled to be working with Amazon to offer even more value to our cardmembers.” Analysts say this newly designed metal card could be Chase’s way to replicate the early success of its popular Sapphire Reserve card. “This is another example of Chase going all out to attract high-end credit card customers,” Mr. Schulz says. “Even though the Amazon Prime customer isn’t a monolithic thing, and there's an awful lot of people in that group, it would stand to reason that the average Amazon Prime member is probably a little more upscale than the typical Amazon customers.” Some observers warn against the potential impact Amazon’s new credit card might have on brick-and-mortar businesses.  Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × “The Amazon Prime Rewards Signature Visa Card is a potential disruptor that can change the retail landscape,” Mr. Friedman tells the Monitor in an email. "By expanding its credit card benefits, Amazon’s strategy is for consumers to make Amazon their default retailer for virtually all their shopping needs." Yet, while Amazon might attempt to grab more market share through this card, Robertson says, “this will not set the world on fire. This is an add-on.” Print/Reprints Next Up The most expensive items on Amazon By Eoin O'Carroll Staff The New Economy As legacy retailers make deep cuts, Amazon promises 100,000 jobs by mid-2018 By Lonnie Shekhtman The New Economy Despite hard times for Macy’s and Sears, physical retail stores are booming By Lonnie Shekhtman Photos of the Day Photos of the weekend Our Award-Winning Publication Subscribe to the Monitor's trustworthy weekly review of global news and ideas.

JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, said earnings rose to $6.7 billion, or $1.71 per share, from $5.4 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding an atypical tax benefit, the bank earned $1.58 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan has one of the largest global investment banks, which affects its earnings significantly when market activity picks up or declines. Along with other big banks, it was widely expected to benefit from a wave of trading in stocks and bonds following Donald Trump's stunning victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. Revenue from fixed-income trading - JPMorgan's most volatile business - rose 31 percent to $3.4 billion, while stock trading revenue increased 8 percent to $1.2 billion. Bank of America Corp, which reported results earlier on Friday, also said trading revenue surged last quarter. In a statement discussing results, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon cited those market trends, as well as growth in deposits and loans, higher credit card sales and competitive gains in "virtually all" of JPMorgan's businesses. The bank also kept a tight lid on expenses, he said. JPMorgan's shares were little changed in premarket trading. Like other banks, its stock has seen big gains since the election on expectations that Trump's plans to cut taxes, ease regulations and boost infrastructure spending will help profits. JPMorgan's stock had risen 23 percent from the election through Thursday's close. Wells Fargo & Co also reported earnings on Friday, but its much smaller trading business did not benefit from post-election market enthusiasm. Its results were also hurt by the fallout from a sales scandal. Looking ahead, big banks are expected to benefit this year from rising interest rates, which allow them to charge more money for loans. The Federal Reserve, which raised a key rate target by a quarter of a percentage point in December, is expected to raise them again three times in 2017. JPMorgan said its net interest income rose 5 percent during the fourth quarter to $12.1 billion, thanks to an uptick in rates, as well as more lending. The bank's total net revenue rose 2.5 percent to $24.33 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $23.95 billion.

The Nasdaq composite set another all-time high Friday even as the Dow Jones industrial average edged lower. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America rose about 0.5 percent and Wells Fargo rose 1.5 percent after reporting earnings that were higher than analysts expected. Banks were also benefiting from an upward move in bond yields, which will lead to higher interest rates on loans. Real estate and materials companies fell. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274. The Nasdaq composite gained 26 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574. The Dow industrials fell 5 points, less than 0.1 percent, to 19,885. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent. ___ 11:45 a.m. Stocks rose in midday trading as investors pore over earnings reports from several big lenders. Banks and other financial companies rose more than the rest of the market Friday. JPMorgan Case and Bank of America rose 1 percent and Wells Fargo rose 2 percent after reporting earnings that were higher than analysts expected. Banks were also benefiting from an upward move in bond yields, which will lead to higher interest rates on loans. Utilities and phone companies fell. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,913. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 6 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,277. The Nasdaq composite gained 36 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,583. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent. ___ 9:35 a.m. Banks are leading an early rise on Wall Street after three major U.S. lenders reported solid results. JPMorgan Case, Bank of America and Wells Fargo each rose about 1 percent in early trading Friday. All three reported results that beat forecasts, although Wells Fargo's profit declined and new account openings plunged following the bank's fraudulent account-opening scandal. Streaming music company Pandora jumped 8 percent after releasing a strong revenue forecast. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 50 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,939. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 5 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,276. The Nasdaq composite gained 22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,570. Bond prices fell.

Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 11:30AM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 11:32AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index rose on Friday, led by the country’s heavyweight banks as U.S. fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off and bond yields rose. Some of the most influential movers on the index were banks, with Toronto-Dominion Bank rising 0.5 per cent to $67.46 and Royal Bank of Canada climbing 0.9 per cent to $94.59. Gains for Canadian bank stocks came as some major U.S. banks reported quarterly profits that beat expectations and bond yields rose after data showed U.S. retail sales rose solidly in December. Higher bond yields increase net interest margins of banks and reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities. Manulife Financial Corp. rose 1.1 per cent to $24.70, while the overall financials group gained 0.6 per cent. At 11:27 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 61.79 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 15,479.95. Still, it is on track to fall 0.1 per cent for the week after reaching last week its highest since September 2014 at 15,621.40, a near all-time high. Consumer staples rose 0.9 per cent, while the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, rose 0.5 per cent even as some gold miners lost ground as gold prices fell. Barrick Gold Corp. declined 1 per cent to $21.94, while gold futures fell 0.9 per cent to $1,188.1 an ounce. Nine of the index’s 10 main groups were higher, with the energy group little changed as oil fell. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were higher in late morning trading on Friday as strong earnings from large U.S. lenders bode well for the rest of the earnings season. The Dow’s gains were comparatively lesser, held back by a drop in consumer stocks after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all reported quarterly profits that beat analysts expectations. Bank of America jumped as much as 2.1 per cent to $23.41, their highest since the financial crisis. JPMorgan surged 2.2 per cent at a record high of $88.17 and Wells Fargo gained 3.1 per cent to $56.20. Goldman Sachs hit a more than nine-year high, while Morgan Stanley touched a more than eight-year high. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index’s 1.23-per-cent rise leading the advancers. The KBW Bank index was up 1.64 per cent, set for their best day since Dec. 1. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Financials have had a very good run post election and the data we’ve gotten today from the big banks has been very good and we do expect this sector to post strong earnings mostly due to the rising interest rate environment,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 19.97 points, or 0.1 percent, at 19,910.97. The S&P 500 was up 6.81 points, or 0.29 per cent, at 2,277.25. The Nasdaq Composite was up 31.87 points, or 0.57 per cent, at 5,579.36. It had hit a record high of 5564.25. The biggest boost was from Facebook, which jumped 1.9 per cent to $128.98 after a Raymond James upgraded the stock. U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s policies will benefit the economy. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 per cent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500’s 6.1 percent rise. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Trump’s policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. “There is a lot of optimism baked in 2017 as far as earnings go and we’ve come a long way very quickly so there’s scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive,” said Mr. Adams. Oil prices fell on Friday and were on track to end the week lower on lingering doubts over the extent of OPEC cuts, with sentiment worsened by concerns over the economic health of the world’s second-largest oil consumer China after it reported the steepest falls in overall exports since 2009. Record Chinese crude imports of 8.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in December helped to buoy prices somewhat, traders said, but they could not hide underlying fears over the overall health of the world’s second-biggest economy. Despite China’s oil thirst, overall exports - the country’s economic backbone - declined by 7.7 per cent last year in what was the second annual decline in a row and the worst since the depths of the global crisis in 2009. Brent crude futures were trading 31 cents lower at $55.70 a barrel and were on track for a weekly loss of 2.5 per cent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell by 41 cents to $52.60, set for a weekly drop of 2.6 per cent. Exports of Chinese refined oil products last month rose nearly 25 per cent year-on-year to a record 5.4 million tonnes, well above November’s previous record of 4.9 million tonnes. “China right now seems more interested in keeping capital in the country than focusing on growth overall,” Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago said. “We have to watch this situation develop because this is one threat to what is an otherwise wildly bullish scenario for oil in the coming year.” On the supply side, there was some market support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said that its output had fallen below 10 million bpd to levels last seen in February 2015 and that it expects to make even deeper cuts next month. However, hard evidence of export reductions has yet to emerge, two weeks into the month in which the cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, such as Russia, were supposed to start. Many analysts expect compliance of 50 per cent to 80 per cent at best. “As the Saudis hint at even deeper reductions in February, assumptions are rife that its enthusiastic approach to output cuts is an admission that cheating is expected on the part of other producers,” said Stephen Brennock of oil brokerage PVM. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its January outlook that it expects Brent and WTI to average $53 and $52 a barrel respectively in 2017. Even if OPEC cuts its output as agreed, traders said that rising U.S. shale output and increasing supply from OPEC members Nigeria and Libya, which were exempt from the pact, might offset any reductions. The market also awaited U.S. drilling rig count data from energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT), the indicator future U.S. production.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 13, 2017 11:13am   Comments Share: Investors got hit with a truckload of earnings and economic data Friday morning, and may spend much of today deciding what it all means. Big bank earnings, retail sales, inflation: You name it; we have it to discuss. In a nutshell, strong earnings from Bank of America Corp(NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) reinforce what we’ve been talking about. We expected trading to be better due to the post-election rally, and that’s reflected in the numbers from these two big companies. Wells Fargo & Co(NYSE: WFC), which relies less on trading than BAC and JPM, didn’t perform as well. And retail sales, which rose 0.6% in December, look like a bit of a disappointment, especially considering recent increases in consumer sentiment. Wall Street analysts had been expecting a 0.7% rise. Automobile sales led the way, but that was something we knew going in. It looks like holiday shopping perhaps was a little disappointing. The markets are holding steady in the early going, and any rally could be on hold until we hear from more companies. There may be more emphasis on what the banks say on their earnings calls, as we wait to hear CEOs’ economic outlooks for 2017. Let’s look at the earnings numbers. At BAC, earnings jumped to 40 cents a share from 27 cents a year earlier, above the Wall Street consensus of 38 cents a share. However, adjusted revenue of $20.22 billion was below the consensus estimate of $20.85 billion. Trading revenue rose 11% to $2.91 billion, with fixed income leading the way. Additionally, BAC committed to re-purchasing additional shares, and cited “strong client activity” in Q4, a sign that the post-election rally may have delivered a trading volume bump. JPM beat consensus estimates for both earnings and revenue. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.71 per share on revenue of $24.333 billion after adjustments. Pre-earnings estimates from Wall Street had been for $1.44 per share on revenue of $23.949 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. WFC earnings per share of 96 cents came in short of the average $1 estimate. However, EPS looked pretty decent after adjustments. The company also missed expectations on sales, and the stock fell in pre-market trading. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for December rose 0.3%, as expected. Core PPI was a bit above expectations. Though most eyes may be on bank earnings, retail sales, and PPI today, don’t forget there’s a bit more data scheduled later, including November business inventories and the University of Michigan’s first read on January sentiment. Also, watch for the weekly crude oil rig count from Baker Hughes, as it’s shown 10-straight weeks of increases and U.S. oil production has climbed. From a technical perspective, Thursday’s action seemed somewhat positive for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), though it finished lower on the day. Early on, the SPX had tumbled down toward long-term technical support in the 2252 area, but bounced back solidly by the end of the session. Sometimes a bounce off support signals technical strength that can filter into coming sessions. The choppy action might have reflected a bit of consolidation ahead of key earnings and data on Friday. Volatility Finally Shows Its Face After starting the year at its lowest levels for January in 10 years, the VIX finally broke out on Thursday, climbing 9% at one point to above 12 before retreating pretty dramatically by the end of the day. Perhaps it’s a sign that investors are starting to build in a chance for bigger market moves in the coming days. Additionally, the CBOE/CBOT U.S. Treasury Note Volatility Index, which has also been sinking lately, popped up a little. The volatility came after President-elect Donald Trump’s press conference on Wednesday, and ahead of a slew of data and earnings Friday. Perhaps the market is waking up a little, as a lot is going on right now. Bond Yields Retreat Since we’re on the subject of Treasuries, it’s worth noting that 10-year Treasury yields fell Thursday to their lowest level since late November. The morning low of 2.31% was down from highs of around 2.6% last month. Rates had been rising on hopes that the new administration could spark the economy with new spending and tax initiatives, but evidently some market participants were disappointed that Trump didn’t spend much time on those subjects at Wednesday’s press conference. Rates had also climbed as the market factored in the Fed’s plans for three rate hikes this year, and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said in prepared remarks Thursday that three rate hikes are appropriate. More Bank Earnings On Tap Got your fill of bank earnings today? Well, you have a three-day weekend to recuperate, then it’s back to the races Tuesday and Wednesday. Markets are closed Monday for the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, but then Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is scheduled to report first thing Tuesday, followed by Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) on Wednesday. And banks won’t be all. Several other big companies are on tap next week, including General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM). Everyone, start your engines! But first, have a nice long weekend.

It’s Complicated, Says Analyst Dick Bove Rising rates are good for banks because they boost earnings, but they're bad because they weigh on book value. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 13, 2017 at 10:48AM Whether higher rates are good or bad for a particular bank depends on a balancing act. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Much of the current excitement surrounding bank stocks stems from investors' belief that interest rates will continue to rise, sending bank profits higher as well. There's truth to this, writes longtime bank analyst Dick Bove in a recent research note, but there's more to the story than just this. Looking back to the 1970s In a report published Monday, Bove looked to the 1970s to get a sense for what's going on in the bank industry today. He did so because the 1970s were known for rapidly rising interest rates. By looking at what happened to bank stocks then, in turn, we can get a sense for what to expect now. Bank profits did in fact go up during that decade. Earnings per share among money center banks -- those like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) -- nearly tripled from 1971 to 1981, Bove notes. This makes sense when you consider that banks sell loans, the prices of which are dictated by interest rates. Higher rates mean higher loan prices. And higher loan prices mean higher interest income for banks. The 1970s paradox Given that interest rates soared throughout the 1970s -- short-term rates got as a high as 18% -- you'd think that the 1970s must have been a great decade for bank stocks. After all, higher profits should translate into higher valuation multiples for bank stocks. Effective Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts. But this isn't what happened. In fact, the multiples on bank stocks went in the other direction. The average price to earnings multiple for banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup went from more than 13.0 in 1972 down to less than 5.0 eight years later. What caused this paradoxical result? In short, because higher interest rates weigh on the price of fixed-income securities (which are a main component of any bank's asset portfolio). Bove says that higher interest rates are only good for banks so long as the benefit to profits outweighs the detriment to book value. According to Bove, What is driving the stock performance in the 1970s was not earnings but a number which one cannot show here since it was never published -- i.e., real book values. As interest rates rose the value of bank assets fell in real terms. This decline in real book values was not being replenished by earnings growth. Today vs. the 1970s Bove is absolutely right to point out that "interest rate changes are often not what is thought in valuing bank stocks." However, there are a couple of things that are worth pointing out. The first is that the 1970s and today, while similar because they were both periods of rising interest rates, are also very different. The 1970s was a particularly tumultuous decade for banks, and things got worse in the 1980s, as the savings and loan crisis gained momentum. The problem at the time wasn't just that interest rates were volatile. The more important issue was that they rose incredibly rapidly, as the Federal Reserve sought to combat a wave of double-digit inflation ignited by soaring energy prices thanks to two OPEC-led oil embargos that decade. This isn't as big of a problem today as there's little reason right now to be worried about a rapid rise in rates since we're still in the shadow of the financial crisis. Moreover, banks in the 1970s managed interest rate risk differently than they do today. After predecessor banks to JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup nearly failed because their cost of money (short-term rates) rose beyond what they earned on their fixed-rate loan portfolios (long-term rates), they began underwriting variable-rate loans. This is the model today -- indeed, one could go so far as to say that modern interest rate risk management was invented in the 1970s. The net result is that higher rates should translate into higher profits at a quicker rate today than they did four decades ago, and the downside shouldn't be as bad either. This is why Bank of America is so asset sensitive and will earn $5.3 billion more in additional net interest income once rates reach merely a percent higher than they were at the end of September. JPMorgan Chase isn't far behind at just under $3 billion, while Citigroup is closer to $2 billion. In sum, while Bove is right that higher rates will yield more income for banks, he's also right that they will weigh on book value. This is why the pace of rate hikes is so important. "Multiple increases in short periods are not positive for these stocks," says Bove. "Moderate increases over long periods are positive." John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

The Dow's gains were comparatively lesser, held back by a drop in consumer stocks after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all reported quarterly profits that beat analysts expectations. Bank of America jumped as much as 2.1 percent to $23.41, their highest since the financial crisis. JPMorgan surged 2.2 percent at a record high of $88.17 and Wells Fargo gained 3.1 percent to $56.20. Goldman Sachs hit a more than nine-year high, while Morgan Stanley touched a more than eight-year high. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index's 1.23 percent rise leading the advancers. The KBW Bank index was up 1.64 percent, set for their best day since Dec. 1. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "Financials have had a very good run post election and the data we've gotten today from the big banks has been very good and we do expect this sector to post strong earnings mostly due to the rising interest rate environment," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. At 11:01 a.m. ET (1601 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was up 19.97 points, or 0.1 percent, at 19,910.97. The S&P 500 was up 6.81 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,277.25. The Nasdaq Composite was up 31.87 points, or 0.57 percent, at 5,579.36. It had hit a record high of 5564.25. The biggest boost was from Facebook, which jumped 1.9 percent to $128.98 after a Raymond James upgraded the stock. U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies will benefit the economy. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Trump's policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. "There is a lot of optimism baked in 2017 as far as earnings go and we've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Adams. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,832 to 930. On the Nasdaq, 1,988 issues rose and 694 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 96 new highs and six new lows.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 13, 2017: 10:19 AM ET Trump tapping top CEOs for advisory group JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon seems hopeful that better times for the economy lie ahead under President-elect Donald Trump. The bank reported better than expected profit for the fourth quarter Friday. And in its earnings release, Dimon suggested more good news could be coming for banks -- and for Americans -- in the months ahead. "The U.S. economy may be building momentum," Dimon said. "Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities." Dimon didn't mention Trump by name or cite specifics about the possibility of Trump and the Republican-led Congress unwinding some of President Obama's financial reforms. During a conference call with reporters, Dimon tempered his enthusiasm. "I'm usually an optimist. But I'm neither euphoric nor depressed," he said, adding that he is hopeful there will be more regulatory and tax reform. He added that it's too soon to tell what, if anything, will change in Washington. Dimon will clearly have a key role in helping the new president's economic policy though. Related: Wall Street hates the Volcker Rule. Will Trump kill it? Dimon is one of 16 CEOs on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group that also includes IBM (IBM, Tech30) CEO Ginni Rometty, Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger, GM (GM) CEO Mary Barra and Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon. Asked during the media call what advice he would whisper in Trump's ear, Dimon quipped, "I don't whisper." He declined to give specifics about what specifically he would suggest, saying there is no one big thing that must be addressed first. Answering a question from CNNMoney, Dimon said he was not overly worried about Trump's attacks against companies for doing business in Mexico or about his protectionist rhetoric -- even though JPMorgan Chase does business around the globe. Dimon said he's putting aside the Trump one-liners and is "comforted" that Trump has put "professionals" in the administration such as treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs exec, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary and former ExxonMobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. "Give him some time," Dimon said of Trump. Even though Dimon said there are still questions about what's next for banks, Wall Street seemed pleased with the results. JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) stock was up nearly 2% in early trading Friday following its earnings. The stock, along with that of other banks, has been on a tear since the election -- largely because of hopes for fewer regulations and rising interest rates, which would boost profits. Shares of JPMorgan Chase are up 23% since the election. Bank of America (BAC) has also risen sharply, and it, too, reported solid earnings Friday morning. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan didn't mention Trump either in his bank's earnings release. But he pointed out that the Fed, which raised interest rates last month and is expected to do so several more times this year, will help BofA. Related: Wells Fargo dumps toxic 'cross-selling' metric JPMorgan Chase CFO Marianne Lake echoed that during her bank's earnings call with reporters. She said the company was excited about more rate hikes but that it will take time for them to improve profits. "We are still at absolutely very low levels of rates," she noted. Scandal-ridden Wells Fargo (WFC) also reported its latest results on Friday morning. The bank, which was forced to admit last year that it opened up millions of fake accounts, disappointed Wall Street with earnings and sales that missed forecasts. But shares of both BofA and Wells Fargo rallied Friday along with JPMorgan Chase. Several other big banks, including Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS), will report their latest results next week.

 Here's the memo the CEO of JPMorgan's giant investment bank just sent to staff Matt Turner and Portia Crowe Jan. 13, 2017, 11:02 AM 32,639 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan JPMorgan on Friday reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom lines. The corporate and investment bank, in particular, had its best revenue on record for a fourth quarter, according to CFO Marianne Lake. The markets business — including both fixed income and equities trading — also had its highest revenues on record for a fourth quarter. Fixed income revenues were up 31%, and equities revenues were up 8%. Investment banking revenue increased 1% from the quarter a year ago. Daniel Pinto, the CEO of the firm's corporate and investment bank, sent this memo to his staff to mark the occasion: "As part of today's firm-wide earnings, the CIB reported quarterly revenue of $8.5 billion, up 20% year-over- year and a fourth quarter record. We generated $3.4 billion of net income during the quarter and a return on equity of 20%. "For the full year, the CIB generated $35.2 billion of revenue, up 5% from 2015 and the best performance since 2009. Net income for the full year jumped to $10.8 billion, 34% higher than 2015, and we produced a return on equity of 16%. On all accounts, today's results are impressive. "Q4 2016 CIB performance highlights include (year-over- year): Screenshot "Our banking franchise remained #1 in global investment banking fees, and #1 in both North America and EMEA. J.P. Morgan was also the only investment bank in the top five to gain global wallet share in 2016. We finished the year ranked #2 in global M&A and advised on more deals than any other bank. We also ended 2016 as the top underwriter in both equity and debt capital markets, ranking #1 in IPOs and convertibles as well as high-yield bonds, high-grade bonds, and syndicated loans. In Treasury Services, revenues continued to rise, primarily due to higher interest rates and operating balances. "The momentum in Markets continued. We reported quarterly revenue of $4.5 billion, a fourth quarter record on the strength of record performances from both equities and fixed income. The higher trading volumes we witnessed in the third quarter carried through to the end of the year as investors actively positioned their portfolios in response to political developments and central bank actions. We witnessed particular strength in the credit markets as risk appetite increased on the back of better growth prospects for the US economy, an improvement in oil prices and a healthy third quarter earnings cycle."

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 13 January 2017 | MYT 10:07 PM JPMorgan results trump estimates as election stimulates trading JPMorgan’s net income rose 23.8% to US$6.73bil (RM30.03bil) in the three months ended Dec 31. - Reuters pic NEW YORK: JPMorgan Chase & Co, the No. 1 US bank by assets, reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue on Friday, helped by a surge in investor activity related to the US presidential election. The bank’s net income rose 23.8% to US$6.73bil (RM30.03bil) in the three months ended Dec 31, while earnings per share rose to US$1.71 from US$1.32. Excluding items, the bank earned US$1.58 per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of US$1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We grew market share in virtually all of our businesses and showed expense discipline while continuing to invest for the future,” chief executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. “The US economy may be building momentum,” he added. “Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities.” Donald Trump’s stunning victory on Nov 8 set off a wave of trading in stocks and bonds during what is normally a slow period for trading desks at big banks. Bank of America Corp, the second-largest US bank, kicked off the quarterly earnings period for big US lenders earlier on Friday, announcing a 46.8% rise in profit. The banks were also reporting their first results since the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate target for the second time since 2006 on Dec 14. Higher interest rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to charge higher rates on loans. Revenue from fixed-income trading - JPMorgan’s most volatile business - rose about 31% to US$3.37bil (RM15.0bil), while stock trading revenue increased 8.1% to US$1.15bil (RM5.11bil). That helped boost total net revenue by 2.5% to US$24.33bil (RM108.17bil), beating analysts average estimate of US$23.95bil (RM106.79bil). JPMorgan’s shares, which up to Thursday had risen about 23% since the election, were little changed in premarket trading. Bank stocks have been on a tear on the expectation that profits will be boosted by Trump’s plans to cut corporate taxes, ease regulatory restraints and boost infrastructure spending. The Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage point in December, is expected to raise them again three times this year. JPMorgan said its fourth-quarter return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 14% up from 11% a year-earlier. Total noninterest expenses fell 3% to US$13.83bil, primarily driven by lower legal expenses. Also on Friday, Wells Fargo, the largest US mortgage lender, reported a 6.4% fall in profit.

X ‘Trump trade’ surge lifts US investment banks to strong profits Results better than expected for key banking players after end-of-year boost in trading Fri, Jan 13, 2017, 15:27 JPMorgan posted a near-doubling of profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 at its investment banking division. Photograph: Reuters         A frenzy of trading after Donald Trump’s election as US president helped JPMorgan Chase deliver a near-doubling of profit in its investment banking unit in the fourth quarter, overcoming an indifferent performance from its core retail business. Similarly, high end-of-year trading volumes drove a better-than-expected 48 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits at Bank of America, while US investment house BlackRock reported the largest net inflows of new client money in its history in 2016, despite a 5 per cent fall in net income for the year. The uptick comes after a tough end to 2015 when banks struggled with tough trading conditions.Shares in all the big US banks have been rising since the US Republicans’ sweep of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, as investors have welcomed promises of higher interest rates, lower taxes and lighter regulation.  Five of the top 10 gainers on the S&P 500 since the election are banks, led by Goldman Sachs (+34 per cent) and Bank of America (+35 per cent). B of A kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season yesterday with its forecast-busting rise in profits. “Few bank CEOs supported Mr Trump but they are benefiting nicely from his arrival,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at Michigan Ross. “Investors have to guess whether less regulation will lead banks to make decisions that are more rational and profitable, or more reckless and disaster-prone.” Investors will be combing through yesterday’s figures from JPMorgan, along with the update from Bank of America and a considerably weaker report from Wells Fargo, to assess whether share prices have run up too high, too soon. The past few years have been a tough time for most of the big banks, as they have faced the profit-sapping effects of tougher capital and liquidity standards, along with stubbornly low interest rates. ADVERTISEMENT Nonetheless, aggregate profits across the system keep grinding higher, as the banks have pushed out more loans and kept losses low, while finding new ways to charge fees. Quarterly net income at federally insured institutions was $45.6 billion in the third quarter, up 13 per cent from a year earlier. – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Donald Trump House Of Representatives Senate White House Bank of America Goldman Sachs Group JPMorgan JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo Read More EU and US strike deal to boost transatlantic insurance market Irish SPVs more a worry for other countries than State - academic Ulster Bank fixes glitch affecting customer payments BoI chief Richie Boucher joins board of Greek lender Italian banking crisis moves on to Unicredit’s €13bn cash call Student loan firm Future Finance looking to operate in Ireland Bitcoin tumbles amid fear of Chinese crackdown Ulster Bank staff in line for a 2 per cent pay increase Bus Eireann chief says threat of insolvency is very real Nurses to meet Department of Health in bid to avert industrial action Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Oxfam report reveals ‘obscene’ gap between rich and poor Personal Finance Q&A: Dominic Coyle Politics Border tariff fears as UK edges towards hard Brexit Rugby Ulster unable to build on start as Exeter end European adventure Sponsored Plan your financial future and enjoy your dream retirement Leading the dance: 'Growing up competing I learned the drive to keep going' Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business New orders drive recovery in construction, latest data shows 01:00 Oxfam report reveals ‘obscene’ gap between rich and poor 00:02 Facebook Germany to start tackling fake news within weeks 19:28 Seen & Heard: Silver lining for Apollo House activists? 19:10 For your diary 19:00 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 40 houses owned by Irish EuroMillions family seized 2 Oxfam report reveals ‘obscene’ gap between rich and poor 3 We could be looking at ‘hard Brexit’.

The Street seems to be satisfied with its mixed Q4 report, which consisted of a $0.02 beat for EPS, but came up shy by $900 million for revenues. After a higher open, it retreated and found support just under the top of Thursday's range ($23.12), reaching $23.11 and then continued its move higher. The ensuing rally has taken the issue through the multiple highs at the $23.30 area, including the former high for the move at $23.39, reaching $23.41. In order to post a new closing high for the recent rally, it would need to exceed its December 15 close of $23.16. Posted-In: Technicals Intraday Update Movers Trading Ideas © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 9:42AM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 9:42AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index rose on Friday as heavyweight financial shares climbed, offsetting losses for energy and mining stocks as commodities fell. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 19.35 points, or 0.13 per cent, at 15,437.51, shortly after the open. Eight of the index’s 10 main groups were higher. U.S. stocks also opened higher on Friday after quarterly profits of Bank of America and JPMorgan beat expectations as fourth-quarter earnings kicked off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28.03 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 19,919.03. The S&P 500 gained 3.32 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 2,273.76. The Nasdaq Composite added 10.83 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,558.32. Shares of Bank of America rose 1..2 per cent to $23.20 in early trading after the lender’s quarterly profit beat estimates, but its revenue fell short. Wells Fargo was up. 1.6 per cent at $55.36 after it reported a fall in profit and its revenue fell short of market expectations. JPMorgan was up 1.4 per cent at $87.45 after its quarterly profit and revenue both topped analysts’ expectations. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “There is a lot of optimism regarding the financial sector but any kind of cautious statement from them might cause a bit of a pullback,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “All the changes that are being proposed for the sector is going to take some time, it’s not going to happen right away.” The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 per cent since the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, outpacing the S&P 500’s 6.1-per-cent rise, boosted by hopes of deregulation and increased interest rates. U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s policies to boost infrastructure spending and reform corporate taxes will benefit the economy. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Mr. Trump’s policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. Blackrock Chief Executive Larry Fink told CNBC that if the roll out of growth initiatives by Trump are slower, then the markets are ahead of themselves. Shares of the world’s largest asset manager were little changed after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. U.S. retail sales rose solidly in December amid strong demand for automobiles, with data showing retail sales increased 0.6 per cent last month, slightly below the 0.- per-cent increase expected by economists. A separate report at 10 a.m. ET is expected to show U.S. consumer sentiment improved to 98.5 in January from 98.2.

The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year," JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a prepared statement. JPMorgan's investment bank division had a stellar quarter, reporting net income of $3.43 billion compared with $1.75 billion in the same period a year earlier. The bank's fixed income, currencies and commodities trading division reported a 31 percent jump in revenue, while stock trading had an 8 percent jump in revenue from the previous year. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. JPMorgan's consumer banking division, its largest business by revenue, had a sluggish quarter, reporting net income of $2.36 billion compared with $2.41 billion in the same period a year earlier. Most of the decline was tied into a drop in revenue from credit cards and auto loans. JPMorgan launched the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card last year, which became popular overnight. However, there were significant costs associated with the program. Overall revenue was $26.09 billion in the period. JPMorgan's adjusted revenue was $23.38 billion, which also beat Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $23.24 billion. JPMorgan shares have decreased slightly since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen slightly more than 1 percent. The stock has increased 46 percent in the last 12 months. _____ This story was partially generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

And with expected economic stimulus and tax cuts likely to bring interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve, banks are expected to see continued profitability this year. JPMorgan Chase announced record profits for 2016, boosted by a "dynamic" US economy and a surge in brokerage activities. JPMorgan Chase announced record profits for 2016, boosted by a "dynamic" US economy and a surge in brokerage activities ©Timothy A. Clary (AFP/File) Annual net profit rose 1.2 percent to $27.7 billion, including $6.73 billion in the fourth quarter alone. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $6.19 for the year which was above analysts' expectations. Bank of America said higher interest rates and an increase in consumer loans boosted earnings, but its business grew less than expected. Net profit in 2016 jumped 13 percent year-on-year to $16.2 billion, marked by a 46.8 jump in the fourth quarter. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 for the year. Bank of America, which had gained 35 percent on Wall Street since the November 8 election, fell 0.17 percent at 1225 GMT in pre-opening trading -- reflecting the disappointment of investors who expected the post-election euphoria to boost earnings further. While revenues from consumer loans increased as expected following the interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in December, revenues from market activities were not as strong as hoped. "If the recent rate hike occurred too late to boost fourth quarter results, we anticipate a higher profit growth in the first quarter of 2017," chief financial officer Paul Donofrio said in a press release. The Fed has suggested it could raise rates three times this year, given that the Trump administration promises deregulation of the financial sector, massive tax cuts and large investments in infrastructure. Meanwhile, troubled Wells Fargo reported lower-than-expected 2016 results, hit by the scandal over thousands of fictitious accounts created without the knowledge of its clients. In the fallout the bank paid a fine of $185 million and the CEO resigned under pressure. Net profit fell 4.2 percent to $21.94 billion last year, including a drop of 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter alone due to a series of costly measures the bank implemented to regain consumer confidence. Earnings per share was $3.99 compared to the analysts' expectation of $4.03. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The bank's net income rose 23.8 percent to $6.73 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, while earnings per share rose to $1.71 from $1.32. (http://bit.ly/2jeHFAY) Excluding items, the bank earned $1.58 per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We grew market share in virtually all of our businesses and showed expense discipline while continuing to invest for the future," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. "The U.S. economy may be building momentum," he added. "Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities." Donald Trump's stunning victory on Nov. 8 set off a wave of trading in stocks and bonds during what is normally a slow period for trading desks at big banks. Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank, kicked off the quarterly earnings period for big U.S. lenders earlier on Friday, announcing a 46.8 percent rise in profit. The banks were also reporting their first results since the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate target for the second time since 2006 on Dec. 14. Higher interest rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to charge higher rates on loans. Revenue from fixed-income trading - JPMorgan's most volatile business - rose about 31 percent to $3.37 billion, while stock trading revenue increased 8.1 percent to $1.15 billion. That helped boost total net revenue by 2.5 percent to $24.33 billion, beating analysts average estimate of $23.95 billion. JPMorgan's shares, which up to Thursday had risen about 23 percent since the election, were little changed in premarket trading. Bank stocks have been on a tear on the expectation that profits will be boosted by Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, ease regulatory restraints and boost infrastructure spending. The Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in December, is expected to raise them again three times this year. JPMorgan said its fourth-quarter return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 14 percent up from 11 percent a year-earlier. Total noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $13.83 billion, primarily driven by lower legal expenses. Also on Friday, Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a 6.4 percent fall in profit. Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley report earnings next week.

Higher interest rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to charge higher rates on loans. Revenue from fixed-income trading - JPMorgan's most volatile business - rose about 31 percent to $3.37 billion, while stock trading revenue increased 8.1 percent to $1.15 billion. That helped boost total net revenue by 2.5 percent to $24.33 billion, beating analysts average estimate of $23.95 billion. JPMorgan's shares, which up to Thursday had risen about 23 percent since the election, were little changed in premarket trading. Bank stocks have been on a tear on the expectation that profits will be boosted by Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, ease regulatory restraints and boost infrastructure spending. The Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in December, is expected to raise them again three times this year. JPMorgan said its fourth-quarter return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 14 percent up from 11 percent a year-earlier. Total noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $13.83 billion, primarily driven by lower legal expenses. Also on Friday, Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a 6.4 percent fall in profit. Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley report earnings next week.

(Photo: Andrew Burton) JPMorgan Chase said Friday its fourth quarter earnings rose 24% from a year ago as consumer banking deposits and fixed income trading revenue grew. Earnings per share of $1.71 beat the $1.42 estimated by analysts who were polled by S&P Global Markets Intelligence. Net income for the period was $6.7 billion, compared with $5.4 billion a year ago. “In the consumer business, we had double digit growth in deposits and core loan balances, our credit card sales volume was a record, and for the year we had over $1 trillion of merchant processing volume," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. Shares of JPMorgan rose 2% in morning trading to $87.95. Revenue totaled $24.3 billion, up 2% from a year ago. The consumer and community banking unit's revenue fell 2% to $11 billion as costs to acquire credit card customers grew. Revenue for consumer banking rose, but the mortgage business was flat. The unit's net income fell 2% to $2.4 billion. Revenue for the investment banking unit rose 20% to $8.5 billion as it booked higher fees for treasury services and debt underwriting, while equity underwriting and advisory fees fell. Net income nearly doubled to $3.4 billion. Commercial banking revenue rose 12% to $1.97 billion, reflecting a gain in interest income based on higher deposit spreads and loan growth. 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jE5crq NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

On Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, JPMorgan Chase & Co. reports financial results. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File) NEW YORK, N.Y. - JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 per cent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year," JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a prepared statement. JPMorgan's investment bank division had a stellar quarter, reporting net income of $3.43 billion compared with $1.75 billion in the same period a year earlier. The bank's fixed income, currencies and commodities trading division reported a 31 per cent jump in revenue, while stock trading had an 8 per cent jump in revenue from the previous year. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. JPMorgan's consumer banking division, its largest business by revenue, had a sluggish quarter, reporting net income of $2.36 billion compared with $2.41 billion in the same period a year earlier. Most of the decline was tied into a drop in revenue from credit cards and auto loans. JPMorgan launched the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card last year, which became popular overnight. However, there were significant costs associated with the program. Overall revenue was $26.09 billion in the period. JPMorgan's adjusted revenue was $23.38 billion, which also beat Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $23.24 billion. JPMorgan shares have decreased slightly since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen slightly more than 1 per cent. The stock has increased 46 per cent in the last 12 months. _____ This story was partially generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, said, "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year, reflecting our intense client focus and solid performance across our businesses. In the Consumer business, we had double digit growth in deposits and core loan balances, our credit card sales volume was a record, and for the year we had over $1 trillion of merchant processing volume." In the Friday pre-market trade, JPM is currently trading at $86.52, up $0.28 or 0.32 percent. Net income for the fourth-quarter rose 24 percent to $6.73 billion, from $5.43 billion, with earnings per share improving to $1.71 per share $1.32 per share in the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of $1.44 per share for the fourth-quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. The provision for credit losses was $864 million, down from $1.3 billion, due to net reserve releases in the current quarter of approximately $400 million across Consumer and Wholesale, versus reserve increases in the prior-year quarter. The reserve releases reflected a decrease in Consumer reserves of approximately $250 million primarily driven by releases in Mortgage Banking, partially of fset by increases in Card and Consumer & Business Banking. The Wholesale provision was a benefit, primarily driven by releases in the Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining portfolios. Net revenue on a reported basis grew 2% to $23.38 billion, from $22.89 billion in the previous year. On a Managed basis, total net revenue was $24.33 billion, up 2% from $23.75 billion in the prior year. Wall Street expected revenues of $23.95 billion. Net interest income was $12.1 billion, up 5%, primarily driven by loan growth and the net impact of higher rates, partially offset by lower investment securities balances. Noninterest revenue was $12.3 billion, flat compared with the prior-year quarter. Noninterest expense was $13.8 billion, down 3%, primarily driven by lower legal expense. In Corporate & Investment Bank, net income was $3.4 billion, up $1.7 billion, reflecting higher net revenue, lower noninterest expense, lower provision for credit losses and a tax benefit related to the utilization of certain deferred tax assets. Markets & Investor Services revenue was $5.7 billion, up 32%, largely driven by higher Markets revenue, up 24%. Fixed Income Markets revenue was up 31% reflecting broad-based strength across products. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year," JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a prepared statement. FILE - This Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2016, file photo, shows a Chase bank branch in North Miami Beach, Fla. On Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, JPMorgan Chase & Co. reports financial results. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File) JPMorgan's investment bank division had a stellar quarter, reporting net income of $3.43 billion compared with $1.75 billion in the same period a year earlier. The bank's fixed income, currencies and commodities trading division reported a 31 percent jump in revenue, while stock trading had an 8 percent jump in revenue from the previous year. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. JPMorgan's consumer banking division, its largest business by revenue, had a sluggish quarter, reporting net income of $2.36 billion compared with $2.41 billion in the same period a year earlier. Most of the decline was tied into a drop in revenue from credit cards and auto loans. JPMorgan launched the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card last year, which became popular overnight. However, there were significant costs associated with the program. Overall revenue was $26.09 billion in the period. JPMorgan's adjusted revenue was $23.38 billion, which also beat Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $23.24 billion. JPMorgan shares have decreased slightly since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen slightly more than 1 percent. The stock has increased 46 percent in the last 12 months. _____ This story was partially generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.
