REUTERS/Jason Lee 26 May 2017 01:10AM (Updated: 26 May 2017 02:35AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail LONDON/HONG KONG: Record-breaking dollar bond sales from Chinese companies are steadily increasing China's weight in global indexes, raising concerns about overexposure among investors who track them. Corporates' rapid move onto offshore bond markets, partly a response to the crackdown on runaway credit growth at home, highlights China's multi-faceted indebtedness, a growing worry for investors. Overall debt is approaching 300 percent of annual economic output (GDP) and Moody's said it was the reason for cutting China's credit rating for the first time in 30 years. Stripping out maturing debt and coupon payments, year-to-date bond sales from companies in emerging markets total US$65 billion including US$54 billion from China, JPMorgan estimates. In gross issuance terms, almost half this year's emerging market corporate bond sales are from Chinese firms, the bank said. Company debt issuance in other emerging markets has been subdued by commodity and growth slumps. Some indexes cap the weight they give to each country but most are committed to broadly representing the market. Advertisement Advertisement This means that the indexes have to increase the weighting they give to China and investors whose portfolios track or benchmark an index must adjust accordingly. "It poses a challenge for global portfolios. You don't want to have too much of a good thing," said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at AllianzGlobal Investments. China today comprises around 20 percent of the Markit iBOXX emerging market corporate index versus 0.5 percent in 2007. In JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad index too, China is 21 percent, up from less than 4 percent in 2010, though in the iBoxx corporate dollar bond index which also includes developed countries and is dominated by U.S. names, China's weight remains around 0.8 percent. It has risen however from 0.074 percent five years ago. Chinese firms should this year easily surpass the US$108 billion debt raised in 2016 and US$116 billion in 2014. In 2010, just US$14 billion was issued. "It's just a juggernaut of issuance," said Guy Stear, co-head of fixed income research at Societe Generale in Paris. "It's so large that it's a game changer in terms of EM corporates... it's not just commodity companies, its cement, materials, internet companies, there's a broad range." The Chinese deals are mostly welcomed by money managers who need to invest the money pouring into their funds. Also, Chinese state-run firms still carry investment grade ratings, unlike issuers from many big emerging economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. "Relative to rating Chinese debt pays relatively decent yield...against that people are conscious that if you are running an EM credit fund you have very very high exposure to one part of the world," Stear said. ALLOCATION CONUNDRUM One popular solution for the allocation dilemma is "unconstrained" debt funds that are less committed to representing the market. Morningstar data showed 10 such funds focused on Asian fixed income were launched already this year by asset managers. More than 40 launched in 2016. "We are already seeing clients and investors wanting a diversified approach rather than just seeking exposure to a broad emerging market bond index," said Bryan Collins, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International in Hong Kong. Such funds can opt for less China exposure. Or they can delve down the credit curve and away from state-run firms whose close correlation with sovereign yields offers less prospect of outperformance, Collins said. Other commonly used indexes cap China's weight - JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad Diversified limits the weight each country can have, while Citigroup and Bloomberg have recently launched index variations capping China exposure. "We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8-10 percent," said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook noted that the US$400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the US$5.7 trillion outstanding in U.S. investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country's overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as US$28 trillion. COOLING DOWN Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody's rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody's downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs. But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies' total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan (US$797.36 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin. For investment-grade Chinese firms, dollar borrowing works out some 90 basis points cheaper than on domestic markets where interest rates have risen. The spread between JP Morgan's China index and onshore AA-rated corporate debt is at its widest in two years, this chart shows: http://tmsnrt.rs/2rxmkUI "If you are laden with debt, interest rates are rising and you need to roll over debt, you find the money wherever you can," Stephen Jen, CEO of Eurizon SLJ Capital, said.

 A bunch of cycling enthusiasts just helped Peloton Cycle raise $325 million — betting it could be 'the Apple of fitness' Matt Turner May 24, 2017, 5:40 PM 8,130 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson Peloton, the indoor-fitness company, has raised $325 million from investors including Wellington Management, Fidelity Investments, Kleiner Perkins, and Comcast NBCUniversal. The deal, likely to be the last financing round before the company goes public, was put together by a number of cycling enthusiasts. The company is on a steep-growth curve: It has tripled annual revenue, to $170 million, in just a year, and has 100,000 paying subscribers. Noah Wintroub picked up the phone and cold-called Peloton Cycle founder and CEO John Foley. A vice-chairman at JPMorgan, Wintroub had ordered a Peloton Cycle indoor bike. Convinced that Foley had built a great product, he wanted to get to know the company better. "If you've used the product, you get it, innately," Wintroub told Business Insider. "It's like 'Oh my god, these guys are the Apple of fitness.'" Fast forward 18 months or so, and Peloton Cycle closed a $325 million financing round, with the likes of Wellington Management, Fidelity Investments, Kleiner Perkins, and Comcast NBCUniversal pouring money into the company. JPMorgan was sole placement agent for the offering. Wintroub worked on the deal with another cycling enthusiast, Eric Stein, who is head of North American investment banking at JPMorgan. The Series E financing round valued the company at around $1.25 billion, making it a unicorn. Peloton Cycle is built around indoor cycling from the home. It has 22 showrooms around the country, and two studios — a flagship in Manhattan and a studio in Chicago. Customers can choose from a variety of live classes and archived classes. The bike costs $1,995, and unlimited classes cost $39 a month. Some Business Insider employees have tried the bike. The company is vertically integrated, making its own hardware, producing a tablet computer and the bike it sits on, and software, with 75 software engineers in New York City. It produces 12 hours of live television content a day, and sells through its own retail stores. It also delivers its own bikes in some cities. “Peloton is a cultural phenomenon and has redefined what it means to build a connected experience disrupting multiple industries simultaneously: in home fitness, boutique class fitness and connected media devices," said Jon Callaghan, cofounder of True Ventures, another investor in the firm. The new funds will go towards upping the number of retail stores it has, toward 40 by the end of the year, according to Foley, and extending in-house delivery to 10 markets, up from three right now. It also plans to sign a lease on a 30,000 square foot space in Midtown or Downtown Manhattan in the next few months, and to turn it into a fitness facility. "We believe Peloton is the leader in a new business that has significant potential – Physical Interactive Media,” Mary Meeker, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, said in a statement. The $325 million fundraiser was bigger than expected and included the sale of both primary equity, or new shares, and existing shares. Foley said he didn't expect there to be another placement, but that that didn't mean an initial public offering was on the immediate horizon. "We're very well capitalized to have options over the next several quarters," he told Business Insider.

Corporates’ rapid move onto offshore bond markets, partly a response to the crackdown on runaway credit growth at home, highlights China’s multi-faceted indebtedness, a growing worry for investors. Overall debt is approaching 300 percent of annual economic output (GDP) and Moody’s said it was the reason for cutting China’s credit rating for the first time in 30 years. Stripping out maturing debt and coupon payments, year-to-date bond sales from companies in emerging markets total $65 billion (£50.19 billion) including $54 billion from China, JPMorgan estimates. In gross issuance terms, almost half this year’s emerging market corporate bond sales are from Chinese firms, the bank said. Company debt issuance in other emerging markets has been subdued by commodity and growth slumps. Some indexes cap the weight they give to each country but most are committed to broadly representing the market. This means that the indexes have to increase the weighting they give to China and investors whose portfolios track or benchmark an index must adjust accordingly. “It poses a challenge for global portfolios. You don’t want to have too much of a good thing,” said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at AllianzGlobal Investments. China today comprises over 20 percent of the Markit iBOXX emerging market corporate index versus 0.5 percent in 2007. In JPMorgan’s CEMBI Broad index too, China is 21 percent, up from less than 4 percent in 2010, while in the iBoxx corporate dollar bond index which also includes developed countries, China has crept to 8 percent, from less than one percent five years ago. Chinese firms should this year easily surpass the $108 billion debt raised in 2016 and $116 billion in 2014. In 2010, just $14 billion was issued. “It’s just a juggernaut of issuance,” said Guy Stear, co-head of fixed income research at Societe Generale in Paris. “It’s so large that it’s a game changer in terms of EM corporates… it’s not just commodity companies, its cement, materials, internet companies, there’s a broad range.” The Chinese deals are mostly welcomed by money managers who need to invest the money pouring into their funds. Also, Chinese state-run firms still carry investment grade ratings, unlike issuers from many big emerging economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. “Relative to rating Chinese debt pays relatively decent yield…against that people are conscious that if you are running an EM credit fund you have very very high exposure to one part of the world,” Stear said. ALLOCATION CONUNDRUM One popular solution for the allocation dilemma is “unconstrained” debt funds that are less committed to representing the market. Morningstar data showed 10 such funds focused on Asian fixed income were launched already this year by asset managers. More than 40 launched in 2016. “We are already seeing clients and investors wanting a diversified approach rather than just seeking exposure to a broad emerging market bond index,” said Bryan Collins, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International in Hong Kong. Such funds can opt for less China exposure. Or they can delve down the credit curve and away from state-run firms whose close correlation with sovereign yields offers less prospect of outperformance, Collins said. Other commonly used indexes cap China’s weight – JPMorgan’s CEMBI Broad Diversified limits the weight each country can have, while Citigroup and Bloomberg have recently launched index variations capping China exposure. “We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8-10 percent,” said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook also noted that the $400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the $5.7 trillion outstanding in U.S. investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country’s overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as $28 trillion. COOLING DOWN Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody’s rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody’s downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs. But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies’ total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan ($797.36 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin estimates. For investment-grade Chinese firms, dollar borrowing works out some 90 basis points cheaper than on domestic markets where interest rates have risen. The spread between JP Morgan’s China index and onshore AA-rated corporate debt is at its widest in two years, this chart shows: http://tmsnrt.rs/2rxmkUI “If you are laden with debt, interest rates are rising and you need to roll over debt, you find the money wherever you can,” Stephen Jen, CEO of Eurizon SLJ Capital, said.

The below graph shows the trajectory of the stock over the past year. And it looks like there is plenty of growth still to come. JPMorgan has a December 2017 target of $1100 per share. Other analysts are even more bullish looking at a forecast of $1250 by year end. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth says: “We believe Amazon is well positioned as the market leader in ecommerce, where it’s still early days with U.S. ecommerce representing ~12% of adjusted retail sales (ex-gas, food, and autos). We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall ecommerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party vs. third-party inventory and its Prime offering both serve as major advantages.” So far this year Amazon stocks are up 32% already compared with the S&P 500’s 8% rise. The stock is also up 40% in the past 12 months. he growth in the share price means that Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos is now the road’s second richest person and could well become the richest man in the world if the stock continues to appreciate.

Corporates' rapid move onto offshore bond markets, partly a response to the crackdown on runaway credit growth at home, highlights China's multi-faceted indebtedness, a growing worry for investors. Overall debt is approaching 300 percent of annual economic output (GDP) and Moody's said it was the reason for cutting China's credit rating for the first time in 30 years. Stripping out maturing debt and coupon payments, year-to-date bond sales from companies in emerging markets total $65 billion including $54 billion from China, JPMorgan estimates. In gross issuance terms, almost half this year's emerging market corporate bond sales are from Chinese firms, the bank said. Company debt issuance in other emerging markets has been subdued by commodity and growth slumps. Some indexes cap the weight they give to each country but most are committed to broadly representing the market. This means that the indexes have to increase the weighting they give to China and investors whose portfolios track or benchmark an index must adjust accordingly. "It poses a challenge for global portfolios. You don't want to have too much of a good thing," said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at AllianzGlobal Investments. China today comprises around 20 percent of the Markit iBOXX emerging market corporate index versus 0.5 percent in 2007. In JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad index too, China is 21 percent, up from less than 4 percent in 2010, though in the iBoxx corporate dollar bond index which also includes developed countries and is dominated by U.S. names, China's weight remains around 0.8 percent. It has risen however from 0.074 percent five years ago. Chinese firms should this year easily surpass the $108 billion debt raised in 2016 and $116 billion in 2014. In 2010, just $14 billion was issued. "It's just a juggernaut of issuance," said Guy Stear, co-head of fixed income research at Societe Generale in Paris. "It's so large that it's a game changer in terms of EM corporates... it's not just commodity companies, its cement, materials, internet companies, there's a broad range." The Chinese deals are mostly welcomed by money managers who need to invest the money pouring into their funds. Also, Chinese state-run firms still carry investment grade ratings, unlike issuers from many big emerging economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. "Relative to rating Chinese debt pays relatively decent yield...against that people are conscious that if you are running an EM credit fund you have very very high exposure to one part of the world," Stear said. ALLOCATION CONUNDRUM One popular solution for the allocation dilemma is "unconstrained" debt funds that are less committed to representing the market. Morningstar data showed 10 such funds focused on Asian fixed income were launched already this year by asset managers. More than 40 launched in 2016. "We are already seeing clients and investors wanting a diversified approach rather than just seeking exposure to a broad emerging market bond index," said Bryan Collins, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International in Hong Kong. Such funds can opt for less China exposure. Or they can delve down the credit curve and away from state-run firms whose close correlation with sovereign yields offers less prospect of outperformance, Collins said. Other commonly used indexes cap China's weight - JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad Diversified limits the weight each country can have, while Citigroup and Bloomberg have recently launched index variations capping China exposure. "We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8-10 percent," said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook noted that the $400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the $5.7 trillion outstanding in U.S. investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country's overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as $28 trillion. COOLING DOWN Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody's rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody's downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs. But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies' total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan ($797.36 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin.

Take your FirstStep CORRECTED: Ballooning Chinese dollar borrowing a dilemma for index trackers LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Record-breaking dollar bond sales from Chinese companies are steadily increasing China's weight in global indexes, raising concerns about overexposure among investors who track them. By Sujata Rao and Saikat Chatterjee LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Record-breaking dollar bond sales from Chinese companies are steadily increasing China's weight in global indexes, raising concerns about overexposure among investors who track them. Corporates' rapid move onto offshore bond markets, partly a response to the crackdown on runaway credit growth at home, highlights China's multi-faceted indebtedness, a growing worry for investors. Overall debt is approaching 300 percent of annual economic output (GDP) and Moody's said it was the reason for cutting China's credit rating for the first time in 30 years. Stripping out maturing debt and coupon payments, year-to-date bond sales from companies in emerging markets total $65 billion including $54 billion from China, JPMorgan estimates. In gross issuance terms, almost half this year's emerging market corporate bond sales are from Chinese firms, the bank said. Company debt issuance in other emerging markets has been subdued by commodity and growth slumps. Some indexes cap the weight they give to each country but most are committed to broadly representing the market. This means that the indexes have to increase the weighting they give to China and investors whose portfolios track or benchmark an index must adjust accordingly. "It poses a challenge for global portfolios. You don't want to have too much of a good thing," said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at AllianzGlobal Investments. China today comprises around 20 percent of the Markit iBOXX emerging market corporate index versus 0.5 percent in 2007. In JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad index too, China is 21 percent, up from less than 4 percent in 2010, though in the iBoxx corporate dollar bond index which also includes developed countries and is dominated by U.S. names, China's weight remains around 0.8 percent. It has risen however from 0.074 percent five years ago. Chinese firms should this year easily surpass the $108 billion debt raised in 2016 and $116 billion in 2014. In 2010, just $14 billion was issued. "It's just a juggernaut of issuance," said Guy Stear, co-head of fixed income research at Societe Generale in Paris. "It's so large that it's a game changer in terms of EM corporates... it's not just commodity companies, its cement, materials, internet companies, there's a broad range." The Chinese deals are mostly welcomed by money managers who need to invest the money pouring into their funds. Also, Chinese state-run firms still carry investment grade ratings, unlike issuers from many big emerging economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. "Relative to rating Chinese debt pays relatively decent yield...against that people are conscious that if you are running an EM credit fund you have very very high exposure to one part of the world," Stear said. ALLOCATION CONUNDRUM One popular solution for the allocation dilemma is "unconstrained" debt funds that are less committed to representing the market. Morningstar data showed 10 such funds focused on Asian fixed income were launched already this year by asset managers. More than 40 launched in 2016. "We are already seeing clients and investors wanting a diversified approach rather than just seeking exposure to a broad emerging market bond index," said Bryan Collins, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International in Hong Kong. Such funds can opt for less China exposure. Or they can delve down the credit curve and away from state-run firms whose close correlation with sovereign yields offers less prospect of outperformance, Collins said. Other commonly used indexes cap China's weight - JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad Diversified limits the weight each country can have, while Citigroup and Bloomberg have recently launched index variations capping China exposure. "We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8-10 percent," said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook noted that the $400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the $5.7 trillion outstanding in U.S. investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country's overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as $28 trillion. COOLING DOWN Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody's rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody's downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs. But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies' total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan ($797.36 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin. For investment-grade Chinese firms, dollar borrowing works out some 90 basis points cheaper than on domestic markets where interest rates have risen.

Overall debt is approaching 300 percent of annual economic output (GDP) and Moody's said it was the reason for cutting China's credit rating for the first time in 30 years.Stripping out maturing debt and coupon payments, year-to-date bond sales from companies in emerging markets total $65 billion including $54 billion from China, JPMorgan estimates. In gross issuance terms, almost half this year's emerging market corporate bond sales are from Chinese firms, the bank said.Company debt issuance in other emerging markets has been subdued by commodity and growth slumps. Some indexes cap the weight they give to each country but most are committed to broadly representing the market.This means that the indexes have to increase the weighting they give to China and investors whose portfolios track or benchmark an index must adjust accordingly."It poses a challenge for global portfolios. You don't want to have too much of a good thing," said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at AllianzGlobal Investments.China today comprises around 20 percent of the Markit iBOXX emerging market corporate index versus 0.5 percent in 2007. In JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad index too, China is 21 percent, up from less than 4 percent in 2010, though in the iBoxx corporate dollar bond index which also includes developed countries and is dominated by U.S. names, China's weight remains around 0.8 percent. It has risen however from 0.074 percent five years ago.Chinese firms should this year easily surpass the $108 billion debt raised in 2016 and $116 billion in 2014. In 2010, just $14 billion was issued. "It's just a juggernaut of issuance," said Guy Stear, co-head of fixed income research at Societe Generale in Paris. "It's so large that it's a game changer in terms of EM corporates... it's not just commodity companies, its cement, materials, internet companies, there's a broad range."The Chinese deals are mostly welcomed by money managers who need to invest the money pouring into their funds. Also, Chinese state-run firms still carry investment grade ratings, unlike issuers from many big emerging economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. "Relative to rating Chinese debt pays relatively decent yield...against that people are conscious that if you are running an EM credit fund you have very very high exposure to one part of the world," Stear said. ALLOCATION CONUNDRUM One popular solution for the allocation dilemma is "unconstrained" debt funds that are less committed to representing the market. Morningstar data showed 10 such funds focused on Asian fixed income were launched already this year by asset managers. More than 40 launched in 2016."We are already seeing clients and investors wanting a diversified approach rather than just seeking exposure to a broad emerging market bond index," said Bryan Collins, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International in Hong Kong.Such funds can opt for less China exposure. Or they can delve down the credit curve and away from state-run firms whose close correlation with sovereign yields offers less prospect of outperformance, Collins said.Other commonly used indexes cap China's weight - JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad Diversified limits the weight each country can have, while Citigroup and Bloomberg have recently launched index variations capping China exposure. "We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8-10 percent," said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook noted that the $400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the $5.7 trillion outstanding in U.S. investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country's overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as $28 trillion.COOLING DOWN Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody's rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody's downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs.But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies' total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan ($797.36 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin. For investment-grade Chinese firms, dollar borrowing works out some 90 basis points cheaper than on domestic markets where interest rates have risen.The spread between JP Morgan's China index and onshore AA-rated corporate debt is at its widest in two years, this chart shows: tmsnrt.rs/2rxmkUI"If you are laden with debt, interest rates are rising and you need to roll over debt, you find the money wherever you can," Stephen Jen, CEO of Eurizon SLJ Capital, said.

"We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8-10 percent," said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook also noted that the $400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the $5.7 trillion outstanding in U.S. investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country's overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as $28 trillion. COOLING DOWN Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody's rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody's downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs. But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies' total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan ($797.36 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin estimates. For investment-grade Chinese firms, dollar borrowing works out some 90 basis points cheaper than on domestic markets where interest rates have risen. The spread between JP Morgan's China index and onshore AA-rated corporate debt is at its widest in two years, this chart shows: http://tmsnrt.rs/2rxmkUI "If you are laden with debt, interest rates are rising and you need to roll over debt, you find the money wherever you can," Stephen Jen, CEO of Eurizon SLJ Capital, said.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:15 AM, May 26, 2017 Updated: 1:50 AM, May 26, 2017 LONDON/HONG KONG - Record-breaking dollar bond sales from Chinese companies are steadily increasing China's weight in global indexes, raising concerns about overexposure among investors who track them. Corporates' rapid move onto offshore bond markets, partly a response to the crackdown on runaway credit growth at home, highlights China's multi-faceted indebtedness, a growing worry for investors. Overall debt is approaching 300 percent of annual economic output (GDP) and Moody's said it was the reason for cutting China's credit rating for the first time in 30 years. Stripping out maturing debt and coupon payments, year-to-date bond sales from companies in emerging markets total $65 billion including $54 billion from China, JPMorgan estimates. In gross issuance terms, almost half this year's emerging market corporate bond sales are from Chinese firms, the bank said. Company debt issuance in other emerging markets has been subdued by commodity and growth slumps. Some indexes cap the weight they give to each country but most are committed to broadly representing the market. This means that the indexes have to increase the weighting they give to China and investors whose portfolios track or benchmark an index must adjust accordingly. "It poses a challenge for global portfolios. You don't want to have too much of a good thing," said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at AllianzGlobal Investments. China today comprises over 20 percent of the Markit iBOXX emerging market corporate index versus 0.5 percent in 2007. In JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad index too, China is 21 percent, up from less than 4 percent in 2010, while in the iBoxx corporate dollar bond index which also includes developed countries, China has crept to 8 percent, from less than one percent five years ago. Chinese firms should this year easily surpass the $108 billion debt raised in 2016 and $116 billion in 2014. In 2010, just $14 billion was issued. "It's just a juggernaut of issuance," said Guy Stear, co-head of fixed income research at Societe Generale in Paris. "It's so large that it's a game changer in terms of EM corporates... it's not just commodity companies, its cement, materials, internet companies, there's a broad range." The Chinese deals are mostly welcomed by money managers who need to invest the money pouring into their funds. Also, Chinese state-run firms still carry investment grade ratings, unlike issuers from many big emerging economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. "Relative to rating Chinese debt pays relatively decent yield...against that people are conscious that if you are running an EM credit fund you have very very high exposure to one part of the world," Stear said. ALLOCATION CONUNDRUM One popular solution for the allocation dilemma is "unconstrained" debt funds that are less committed to representing the market. Morningstar data showed 10 such funds focused on Asian fixed income were launched already this year by asset managers. More than 40 launched in 2016. "We are already seeing clients and investors wanting a diversified approach rather than just seeking exposure to a broad emerging market bond index," said Bryan Collins, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International in Hong Kong. Such funds can opt for less China exposure. Or they can delve down the credit curve and away from state-run firms whose close correlation with sovereign yields offers less prospect of outperformance, Collins said. Other commonly used indexes cap China's weight - JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad Diversified limits the weight each country can have, while Citigroup and Bloomberg have recently launched index variations capping China exposure. "We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8-10 percent," said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook also noted that the $400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the $5.7 trillion outstanding in U.S. investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country's overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as $28 trillion. COOLING DOWN Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody's rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody's downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs. But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies' total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan ($797.36 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin estimates. For investment-grade Chinese firms, dollar borrowing works out some 90 basis points cheaper than on domestic markets where interest rates have risen. The spread between JP Morgan's China index and onshore AA-rated corporate debt is at its widest in two years, this chart shows: http://tmsnrt.rs/2rxmkUI "If you are laden with debt, interest rates are rising and you need to roll over debt, you find the money wherever you can," Stephen Jen, CEO of Eurizon SLJ Capital, said.

A subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that excels at finding patterns and making predictions, it used to be the preserve of technology firms. The financial industry has jumped on the bandwagon. To cite just a few examples, “heads of machine-learning” can be found at PwC, a consultancy and auditing firm, at JP Morgan Chase, a large bank, and at Man GLG, a hedge-fund manager. From 2019, anyone seeking to become a “chartered financial analyst”, a sought-after distinction in the industry, will need AI expertise to pass his exams. Despite the scepticism of many, including, surprisingly, some “quant” hedge funds that specialise in algorithm-based trading, machine-learning is poised to have a big impact. Innovative fintech firms and a few nimble incumbents have started applying the technique to everything from fraud protection to finding new trading strategies—promising to up-end not just the humdrum drudgery of the back-office, but the more glamorous stuff up-front.

Intelligent Voice, a British firm, sells its machine-learning-driven speech-transcription tool to large banks to monitor traders’ phone calls for signs of wrongdoing, such as insider trading. Other specialists, like Xcelerit or Kinetica, offer banks and investment firms near-real-time tracking of their risk exposures, allowing them to monitor their capital requirements at all times. Machine-learning excels in spotting unusual patterns of transactions, which can indicate fraud. Firms ranging from startups such as Feedzai (for payments) or Shift Technology (for insurance) to behemoths such as IBM are offering such services. Some are developing the skills in-house. Monzo, a British banking startup, built a model quick enough to stop would-be fraudsters from completing a transaction, bringing the fraud rate on its pre-paid cards down from 0.85% in June 2016 to less than 0.1% by January 2017. Natural-language processing, where AI-based systems are unleashed on text, is starting to have a big impact in document-heavy parts of finance. In June 2016 JPMorgan Chase deployed software that can sift through 12,000 commercial-loan contracts in seconds, compared with the 360,000 hours it used to take lawyers and loan officers to review the contracts. Machine-learning is also good at automating financial decisions, whether assessing creditworthiness or eligibility for an insurance policy. Zest Finance has been in the business of automated credit-scoring since its founding in 2009. Earlier this year it rolled out a machine-learning underwriting tool to help lenders make credit decisions, even for people with little conventional credit-scoring information. It sifts through vast amounts of data, such as people’s payment history or how they interact with a lender’s website. Lemonade, a tech-savvy insurance startup, is using machine-learning both to sell insurance policies and to manage claims. Perhaps the newest frontier for machine-learning is in trading, where it is used both to crunch market data and to select and trade portfolios of securities. The quantitative-investment strategies division at Goldman Sachs uses language processing driven by machine-learning to go through thousands of analysts’ reports on companies. It compiles an aggregate “sentiment score” based on the balance of positive to negative words. This score is then used to help pick stocks. Goldman has also invested in Kensho, a startup that uses machine-learning to predict how events like natural disasters will affect market prices, based on data on similar events. Quantifiable progress Quant hedge funds, both new and old, are piling in. Castle Ridge Asset Management, a Toronto-based upstart, has achieved annual average returns of 32% since its founding in 2013. It uses a sophisticated machine-learning system, like those used to model evolutionary biology, to make investment decisions. It is so sensitive, claims the firm’s chief executive, Adrian de Valois-Franklin, that it picked up 24 acquisitions before they were even announced (because of telltale signals suggesting a small amount of insider trading). Man AHL, meanwhile, a well-established $18.8bn quant fund provider, has been conducting research into machine-learning for trading purposes since 2009, and using it as one of the techniques to manage client money since 2014. So it seems odd that some prominent quant funds are machine-learning sceptics. Martin Lueck of Aspect Capital finds the technique overrated, saying his firm has found only limited useful applications for it. David Siegel, co-founder of Two Sigma, a quant behemoth, and David Harding of Winton Capital, have also argued that the techniques are overhyped. In other fields, however, machine-learning has game-changing potential. There is no reason to expect finance to be different. According to Jonathan Masci of Quantenstein, a machine-learning fund manager, years of work on rules-based approaches in computer vision—telling a computer how to recognise a nose, say—were swiftly eclipsed in 2012 by machine-learning processes that allowed computers to “learn” what a nose looked like from perusing millions of nasal pin-ups. Similarly, says Mr Masci, a machine-learning algorithm ought to beat conventional trading strategies based on rules set by humans. The real vulnerability may in any case lie outside trading. Many quant funds depend on human researchers to sift through data and build algorithms. These posts could be replaced by better-performing machines. For all their professed scepticism, Two Sigma and its peers are busy recruiting machine-learning specialists.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 25, 2017 11:45am   Comments Share: Related PVH Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For May 25, 2017 The Market In 5 Minutes Nasdaq, S&P 500 Open At New Highs; Netflix Gets Target Hike (Investor's Business Daily) Reviewing PVH Corp (NYSE: PVH)'s first-quarter results, JPMorgan said the company achieved a retail rarity with its beat and raise quarter. The firm upgraded the shares of the company and also lifted its price target. Giving the rationale for its upgrade, JPMorgan said: The deep-dive in Calvin Klein would translate into double-digit top-line growth for five-plus years. China is a material top and bottom-line opportunity for Tommy Hilfiger. No improvement is expected in the North American landscape through 2019. Strong balance sheet provides optionality. Q1 Print Analyst Matthew Ross, Grace Smalley, Anne Samuel and Steven Zaccone noted that the company reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.65 compared to the consensus estimate of $1.60, driven by 5 percent constant currency top-line growth and 178 basis point-expansion in margins. Outlook JPMorgan noted that the company raised its 2017 earnings per share guidance to $7.40–$7.50 from the previous $7.30–$7.40. The firm clarified that the high end of the management's second-quarter guidance suggests 10-percent earnings per share growth in the first half of 2017 and implying similar growth rate in the second half, despite suggesting a 1,440-basis-point sequential step-down in 2016 second-half growth. Multi-year, the firm sees increased visibility to a sustainable double-digit bottom-line profile at PVH, as forex headwinds abate, with the combination of Calvin Klein's Europe self-help story and early innings Tommy China growth opportunity. This, according to the firm, equates to a compounding low-double-digit+ EPS growth story despite modeling North American revenues at negative low-single-digits through fiscal year 2019. As such, JPMorgan upgraded shares of PVH to Overweight from Neutral and lifted its price target to $125 from $116. At the time of writing, shares of PVH were rallying 5.20 percent to $107.35.

Corporates' rapid move onto offshore bond markets, partly a response to the crackdown on runaway credit growth at home, highlights China's multi-faceted indebtedness, a growing worry for investors. Overall debt is approaching 300 percent of annual economic output (GDP) and Moody's said it was the reason for cutting China's credit rating for the first time in 30 years. Stripping out maturing debt and coupon payments, year-to-date bond sales from companies in emerging markets total $65 billion including $54 billion from China, JPMorgan estimates. In gross issuance terms, almost half this year's emerging market corporate bond sales are from Chinese firms, the bank said. Company debt issuance in other emerging markets has been subdued by commodity and growth slumps. Some indexes cap the weight they give to each country but most are committed to broadly representing the market. This means that the indexes have to increase the weighting they give to China and investors whose porftolios track or benchmark an index must adjust accordingly. "It poses a challenge for global portfolios. You don't want to have too much of a good thing," said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at AllianzGlobal Investments. China today comprises over 20 percent of the Markit iBOXX emerging market corporate index versus 0.5 percent in 2007. In JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad index too, China is 21 percent, up from less than 4 percent in 2010, while in the iBoxx corporate dollar bond index which also includes developed countries, China has crept to 8 percent, from less than one percent five years ago. Chinese firms should this year easily surpass the $108 billion debt raised in 2016 and $116 billion in 2014. In 2010, just $14 billion was issued. "It's just a juggernaut of issuance," said Guy Stear, co-head of fixed income research at Societe Generale in Paris. "It's so large that it's a game changer in terms of EM corporates... it's not just commodity companies, its cement, materials, internet companies, there's a broad range." The Chinese deals are mostly welcomed by money managers who need to invest the money pouring into their funds. Also, Chinese state-run firms still carry investment grade ratings, unlike issuers from many big emerging economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. "Relative to rating Chinese debt pays relatively decent yield...against that people are conscious that if you are running an EM credit fund you have very very high exposure to one part of the world," Stear said. ALLOCATION CONUNDRUM One popular solution for the allocation dilemma is "unconstrained" debt funds that are less committed to representing the market. Morningstar data showed 10 such funds focused on Asian fixed income were launched already this year by asset managers. More than 40 launched in 2016. "We are already seeing clients and investors wanting a diversified approach rather than just seeking exposure to a broad emerging market bond index," said Bryan Collins, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International in Hong Kong. Such funds can opt for less China exposure. Or they can delve down the credit curve and away from state-run firms whose close correlation with sovereign yields offers less prospect of outperformance, Collins said. Other commonly used indexes cap China's weight - JPMorgan's CEMBI Broad Diversified limits the weight each country can have, while Citigroup and Bloomberg have recently launched index variations capping China exposure. "We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8-10 percent," said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook also noted that the $400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the $5.7 trillion outstanding in U.S. investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country's overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as $28 trillion. COOLING DOWN Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody's rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody's downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs. But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies' total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan ($797.36 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin estimates. For investment-grade Chinese firms, dollar borrowing works out some 90 basis points cheaper than on domestic markets where interest rates have risen. The spread between JP Morgan's China index and onshore AA-rated corporate debt is at its widest in two years, this chart shows: http://tmsnrt.rs/2rxmkUI "If you are laden with debt, interest rates are rising and you need to roll over debt, you find the money wherever you can," Stephen Jen, CEO of Eurizon SLJ Capital, said.

A gauge of expected price swings in developing-nations exchange rates is near the lowest level since 2014, unruffled by the political turmoil in the US and Brazil, and concern over China’s growing debt pile that led to a cut in its credit rating. The Federal Reserve looks set to raise interest rates in June, while the European Central Bank may also take steps toward unwinding stimulus. “This is a goldilocks environment for EM FX markets, though volatility looks too low ahead of ECB and the Fed,” Viraj Patel, a London-based foreign-exchange strategist at ING, said by email. “Both central banks could lead with changes to their respective balance sheet policies and this could create a perfect storm at the long-end of global markets.” While European Central Bank officials have been debating when and how to start paring stimulus and increase rates, researchers at the authority warned last month that emerging markets should brace for increased volatility as the world’s major central banks adjust the size of their balance sheets. Still, a JPMorgan Chase & Co index of implied volatility has resumed declines after rebounding from a 30-month low reached on May 16. Patel’s scepticism isn’t shared by money managers and strategists at Aberdeen Asset Management, Amundi Asset Management and Mizuho Bank Ltd. The slow pace of borrowing-cost increases in developed markets and improving economies for many emerging countries will continue to draw yield-hungry investors to riskier assets, some of them say. “With EM current accounts now at their best level in almost 10 years on average, we expect the environment to remain accommodative even if Fed continues to normalise interest rate,” said Abbas Ameli-Renani, Global EM Strategist at Amundi in London. “Historical observations show that as EM current-account balances improve, the sensitivity of their assets to developed-market interest rates declines.” Bad headline For Edwin Gutierrez, the London-based head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Asset, the possible moves by the Fed and the ECB “are pretty much well telegraphed.” “It’s gonna take some pretty hawkish commentary to spook the market,” he said. The stability seen in emerging-market currencies has a lot to do with “the dollar’s weakness as the Trump reflation trade is unwound,” he said. Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s May 2-3 gathering released Wednesday pointed toward a hike as soon as the meeting in mid-June. However, the dollar weakened as FOMC voters added the caveat that “it would be prudent” to wait for evidence that a recent slowdown in economic activity had been transitory. The JPMorgan volatility gauge has slipped 44 basis points so far this week, after climbing 64 basis points last week, the most since November. Ken Cheung, a Hong Kong-based currency strategist at Mizuho, also cited the “collapsing” Trump trade while predicting that swings in emerging-market currencies may narrow further. “The foreign-exchange market also digested Fed’s plan to deliver three rate hikes and shrink its balance sheet,” he said. Even so, the somewhat muted market reaction to China’s rating downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service Wednesday seems to affirm Patel’s view. “China is one of the many global tail risks out there — Trumpeachment, geopolitics, potential end of global monetary easing are others to consider,” he said. “The message from markets is that we are aware of these risks, but we need to see an escalation of any one of these before becoming overly concerned. This is a risky strategy — you’re just one bad headline away from getting caught out.” More from Markets World stocks hit record as Fed signals caution UAE banks allowing foreign ownership at ADX up Damac invites shareholders to general assembly Bitcoin inflates bubble fears Egypt raises $3b in bumper Eurobond sale Gold steady as Fed minutes weigh on dollar Big bang for traders will be more soft launch Dubai stock traders resort to profit-taking tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNChina follow this tag on MGNBrazil follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsMarkets tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGNBrazil follow this tag on MGN+ MGNforex Also In MarketsWorld stocks hit record as Fed signals caution Business Gallery Doors open to a three-day super sale Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Waha Capital expands private debt business 02Not ready to invest in Pakistani stocks 03Bodoor Al Qasimi is WEF regional council chair Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Dragon Mart has latest and cheapest iPads Mar 03, 2011 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 1Image Pictures: Apple Store at Mall of the Emirates Oct 27, 2015 2Images China’s home-grown C919 passenger jet takes off May 05, 2017 International Commodity Prices Error - No Data As on 2017-05-26 01:10:13 Most Popular on Gulf News 7 killed, 35 injured in horrific Dubai bus crash Ramadan school timings announced Private sector working hours announced When can the UAE expect Ramadan?

Oil near one-month high as investors await OPEC outcome Oil holds gain as data show US supplies fall   London - OPEC may be celebrating an historic deal to extend supply cuts, but after the party, the organisation will face a trio of questions it left unanswered. Will the lucrative yet delicate relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia survive the life of the agreement? Will surging US shale output prove too much temptation for OPEC countries to stick to their own production promises? And, perhaps most perplexing: What does OPEC have planned long-term? The deal to maintain the cut another nine months, hammered out this week in Vienna, could expire in March with a return to OPEC’s pump-at-will policy that prevailed between 2014 and 2016 and pushed prices below $30 a barrel. Or the organization could keep adjusting production. “What concerns me is that there is no clear messaging around the exit strategy,” Ebele Kemery, head of energy investing at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV. “The way we look at the market going forward, there’s going to be oversupply in 2018. They’re talking about price stability. To get price stability we need to know what the end-game is.” Kemery’s concern over a lack of strategy appeared to be widespread. Brent crude fell 5% to $51.24 a barrel on the decision, wiping out most of the gains since Russia and Saudi Arabia publicly backed the nine-month extension last week. Futures in London slid 25 cents to $51.21 a barrel at 12:35 Singapore time, heading for a weekly decline. New floor Despite an admission that November’s landmark agreement to limit output failed to eliminate the global oil glut, the commitment of two-dozen oil-producing countries did succeed in establishing a new floor for prices that’s well above the lows seen last year. “OPEC is settling in for the long haul,’’ said Roger Diwan, an OPEC watcher at consultant IHS Markit in Washington. “I think we’ll remain between $50 and $60 a barrel for the time being.’’ The agreement, which includes countries accounting for 60% of the world’s oil production, has already delivered for national budgets from Moscow to Tehran, as higher prices outweighed lower production. “This is a historic deal, it already was in November and now still more,’’ said Jan Stuart, chief energy economist at Credit Suisse Group. “Now we have more confidence of a 2017 rebalance.’’ The extension to March prolongs a rare period of collaboration between the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some of its biggest rivals. The last time both sides worked together was 15 years ago. Back then, the agreement fell apart soon after it was made. Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, said the relationship between OPEC and non-members of the cartel was at a “pivotal moment.’’ Shifting calculus The calculus may shift in 2018, testing the increasingly close cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia, according to Ronald Smith, senior oil analyst at Citigroup Inc. in Moscow. It may not be in the best interest of Vladimir Putin’s balance sheet to keep new oilfields on the shelf. The lost revenue would be felt mostly by state-owned Rosneft on projects scheduled to ramp up production in 2018 and 2019. “Rosneft, the state-owned champion, will have invested a lot of money in these fields that will be sitting idle if they continue to extend the agreement,’’ Smith said. “The math is going to be more ambiguous going forward. At some point they may decide they need to take back some market share.’’ Also a contender in the battle for market share - and producers who didn’t sign on to the Vienna agreement - are US shale drillers, who could benefit from this week’s deal. Higher inventories Resurgent US production has meant oil inventories remain well above the level targeted by OPEC ministers. Analysts at energy consultant Wood MacKenzie said the deal extension would help U.S. shale oil output accelerate to its fastest growth rate in years. In 2018, global oil inventories would increase by about 600 000 barrels a day in the first quarter, followed by about 500 000 each quarter for the rest of the year. “There’s still an oversupply to wrestle with,” said Simon Flowers, chief analyst at the consultant. Even so, after more than two years of flip-flopping from market management to pump-at-will and back again, it’s not clear what OPEC will do next. As recently as March, the production ceiling was envisaged as a short-term prop to rapidly bring a glut of global oil inventories back to historically typical levels. In March, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih told an industry conference in Houston that the kingdom’s policy was to manage output “for a restricted period of time, with the aim of accelerating rebalancing, and then allowing the free market to work.” That is exactly what some fear, and Al-Falih did not dispel those concerns on Thursday, telling Bloomberg, “This is not a structural intervention.’’ With the deal agreed to, Al-Falih said he expected OPEC to achieve its goal of returning global oil inventories to their five-year average by the end of the year. He reiterated a pledge “to do whatever it takes” to rebalance the market. If Al-Falih’s optimistic outlook is correct, OPEC may not need a clear exit strategy. “The exit strategy for OPEC is, eventually, when the market is tight enough, start to cheat on the cuts,’’ said Gary Ross, global head of oil at PIRA Energy Group, part of S&P Global.

From manipulating LIBOR, a benchmark interest rate, to rigging the daily fix of foreign-exchange (FX) rates, traders have shown themselves ready not just to stretch the rules, but to collude in outright illegality. A global code of conduct for the FX market, unveiled on May 25th, aims to put things on a sounder footing. Drawn up over the past two years by a coalition of central bankers, known as the FX Working Group (FXWG), and supported by a panel of industry participants, the code’s 55 principles lay down international standards on a range of practices, from the handling of confidential information to the pricing and settlement of deals.

Roughly $5trn is traded every day (see chart). Many companies, pension funds and money managers depend on banks to hedge their exposure to currency fluctuations. Yet in the past traders colluded with one another in internet chat rooms, secretly swapping client data in order to rig the widely used WM/Reuters benchmark exchange rates. Some were caught and fired. Banks such as Citigroup, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS paid billions of dollars in fines. The FX market has always been lightly regulated, but many countries do have codes of conduct, usually drafted by the central bank in consultation with market participants. Often, however, the codes were defective: they missed areas vulnerable to malpractice; and were rarely updated, scantily enforced and widely flouted. The new code starts with some advantages. It will supersede the national codes, and provide a single global set of principles, with adherence closely monitored by a newly formed committee of central bankers and trading institutions. It is also designed to reflect current market practice, with clear guidelines on communication between participants and on trade-execution practices—two areas of weakness highlighted by the scandal. Managers of FX traders will now be enjoined to limit access to confidential information, and to ensure that clear guidance has been given on approved channels of communication. Greater disclosure is also demanded on how orders are processed, so that clients will never lose oversight and control of their trades. The code will, however, be voluntary. Guy Debelle of the Reserve Bank of Australia, who led the drafting, reckons that to write binding rules for a global market would have been more convoluted and less effective. Principles, he argues, are harder to exploit or ignore than rules. Alongside the code itself, the FXWG has developed a blueprint for adoption, which makes those active in the market responsible for embedding the code in their day-to-day operations. Central banks have committed themselves to leading by example, by implementing the code for their own FX activities. Consideration is being given to maintaining public registers of those who have signed up. “I wouldn’t underestimate the impact of peer pressure in improving behaviour,” says Mr Debelle. Given the painfully low level of trust in foreign-exchange and other financial markets, central bankers are adamant that codes like these must not be ignored or allowed to become outdated. The new global FX committee will monitor the success of the project and consider the case for further updates. But the incentives for adherence do not seem compelling. Whether the code actually prevents market malfeasance will be determined by the many institutions, large and small, that trade FX each day. And, as the market has proved in the past, it is important not to underestimate the power of peer pressure to worsen behaviour as well as improve it.

What went unnoticed -- and is largely unknown -- is how important Blackstone is to the Kushner family company. Schwarzman, right, with Trump at the White House on April 11. Photographer: Olivier Douliery/Pool via Bloomberg Since 2013, Blackstone has loaned more than $400 million to finance four Kushner Cos. deals -- two of which have not been reported -- making it one of the business’s largest lenders. And their ties go beyond the loans. Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone’s co-founder and chief executive officer, heads Trump’s business-advisory council and was in Riyadh with the president and Kushner. The Saudi promise to invest in Blackstone’s fund drove the firm’s stock up more than 8 percent. A Blackstone spokeswoman, Christine Anderson, said the company began talks with the Saudis a year ago, “well before President Trump was even his party’s nominee.” Blackstone is one of the largest non-bank real-estate lenders, and corporate deals are often announced during state visits. A spokesman for Kushner Cos. declined to comment. But the sequence of the deals and the intertwined personal relationships of the principals raise concerns about conflicts of interest. Schwarzman, one of the world’s richest businessmen, is a Republican and, like Trump, a resident of New York and Palm Beach. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and Kushner’s wife, was an investor in a fund Blackstone created in 2010 to seed hedge funds, according to financial disclosures. Kushner has divested some of his assets to family members, and the White House says he’ll recuse himself when necessary. (Separately, the Washington Post reported in an unrelated matter Thursday, citing people familiar with the investigation, that Kushner is now a subject of the FBI probe into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Jamie Gorelick, an attorney for Kushner, told the Post that her client has cooperated with a congressional investigation into the matter and “will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.”) Advisory Panel Schwarzman’s advisory panel -- which also includes General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra, Tesla Inc. co-founder and CEO Elon Musk and JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon -- isn’t subject to ethics rules. Meanwhile, whether there are links among the arms deal, the Saudi investment and the loans, future steps will seem fraught. Schwarzman’s relationship with Trump is echoed in the next generation. Jon Gray, Blackstone’s global head of real estate, met with Trump when the president-elect was interviewing candidates for Treasury secretary even though he supported Hillary Clinton. Jared Kushner and Jon Gray. Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg Gray, 47, and Kushner, 36, have known each other for at least four years. They both had much to celebrate in March 2013 at the anniversary party for the New York Observer, a newspaper the Kushners own. Gray was coming off a year that saw Blackstone close on $13.3 billion of capital pledges for what was then the world’s biggest private-equity real-estate fund. He had been named to the Blackstone board, a sign he was being groomed for the top job at Schwarzman’s company.  ‘25 to Watch’ Days earlier, the Observer named Gray among “25 to Watch” for its annual list of “100 Most Influential New Yorkers.” The paper has often heaped praise on those with whom its owners might do business, and the recommendation to watch Gray was prescient. Shares in Blackstone doubled in 2013, thanks in large part to Gray’s real-estate deals. These included the December 2013 initial public offering of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., which became the most profitable private-equity deal on record, and would later play a key role in Blackstone’s search for investors outside the U.S., notably in China.  All of this was happening as Blackstone was quietly financing two Kushner endeavors. In June 2013, Kushner and CIM Group, a Los Angeles-based real-estate investor, bought an office building in Manhattan’s financial district. Though documents filed with New York show Deutsche Bank AG issued the group an $88 million loan for the property at 2 Rector St., Blackstone was also among the project’s lenders, according to a person familiar with the transaction. CIM and Kushner repaid the loan in full in March 2016 with the roughly $225-million sale of the property to investors, including Cove Property Group and Bentall Kennedy. Undisclosed Partners A similar arrangement enabled Kushner Cos.’ purchase of five Jehovah’s Witnesses warehouse and printing buildings that October. Documents show Natixis Real Estate Capital loaned Kushner’s consortium $249 million for the deal. Again, Blackstone was among the undisclosed partners. The buildings, in the Brooklyn neighborhood known as Dumbo -- the acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass -- were the first step in realizing Jared Kushner’s dream of a new business hub for startups and technology companies. The Witnesses’ headquarters, famous for its red “WATCHTOWER” sign, wouldn’t come until later. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Last August, Kushner Cos. and its partners bought the building with $376 million in loans from a limited liability company controlled by Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc. The deal came a few weeks after Trump briefly eclipsed Clinton in the polls. Kushner, still in his role as CEO, announced plans to transform the property “into one of the marquee urban office campuses anywhere in the country, let alone New York City.” The future success of the development is far from certain, as large office tenants still haven’t warmed to Brooklyn, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. Kushner Cos. will begin looking for companies to move into the Watchtower building soon. Purchasing Power Two things are more certain. First, the Saudis were very happy with the arms sale. Second, Blackstone’s securing the pledge from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund moves the company closer to its goal of having more than $100 billion of purchasing power for infrastructure projects, an asset type where private investment has been limited by lengthy planning and permitting processes. Thanks to the Saudi boost, Blackstone shares are once again above their initial public offering price of $31 after slumping two years ago. That means Schwarzman, as well as having Trump’s ear, has about $500 million more in net worth. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Will the lucrative yet delicate relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia survive the life of the agreement? Will surging US shale output prove too much temptation for Opec countries to stick to their own production promises? And, perhaps most perplexing: What does Opec have planned long-term? The deal to maintain the cut another nine months, hammered out this week in Vienna, could expire in March with a return to Opec’s pump-at-will policy that prevailed between 2014 and 2016 and pushed prices below US$30 (RM128) a barrel. Or the organisation could keep adjusting production. “What concerns me is that there is no clear messaging around the exit strategy,” Ebele Kemery, head of energy investing at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV. “The way we look at the market going forward, there’s going to be oversupply in 2018. They’re talking about price stability. To get price stability we need to know what the end-game is.” Kemery’s concern over a lack of strategy appeared to be widespread. Brent crude fell 5 per cent to US$51.24 a barrel on the decision, wiping out most of the gains since Russia and Saudi Arabia publicly backed the nine-month extension last week. New floor Despite an admission that November’s landmark agreement to limit output failed to eliminate the global oil glut, the commitment of two-dozen oil-producing countries did succeed in establishing a new floor for prices that’s well above the lows seen last year. “Opec is settling in for the long haul,” said Roger Diwan, an Opec watcher at consultant IHS Markit Ltd in Washington. “I think we’ll remain between US$50 and US$60 a barrel for the time being.” The agreement, which includes countries accounting for 60 per cent of the world’s oil production, has already delivered for national budgets from Moscow to Tehran, as higher prices outweighed lower production. “This is a historic deal, it already was in November and now still more," said Jan Stuart, chief energy economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. “Now we have more confidence of a 2017 rebalance.” The extension to March prolongs a rare period of collaboration between the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some of its biggest rivals. The last time both sides worked together was 15 years ago. Back then, the agreement fell apart soon after it was made. Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, said the relationship between Opec and non-members of the cartel was at a “pivotal moment.” Shifting calculus The calculus may shift in 2018, testing the increasingly close cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia, according to Ronald Smith, senior oil analyst at Citigroup Inc. in Moscow. It may not be in the best interest of Vladimir Putin’s balance sheet to keep new oilfields on the shelf. The lost revenue would be felt mostly by state-owned Rosneft PJSC on projects scheduled to ramp up production in 2018 and 2019. “Rosneft, the state-owned champion, will have invested a lot of money in these fields that will be sitting idle if they continue to extend the agreement,” Smith said. “The math is going to be more ambiguous going forward. At some point they may decide they need to take back some market share.’’ Also a contender in the battle for market share — and producers who didn’t sign on to the Vienna agreement — are US shale drillers, who could benefit from this week’s deal. Higher inventories Resurgent US production has meant oil inventories remain well above the level targeted by Opec ministers. Analysts at energy consultant Wood MacKenzie said the deal extension would help US shale oil output accelerate to its fastest growth rate in years. In 2018, global oil inventories would increase by about 600,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, followed by about 500,000 each quarter for the rest of the year. “There’s still an oversupply to wrestle with,” said Simon Flowers, chief analyst at the consultant. Even so, after more than two years of flip-flopping from market management to pump-at-will and back again, it’s not clear what Opec will do next. As recently as March, the production ceiling was envisaged as a short-term prop to rapidly bring a glut of global oil inventories back to historically typical levels. In March, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih told an industry conference in Houston that the kingdom’s policy was to manage output “for a restricted period of time, with the aim of accelerating rebalancing, and then allowing the free market to work.” That is exactly what some fear, and Al-Falih did not dispel those concerns yesterday, telling Bloomberg, “This is not a structural intervention.” With the deal agreed to, Al-Falih said he expected Opec to achieve its goal of returning global oil inventories to their five-year average by the end of the year. He reiterated a pledge “to do whatever it takes” to rebalance the market. If Al-Falih’s optimistic outlook is correct, Opec may not need a clear exit strategy. “The exit strategy for Opec is, eventually, when the market is tight enough, start to cheat on the cuts,” said Gary Ross, global head of oil at PIRA Energy Group, part of S&P Global Inc. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week AirAsia's Fernandes says 'foolish' not to consider C919 Big drop in US oil stocks finally on the way, traders say Oil slump hits Asian energy stocks, sterling slides Ringgit opens higher against greenback US jobless claims edge up, trade deficit widens Singapore court fines ex-broker for corruption in 1MDB probe IRB hits Magnum, subsidiary with RM476m penalty Chinese automaker Geely takes 49.9pc stake in Proton Bank Negara’s MyClear merges with MEPS to form PayNet Chinese carmaker Geely to acquire Malaysia’s Proton, sources say Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album When a hunter becomes the hunted ‘War for the Planet of the Apes’ gets new TV spot Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Oil prices fall on White House proposal to sell US oil reserves Budget pressure likely to keep Saudis propping up oil price Oil rises on expectation of extended, possibly deepened output cut Oil climbs above US$50 as Opec seen prolonging curbs next week Opec panel looking at deepening, extending oil cuts, sources say Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

At about 2.25 percent, 10-year yields are plumbing 2017 lows, following a rally Wednesday as the central bank signaled an imminent rate hike but also a gradual approach to shrinking its massive bond portfolio. Banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut year-end yield forecasts this month, while maintaining calls for more tightening. The underlying message: While the economy may be robust enough to warrant further Fed moves, the bond-market forces that drove yields to record lows last year are still intact. The story isn’t playing out as expected this year, as investors and analysts navigate a slew of forces beyond just the path of short-term rates -- faltering inflation data, waning confidence in Donald Trump’s agenda, haven demand and a growing conviction that the bond market will smoothly digest the transition to a smaller Fed balance sheet. “Our expectation is the Treasury market is priced appropriately for muted inflation and muted growth for the rest of the year,” said Rich Piccirillo, a portfolio manager at Prudential Financial Inc.’s fixed-income business, PGIM Fixed Income, which oversees $654 billion. Yet “you’re going to need more disappointing data than just a couple weak inflation CPI prints to move them off of hiking in June. The FOMC’s desire is to normalize policy.” Here’s what’s depressing yields even with the Fed seemingly bent on tightening. Trump Trade The so-called Trump trade that drove financial markets for months is close to dead as gridlock grips Washington. The 10-year breakeven rate, which gauges market expectations for inflation over the next decade, is close to the lowest since November. That’s a sure sign that bond-market bets on faster growth and inflation -- inspired by the prospect of tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending at a time when unemployment was already plunging -- have mostly run their course. “The new reality is the growth forecasts are probably a little bit tamer than they were at the beginning of the year,” said Gemma Wright-Casparius, a senior money manager at Vanguard Group Inc., which oversees about $4 trillion. “That markdown and the inflation reassessment story is what is really starting to push down the yield forecasts.” Haven On Earth Lately, the decline in yields has also reflected day-to-day revelations about the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. After a memo written by former FBI director James Comey surfaced last week alleging that the president asked him to drop an investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Treasuries rallied the most since July, Bloomberg Barclays index data show. “You have a bit of a crisis of confidence over Trump getting through a lot of the deregulation, the fiscal stimulus and tax reform -- which has now been pushed to the back burner as a result of the headwinds with Russia and the FBI,” said Nick Maroutsos, portfolio manager at Janus Capital Group, which oversees about $200 billion. “The natural buying from offshore will put a cap on yields.” Loading Other Articles...

Will the lucrative yet delicate relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia survive the life of the agreement? Will surging U.S. shale output prove too much temptation for OPEC countries to stick to their own production promises? And, perhaps most perplexing: What does OPEC have planned long-term? The deal to maintain the cut another nine months, hammered out this week in Vienna, could expire in March with a return to OPEC’s pump-at-will policy that prevailed between 2014 and 2016 and pushed prices below $30 a barrel. Or the organization could keep adjusting production. “What concerns me is that there is no clear messaging around the exit strategy,” Ebele Kemery, head of energy investing at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV. “The way we look at the market going forward, there’s going to be oversupply in 2018. They’re talking about price stability. To get price stability we need to know what the end-game is.” JPMorgan’s Kemery and Bloomberg’s David Wethe discuss a reported extension of OPEC production cuts (Source: Bloomberg) Kemery’s concern over a lack of strategy appeared to be widespread. Brent crude fell 5 percent to $51.24 a barrel on the decision, wiping out most of the gains since Russia and Saudi Arabia publicly backed the nine-month extension last week. Futures in London slid 25 cents to $51.21 a barrel at 12:35 p.m. Singapore time, heading for a weekly decline. New Floor Despite an admission that November’s landmark agreement to limit output failed to eliminate the global oil glut, the commitment of two-dozen oil-producing countries did succeed in establishing a new floor for prices that’s well above the lows seen last year. “OPEC is settling in for the long haul,’’ said Roger Diwan, an OPEC watcher at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. in Washington. “I think we’ll remain between $50 and $60 a barrel for the time being.’’ The agreement, which includes countries accounting for 60 percent of the world’s oil production, has already delivered for national budgets from Moscow to Tehran, as higher prices outweighed lower production. “This is a historic deal, it already was in November and now still more,’’ said Jan Stuart, chief energy economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. “Now we have more confidence of a 2017 rebalance.’’ The extension to March prolongs a rare period of collaboration between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some of its biggest rivals. The last time both sides worked together was 15 years ago. Back then, the agreement fell apart soon after it was made. Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, said the relationship between OPEC and non-members of the cartel was at a “pivotal moment.’’ Shifting Calculus The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The calculus may shift in 2018, testing the increasingly close cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia, according to Ronald Smith, senior oil analyst at Citigroup Inc. in Moscow. It may not be in the best interest of Vladimir Putin’s balance sheet to keep new oilfields on the shelf. The lost revenue would be felt mostly by state-owned Rosneft PJSC on projects scheduled to ramp up production in 2018 and 2019. “Rosneft, the state-owned champion, will have invested a lot of money in these fields that will be sitting idle if they continue to extend the agreement,’’ Smith said. “The math is going to be more ambiguous going forward. At some point they may decide they need to take back some market share.’’ Also a contender in the battle for market share -- and producers who didn’t sign on to the Vienna agreement -- are U.S. shale drillers, who could benefit from this week’s deal. Higher Inventories Resurgent U.S. production has meant oil inventories remain well above the level targeted by OPEC ministers. Analysts at energy consultant Wood MacKenzie said the deal extension would help U.S. shale oil output accelerate to its fastest growth rate in years. In 2018, global oil inventories would increase by about 600,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, followed by about 500,000 each quarter for the rest of the year. “There’s still an oversupply to wrestle with,” said Simon Flowers, chief analyst at the consultant. Even so, after more than two years of flip-flopping from market management to pump-at-will and back again, it’s not clear what OPEC will do next. As recently as March, the production ceiling was envisaged as a short-term prop to rapidly bring a glut of global oil inventories back to historically typical levels. In March, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih told an industry conference in Houston that the kingdom’s policy was to manage output “for a restricted period of time, with the aim of accelerating rebalancing, and then allowing the free market to work.” That is exactly what some fear, and Al-Falih did not dispel those concerns on Thursday, telling Bloomberg, “This is not a structural intervention.’’ With the deal agreed to, Al-Falih said he expected OPEC to achieve its goal of returning global oil inventories to their five-year average by the end of the year. He reiterated a pledge “to do whatever it takes” to rebalance the market. If Al-Falih’s optimistic outlook is correct, OPEC may not need a clear exit strategy. “The exit strategy for OPEC is, eventually, when the market is tight enough, start to cheat on the cuts,’’ said Gary Ross, global head of oil at PIRA Energy Group, part of S&P Global Inc.

"That markdown and the inflation reassessment story is what is really starting to push down the yield forecasts." 'Crisis of confidence' Lately, the decline in yields has also reflected day-to-day revelations about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. After a memo written by former FBI director James Comey surfaced last week alleging that the president asked him to drop an investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Treasuries rallied the most since July, Bloomberg Barclays index data show. "You have a bit of a crisis of confidence over Trump getting through a lot of the deregulation, the fiscal stimulus and tax reform — which has now been pushed to the back burner as a result of the headwinds with Russia and the FBI," said Nick Maroutsos, portfolio manager at Janus Capital Group, which oversees about $US200 billion. "The natural buying from offshore will put a cap on yields." Financial conditions have actually eased since the Fed lifted rates in March, helping limit upward pressure on yields. Goldman Sachs economists say the looser conditions are a reason for the Fed to do more, and they expect policy makers to boost rates by a quarter-point three to four times annually through 2019. For many investors and analysts, the drop in yields this year comes back to the forces that have sustained the three-decade bond bull market time and again. With the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank still buying debt, US yields are among the highest worldwide. Couple that with an aging global population that craves fixed income, plus sovereign governments running up budget deficits, and it's little surprise that growth — and, by extension, bond yields — have muddled along at such low levels. Gradual balance sheet drawdown "There's a difference between good growth and good enough growth for the Fed to move," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. "I'm not backing off that the Fed is going to continue, yet I don't necessarily think that rates are going to rise as much now as I thought going into the year." He cut his forecast in May for 10-year yields, to 2.8 per cent at year-end from 3.2 per cent. And then there's the matter of the Fed's $US4.5 trillion balance sheet, amassed amid efforts to support the economy. The gap between two- and 10-year yields narrowed after this week's release of minutes from the Fed's latest meeting, which shed some light on plans to unwind the stash of debt. The takeaway for investors: Officials discussed a system of rolling caps that will keep the drawdown gradual. The aim, according to the minutes, is to mitigate the fallout in financial markets and avoid roiling long-term rates. "This portfolio unwind will very much be a slow, gradual and most importantly a methodical process," wrote Walter Schmidt, senior vice president of structured products at FTN Financial.

Jones in her photo on her LinkedIn page. BY LINCOLN ANDERSON | The 60-year-old woman fatally struck by a private garbage truck on Tues., May 16, at Eighth St. and Sixth Ave., was an Ivy League-educated financial adviser and broker and a founding member of the W. Eighth St. Block Association. As of last week’s Villager deadline, police had not yet released the victim’s name pending family notification. Fern B. Jones lived at Nine W. Eighth St., near Fifth Ave. — a little less than a block away from where she was horrifically crushed by the carting truck. Jones is listed as having financial businesses registered at Apartment No. 2 at Nine W. Eighth St. Her LinkedIn page lists her as having been president since 2005 of FJ Co, a company that “enhances portfolios.” Her jobs before that included director of portfolio management at MetLife, senior investment analyst for global fixed income for General Motors Asset Management, and mortgage analyst and a trader/risk manager at JPMorgan Chase. Jones received a bachelor of arts from Yale in 1981 and a master’s degree in management and finance from M.I.T. in 1998. Members were informed of Jones’s death in a message on Mon., May 22, from Laurie Moody, secretary of the W. Eighth St. Block Association, on behalf of its co-chairpersons, Cormac Flynn and Carol Wilson. “We remember Fern as a good friend and valued community member, who worked hard to improve the quality of life on our block,” the e-mail said, in part. “She will be greatly missed here.” Sharon Woolums recalled Jones as “a very sweet, intelligent member of the block association. I saw Fern recently and am shocked by the news,” she said. The private carting-company truck that fatally struck longtime W. Eighth St. resident Fern B. Jones on Sixth Ave. Tuesday evening. Photo by C4P Jones’s sister Ruth told the block association that Fern will be buried in Virginia on Memorial Day weekend and that the family is planning a memorial in New York this summer. Following the publication of a brief article about Jones’s death in last week’s Villager, a spokesperson for M&M Sanitation Corp. reached out to say the truck was going just 4 miles per hour when it hit Jones. A Police Department spokesperson said she could not definitively answer how fast the truck was going at the time of the incident, and that the department’s Collision Investigation Squad was still investigating. The New York Post reported Jones was crossing Sixth Ave. at W. Eighth St. when, according to witnesses, she was struck, then dragged and crushed under the tires of the mammoth garbage rig. Police said she had been trying to cross from the north side of W. Eighth St. to the south side.

Huge public companies still prospered this past year despite wild swings between market uncertainty and volatility, punctuated by unexpected political outcomes. Load Error The 2017 Global 2000 is bigger and more valuable in the aggregate than last year’s list, with higher sales, profits, assets and market values. The list as a whole is significantly more valuable from the year prior, with aggregate market capitalization up 10%. Here’s how we crunched the numbers Despite slowing GDP figures, China and the U.S., whose companies make up more than 40% of the list, continue to dominate the top 10 list with financial giants including No. 1 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and No. 4 JPMorgan Chase. China’s two-year stronghold of the top 3 spots was disrupted this year with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway snagging the third spot, another signal that U.S. companies didn’t suffer terribly from market uncertainty that defined the year, as Berkshire owns many other American staple stocks. The Forbes Global 2000 ranking is based on a composite score from equally weighted measures of revenue, profits, assets and market value. The 2017 list features public companies from 58 countries that together account for $35.3 trillion in revenue, $2.5 trillion in profit, $169.1 trillion of assets and have a combined market value of $48.8 trillion. All four metrics are up from the 2016 ranking, with market capitalization up 10% from last year. Despite a slowing of the global IPO market, several newly public companies debuted on this year’s list. The biggest newcomer at No. 55 is Postal Savings Bank of China. The September 2016 IPO was the year’s largest, worth $8.1 billion. In the U.S., the most high-profile company to enter the list was Snap. The company’s $24 billion market cap helped earn a spot at No. 1,693. U.S. companies account for the most members of the list, 565, followed by China and Hong Kong, which is home to 263 Global 2000 companies. The world’s biggest companies have gotten bigger, more profitable and more valuable in the past year. Fifty-eight countries were represented, down from last year’s 62 with Cyprus, Kazakhstan, Romania and Malta no longer boasting companies on the list. It wasn’t a good year for energy companies that fought against rock-bottom petroleum prices. Exxon Mobil fell four spots to No. 13, PetroChina fell off the top 10 to No. 102, and Chevron slipped to No. 359 from last year’s No. 28 position.  One big gainer this year is Charter Communications (No. 107), which climbed 677 spots by buying Time Warner,  No. 214 last year,  knocking it off the list. General Electric climbed 54 spots to No. 13 and No. 83 Amazon broke into the top 100 from its previous rank of No. 237. Alibaba also moved up the list to No. 140. Some major names absent from the list were either acquired by another company or performed poorly and ranked under the No. 2,000 position. Notable drop-offs include SABMiller, which was acquired by No. 126 Anheuser-Busch InBev. Western Digital bought No. 1,266 SanDisk and Marriott acquired Starwood Hotels & Resorts which was No. 1,214 last year. Chipotle, which suffered a terrible stock price after their food poisoned customers, also fell off the list. Casino giant Caesars Entertainment Corp., No. 1,198 last year, got knocked off too.See the complete Forbes Global 2000 list here    Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Alts Equities ETF Ecosystem Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Smart Beta Channel Search Smart Beta ETFs Continue to Gain Traction May 25, 2017 at 1:34 pm by Todd Rosenbluth By Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA What percentage of average actively managed large cap strategies outperformed the Russell 1000 US Comprehensive Factor index? How about the MSCI USA Diversified Multiple Factor index? While those phrases are not being regularly written, perhaps even inside FTSE Russell and MSCI offices, a recent survey of global institutional investors indicates adoption of such smart beta benchmarks is becoming more accepted. FTSE Russell released this week the results of its early 2017 survey of almost 200 asset institutions, with a combined assets under management of $2 trillion about their investments in and views toward smart beta indices. To us, the trends were favorable, as 46% of global respondents said they had a smart beta product allocation. More compelling to us was that half of the global institutions that had previously evaluated but not implemented smart beta strategies were reevaluating in 2017. While pricing for smart beta ETFs in the US has come down recently and the products had longer life histories to consider, the majority of respondents pointed to increased understanding through new information and education as well as new types of smart beta strategies, including multi factor ones. Indeed, there are a variety of multi-factor products to consider even connected to the same index provider. For example, O’Shares FTSE US Quality Dividend ETF (OUSA) tracks a FTSE Russell index constructed based on three factors (dividends, quality and low volatility), while JPMorgan Diversified Return US Equity ETF (JPUS) tracks a FTSE Russell index based on four, not identical, factors (quality, low volatility, value, momentum). Lastly, Deutsche X-Trackers Russell 1000 Comprehensive Factor ETF (DEUS) tracks a different index from the same family and incorporates five factors (quality, low volatility, size, momentum and value). In ranking more than 1,000 equity ETFs, CFRA focuses more on the underlying holdings and costs than its longer-term track record. The exposure and performance of these three ETF are different, evidenced by JPUS’s 8.4% year to date gain outperforming both OUSA and DEUS by more than 170 basis points. Naturally, other ETF providers are not ceding this still emerging investment approach and have either partnered with other index providers or launched their own multi factor products. For example, PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD) and Legg Mason Low Volatility High Dividend (LVHD) combine dividends and low volatility attributes in one product, with the Powershares product connected to S&P index and Legg Mason developing their own. Meanwhile, iShares Edge MSCI MultiFactor USA (LRGF) tracks an MSCI index focused on quality, value, momentum and size, and LRGF and Franklin LibertyQ US Equity (FLQL) tracks a proprietary index focused on quality, value, momentum and low volatility. Separately, in North America, 57% of respondents think smart beta indices are an appropriate benchmark for an active strategy, up from 39% that thought so a year earlier. To us, even as institutions increasingly look to assess and utilize rules-based strategies as a replacement for active ones, the possibility of actively managed offerings being compared to the performance of something other than a market cap weighted S&P 500 or Russell 1000 index grows. So don’t be surprised if in the near future, the popular SPIVA scorecard is augmented with a multi-factor benchmark that combines factor frequently used by active managers. CFRA reports on the above and other smart beta ETFs can be found on this platform. Todd Rosenbluth is Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research at CFRA.

Known as the Durbin Amendment, the measure was included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to limit how much money banks can charge retailers when consumers use their debit cards. While House Republicans have proposed a bill to rip up most of Dodd-Frank, they’ve concluded that they don’t have the votes to pass the legislation as long as it includes a repeal of Durbin, said two congressional aides with direct knowledge of the matter. The decision to leave the debit-fee cap in place likely clears the way for a full House vote on the Dodd-Frank overhaul as soon as next month, said the aides. Bloomberg News The decision on Durbin is a victory for the retail industry, which has spent millions of dollars lobbying politicians. The issue has always been a sensitive one for lawmakers, many of whom are loath to pick sides in a fight between powerful corporations such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Members of Congress generally want cordial relations, and campaign contributions, from both industries. Debit-card fees are set by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., but most of the money goes to banks. The provision that mandated the fee cap, which is named after Democratic Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, has cost lenders an estimated $9 billion, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The bill to revamp Dodd-Frank’s post-financial crisis reforms was written by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, and included the repeal of the fee cap. Hensarling’s panel approved the legislation earlier this month, but he has faced resistance from other GOP lawmakers over the Durbin amendment. Hensarling said on Wednesday he would remove the provision. When House Republicans held an internal vote count this week, they found that scrapping Durbin would derail Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act, said the aides who asked not to be named because the vote was private. House Republicans are eager to move the bill forward, as removing constraints that Dodd-Frank imposed on the finance industry is a top goal that is shared by President Donald Trump. Administration officials have repeatedly blamed Dodd-Frank for curtailing lending and economic growth. “I’ve said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans,” Hensarling said in a statement. “We won’t let this one provision hinder passage of an important-priority bill that will end bank bailouts and help renew economic growth for all Americans.” "We welcome today’s news that Congress is listening," said Cicely Simpson, executive vice president at the National Restaurant Association. While other aspects of Dodd-Frank get more attention -- such as the Volcker Rule restriction on banks’ trading -- repealing Durbin has been one of the finance industry’s top priorities in Washington for years. The American Bankers Association, a lobbying group, pledged to keep fighting over the issue despite Wednesday’s setback. “This is unfortunate, but certainly not the end of this debate," James Ballentine, an ABA executive vice president said in a memo sent to banks. The group will “continue to work with and educate members who are interested in removing this language.” Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Group Inc., predicted the battle between retailers and banks is far from over, which he said is good news for lawmakers. “This is a great issue to fund-raise off of given how much it matters to banks, credit unions and merchants," Seiberg said in a note. Banks will continue to lobby for a removal of the cap and retailers may push for it to be expanded to include credit cards, he added. Regardless of what happens in the House, Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act faces long odds in the Senate, where most bills need some Democratic support to pass. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this month that he’s not optimistic Congress will overhaul Dodd-Frank because of a lack of Democratic votes. The bill is H.R. 10.

Hackers have been able to steal credit card and personal information from major companies like JPMorgan and Home Depot. As a result, cybersecurity has become more necessary, and instead of developing a dedicated department within a company, most opt to hire a third-party cybersecurity firm. What is interesting here is that many investors think cybersecurity is the next area in technology that needs real consolidation. The May 15 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest moves in the selected cybersecurity stocks were mixed. FireEye Inc. (NASDAQ: FEYE) saw its short interest decrease to 32.09 million shares from the previous reading of 33.40 million. Shares were last seen at $15.17, in a 52-week trading range of $10.35 to $18.42. The short interest at CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CYBR) increased to 2.08 million shares from the previous level of 1.98 million. Shares were trading at $49.36, within a 52-week range of $42.73 to $59.28. Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.’s (NASDAQ: CHKP) short interest barely increased to 5.19 million shares from with the previous reading of 5.18 million. Shares were trading at $110.54, in a 52-week range of $74.34 to $111.24. The number of Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE: PANW) shares short was not updated this period. The previous level was 7.82 million. Shares were trading at $118.32, within a 52-week range of $107.31 to $165.69. Fortinet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: FTNT) short interest decreased slightly to 5.62 million shares from its previous reading of 5.64 million. Shares were trading at $40.05, in a 52-week trading range of $28.51 to $41.33.

Republicans Say No by Elizabeth Dexheimer More stories by Elizabeth Dexheimer and Billy House @HouseInSession More stories by Billy House May 24, 2017, 7:56 PM EDT May 25, 2017, 12:41 PM EDT House said to strip contentious measure from Dodd-Frank revamp Durbin amendment has cost lenders an estimated $9 billion Wal-Mart and other retailers have beat back the finance industry’s latest lobbying campaign to let banks charge stores higher fees when customers use debit cards, according to two congressional aides with direct knowledge of the matter. House Republicans have been working on legislation to kill off key parts of the Dodd-Frank banking reform law, which imposed restrictions on Wall Street in the aftermath of the financial crisis. While banks dislike many aspects of the 2010 law, they have particular disdain for a provision known as the Durbin amendment that limits swipe fees, saying the caps have cost them billions of dollars in lost revenue. But the fee cap is a boon for retailers, which have repeatedly told lawmakers that consumers will be hurt if it’s removed. House GOP leaders have concluded they don’t have the votes to overhaul Dodd-Frank if their bill includes a repeal of Durbin, the two aides said. The decision to leave the debit-fee cap in place likely clears the way for a full House vote on the Dodd-Frank revamp as soon as next month, the aides said. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up The decision on Durbin is a victory for the retail industry, which has spent millions of dollars lobbying politicians. The issue has always been a sensitive one for lawmakers, many of whom are loath to pick sides in a fight between powerful corporations such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Members of Congress generally want cordial relations, and campaign contributions, from both industries. $9 Billion Debit-card fees are set by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., but most of the money goes to banks. The provision that mandated the fee cap, which is named after Democratic Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, has cost lenders an estimated $9 billion, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The bill to revamp Dodd-Frank’s post-financial crisis reforms was written by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, and included the repeal of the fee cap. Hensarling’s panel approved the legislation earlier this month, but he has faced resistance from other GOP lawmakers over the Durbin amendment. Hensarling said on Wednesday he would remove the provision. When House Republicans held an internal vote count this week, they found that scrapping Durbin would derail Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act, said the aides who asked not to be named because the vote was private. House Republicans are eager to move the bill forward, as removing constraints that Dodd-Frank imposed on the finance industry is a top goal that is shared by President Donald Trump. Administration officials have repeatedly blamed Dodd-Frank for curtailing lending and economic growth. Contentious Provision “I’ve said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans,” Hensarling said in a statement. “We won’t let this one provision hinder passage of an important-priority bill that will end bank bailouts and help renew economic growth for all Americans.” While other aspects of Dodd-Frank get more attention -- such as the Volcker Rule restriction on banks’ trading -- repealing Durbin has been one of the finance industry’s top priorities in Washington for years. The American Bankers Association, a lobbying group, pledged to keep fighting over the issue despite Wednesday’s setback. “This is unfortunate, but certainly not the end of this debate," James Ballentine, an ABA executive vice president said in a memo sent to banks. The group will “continue to work with and educate members who are interested in removing this language.” Fundraising Issue Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Group Inc., predicted the battle between retailers and banks is far from over, which he said is good news for lawmakers. “This is a great issue to fund-raise off of given how much it matters to banks, credit unions and merchants," Seiberg said in a note. Banks will continue to lobby for a removal of the cap and retailers may push for it to be expanded to include credit cards, he added. Regardless of what happens in the House, Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act faces long odds in the Senate, where most bills need some Democratic support to pass. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this month that he’s not optimistic Congress will overhaul Dodd-Frank because of a lack of Democratic votes. The bill is H.R. 10.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman CIT Announces Preliminary Results of Cash Tender Offer for Up To $2,750,000,000 of its Common Stock NEW YORK, May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CIT Group Inc. (NYSE: CIT) today announced the preliminary results of its "modified Dutch auction" tender offer, which expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on May 24, 2017. Based on the preliminary count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, a total of approximately 65.8 million shares of CIT's common stock were properly tendered and not properly withdrawn at or below a purchase price of $48.00 per share, including approximately 27.4 million shares that were tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer and based on the preliminary count by the depositary, CIT expects to accept for payment, at a purchase price of $48.00, approximately 57.3 million shares properly tendered at or below the purchase price and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date, at an aggregate cost of approximately $2,750,000,000, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer. CIT expects to accept the shares on a pro rata basis, except for tenders of "odd lots," which will be accepted in full, and has been informed by the depositary that the preliminary proration factor for the tender offer is approximately 88.2%. The shares expected to be purchased represent approximately 28.3% of CIT's common stock issued and outstanding as of May 23, 2017. The number of shares expected to be purchased in the tender offer, the per share and total purchase prices and the proration factor are based on the assumption that all shares tendered through notice of guaranteed delivery will be delivered within the prescribed three trading day settlement period.

The 2017 Global 2000 is bigger and more valuable in the aggregate than last year's list, with higher sales, profits, assets and market values. The list as a whole is significantly more valuable from the year prior, with aggregate market capitalization up 10%. Here's how we crunched the numbers. Despite slowing GDP figures, China and the U.S., whose companies make up more than 40% of the list, continue to dominate the top 10 list with financial giants including #1 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and #4 JPMorgan Chase. China’s two-year stronghold of the top 3 spots was disrupted this year with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway snagging the third spot, another signal that U.S. companies didn’t suffer terribly from market uncertainty that defined the year, as Berkshire owns many other American staple stocks. View photos The FORBES Global 2000 ranking is based on a composite score from equally-weighted measures of revenue, profits, assets and market value. The 2017 list features public companies from 58 countries that together account for $35.3 trillion in revenue, $2.5 trillion in profit, $169.1 trillion of assets, and have a combined market value of $48.8 trillion. All four metrics are up from the 2016 ranking, with market capitalization up 10% from last year. Despite a slowing of the global IPO market, several newly-public companies debuted on this year's list.  The biggest newcomer at No. 55 is Postal Savings Bank of China. The September 2016 IPO was the year’s largest, worth $8.1 billion. In the U.S., the most high-profile company to enter the list was Snap Inc. The company’s $24 billion market cap helped earn a spot at No. 1693. U.S. companies account for the most members of the list, 565, followed by China and Hong Kong, which is home to 263 Global 2000 companies. The world’s biggest companies have gotten bigger, more profitable and more valuable in the past year. 58 countries were represented, down from last year's 62 with Cyprus, Kazakhstan, Romania and Malta no longer boasting companies on the list. It wasn’t a good year for energy companies that fought against rock-bottom petroleum prices. Exxon Mobil fell 4 spots to #13, PetroChina fell off the top 10 to #102, and Chevron slipped to#359 from last year's #28 position. View photos globe-indonesia-equator-80467More Read More One big gainer this year is Charter Communications (#107), which climbed 677 spots by buying Time Warner, #214 last year,  knocking it off the list. General Electric climbed 54 spots to #13 and #83 Amazon broke into the top 100 from its previous rank of #237. Alibaba also moved up the list to #140. Some major names absent from the list were either acquired by another company or performed poorly and ranked under the #2000 position. Notable drop-offs include SABMiller, which was acquired by #126 Anheuser-Busch InBev. Western Digital bought #1266 SanDisk and Marriot acquired Starwood Hotels & Resorts which was #1214 last year. Chipotle, which suffered a terrible stock price after their food poisoned customers, also fell off the list. Casino giant Caesars Entertainment Corporation, #1198 last year, got knocked off too.   See Forbes Global 2000 List Here   List Credits Edited by: Halah Touryalai and Corinne Jurney Reporters: Antoine Gara, Lauren Gensler, Maggie McGrath, Kristin Stoller, Ashlea Ebeling, Grace L.

Six months later, the “Trump trade” is over Written by Eshe Nelson Obsession "America First" May 25, 2017 So long! (Reuters/Yuri Gripas) Share Written by Eshe Nelson Obsession "America First" May 25, 2017 “I think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that’s my fault because people have confidence in me.” —Donald J. Trump, April 2017 Within a month of Donald Trump boasting about markets having too much confidence in him, the dollar had erased all the gains it made after the president’s momentous election victory in November. To be fair, currency traders were never as pumped by Trump as stock traders were. Trump’s pledge to cut taxes, spend big on infrastructure, and slash regulation sent stock markets surging to record highs—the “Trump trade,” as it came to be known. The dollar rose along with stocks, at first. Before too long, though, traders started to question if Trump could achieve any of his policy goals. The White House has been mired in scandal and infighting from day one; even two interest rate hikes by the Fed couldn’t sustain the dollar’s value. Last week, it looked like the stock markets were also starting to lose faith in Trump. The S&P 500 and Dow indexes dropped almost 2% on May 17—their worst day in eight months—after a memo by the former director of the FBI alleged that Trump was trying to influence an investigation into his campaign’s relationship with Russia. Stocks haven’t tumbled like the dollar has, but they have traded in a relatively tight range over the past two months:   Was last week’s blip a sign that equity investors have only recently realized that bullish forecasts based on Trump’s promised reforms may be problematic? Is this the end of the Trump trade? No. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and BlackRock all say that the Trump trade was already over, well before the recent wobble. Economists at Goldman Sachs have once again lowered their expectations for US fiscal policy changes in the next year, and note that market expectations are even lower. The four charts below show that traders no longer expect much, if any, tax reform, infrastructure spending, or deregulation any time soon. (Goldman Sachs) The top two charts show the relative performance of a basket of high-tax stocks (left) and infrastructure stocks (right) versus the S&P 500 index. Immediately after Trump’s election victory, these stocks gained more than others on expectations of favorable policy changes, specifically plans to slash the corporate tax rate and spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. In March, this outperformance began to wane as traders began to doubt Trump could deliver on his promises following a failed first attempt to pass a health care bill. The lower left-hand chart uses a Goldman Sachs model as a benchmark to show how the outperformance of bank stocks after the election has been erased in the past few months. The lower right-hand chart, finally, shows a measure of bond market inflation expectations—called a five-year, five-year forward inflation rate—returning to its pre-election level. Trump’s aggressive policies were expected to stoke inflation after years of subdued price growth in developed countries. The fall in this rate “suggests that the market may have now mostly priced out expectations of the broader macroeconomic effects of the Trump agenda as well,” Goldman analyst Alec Phillips wrote. Bottom-up vs. top-down So if the Trump trade is over, why is the S&P 500 still 12% higher than it was before the election? The index closed at a new record high yesterday, after all. Trump inherited not only a strong US economy, but also a strengthening global economy. The best set of quarterly corporate earnings in more than five years is a major factor pushing the stock market higher. According to Mike Bell, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, the market has already given up hope of US fiscal stimulus because “most people are skeptical that it’s going to be delivered.” What matters now are earnings, he said. Large US companies are benefitting from a weaker dollar because it boosts the value of overseas earnings. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the stocks that generate the majority of their revenues outside the US have returned more to investors in the past six months than more domestically focused firms. Trump’s “America First” rhetoric initially inspired investors to bet on smaller, US-focused companies. Look out below The dollar could have further to fall, as investors increasingly eye juicier returns outside of the US. After market-friendly centrist Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker, won the French presidential election, traders are focusing on the increasingly positive economic story in Europe in particular. Investors have been loading up on the euro and other European assets in recent weeks. And now, with drastically lowered expectations for a US fiscal boost, stocks have little to lose if Trump’s proposed reforms continue to falter, but plenty to gain if he unexpectedly fulfills some of his pledges. Analysts at the BlackRock Investment Institute, part of the world’s largest asset manager, said last week that the “Trump equity trade” is over but “reflation trades” are still on, as the US economy grows slightly above trend. Last week’s short-lived burst of panic shows how little impact Trump’s volatile administration is having on markets these days. To see what it looks like when investors really factor political instability into their financial forecasts, turn to Brazil.

Quotes in the article Exxon Mobil Corp XOM ▼ 81.75 -0.54 -0.66% Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDS.B ▼ 56.29 -0.62 -1.09% RUMAH, Saudi Arabia—To understand the deep bonds between Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and the country’s royal family, consider a $55-plus million project the state oil giant recently completed on an empty expanse of desert north of Riyadh. It includes a mosque, a children’s camp and a museum. Broad boulevards with solar-powered streetlamps lead to gleaming white grandstands at the complex’s centerpiece—a stage for Saudi Arabia’s most prestigious camel beauty contest. In a country with limited industrial capability, Saudi Aramco, as the oil company is known, was one of the few firms that could build the project in time for the springtime pageant, an event cherished by King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. “Within 50 days, they made this city,” said Badah Alsubaie, a camel-complex official. The kingdom wants to list a minority of Aramco’s shares in what could be the world’s largest-ever initial public offering, planned for the second half of 2018. First, however, the company needs to be separated from the kingdom. The kingdom’s oil company and its gargantuan cash flow drove the development of modern Saudi Arabia. In addition to being the engine of the national economy, Aramco is a core part of the government apparatus, so much so that some Aramco employees call their employer the “Ministry of Aramco.” Yet many potential investors say that, to be valued on a footing with publicly traded peers such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Aramco will need to present financial statements showing the company is independent, and that its profits aren’t subsidizing pavilions for camel beauty pageants or other Saudi budget items. “I’d much rather have a simple, straightforward company that specializes in that area of the market than one that might go off in other directions,” says Paul Mumford, a fund manager who invests in energy stocks for Cavendish Asset Management. Load Error The company and the kingdom are so deeply enmeshed that, a year into IPO preparations, company and government officials are still wrestling with how to untangle them, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former Aramco executives, government officials and outside advisers, as well as corporate and government documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The IPO is crucial to the ambitions of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who wants to invest the proceeds in other industries to make Saudi Arabia’s economy less reliant on oil. Saudi Aramco said in a statement it has “initiated a multi-phased program to define our relationship with our stakeholders for the future.” The company said it couldn’t answer certain specific questions about IPO preparation due to concerns about complying with stock-exchange regulations ahead of the offering. Saudi Aramco’s chairman, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, said in a March interview that Aramco is “ring-fenced financially” from the state, with governance comparable to multinationals. Yet people familiar with the behemoth’s finances say that it is often unclear even to some officials high up in the company whether Aramco has been reimbursed in full for projects, and how the reimbursement process works. Discussing the desert construction complex, a Saudi Aramco spokesman said in an emailed statement the company “was fully reimbursed for its costs relating to this event.” Aramco, which contributes over 70% of government revenues, has a range of roles beyond infrastructure building, including economic planning. It also provides heavily discounted fuel to support companies and consumers with inexpensive power.

A spokesman for Aramco said that “its sales within the Kingdom are regulated by the government.” Saudi Electricity Company, the third-largest nonfinancial company in the kingdom, said in 2015 it owed some 73.7 billion riyals ($19.7 billion) to the government and Aramco for fuel it received from Aramco since 2000. Aramco owns 6.9% of the company. That fuel allows Saudi citizens and businesses to buy electricity at a discount. Two people with knowledge of Aramco’s finances say Saudi Electricity still hasn’t paid Aramco for the fuel. Saudi Arabian Mining Company, the sixth-largest nonfinancial company, disclosed in 2016 that one of its biggest competitive advantages was access to “quality phosphate rock and molten sulphur from Saudi Aramco.” An Aramco spokesman said the sulphur “is a byproduct of operations and is sold on a commercial basis.” The company that became Aramco started in 1933 as a joint venture between the Saudi government and Standard Oil Company of California, and for years was largely U.S.-run. Control shifted to Saudis through the 1960s and ‘70s; in 1980, the government became Aramco’s outright owner through a deal it struck with its U.S. partner. As the world’s thirst for oil grew, Aramco kept pace, and has accounted for more than 10% of global oil production in recent years. The company broadened its expertise from tapping and managing the world’s biggest oil reservoirs to shipping and processing crude into more-valuable products. Aramco now has joint ventures with multinationals including Exxon Mobil and Dow Chemical Co. Its profits built the modern Saudi state almost from scratch. In 1968, Saudi Arabia’s gross domestic product was less than $4.2 billion, according to World Bank data, and a Saudi born that year could expect to live less than 51 years. In 2015, Saudi GDP was $646 billion, and life expectancy reached nearly 75 years. Aramco took on infrastructure projects including roads, hospitals and schools, and provided a host of social and economic programs: interest-free housing loans, funding for U.S.-bound students and malaria eradication. The company said its construction projects are part of a “program of corporate citizenship” that has included “national capacity building, training, schools and education.” In addition, the company said it has “also undertaken infrastructure projects at the request of the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia” for which it said it received “due compensation.” Other people with direct knowledge of Aramco’s finances dispute that, saying the company hasn’t been reimbursed for some projects built at the government’s request. Untangling the paybacks is difficult, says a person involved in the process, because the government and Aramco sometimes deal with compensation as part of the negotiation of Aramco’s annual payments to the government. In 2006, then-King Abdullah ordered up Saudi Arabia’s first coed university for an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion. An Aramco spokesman says “the government bore the substantial majority of the costs” for the project, and that the government reimbursed Aramco for building a $1 billion “sports city” encompassing a soccer stadium and at least five mosques. On other specific projects, such as a years-long stormwater-drainage project in Jeddah, the company declined to comment. Another project, a futuristic museum and cultural center rising from Saudi Arabia’s eastern desert, cost Aramco more than $800 million, people familiar with the project said. The company still owns and runs the King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture, which is slated to open next year. Aramco was also involved in building the counter-terrorism center in Riyadh where President Donald Trump and King Salman were photographed earlier this week touching a glowing orb, says a person familiar with the matter. In 2014, some Aramco officials began confronting Saudi Arabia’s brewing economic problems. In their unofficial role as the country’s economic steward, they prepared a private report warning the government of a looming demographic explosion, where the country would need to create some 300,000 to 350,000 jobs annually to keep unemployment below 20%. The government didn’t initially act. Then oil prices crashed. Abdullah died in 2015; instead of asking for stadiums, his successor King Salman asked his son, Prince Mohammed, to break the kingdom’s oil dependence, and empowered the prince to oversee a sweeping economic overhaul. On Jan. 7, 2016, Aramco employees learned about their future from The Economist magazine: Prince Mohammed told an interviewer the company would go public. “There was a shudder of silence in the room when it was announced,” said one employee. “We were the ones pushing the research saying the economy needed to be diversified, but we never considered an IPO as the way to do that.” Public-relations staff rushed to issue a statement that made the news look like the result of a long-running study, say people familiar with the event. The announcement set off a race to figure out how to list a company so big and so intertwined with the government that taking it public, some bankers have said, would be equivalent to “floating a country.” Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair sat with Prince Mohammed in a desert camp; Larry Summers, a veteran of Clinton and Obama White Houses, met Saudi leaders, as did former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, say people familiar with the meetings. The former politicians, experts in politics and economics, are also affiliated with banks vying for Aramco IPO business. Mr. Blair is the chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.’s international council, which advises the bank (Aramco’s chairman, Mr. Falih, was also on that council). Messrs. Summers and Cantor are affiliated with boutique firms advising Aramco. In his meetings with Prince Mohammed, Mr. Blair discussed “general Middle East politics,” but nothing to do with “business” or his role at J.P. Morgan, according to a person close to Mr. Blair. As a first step, Mr. Falih and Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser appointed Motassim al-Maashouq to lead a group that would figure out how to untangle the oil, fuels and chemicals businesses from Aramco’s government obligations. In a speech to the corporate-planning department, Mr. Maashouq, the goateed and gregarious onetime head of an Aramco division that builds non-oil projects, told employees the IPO would be “a landmark” for Aramco and that “transparency and efficiency will make things better,” one attendee recalls. Mr. Maashouq enlisted more than 20 Aramco employees. They were assigned to teams called “Project X,” “Project Y” and “Project Z,” say people familiar with the matter, and began meeting in offices with combination locks on the doors. Project X worked up a plan to take the entire company public; Projects Y and Z examined more modest offerings of Aramco’s processing businesses, say people familiar with the matter. Executives decided to move ahead with Project X, they say, and put together another team, “Project R,” to focus on getting the company ready to go public. The teams, along with outside advisers, developed plans to move subsidies off Aramco’s books and put non-energy functions—such as building stadiums and camel complexes—under government ministries. The very process of realizing the prince’s economic overhaul only served to highlight the blurred lines around Aramco’s role. The government began asking Aramco’s oil-price-forecasting group for about 10 reports a week on countries and companies the prince viewed as alternative investment opportunities. Those included Russia, Japan’s SoftBank, the Comoros Islands and an amusement-park company. “We’re going, ‘What’s Six Flags got to do with the price oil?’ ” says a person involved in the assignment. The internal team preparing the company’s IPO began to realize they might not meet the lofty price publicly predicted by Prince Mohammed of $2 trillion. According to internal documents, the team reached a valuation of less than $1.5 trillion under current tax rates and royalty rates. Within Aramco, worries about potential disruption caused by the IPO effort have led some employees to work on what one calls a “constructive sabotage” effort—an attempt to persuade superiors Aramco should remain an arm of government. Their quiet rebellion seems unlikely to succeed. Prince Mohammed is committed to the IPO, according to people in his circle. An Aramco spokesman declined to comment on the potential valuation or on the prince’s plans. Saudi business leaders also were becoming unsettled by aspects of the economic overhaul plan. Already hit by reduced government support, companies were facing new taxes and other measures aimed at weaning the country off oil revenue. To some, it felt like the government was focused on one thing: maximizing an Aramco IPO. On March 4, several Saudi business leaders sat with Prince Mohammed to air their grievances, according to minutes of the meeting reviewed by The Journal. Changes the prince planned to introduce as part of Vision 2030—the name of the government’s economic transformation plan—would add to their costs, they complained, including by hampering their ability to bring in foreign workers. The only sector exempted, they pointed out, was oil, according to the meeting minutes. The prince offered little comfort. The take-away for one executive whose company was represented: “What 2030 stands for is we take 30 and give you 20.” While the meeting was being held, Aramco was close to finishing the camel stage. On a recent afternoon, hundreds of camels chewed their cuds in dusty paddocks. One white female—made particularly desirable by the downturned snout towering two feet over her caregiver’s head—was the subject of a $10 million auction bid. Her owner turned it down. Aramco engineers were on site through the contest, said Mr. Alsubaie, the camel-complex official. Saudi officials frame Aramco’s involvement as a marriage of Bedouin tradition and modern wealth that epitomizes today’s Saudi Arabia. The government called the contest, which gave out some $30 million in prizes, “part of the transformation of the country’s oil-dependent economy.” Top prizes went to two Saudi princes. In the weeks since the camel facility was finished, government thinking on untangling Aramco has shifted, say people familiar with the matter. For months, company officials and their bankers signaled they would break Aramco’s non-oil functions from the company ahead of the IPO. On the eve of the camel pageant finale in April, senior officials said they now intend to keep the construction function in the company, hoping it can make a profit. The work is so good, say officials involved in the process, investors will want a piece.

The spreading demand among ordinary citizens for homes in smaller cities underscores the enormity of the task ahead for China’s leaders: rein in the market without tanking the economy. The risk that China could fail to keep that tricky balance is at the core of the long-term financial concerns for China that triggered a downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service on May 24. “The current surge in sales in third- and fourth-tier cities is fueled largely by expectations of a future price rally, not by asset yields, and that’s exactly a sign of a bubble,” said Zhao Yang, Hong Kong-based chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. The “biggest risk” is a downturn in those cities triggering an abrupt national sales slump, Zhao said. Read about China’s first Moody’s downgrade since 1989 here When Beijing resident Fay Qu, 34, found herself locked out of local property purchases because of the city’s curbs, she and her friends instead together bought a million-yuan apartment late last year in the third-tier coastal city of Zhongshan in Guangdong province -- 1,400 miles away -- beating restrictions that the local authorities rolled out in March. “We were lucky,” she said. “It’s much better than depositing money in the bank.” Cooling measures pulled down price gains in cities such as Beijing, where the restrictions are harshest, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. That’s not the case in smaller places like Tangshan, best known for a 1976 earthquake, or Bengbu, a city in the poorer province of Anhui. Both had a 2.2 percent month-on-month gain in April, the biggest increase since at least 2011. In Xishuangbanna’s Jinghong -- too small to feature in the most-watched statistics bureau releases -- prices rose 26 percent in the 12 months ended March, according to city data cited by the private property website Ynhouse.com. Investors’ Bets Strength in property markets in tier-3 and tier-4 cities is partly offsetting a worsening in bigger cities, Citigroup Inc. analyst Oscar Choi, who’s based in Hong Kong, wrote in a note. A Bloomberg Intelligence index tracking the shares of 22 large Chinese developers is up 37 percent this year; it fell as much as 1.9 percent on Friday. To rein in a surge in prices, China’s leaders adopted a targeted strategy to cool buyer demand in specific hubs, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. That meant urging stricter restrictions in cities such as Beijing and Shenzhen, which had seen the biggest growth, while leaving local governments in smaller centers to take the steam out of markets as they saw fit.  The trick, as cooling measures spread, is to avoid weighing too heavily on the nation’s economic expansion. National home sales growth slowed in April to the weakest annual pace in more than two years. During 2016, sales swung month by month as curbs intensified and buyers channeled money into new cities or found ways to bypass restrictions. Construction Slowdown The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. this month forecast falling sales and weaker growth in real-estate investment over the rest of the year, with the government likely to succeed in keeping national housing prices “stable.” Bloomberg Intelligence economists Fielding Chen and Tom Orlik estimate that a likely slowdown in construction will shave 0.8 percentage points off the nation’s economic growth rate. If a slowdown bites, the authorities may find themselves forced to choose between hitting the 6.5 percent growth target and letting the restrictions on property ease. For now, local authorities have boosted down-payment requirements, restricted purchases by non-residents, and capped the number of dwellings that a household can own. Since March, at least 26 cities have imposed resale lock-up periods, with Hebei’s Baoding city slapping a decade-long ban on some homes, according to Shanghai-based Tospur Real Estate Consulting Co. While President Xi Jinping and his officials keep repeating the slogan that “houses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation,” the popular faith in real estate as an investment is undimmed. — With assistance by Emma Dong, and Miao Han Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

More investors and business people attended than expected for a technology-focused conference, attendees said. Big U.S. financial institutions announced more involvement in the digital currency industry this week. Evelyn Cheng | @chengevelyn 9 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Here are three big risks to the bitcoin rally: Trader    9 Hours Ago | 04:25 The world of finance is getting so interested in bitcoin that it's no longer just the land of coders. "At this conference, one thing I immediately noticed, I have a hard time finding the nerd table," said Joseph Poon, founder of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, a system for digital payments. He was speaking on the sidelines of the Token Summit in New York, a conference Thursday that looked at the application of bitcoin's blockchain technology to business. "For the past five years, it's always been easy to find the nerd table because it's everywhere. The conference was the nerd table. Now it seems like it's all ambassadors, and it's basically like I can only find like 10 people I can recognize here," Poon said. Wall Street is getting more invested in digital currencies and just in time for Bitcoin to hit a record high. That may not be a coincidence. Bitcoin has more than doubled in price this year and briefly surged to a record of $2,791.70 Thursday, before briefly erasing $400. The gains come with increased interest in digital currencies, or tokens. Bitcoin is a kind of token for which transactions are recorded in a secure accounting system called blockchain. show chapters What's driving bitcoin to new all-time highs    9 Hours Ago | 01:46 The demand to attend the Token Summit exceeded organizer William Mougayar's own expectation of 300 — there were as many on the waiting list before he closed it, he said. He began organizing the Token Summit in December, and out of 650 registrants from 44 countries he said about a quarter were involved with the business and financing side. "I was surprised," he said. Earlier in the week at another New York digital currency conference, Consensus, Fidelity announced it will allow clients to see bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held on Coinbase on its website, according to a Reuters report. Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson said in the report that the asset manager has also allowed employees to use bitcoin to pay in the firm's cafeteria. "They basically let the world know they are looking at it," Nick Kirk, formerly of IBM Research and an investor in cryptocurrencies, said from the Token Summit. "The smart money is starting to come in now." Kirk said he recently met with proprietary trading firms from Chicago that are interested in digital currencies. It's not just Fidelity that's getting more public about their interest in digital currencies and the underlying blockchain technology. One currency in particular, ethereum, has gained more than 2,000 percent this year because investors see its potential in paving the way for a new, decentralized internet. Last week, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance announced 86 new members of the standards-setting development group, including financial communications company Broadridge, clearinghouse DTCC and consulting firm Deloitte. JPMorgan, Intel and Microsoft were among the founding group. JPMorgan on Monday also announced at the Consensus conference that the bank is working with the makers of a digital currency called zcash to increase privacy for settlement of transactions on a blockchain, according to CoinDesk, the conference host. At Consensus "there were a lot of suits," David Vorick, co-founder and CEO of Sia, a cloud computing company based on blockchain, said of his experience at Consensus. "It just felt like everybody was there doing business. Even myself. I was wearing a suit, and that's not my natural state of being."

Me neither. The members of the cartel must be wondering what exactly they have to do to regain their former glory and influence after the price of oil tumbled, even though the group reached an agreement in Vienna today to extend production cuts for nine more months. Six months after forming an unprecedented coalition of 24 nations and delivering output reductions that exceeded expectations, resurgent production from U.S. shale fields has meant oil inventories remain well above the level targeted by OPEC ministers, according to Bloomberg News' Wael Mahdi, Grant Smith and Javier Blas. Oil bulls were also disappointed that no new non-OPEC countries will be joining the pact and there was no option set out to continue curbs further into 2018. The disappointment wasn't confined to the commodities market, as shares of big oil companies such as Chesapeake Energy, Marathon Oil and Transocean all tumbled. Over in the bond market, traders lowered their inflation estimates, given that it doesn't look like the price of crude is going to rebound any time soon. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said maintaining the same level of production through March 2018 “is a very safe and almost certain option to do the trick.” He later added that he hopes U.S. shale oil producers will moderate their growth after adding rigs and increasing America's production. "The Saudis have been trying to put a happy face on this thing," John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy, told Bloomberg News' Meenal Vamburkar. "But this is all they could get, and that’s disappointing to the market." STOCKS FILL THE GAP It hasn't been a very impressive rally, but the S&P 500 Index has managed to rise for six straight days. That's the longest streak since it gained for seven consecutive days in the period ended Feb. 15. The benchmark has now fully recovered from the selloff a week ago that was sparked by House Speaker Paul Ryan's inability to reassure markets that Congress can simultaneously investigate potential Russian meddling in the U.S. election and possible ties to President Donald Trump’s campaign while advancing the administration’s pro-growth legislative agenda. So, who is buying? Bloomberg News reporter Lu Wang found that data compiled by Bank of America on its client flows show the biggest source of demand has come from companies themselves, which have raised buybacks to the highest level of 2017. Hedge funds also partook in the spree after spending most of the time since mid-March scooping up shares. Institutional clients such as pension funds, for one, have been net sellers for 14 straight weeks, Bank of America data show. Reluctance can also be found among wealthy individuals, who reduced holdings after two weeks of purchases. THE BOND RALLY THAT JUST WON'T DIE One of the big surprises in markets this year has been the performance of the bond market, which many had expected to suffer under Trump's pro-growth policies. Instead, persistent demand for Treasuries is spurring Wall Street strategists to slash their yield forecasts -- again -- and whether the Federal Reserve winds up raising rates again has little to do with it, according to Bloomberg News' Brian Chappatta and Liz Capo McCormick. At about 2.25 percent, 10-year yields are plumbing 2017 lows as the central bank signaled not only an imminent rate hike, but also a gradual approach to shrinking its massive bond portfolio. Big bond dealers such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase cut year-end yield forecasts this month, while maintaining calls for more tightening. The underlying message: While the economy may be robust enough to warrant further Fed moves, the bond-market forces that drove yields to record lows last year are still intact: tame inflation data, waning confidence in Trump’s agenda, haven demand amid rising geopolitical risks and a growing conviction that the bond market will smoothly digest the transition to a smaller Fed balance sheet. COPPER RISES UP It was a big day for metals, as copper rose to a three-week high after Freeport-McMoRan dismissed striking workers at the world’s second-largest mine for the metal, casting a cloud over the supply outlook. The IndustriALL global union said Wednesday that Freeport has issued 2,018 “voluntary resignation” notices to workers who were absent for more than five days at the Grasberg site in Indonesia, according to Bloomberg News' Luzi Ann Javier, Danielle Bochove and Mark Burton. Copper has climbed 24 percent over the past year as mine disruptions in Grasberg and Escondida in Chile raised concerns about global shortages. Inventories tracked by the London Metal Exchange have fallen as orders to withdraw the metal in warehouses in Asia swelled on Wednesday to the highest in more than six months. Copper futures for July delivery gained 0.5 percent to $2.5975 an ounce at 12:18 p.m. on the Comex in New York, after touching $2.6195, the highest for a most-active contract since May 3. THE YUAN ISN'T TAKING OVER THE WORLD JUST YET Efforts by China to make the yuan a global currency that may one day challenge the dollar for supremacy are off to a slow start. The yuan's share of global payments fell to 1.6 percent in April, the lowest since October 2014, according to data from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. For China’s leaders, the decline is a reminder that the policy has trade-offs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence economists Michael McDonough and Tom Orlik. Yuan depreciation for much of the period from mid-2015 through 2016 helped restore competitiveness to exports. But a weakening yuan was less attractive as a store of value, limiting its international appeal. Since the end of 2016, capital controls have brought renewed stability, but have placed another barrier in the path of international adoption. McDonough and Orlik say the lesson in the yuan’s shrinking global role is clear: If currencies are not freely usable, they won’t be internationally adopted. If they are freely usable, they won’t be easily controlled. That’s the trade-off that China’s policy makers will continue to wrestle with. TEA LEAVES Friday brings the first revision to last quarter's gross domestic product numbers. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for a bump to 0.9 percent from 0.7 percent. There's a little more than month to go in this quarter, but economists are wondering whether they will have to downgrade their forecasts for 2.4 percent growth after data showed the U.S. recorded its second-widest merchandise trade deficit in two years last month and inventories at wholesalers and retailers fell in April. Economists look to the advance report on trade and inventories -- the two most volatile parts of the calculation for gross domestic product -- to gin up forecasts for quarterly growth, according to Bloomberg News' Shobhana Chandra. In April, the trade gap in goods widened to $67.6 billion from $65.1 billion in March as exports declined and imports rose.

Wall Street analysts, on average, say the shares can rise almost 10 percent from here in the next 12 months. Amazon's stock is up 32 percent this year and 40 percent in the past 12 months. Tae Kim | @firstadopter 11 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Amazon's continues its amazing run to nearly $1000 a share    14 Hours Ago | 01:10 As Amazon shares approach $1,000, investors are buzzing about whether it is time to cash in or stick with the momentum currently lifting shares of the retailing and web services juggernaut. Wall Street analysts believe the pace of the rally may slow, but that Amazon will be almost 10 percent higher a year from now. The stock came within one dollar of $1,000 during Thursday's session, touching an all-time high of $999 a share on the nose before falling back slightly, according to FactSet. It closed a little bit more than 1 percent higher on the day at $993.38. The average 12-month price target from 31 analysts for Amazon is $1,095 according to TipRanks. Susquehanna, Wedbush and Goldman Sachs all share the Wall Street high forecast of $1,250, according to the analyst tracking firm's database. Wall Street's Amazon average price target Source: TipRanks Surprisingly, some on Wall Street think Amazon's online retail business is still at the beginning stages of growth. "We believe Amazon is well positioned as the market leader in e-commerce, where it's still early days with U.S. e-commerce representing ~12% of adjusted retail sales (ex-gas, food, and autos)," JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to clients on May 17. "We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall e-commerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party vs. third-party inventory and its Prime offering both serve as major advantages." Anmuth reaffirmed his $1,110 December 2017 price target and overweight rating for Amazon in the report. Amazon is one of the market's best-performing stocks, with its shares up 32 percent this year compared with the S&P 500's 8 percent return. The stock is also up 40 percent in the past 12 months. The internet company is driving the market's and hedge funds' performance. It was the third-largest contributor to the S&P 500's return year to date through May 18, according to a Goldman Sachs report Friday. The bank also noted 66 hedge funds had Amazon as a top 10 position at the end of the March quarter, which is the second-highest number after Facebook. Lansdowne Partners is a big hedge fund winner with more than 11 percent of the firm's long portfolio in Amazon alone, according to Symmetric, a hedge fund tracking firm.

Jones Calkins, Mollieann Carey Evans, Thomas Russell Fagula, Michele Magli Harmon, Doris M. Hunter, Leona P. Adams Kalafut, Kristy M. Kolbeck, Ann Misewich, Mary C. Moran, Catherine Mary (Kay) Bob Kalinowski / Published: May 25, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     A headline-grabbing lawsuit against the owners of 16 local McDonald’s restaurants for paying employees exclusively with fee-laden debit cards appears to have reached a conclusion. The state Supreme Court this week denied a request to hear an appeal filed by the owners after prior courts ruled the pay method was illegal. “The kids won. McDonald’s lost,” said West Pittston-based attorney Mike Cefalo, who filed the class action lawsuit on behalf of local McDonald’s workers in June 2013. Albert and Carol Mueller of Clarks Summit, the franchise owners, declined comment on the Supreme Court’s refusal to hear their argument, a spokeswoman said. The case will now return to Luzerne County Court, where Judge Thomas F. Burke Jr. will determine what damages will be awarded to the plaintiffs, according to Cefalo. In June 2015, Burke ruled that paying employees exclusively with a debit card did not fall in line with the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law, which mandates “wages shall be paid in lawful money of the United States or check.” The state Superior Court last year upheld Burke’s decision. “The language is clear. A debit card is not ‘lawful money’ and it is not a ‘check’ ...” Superior Court Judge Anne Lazarus wrote in the court’s opinion. Attorneys for the Muellers had argued a debit card was the “functional equivalent” of a check or lawful money. The Superior Court panel called that argument “unavailing,” because the cards were mandatory and “forced users to incur fees” for all types of transactions. The J.P. Morgan Chase payroll cards issued to local McDonald’s employees carried fees for nearly every type of transaction, according to Cefalo’s lawsuit, including a $1.50 charge for ATM withdrawals, $5 for over-the-counter cash withdrawals, $1 to check the card’s balance, 75 cents per online bill payment and $10 per month if the card is left inactive for more than three months. After Cefalo filed the lawsuit, it quickly gained national attention, including a front-page story in The New York Times and an investigation by federal officials. Soon after, the Muellers announced they were abandoning the pay practice and would give employees the choice of being paid by check, direct deposit or by payroll card.

More On: miami marlins Jeb Bush complains of 'fake news' about his Marlins bid The 15 impact players most likely to be traded before MLB deadline Derek Jeter in a billion-dollar dogfight for Marlins Derek Jeter's pals don't get his memo on Marlins poker face Miami Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria, unable to attract a bid at his already reduced $1.3 billion asking price, may soon face a tough choice — cut the price a second time or take his money-losing team off the block, sources told The Post. Neither of the two bidding groups — including one with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Yankees great Derek Jeter at the top — have met the asking price, sources said. In a dramatic finish to an otherwise lackluster auction, both the Bush/Jeter group and a second group — led by Tagg Romney, the son of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney — are both frantically reaching out to a small group of billionaires in a last-ditch effort to bolster their bids. But in their respective dialing for dollars dash, both groups are striking out, sources said. “I don’t think anybody will get to $1.3 billion,” a sports investment banker said told The Post. “Jeb and Derek are still out there and they are not close to getting the money,” the source said. “Now, it’s a stale deal.” While the next phone call from either camp could scare up the needed cash to push it noticeably ahead of its rival, the odds of that happening go down with each failed pitch to prospective partners. “I think the price goes down from here,” the source said. “Nothing is close to being done,” one baseball owner told The Post. Loria, if he decides to significantly lower his asking price, could attract additional suitors, such as Hostess honcho Dean Metropoulos, who is interested in owning a sports team — but not at the current asking price, sources said. “I think if Jeffrey dropped it to $1 billion there would be buyers,” a baseball source told The Post. However, Loria, a wealthy and successful New York art dealer, shows no obvious signs of being desperate for money — even with the Marlins losing roughly $40 million a year and consistently being one of the worst draws in MLB. For that reason, some believe Loria, whose art collection, including works by pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, is said to be worth several hundred million dollars, will pull the team off the market and try again next year. “I really don’t think he’s a forced seller,” one sports banker said. “I predict that two months from now there will not be any sale,” the baseball source said, believing Loria may simply scrap the process. A lending source told The Post, “If Loria had to sell a stake he would have hired an investment bank,” which he has not. The Marlins have borrowed roughly $100 million through a credit line against the Major League Baseball national media contract, and the team has a roughly $300 million JPMorgan-led credit line, sources said. Loria has used those facilities to cover the team’s losses. That JPMorgan credit line arranged a little over four years ago is mostly tapped, sources said. MLB would need to approve a new larger JPM loan if Loria wants to borrow more money to cover losses. Before the auction, Loria was in talks to sell the Marlins to the Kushner family for $1.6 billion, according to report. Those talks fell apart. Loria then dropped the price to $1.3 billion and started the auction — attracting the two bidding groups. “I’ve seen him hold out for prices,” the art source said, when offers fall too greatly in value. Loria paid less than $200 million for the Marlins in 2002 so a sale at $1 billion even when subtracting the team’s $400 million in debt would still be highly profitable, sources said. The Marlins and MLB declined comment.

Show, from left to right, are: Gerard Purcell, senior vice president of global IT integration at Tech Data Corp.; John Kuemmel, chief information officer at Triad Retail Media, and Chris Cate, chief operating officer at Valpak. [Robert Trigaux, Times] ST. PETERSBURG — They came. They saw. They celebrated Tampa Bay's tech momentum. Related News/Archive Restaurants use technology to nudge us into spending more 2 Weeks Ago Trigaux: Here's the latest thing Jeff Vinik is doing to make Tampa a magnet for urban development 2 Weeks Ago New Tampa Bay Partnership unveils leadership, working groups for transit, regional metrics 7 Months Ago On a blustery Wednesday afternoon, hundreds of technology executives, entrepreneurs, economic developers and others converged on the Mahaffey Theater in downtown St. Petersburg to hear 18 area speakers share what's got the region's tech community feeling pretty good these days. And they learned what needs to be done to take to the next level what the area tech sector likes to call "Florida's largest and fastest growing tech hub." The half-day event, dubbed the "PoweredUp Technology Festival," yielded a record turnout of more than 500 for the hosting Tampa Bay Technology Forum. The group's closing in on a quarter century as this greater metro area's tech advocacy organization and looks ready to exert more influence in the direction of the Tampa Bay economy. The Tampa Bay economy employs close to 50,000 tech workers (one of every 89 in the country) and still has more than 5,000 openings to fill — a sign of success and a challenge in building a talent pipeline of tech workers for the future, said current TBTF board chairman Jeff Alagood, whose day job is chief operating officer at the Tampa customer software firm AgileThought. Alagood praised the success of the Exploratory Lab Boot Camp, a collaborative effort by Tech Data staff, Pat Gehant and St. Petersburg College to expose non-technical students to tech opportunities in the area. Alagood said many of the young people in that young program have gone on to tech jobs, and the commitment by JPMorgan Chase to commit $250,000 to the program will help it grow even more. Among the afternoon highlights? A panel of executives from area companies involved in three separate mergers and acquisitions worth an estimated $3 billion discussed the pros and cons of becoming part of another business. Someone asked the sticky question: Better to be the buyer or the acquired? The diplomatic answer: Either one suggests market strength and a recognition of local talent. Valpak, represented on stage by chief operating officer Chris Cate, was just purchased by private equity firm Platinum Equity. Cate said the challenge for Valpak (which is transitioning to a new CEO) is to preserve its strong culture while figuring out how to grow faster with the added resources of a more aggressive owner. Also on stage was John Kuemmel, chief information officer at Triad Retail Media. That company was bought last year by a multinational conglomerate which, Kuemmel said, made it more challenging for Triad to communicate its new role in such a bigger organization. And Gerard Purcell, head of global IT integration at Tech Data Corp., said his company's recent purchase of an Arizona tech distributor will push Tech Data annual revenues to $35 billion. Of the merging companies, Purcell joked one company is now known for starting a little later than the other. TBTF executive director Daniel James Scott hopes the PoweredUp gathering can become an annual event — befitting a regional tech industry eager to flex its muscle.

The day kicked off on a rather negative note, as Moody’s downgraded China’s credit rating for the first time in nearly 30 years – from A1 to Aa3. Moody’s cited concerns about the impact that rising levels of debt will have on the world’s second largest economy, which is a major buyer of industrial and precious metals. Moody’s action on China briefly rattled Asian markets. Meanwhile, US stocks traded in positive territory on Wednesday, though trading was subdued ahead of minutes from the Federal Reserve Bank’s latest meeting, which could quell doubts about a June interest rate increase. Travel shares fly higher Looking at Europe, travel and leisure stocks had a good day on Wednesday, with TUI AG, EasyJet and Ryanair at the top of the benchmark. Shares of TUI were up 3.29% and shares of EasyJet gained 3.38% in London. According to Reuters, Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary said the company would reveal a “strong set of results” in its upcoming earnings, expected next week. This was music to the ears of investors and sent shares soaring 2.78%. Retail mixed Shares of department store operator Marks & Spencer rebounded to trade higher on Wednesday, after dipping at the open. Shares had been lower after the company said full-year profits fell compared to a year ago, blaming weaker sales for clothing and non-food items. But the company posted solid gains overall, sending shares up 1.27%. Staying in the sector, shares of Next were trading in the red after the company’s stock had its “neutral” rating reissued by JPMorgan Chase. Shares were off 0.85%. Meanwhile, home improvements retailer Kingfisher was trading lower after it reported a slip in sales in its first-quarter results. The company said this was due to weak sales in France and disruption caused by a renovation. Autos struggle Shares in Daimler AG fell on Wednesday, leading declines on the DAX after the German authorities raided the company’s Stuttgart headquarters and other sites to secure evidence in their investigation in possible diesel emissions fraud by the car maker. Shares were off 1.82%. On a similar note, shares of Fiat were in the red with the car maker saying it was disappointed the US justice department filed a complaint against the company related to allegations it used software to cheat diesel emission tests.
