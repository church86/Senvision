 One of the most senior women on Wall Street just issued a rallying cry for stock pickers Matt Turner Feb. 28, 2017, 12:12 PM 3,566 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mary Erdoes, JPMorgan's CEO of asset and wealth management. Fortune Live Media via flickr Mary Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management at JPMorgan, just issued a rallying cry. Speaking to a room full of stock analysts at JPMorgan's investor day, she provided an impassioned defense of active management and Wall Street research. "The world is changing, and you cannot doubt the ability for human beings to pick good stocks over bad stocks," she said. "You, too, should not doubt yourself in the job you're in." 2016 was one of the most challenging years for professional stock-pickers. According to research from JPMorgan's US equity strategy, only 32% of active quant funds and active long-only funds outperformed their benchmarks in 2016. Investors pulled $200 billion from active US equity funds over 2016 — the single largest annual rotation out of active management. Referring to the challenges facing the industry — such as the flow of money from active management to passive management and the shift from human money managers to computer-driven investing — Erdoes highlighted a selection of stories from decades ago. "These are the same headlines year in, year out," she said. JPMorgan "We don't believe the debate is active versus passive," she said. "It is active and passive. We need those as building blocks for strong portfolios for the future." She made a similar argument about the computer-versus-human debate, saying that both are needed, rather than one or the other. "Human beings need human beings to explain the world to them, and that's our job," she said. "Siri is not going to hold your hand and help you get through these tough markets," she added. Of course, JPMorgan has an interest in defending active management. Asset and wealth management clients' assets hit $2.5 trillion in 2016, a record high. Erdoes shared a slide showing JPMorgan's fund performance. The chart shows the proportion of assets in mutual funds that are ranked above their respective peer category media over different time frames to the end of 2016. Erdoes said the one-year number would be even higher on a rolling 12-month basis, as it would strip the impact of January 2016 and include a strong performance in early 2017.

The main crux of the challenge, labeled Orellana vs JP Morgan, is very similar to the previous suit filed in late January. According to the lead plaintiff, who is seeking class certification for other similarly situated plan participants, the JP Morgan plan sponsors “violated their fiduciary duties by larding the plan with proprietary fund investment options that charged excessively high fees that inured to the benefit of affiliates of JPMorgan and one of JPMorgan’s closest business partners, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BlackRock”), at the expense of plan participants.” Plaintiffs argue that, instead of acting for the exclusive benefit of the plan and its participants and beneficiaries, “defendants acted for the benefit of themselves—by forcing the plan into costly investments managed by JPMorgan and BlackRock. Rather than engage in a systematic, arm’s-length review of available Plan investment options, JPMorgan sought out investment options that allowed its affiliates and business partners to reap outsized fees to the detriment of plaintiff and members of the Class. During the Class Period (defined herein), half of all Plan investment options were affiliated with JPMorgan entities, while more than 70% were affiliated with either JPMorgan or BlackRock.” Those retirement industry professionals closely following ERISA litigation will recognize many of the themes called up in this complaint—and they will probably disagree with many of them. For example, the complaint bemoans the inclusion of active management funds and argues their inclusion robbed investors of an opportunity to save on fees by investing passively. This is despite the well-established standard that investments have to be reasonably priced, rather than the cheapest possible, to meet the requirements of prudence and care under ERISA. This is how the plaintiffs make the case: “These funds were also actively managed, and therefore charged higher fees, even though passively managed investment options were available that would have allowed plan beneficiaries to utilize similar strategies during the class period at a significantly lower cost. For most of the class period, these JPMorgan-affiliated investment options were the priciest in the plan. For example, the JPMIM-managed Mid Cap Growth Fund charged fees of 0.93%, while the Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund Admiral also utilized a mid-cap growth strategy and had an annualized expense ratio of only 0.08%.” For its part, JP Morgan tells PLANSPONSOR, “We are reviewing the complaint. We disagree with the fundamental allegations in the complaint and believe the case is without merit.”  NEXT: Reading further into the complaint  Prev 1 2 Next View Full Article Tagged: Litigation, Regulations, Litigation, 401k, related articles related research most e-mailed Cover On Guard From plansponsor.com JP Morgan 401(k) Plan Challenged Again American Century Self-Dealing Complaint Advances Judge Denies Oracle’s Motion to Dismiss 401(k) Fee Lawsuit T.

If the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan, JPMorgan Chase could earn an additional $2 billion in net revenue this year. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Mar 3, 2017 at 1:23PM JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has transformed into a powerful bank, and not just defensively, as can be assumed from CEO Jamie Dimon's obsession with a fortress balance sheet. Its offensive strength is equally strong, it just hasn't shown through as much because interest rates have been so low. The good news is that this could be about to change, with the Federal Reserve telescoping that it could raise rates multiple times this year. You can gather this from its latest dot plot, which shows that a plurality of members on its monetary policy committee believe its short-term interest rate benchmark should end the year between 1.25% and 1.5%. That benchmark, the Fed funds rate, which is how much banks charge to lend each other excess reserves on an overnight basis, is currently between 0.5% and 0.75%. That implies three hikes of 25 basis points each if the Fed continues its gradual rate of increase. For JPMorgan Chase, this would mean billions more in net interest income, which is high-margin revenue that largely falls to the bottom line. According to its recently filed 10-K, a 100 basis point increase in short- and long-term rates will translate into $2.4 billion worth of added net interest income. If rates go up twice that amount, JPMorgan Chase would earn $4 billion in extra net interest income. Scenario Increase in JPMorgan Chase's Net Interest Income Short- and long-term rates increase by 100 basis points $2.4 billion Short- and long-term rates increase by 200 basis points $4 billion Data source: JPMorgan Chase's 2016 10-K, page 122. It's worth pointing out that this is a fraction of JPMorgan Chase's annual net income. Last year, it earned $24.7 billion. Even if rates were to spike by a full 100 basis points, it would still increase JPMorgan Chase's bottom line by less than 10%. But if rates continue to head higher for multiple years, which could happen given where they are today, you could easily get the same boost to earnings for several consecutive years. These interest rate increases will add up for a bank like JPMorgan Chase. They'll help to reveal what a powerful franchise the bank built as a result of the financial crisis. It acquired Bear Stearns in March 2008 for pennies on the dollar, gaining control over Bear's lucrative primary brokerage business. Six months later, JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual for $1.9 billion in exchange for $180 billion worth of Washington Mutual's deposits and $176 billion of its home loans. What will higher interest rates do for JPMorgan Chase? Image source: Getty Images. These acquisitions, both done at bargain-basement prices, added considerable heft to JPMorgan Chase's product lineup and helped the bank climb to the very top of the heap not only as a Wall Street bank, but also as a Main Street bank. But their value won't be obvious until rates rise and lending margins widen; that's when the $180 billion worth of additional cheap deposits become valuable. In short, while JPMorgan Chase could earn $2 billion or more in added net interest income this year, which will boost its bottom line, it's the prospect of more rate hikes in the future that makes this bank stock so attractive as a long-term hold.

By Expert Roundup Biography March 1, 2017 11:00 p.m. ET China’s annual National People’s Congress (NPC), which lays out the government’s economic and social development plan, will start on Sunday, March 5. Here are the views of several top economists on what to expect: JPMorgan JPM -0.9482758620689655% JPMorgan Chase & Co. U.S.: NYSE USD91.92 -0.88 -0.9482758620689655% /Date(1488837619927-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 14968492 AFTER HOURS USD91.8 -0.120000000000005 -0.13054830287206268% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 90686 P/E Ratio 14.849757673667206 Market Cap 331478167150.766 Dividend Yield 2.088772845953003% Rev. per Employee 421060 More quote details and news » JPM in Your Value Your Change Short position – Haibin Zhu Growth target. We expect the government will keep the growth target unchanged at [6.5%, 7%]. Note that in the previous two years the growth target was lowered from 7.5% to 7%, and then to [6.5%, 7%]. Economic activity (excluding financial services) experienced a notable recovery in 2016, and growth momentum remained stable in 4Q16 (6.7% quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annual rate). Our forecast expects 6.5% growth in 2017, driven by the turnaround in real estate investment (-), auto sales (-), financial services (+) and private investment (+). Uncertainty is largely related to housing market outlook, financial risk development and external risks (US-China trade relationship, euro-area election and outlook), hence balancing between growth and risk management is still a key challenge for Chinese policymakers. President Xi said in a recent speech that China can tolerate lower than 6.5% growth if it comes at excessive risks. Fiscal budget. Last year’s actual fiscal deficit was 3.8% of GDP (vs. a target of 3% of GDP), and if adding non-budgeting items such as policy bank lending and net land sales, augmented fiscal deficit was 10.8% of GDP based on our estimate (vs. 9.7% of GDP in 2015). For 2017, we expect the government will raise the budgetary fiscal deficit target to 3.5% of GDP, with bias to the downside (any number between 3% and 3.5% of GDP). Augmented fiscal deficit may rise further to 11.4% of GDP, supporting an expansionary fiscal policy stance (but the fiscal impulse is smaller than in 2016). Monetary policy. The targets related to monetary policy operation are inflation target and M2 and TSF (total social financing) growth target. We expect the inflation target will remain unchanged at 3%, and M2 and TSF growth target will be lowered to 12% (vs. 13% last year). Note that last year actual M2 growth was 11.3% and TSF growth was 12.8%, hence credit policy tends to be neutral in 2017. On the inflation front, the major change was the producer price index (PPI) reflation. PPI inflation jumped from -5.9% oya (over a year ago) in December 2015 to 6.9% oya in January 2017, improving corporate profits (especially upstream industries) and reducing near-term credit risk for the financial sector. PPI-reflation is most visible in upstream industries and passed through to intermediate sectors, but consumer goods prices are almost unaffected, leading to divergence between CPI and PPI inflation dynamics. In 2017, we expect CPI (consumer price index) will average 2.4% and PPI will average 5%-handle. The pace of rise in GDP deflator will further move up to 3.5% (vs. 1.3% in 2016), and nominal GDP growth will rise to 10% (vs. 8% in 2016). Bank of America Merrill Lynch – Helen Qiao, Sylvia Sheng We expect the government’s macro targets to be adjusted slightly in 2017. GDP growth target of around 6.5%: Given the focus on stability, as shown during the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) in December, we expect the government to calibrate the GDP growth target to “around 6.5%”, from the range of”6.5-7.0%” previously. If verified, this move will potentially leave some room for structural reforms without stretching on short-term growth objectives, in our view. On the other hand, if the growth target range is unchanged at “6.5-7.0%”, it could be due to concerns about confidence levels before the 19th CPC. Since policy makers have become more complacent about growth resilience in 2016, there is also a low probability that such a growth target range is removed from the working report this year, to emphasize on the objective of managing high leverage-related risks. CPI inflation target at 3.0%: The government will likely maintain the CPI inflation target at 3.0%. Note the inflation target is a cap and not binding. We expect CPI inflation to rise modestly to 2.3% yoy in 2017 from 2.0% yoy in 2016 as the still-negative output gap and tapered policy support should keep inflationary pressure at bay. Therefore, we do not expect the benign CPI inflation outlook to trigger any major policy tightening such as hiking benchmark rate. M2 growth target at 12%: The government will likely lower the M2 growth target to 12.0% (vs the target of 13.0% and actual growth of 11.3% in 2016). Since the Central Economic Working Conference has set monetary policy stance as “prudently neutral”, we believe a case of lower M2 growth could be made. Given the rise in CPI inflation this year, a 12% M2 growth target would be supportive for maintaining growth without risking a significant pick-up in leverage. Maintain fiscal deficit at 3.0% of GDP: Given our assessment that policymakers are still in the “complacency phase” of the mini-cycle, we expect planned fiscal deficit-to-GDP target to remain unchanged at 3.0% of GDP in 2017. Nevertheless, the official fiscal deficit target does not constrain the overall fiscal stance. If growth decelerates notably, the government could step up its fiscal support through quasi-fiscal channels, such as policy banks. Standard Chartered STAN.LN -0.4311506332524926% Standard Chartered PLC U.K.: London GBP739 -3.2 -0.4311506332524926% /Date(1488900099000-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 954623 P/E Ratio N/A Market Cap 24493906503.7551 Dividend Yield 2.5434141271989175% Rev. per Employee 166121 More quote details and news » STAN.LN in Your Value Your Change Short position – Shuang Ding, Se Yan We expect policy makers to prioritise stability amid external uncertainty, and ahead of the 19th Party Congress to be convened in the fall of this year. China’s annual NPC meetings – scheduled to commence on 5 March and last about 10 days – will approve the main economic and social targets, confirm the fiscal and monetary policy stances and set reform priorities for 2017. We expect policy makers to approve a slightly lower growth target, underscore the importance of containing financial risks, and promote reforms aimed at addressing the asset-price bubble and shutting down zombie enterprises. China will likely target growth of around 6.5%, versus 6.5-7.0% in 2016. GDP grew 6.7% in 2016, the first year of the 13th Five-Year Plan. Local governments have already set their 2017 growth targets, with six provinces adopting higher targets, 13 keeping targets unchanged and 12 lowering targets. Local governments generally appear to be more tolerant of slower growth. However, we do not think the central government will accept growth significantly below 6.5%, as it has committed to deliver average growth of at least 6.5% over 2016-20. The government may keep the CPI inflation target at 3.0% (average). We think more policy support will be needed to achieve the growth target, although the inflation target is less challenging. The M2 and total social financing (TSF) growth target is likely to be lowered to 12% from 13% in 2016. The government has indicated that monetary policy will be prudent and neutral in 2017. The wording and recent rate hikes by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) suggest monetary policy will be moderately tighter. We believe a tighter monetary policy is needed to counter the inflation uptrend, Renminbi depreciation expectations and rising leverage.

 Here's what to expect from Wednesday's budget, Philip Hammond's first as Chancellor Oscar Williams-Grut Mar. 4, 2017, 4:30 AM 624 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chancellor Philip Hammond. Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire/PA Images The budget will be delivered on Wednesday, March 8 at 12.30 p.m. GMT. Analysts are expecting a "low-key affair." Growth forecasts are likely to be upgraded, borrowing forecasts likely to be cut. NHS funding and business rates reliefs are also likely. LONDON — Philip Hammond will deliver his first budget since becoming Chancellor on Wednesday, with analysts expecting a relatively modest affair. Hammond will step up to the dispatch box in Parliament at 12.30 p.m. GMT (7.20 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, March 8. It is his first budget since becoming Chancellor last July but his second major fiscal statement, following last November's Autumn Statement. The biggest headline from the Autumn Statement was a relaxing of fiscal targets, as Hammond ditched predecessor George Osborne's commitment to reach a budget surplus by 2020. This gives Hammond more financial wiggle room to deal with any Brexit-related economic headwinds. BI has combed through preview notes from UBS, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank to find out what the market is expecting from this year's budget. Here are the key takeaways: Growth up, borrowing down "The main focus at next week’s Budget is likely to be a large upgrade to the OBR’s 2017 growth forecast," says JPMorgan's Allan Monks. He is expecting the Office for Budget Responsibility to up its GDP growth forecast for this year from 1.4% to 1.9%. Other analysts are predicting a similar rise. It follows a string of better than expected economic numbers since last June's Brexit vote and momentum since last November's Autumn Statement. As a result of better-than-expected growth, most analysts are expecting a downgrade to borrowing forecasts and an improvement of public finances as the Treasury takes in more tax. This could free up between £10 billion and £15 billion a year for Hammond to play with, depending on which analyst you're reading. However, most are expecting Hammond to use the bulk of this cash to boost the government's £27 billion war chest, which the Chancellor has set aside to deal with any unexpected Brexit headwinds over the next few years. He warned ministers last month that there is "no pot of money under my desk," suggesting he is unwilling to spend much. Morgan Stanley's Jacob Neil, Melanie Baker, and team said: "Our judgment is that [Hammond] will seek to bank two-thirds of the improvement, reducing the deficit by about £10 billion per annum, to strengthen the capacity to respond to a possible Brexit slowdown – not least since growth so far has been resilient and he has another near-term opportunity to act in the autumn Budget, if required." 'Ease the squeeze' Chancellor Philip Hammond delivering his first Autumn Statement last November. PA/PA Wire/PA Images However, Morgan Stanley expects Hammond to spend the rest of his excess billions on "additional spending to 'ease the squeeze', softening the 2% per annum fall in real spending per capita embedded in current plans." Deutsche Bank thinks this will mean "more NHS spending, funds for social care and possibly also a relief for small businesses against the planned increase in business rates." Social care and NHS has become a huge issue over the last year, with both sectors facing crippling shortfalls in budgets. Some spending, even if tokenistic, on these issues would be well received. The press and businesses have also been vocal in attacking the new business rates regime. Morgan Stanley's Baker and Neil add: "We see scope for additional funding to implement the housing white paper vision of additional housebuilding." Cabinet member Sajid Javid delivered the white paper last month. Morgan Stanley expects these aggregate spending measures will amount to a maximum of £5 billion and will be fiscally neutral, i.e. totally funded by improved public finances rather than borrowing. Possible surprises: self-employed taxes, diesel Beyond headline-grabbing measures on the NHS and business rates, could the budget yield any surprises? Goldman Sachs writes: "On the tax side, there is a reasonable chance the Chancellor changes the tax treatment of self-employment which currently incurs a much lower rate of national insurance contributions than employees. We believe this anomaly will eventually be addressed by HM Treasury and that may begin in this Budget." The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently calculated that the self-employed enjoy a £1,240 tax advantage over employees, calling the current system "costly, inefficient, and unfair." The budget box. Hannah McKay/PA Wire/PA Images Goldman adds that "incentives to encourage the early trading-in of diesel-fuelled cars may also be on the cards," given that air pollution and smog have become big issues this year, with London already breaching its annual limit. However, analysts are less sure of what to expect than in past budgets. Morgan Stanley said: "The government has made less use of pre-Budget briefing than Osborne and the Cameron government, and there is a higher-than-usual level of uncertainty around the economic outlook, given Brexit. Both factors make forecasting government fiscal decisions more challenging." Despite Hammond's silence on possible giveaways, analysts are not expecting the kind of "rabbit out of the hat" surprises that typified George Osborne's budgets. Deutsche Bank says: "Hammond’s intention is for UK fiscal policy to become more "boring"," and JPMorgan say they expect a "low-key affair." Hammond signalled at the last Autumn Statement that he is scrapping the tradition of twice-a-year financial updates, instead moving the full budget to autumn and making it the only annual update. As a result, this spring budget is something of a stop gap. Goldman writes: "We do not expect the Budget to be a major macro or fiscal event... there may be more news from the Budget at a sector level in terms of both tax and public spending announcements, although here too our expectations are modest."

Economy Yellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017 JED GRAHAM 3/03/2017 Reprints Fed chief Janet Yellen sealed the deal for an interest-rate hike on March 15, saying it "would likely be appropriate," as long as the economy doesn't flash unexpected weakness. Yellen also endorsed three rate hikes in 2017 as appropriate, though decisions will remain data-dependent. Dow financials JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) closed modestly higher after Yellen's remarks, while the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq closed slightly higher. Yellen's speech followed a wave of hawkish Fed comments and strong economic data, which continued on Friday. Yellen noted that job growth of around 180,000 per month is "notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth — between 75,000 and 125,000 per month." Earlier Friday, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said that the central bank must act pre-emptively in raising interest rates or it risks a repeat of the disastrous inflation experience of the 1970s. Even from a reliable hawk, the warning was surprising. Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management gauge of nonmanufacturing activity surged to 57.6 in February, the highest level since October 2015. That news made a Fed rate hike on March 15 seem like even more of a slam dunk. Markets now see an 86% chance of an increase, a dramatic turnaround since the beginning of the week, when a hike was seen as a distant possibility. Markets now see a 55% chance of at least three hikes by the December meeting. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, one of the more dovish officials on the central bank, said he still favors gradual tightening. Yellen put the idea of a March hike on the table last month when she warned of the risks of waiting too long. Yellen could lock in market expectations for March rate hike or reintroduce investor doubts. Although the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite were almost unchanged Friday intraday, bank stocks continued to rise on hopes for stronger growth and higher rates. JPMorgan Chase rose 0.7% to 92.80, while Goldman Sachs advanced 0.7% to 252.89. Wells Fargo (WFC) crept up 0.3% to 58.89 and Bank of America (BAC) added 0.8% to 25.44. All four banks hit all-time or post-crisis highs this week. Banks benefit from a wider yield spread, letting them borrow short and lend long. The 10-year Treasury yield has soared in the last few days, but the curve has continued to flatten as the two-year yield spikes to its highest level since 2008. IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve is getting impatient to raise interest rates even though prospects for a near-term economic stimulus from President Trump are diminishing. On Tuesday, New York Fed President William Dudley, generally seen as a dovish policymaker, said the case for a March hike had "gotten a lot more compelling." On Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing activity gauge hit a 30-month high of 57.7 as new orders surged. The data seemed to support Dudley's contention that the "animal spirits" of business decision makers were emboldened by the election of President Trump. Weekly initial jobless claims tumbled to their lowest level in nearly 44 years, the Labor Department said Thursday.

March 3, 2017 • Ben Steverman Loading Other Articles... JPMorgan Chase created a sensation last year with a new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, crafted from “a proprietary mix of embedded metals.” Also sensational, and pretty crafty, was the annual fee of $450. A turnoff? So many people signed up, Chase ran out of embedded metals, and the card cost the company some profits in the fourth quarter. Fighting back, American Express sweetened some of the perks on its own, 33-year-old premium card, the Amex Platinum. Included in the company’s latest enticement? An increase in Platinum’s annual fee from $450 to $550. There’s something strange about the credit card business. It’s technically possible to justify paying $450, maybe even $550, for the privilege of using a credit card. Look at the long list of perks, the points and credits toward trips and hotels, the freebies and upgrades. Then do the math. Will you actually use enough to justify the fee -- or have the time and patience to obsess over the reward program’s complicated rules and requirements? If so, go ahead and sign up. If not, you might be better off with a simple, no-fee card, maybe one with a generous cash-back bonus or an especially low interest rate. But that’s no fun. Part of the appeal of a premium credit card is that it’s a premium card. It might not save you a dime, but it will get you on a plane earlier or, even better, in the lounge sipping cocktails while everyone else on your flight lines up to board. It makes you feel special, just holding that solid metal rectangle in your hand. When you flash it, everyone knows you can afford it. Of the nearly 350 million U.S. credit card accounts (up from about 275 million since 2010, according to the American Bankers Association), the vast majority of cards don’t charge any annual fee at all -- though they still bring in plenty of revenue from penalties, interest, and the interchange fees paid by merchants. Will American Express customers pay an extra $100 to keep carrying around their Platinum cards? Each customer will have to make his or her own decision, based on rational, or irrational, considerations. Recently, Mark Jackson was thinking about canceling his Platinum. The 27-year-old resident of Scottsdale, Ariz., realized he probably wasn’t getting the full benefit from the card’s $450 annual fee. Now that the card is an extra $100 ... he’s planning to stick with it. In the end it was hard to imagine giving up access to American Express’s airport lounges. Jackson has stopped in the Centurion lounges in Miami and San Francisco on layovers. At the lounge in Dallas, he got a free 15-minute massage. “It’s kind of nice to pamper yourself,” said Jackson, who writes for a deals website. “It’s nice to have a place, if you have an hour to kill, to get a nice cup of coffee or a cocktail.” American Express is betting that most of its customers act like Jackson, and not like coldly rational bargain hunters. Charlotte Fuller, a spokeswoman, points out that the Platinum fee increase is the first in 10 years. The company is hoping customers pay more attention to the new perks, which include $200 a year toward Uber rides and extra rewards for hotel and airline purchases. Platinum customers also have exclusive access to events and dinner reservations at famous restaurants. “This means more tables held every night for our card members,” Fuller said. Premium cards don’t always make it easy to get the perks. Jackson, who doesn’t own a car, is excited about the Amex Platinum’s new $200 Uber credit, but one feature annoys him. The $200 is doled out at $15 a month (with an extra $20 in December). You use that credit each month or lose it. If Jackson doesn’t hail an Uber in April, there’s no way to claim that $15 in May or June. “It really is going to depend on what the customer values,” said Tiffani Montez, senior analyst at Aite Group. “People are going to have to dissect the rewards structures and see if it makes sense for them.” After a long day of travel, a $550 massage might just make sense for you.

The weird logic of Platinum, Sapphire, and the rest of the premium crowd. by Ben Steverman @bsteverman More stories by Ben Steverman March 3, 2017, 5:00 AM EST There’s something strange about the credit card business... Illustration: Getty Images JPMorgan Chase created a sensation last year with a new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, crafted from “a proprietary mix of embedded metals.” Also sensational, and pretty crafty, was the annual fee of $450. A turnoff? So many people signed up, Chase ran out of embedded metals. Fighting back, American Express sweetened some of the perks on its own, 33-year-old premium card, the Amex Platinum. Included in the company’s latest enticement? An increase in Platinum’s annual fee from $450 to $550. There’s something strange about the credit card business. It’s technically possible to justify paying $450, maybe even $550, for the privilege of using a credit card. Look at the long list of perks, the points and credits toward trips and hotels, the freebies and upgrades. Then do the math. Will you actually use enough to justify the fee—or have the time and patience to obsess over the reward program’s complicated rules and requirements? If so, go ahead and sign up. If not, you might be better off with a simple, no-fee card, maybe one with a generous cash-back bonus or an especially low interest rate. But that’s no fun. Part of the appeal of a premium credit card is that it’s a premium card. It might not save you a dime, but it will get you on a plane earlier or, even better, in the lounge sipping cocktails while everyone else on your flight lines up to board. It makes you feel special, just holding that solid metal rectangle in your hand. When you flash it, everyone knows you can afford it. Of the nearly 350 million U.S. credit card accounts (up from about 275 million since 2010, according to the American Bankers Association), the vast majority of cards don’t charge any annual fee at all—though they still bring in plenty of revenue from penalties, interest, and the interchange fees paid by merchants. Will American Express customers pay an extra $100 to to keep carrying around their Platinum cards? Each customer will have to make his or her own decision, based on rational, or irrational, considerations. Recently, Mark Jackson was thinking about canceling his Platinum. The 27-year-old resident of Scottsdale, Ariz., realized he probably wasn’t getting the full benefit from the card’s $450 annual fee. Now that the card is an extra $100 ... he’s planning to stick with it. In the end it was hard to imagine giving up access to American Express’s airport lounges. Jackson has stopped in the Centurion lounges in Miami and San Francisco on layovers. At the lounge in Dallas, he got a free 15-minute massage. “It’s kind of nice to pamper yourself,” said Jackson, who writes for a deals website. “It’s nice to have a place, if you have an hour to kill, to get a nice cup of coffee or a cocktail.” Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up American Express is betting that most of its customers act like Jackson, and not like coldly rational bargain hunters. Charlotte Fuller, a spokeswoman, points out that the Platinum fee increase is the first in 10 years. The company is hoping customers pay more attention to the new perks, which include $200 a year toward Uber rides and extra rewards for hotel and airline purchases. Platinum customers also have exclusive access to events and dinner reservations at famous restaurants. “This means more tables held every night for our card members,” Fuller said. Premium cards don’t always make it easy to get the perks. Jackson, who doesn’t own a car, is excited about the Amex Platinum’s new $200 Uber credit, but one feature annoys him. The $200 is doled out at $15 a month (with an extra $20 in December). You use that credit each month or lose it. If Jackson doesn’t hail an Uber in April, there’s no way to claim that $15 in May or June. “It really is going to depend on what the customer values,” said Tiffani Montez, senior analyst at Aite Group. “People are going to have to dissect the rewards structures and see if it makes sense for them.” After a long day of travel, a $550 massage might just make sense for you.

Lawrence Obracanik, 42, pleaded guilty to wire fraud affecting a financial institution on Thursday before U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams in Manhattan, according to an announcement from U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine, according to Bharara’s office. Obracanik is scheduled to be sentenced by Abrams on July 7. A lawyer for Obracanik did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday evening. Obracanik, a resident of Fort Worth, Texas, turned himself in to authorities in New York in December. Following a court appearance on the day of his arrest, he was released on a $100,000 bond. He was instructed as part of his bail conditions to seek employment and attend counselling for gambling, according to court records. The criminal complaint against Obracanik did not identify JPMorgan by name. But a profile for him on LinkedIn said that he had worked for the New York-based bank in Texas. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment at the time of Obracanik’s arrest. Representatives of the bank could not immediately be reached on Thursday. Prosecutors say that, between July 2014 and February 2016, Obracanik was responsible for wire transfers of more than $5 million from an account at the bank where he worked to an account at another bank belonging to an unnamed individual. The complaint said that during an interview with two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in August, Obracanik admitted wiring the money to that person’s account and said that he had done so to pay personal debts. The case is U.S. v. Obracanik, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-mj-7732.

That doesn’t mean it’s cheap. The company has 20,000 developers and plans to spend $9.6 billion on tech, or about 9 percent of its projected revenue — double the industry average. The bank also created bots for some customer-service tasks — such as resetting passwords — doing the work of 140 people. It’s all more fodder for the basic income crowd. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

I don’t have the experience. I don’t know enough.’ And now I'm thinking, ‘Oh!’” She said she won’t run.  Oprah Realizes You Don't Need Experience to Be President 3) Uber is having an awful year First there was the #DeleteUber campaign. Then a former employee alleged she was sexually harassed. This week, Bloomberg obtained a video of Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with his driver about declining fares. In the video, Kalanick said: “Some people don’t like to take responsibility ... they blame everything in their life on somebody else.” Kalanick was quick to apologize. “To say that I am ashamed is an extreme understatement,” he wrote in an email to staff. “This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” Watch him shimmy before it all goes bad. Uber CEO, Travis Kalanick (video) 4) You can lease a dog? People joke that their pets own them, not the other way around. Some have learned neither’s the case. Pet stores across the U.S. are renting out dogs and cats in contracts similar to car leases. One dog, for example, cost $2,400 down and $165.06 a month for 34 months. That means Fido can become a financial liability if he runs away, and he can be repossessed if the family misses a payment. “This cat is ruining my credit score,” one customer lamented. 5) It’s been a great year for the really rich The world’s 500 richest people earned an extra $217 billion so far this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Mexico’s Carlos Slim has lost about $16 billion since President Donald Trump launched his campaign, but he became a whole lot more popular. China’s richest, in contrast, have raked it in under the new U.S. leader. The new index shows the winners and losers.   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

 JPMorgan is hiring bankers in a city near you Matt Turner Feb. 28, 2017, 10:24 AM 5,475 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan JPMorgan is looking to hire bankers in a city near you. The US bank hosted its annual investor day Tuesday February 28, and Doug Petno, chief executive of commercial banking at the company, delivered a presentation. Commercial banking looks after Middle Market Banking (MMBSI) clients, or companies with between $20 million and $500 million in revenue, and Corporate Client Banking (CCBSI), which covers those with $500 million to $2 billion in revenue. Smaller companies are served by Chase Business Banking and bigger companies are served by the Corporate and Investment Banking division. The commercial banking business has been expanding, adding more than 150 revenue-producing bankers between 2014 and 2016, according to a slide. There has been a 17% year-on-year increase in specialized industry bankers, according to another slide.  The bank has pushed into new markets like Palo Alto and Memphis, and plans to have a presence in the top 50 Metropolitan Statistical Areas ranked by population by the end of this year. Right now, it's in 48. The number of client calls was up 13% year-on-year, while the number of new relationships is up 14%. The long term target is to generate $1 billion in revenues from expansion markets, up from $411 million in 2016.  Asked by an analyst about the expansion effort, Petno said that "it's not easy to hire good bankers." "There's not a banker tree ... The good ones are entrenched in the banks, and they're hard to pry out." He added that employment growth had been limited by JPMorgan's ability to develop its own bankers in certain markets, and acquire bankers in others.  "We've been building very steadily," he said.  JPMorgan   SEE ALSO: Warren Buffett just shared his best investment advice, and said the 'elite' have wasted $100 billion ignoring it NOW WATCH: This is why Wall Street is able to stay one step ahead of federal investigations Loading video...

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 March 2017 by Military News Bank Stock Roundup: Fed Interest Hike Expectation Raise Optimism; JPMorgan, Citi in Focus Shutterstock photo Over the last five trading days, major banks’ rally continued with expectation of another interest rate hike this month. The rate hike will aid top-line expansion for banks, making way for improved results in the quarters ahead. An upsurge in interest income is anticipated for banks and margin pressure is likely to ease further. Further, domestic economic growth will support their financials. Mortgage rates, which were on an upswing, declined this week, hitting 4.10%. In spite of the plunge, investors are apprehensive about parking funds in the housing market, thanks to the volatility in the financial world. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time gainers. Meanwhile, banks remained focused on strategies to enhance profitability through restructuring and acquisitions, in the last five trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Feb 24, 2017 ) Important Developments of the Week 1. At the annual Investors Day conference, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPM management discussed the current macroeconomic backdrop and the path the company is taking to enhance profitability over the medium term. In addition, the company provided first-quarter and full-year 2017 guidance. The first and foremost thing that comes to every investor’s mind is the improving rate scenario and how banks will capitalize on the same. JPMorgan is well positioned for raising rates, which will drive its net interest income. Further, JPMorgan intends to invest significantly in its credit card business and become more technologically focused to remain competitive amid growing customer needs. Notably, JPMorgan affirmed its long term-targets of cost-to-revenue ratio of 55% (despite continued investments in franchise), return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of nearly 15% and net payout ratio of 55-75% (read more: What Lies Ahead for JPMorgan Amid Improving Economy? ). 2. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported fourth-quarter 2016 earnings of $43.7 billion, up 7.7% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 93% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $5.3 billion, up 10.5% year over year. Banks’ earnings were driven by higher revenues, loan growth and lower loan-loss provisions. Moreover, improved trading revenue remained another positive. On the other hand, expenses flared up (read more: FDIC-Insured Banks: Q4 Earnings Strong, Revenues Escalate ). 3. Following Wells Fargo & Company’s WFC $185-million settlement in Sep 2016 to resolve regulators’ claims of illegally opening millions of unauthorized accounts, the U.S. lender now plans to cut back 2016 cash bonuses for eight top executives and withhold stock awards received in 2014 by 50%. The clawback of bonuses will reduce Wells Fargo’s bonus pay by $32 million. Notably, eight top executives included the new CEO Tim Sloan and CFO John Shrewsberry as well. After the disclosure of malpractices related to the opening of around two million bank and credit card accounts without customers’ consent, Wells Fargo has been facing issues with clients as they are reluctant to conduct business with the lender. Following this scandal, new account openings slumped about 44% (read more: Wells Fargo Slashes Bonus for Executives Post Scandal ). 4.  More than a decade after withdrawing its operations from Saudi Arabia, Citigroup Inc. C is making efforts to re-enter the region. The bank is currently in discussions for acquiring a banking license in Saudi Arabia, as it is trying to capitalize on the country’s financial reforms. Though the company is optimistic about receiving the license, it is apprehensive that the talks could fail at the last stage. Without a license from the Capital Market Authority (CMA) – the regulatory body in Saudi Arabia for applying for full financial, legal, and administrative independence – international banks face hurdles on working on deals signed in the country. (read more: Citigroup in Discussion for Saudi Arabia Banking License ). Price Performance Here is how the seven major stocks performed: Company Last Week 6 months JPM 2.0% 36.5% BAC 4.1% 57.7% WFC 1.6% 16.1% C 1.8% 27.6% COF 1.9% 31.7% USB 0.7% 25.6% PNC 0.5% 40.8% In the last five trading sessions, Bank of America Corp. BAC and JPMorgan were the major gainers with their shares increasing 4.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Moreover, Capital One Financial Corp. COF shares inched up 1.9%. BofA and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC were the best performers in the last six months, with their shares surging a whopping 57.7% and 40.8%, respectively. Moreover, JPMorgan’s shares jumped 36.5%. What’s Next? In the coming five days, nothing major is likely to occur in the banking space. Unless there is a substantial upheaval in the global markets, bank stocks will continue to perform in a similar fashion.

'If you go into what I call a bubble boom, every bubble bursts.' - Margaret Thatcher Home Articles Authors Search About Us HOME / Articles / Doug Noland / Reality vs. The Neutral Rate Reality vs. The Neutral Rate By: Doug Noland | Sat, Mar 4, 2017 Share Print Email How about a cursory look at recent economic data: February's 57.7 ISM Manufacturing reading was the strongest since August 2014. New Orders at 65.1 matched the strongest level (Dec. 2013) since 2009. Prices Paid at 68 was only slightly below January's 69, the strongest since 2011. February's ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.6, the highest since October 2015 (58.1). Auto sales in February were just below record levels. Last week's Initial jobless claims (223,000) were the lowest since March 1973. Weekly mortgage purchase applications bounced back to near seven-year highs. Trade deficits are running at the widest level since before the crisis. The PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) Deflator was up 0.4% in January, increasing y-o-y gains to 1.9%. This matched the highest y-o-y reading in almost five years. Core PCE was up 0.3% for the month, pushing y-o-y gains to 1.7%. The Conference Board's February Consumer Confidence reading rose to the highest level since July 2001. At 133.4, the Conference Board Present Situation index jumped to the high since July 2007 - and is now only five points away from a 15-year high. Personal Income added 0.4% in January, increasing y-o-y income growth to 4.0%. After incredible 2016 inflows of $305 billion, Vanguard has attracted flows of $80 billion in just the first two months of the year. March 3 - Wall Street Journal (Asjylyn Loder): "Investors poured $62.9 billion into exchange-traded funds in February, pushing the year-to-date world-wide tally to $124 billion, the fastest start of any year in the history of the ETF industry, according to... BlackRock Inc. U.S. ETFs accounted for $44 billion of that, pushing assets in U.S. funds to almost $2.8 trillion. Most of the money went to cheap, index-tracking ETFs..." February 28 - Bloomberg (Sid Verma and Oliver Renick): "You can thank the little guy for Dow 20,000. That's the takeaway from data tracking money flows into and out of stocks, according to... JPMorgan... The telltale sign retail investors are behind the longest string of U.S. stock highs in decades? An $83 billion surge of cash into passive strategies so far this year amid a $15 billion withdrawal from actively managed funds. That's on top of evidence that institutional traders have backed away, the bank says." March 3 - Bloomberg (George Caliendo and Michael Hyler): "U.S. investment grade corporate bond sales totaled more than $281 billion in the first two months of the year, the most in at least 10 years. Exxon Mobil Corp is among the companies that could keep issuance at a record pace in the first quarter of 2017." They've really gone and done it this time. The Fed had cut rates from 8.25% in 1990 to a cycle low 3.0% in September 1992. Ignoring a policy-induced speculative bubble inflating throughout the bond and mortgage derivatives markets, the Greenspan Fed waited to begin normalizing rates until February 1994. In 2001, Fed funds began the year at 6.50% and were then slashed to only 1.00% by June 2003. The Fed didn't take its first baby-step increase until June 2004, after several years of double-digit mortgage Credit growth and a mortgage finance Bubble that had gathered powerful momentum. The current remarkable cycle has brought new meaning to the phrase "Behind the Curve." Rates were cut from 5.25% starting back in September 2007. By December 2008 they had been slashed to zero (to 25bps), with the DJIA ending the year at 8,876. Now, with the DJIA at 21,000, Fed funds sit today at only 0.75%. Rates have budged little off zero despite record securities prices, record corporate bond issuance, record home prices and a 4.8% unemployment rate. While Q4 data will be out soon, it appears that 2016 posted the largest Credit growth since 2007. Through the first three quarters of 2016, non-financial Credit expanded at an annualized pace of just under $2.4 TN, not far off 2007's record $2.503 TN. For comparison, non-financial debt expanded $1.259 TN in '09, $1.589 TN in '10, $1.309 TN in '11, $1.916 TN in '12, $1.545 TN in '13, $1.807 TN in '14 and $1.931 TN in '15. The strongest Credit expansion in years is led by robust growth in consumer Credit, corporate debt and federal borrowings. Even mortgage Credit has picked up to the fastest pace since 2007, after years in the doldrums. In my parlance, years of accelerating Credit expansion have engendered self-reinforcing inflationary biases throughout the economy, most notably in securities, real estate and asset prices more generally. Increasingly, however, rising incomes have begun fueling some inflationary pressure even in the traditional consumer price arena. U.S. Credit growth and economic activity had attained sufficient self-sustaining momentum by 2014 and 2015 for the Fed to have launched so-called "normalization." It was a major policy blunder not to have this process well underway by 2016. The Fed basically disregarded domestic considerations as it postponed rate adjustments after the single December 2015 baby-step. The faltering Chinese Bubble from a year ago held sway, not only with respect to Fed policy but for the ECB and BOJ as well. A Chinese bust clearly had major ramifications for the global inflationary backdrop. Yet there's always that thin line between a bursting Bubble and the acquiescence of irrepressible "Terminal Phase" excess. As it turned out, rather than a disinflationary shock catalyst for a susceptible world, China's aggressive reflationary measures ensured record 2016 Credit expansion and attendant upside inflationary pressures at home and abroad. China historic Credit Bubble is ongoing, and it's pulling global inflationary dynamics along for the ride. From the conclusion of Yellen's Friday Afternoon speech - "From Adding Accommodation to Scaling It Back:" "We [support continued growth... in pursuit of our... mandates], as I have noted, with an eye always on the risks. To that end, we realize that waiting too long to scale back some of our support could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly sometime down the road, which in turn could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Having said that, I currently see no evidence that the Federal Reserve has fallen behind the curve, and I therefore continue to have confidence in our judgment that a gradual removal of accommodation is likely to be appropriate." Of course chair Yellen is not about to conceded that the Fed has fallen "Behind the Curve." Her speech, however, was heavy on rationalizing and justifying why the FOMC has been incredibly reluctant to begin normalizing policy. "Gauging the current stance of monetary policy requires arriving at a judgment of what would constitute a neutral policy stance at a given time. A useful concept in this regard is the neutral 'real' federal funds rate, defined as the level of the federal funds rate that, when adjusted for inflation, is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its potential. In effect, a 'neutral' policy stance is one where monetary policy neither has its foot on the brake nor is pressing down on the accelerator..." "In the Committee's most recent projections last December, most FOMC participants assessed the longer-run value of the neutral real federal funds rate to be in the vicinity of 1%..." "It is difficult to say just how low the current neutral rate is because assessments of the effect of post-recession headwinds on the current level of the neutral real rate are subject to a great deal of uncertainty. Some recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero percent..." "In 2015, the unemployment rate fell significantly faster than we generally had anticipated in 2014. However, a series of unanticipated global developments beginning in the second half of 2014--including a prolonged decline in oil prices, a sizable appreciation of the dollar, and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad--ended up having adverse implications for the outlook for inflation and economic activity in the United States, prompting the FOMC to remove monetary policy accommodation at a slower pace than we had anticipated in mid-2014..." Future historians will be unimpressed with the Fed's whole line of "neutral rate" analysis. It's certainly reminiscent of chairman Greenspan's late-nineties foray into the New Economy's "faster speed limit" -- as rationalization for evading the tough action necessary to rein in excessively loose monetary conditions and resulting speculative asset markets. Yellen presented a reasonably comprehensive analysis of Fed thinking, yet her Friday speech does not include the either the word "Credit" or "money." Regrettably, it's the same flawed theoretical framework that has gotten the Fed - and the rest of us - in repeated trouble for the past three decades. Ten-year bond yields were 5.6% when the Fed moved to tighten policy in February 1994. Yields then shot all the way to 8.0% into early November. The Fed took from that experience the notion that it must clearly signal to the markets that rate increases will be gradual and quite measured. This fundamentally altered how the bond market responds to Fed policy changes. Indeed, a case can be made that since '94 the Fed has avoided measures that would actually tighten financial conditions. Ten-year yields were at 4.7% when the Fed initiated tightening measures (at 1.25%) in May 2004, before ending the year at 4.2%. Fed funds were up to 5.25% by June '06, though 10-year bond yields had increased to just over 5%. Bond yields then began 2007 at 4.7%, market rates sufficiently low to ensure quite loose financial conditions and prolong the dangerous Bubble. Ten-year yields closed Friday trading at 2.48%. Clearly, the bond market has little fear of Fed tightening measures. At this point, the backdrop is showing similarities to the 2004-2007 Bubble period where Fed rate increases couldn't keep up with rising inflationary biases - in securities and asset prices, as well as throughout the real economy. The Fed's focus on some abstract "neutral rate" is foolhardy central banking, especially when it comes at the expense of analysis of Credit and monetary factors. For a central bank supposedly "data dependent", how are the markets to gauge and interpret such a nebulous theoretical concept (other than as rationalization for disregarding asset inflation and bubbles)? What was the "neutral rate" one year ago, with China in trouble, global markets faltering, crude at about $40 and CPI measures pointing downward? How about today, with record global Credit growth, booming markets, crude at $53 and CPI trends pointing almost straight up? The ISM Prices Paid index was 33.5 in January 2016 - the low since 2009. By January 2017 it had more than doubled to 69, the highest in almost six years. "Neutral rate" has no practical policy relevance in a period of such monetary and price disorder. The Fed surely hopes to offload some of their tightening work to the financial markets. So far, ebullient markets seem rather determined to sustain ultra-loose financial conditions. If inflationary forces have finally gathered self-reinforcing momentum, dillydallying several years to get Fed funds up to three or four percent is not going to cut it. It seems obvious that the Fed has fallen way Behind the Curve. And this may be irrelevant to markets currently, though this phase will pass. It's sure disconcerting to see the public throw "money" at equity index products at this stage of the market cycle. The Fed has cultivated the misperception that it's a whole lot safer than buying Bubble technology stocks in 1999 or Bubble equities and houses in 2007.   For the Week: The S&P500 gained 0.7% (up 6.4% y-t-d), and the Dow increased 0.9% (up 6.3%).

Copper was unchanged (up 7%). Wheat gained 1.2% (up 11%). Corn jumped 2.7% (up 8%). Trump Administration Watch: February 27 - Politico (Rachael Bade, Sarah Ferris and Shane Goldmacher): "Congressional Republicans... panned Donald Trump's call to finance a military buildup by slashing domestic agencies and ignoring entitlement programs — undermining the president's budget even before it's been finalized. The consternation spanned the party's ranks just one day before Trump addresses Congress for his first time Tuesday evening: House GOP fiscal hawks said it was ludicrous to think they'd pass a budget that did not address ballooning costs in Medicare and Social Security, the main drivers of the national debt. Pragmatic-minded GOP appropriators scratched their heads over where Trump would siphon off $54 billion in domestic cuts. And GOP defense hawks said the Pentagon budget boost doesn't go nearly far enough." February 28 - Wall Street Journal (Michael C. Bender): "One day after his budget team promised dollar-for-dollar cuts to offset a request for more military spending, President Donald Trump said... the additional money he is seeking for the defense budget would be paid for by a surge in tax collections sparked by the improving economy. 'The money is going to come from a revved-up economy,' Mr. Trump said... 'I mean, you look at the kind of numbers we're doing, we were probably GDP of a little more than 1%. And if I can get that up to three, maybe more, we have a whole different ballgame." March 1 - Bloomberg (Andrew Mayeda): "The U.S. isn't bound by decisions made at the World Trade Organization, President Donald Trump's administration said in outlining a new trade agenda that promises to root out unfair practices by foreign countries. America plans to defend its 'national sovereignty over trade policy,' the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in an annual document laying out the president's trade agenda. Under the terms of its entry into the WTO, the U.S. didn't abandon its trade rights, according to the document, obtained by Bloomberg News and titled '2017 Trade Policy Agenda.'" China Bubble Watch: March 1 - Bloomberg: "China's banking regulator outlined wide-ranging efforts to rein in financial risks, including clamping down on shadow lending and curbing funding for property speculation. Guo Shuqing, three days on the job as chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said he will coordinate with other financial authorities, including the central bank, to plug loopholes in regulations for cross-market financial products and update rules that no longer fit with banks' current business and risk management. 'Banks, trusts, fund-management firms, brokerages and insurers all have asset-management operations, but because they have different regulators and are subject to different rules, there's been some chaos,' Guo said..." February 28 - Reuters (Kevin Yao): "China plans to target broad money supply growth of around 12% in 2017, slightly lower than last year's goal, policy sources said, signaling a bid to contain debt risks while keeping growth on track. Under its new 'prudent and neutral' policy, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has adopted a modest tightening bias in a bid to cool torrid credit expansion, though it is treading cautiously to avoid hurting the economy. The M2 growth target was endorsed by leaders at the closed-door Central Economic Work Conference in December..." February 25 - Reuters (Shu Zhang and Matthew Miller): "Guo Shuqing, who is stepping down as governor of Shandong province to take control of China's banking regulator, returns to Beijing at a decisive moment for the country's financial system following years of breakneck economic growth. The immediate challenge for the new chairman of the ChinaBanking Regulatory Commission (CRBC) is formidable - Guo must vigorously address troubled lending in the country's 232 trillion yuan ($34 trillion) banking sector and implement tougher measures to control lightly regulated shadow banking activities." February 26 - Reuters: "China will focus on stable development of its capital markets this year, but will press ahead to further open its markets to foreign companies, the top securities regulator said... 'We will not waver from reforms (to make China's capital markets) more market-based, law-based and international,' Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told a news conference... Chinese regulators have turned their sights on controlling risks in financial markets as speculative activity and leverage in the economy rise, with the securities regulator vowing to clear out "abnormal phenomena" from capital markets. The CSRC recently pledged to target 'barbaric' leveraged buyouts and to restrict excessive fundraising by some listed companies, with a focus on private share placements." March 2 - New York Times (Sui-Lee Wee): "Mao once branded capitalists enemies of the Chinese people. In the era of President Xi Jinping, those capitalists are billionaire lawmakers — and they're getting even wealthier. The combined fortune of the wealthiest members of China's Parliament and its advisory body amounts to $500 billion, just below the annual economic output of Sweden. Among that group of 209 entrepreneurs and business tycoons, the 100 richest saw their net worth rise 64% in the four years since Mr. Xi took power..." February 27 - Financial Times (Jennifer Hughes and Don Weinland): "Chinese companies have borrowed more money from the international bond market than from domestic investors so far this year, breaking with tradition as authorities in Beijing focus on curbing capital outflows. Banks and other corporate borrowers have been quietly encouraged to raise money offshore in other currencies, limiting the need for Chinese companies to sell renminbi to finance overseas investments. Borrowing more outside the mainland also allows for the possibility companies will remit some of the cash back home, bolstering the Chinese currency in the process. Led by banks and property developers, corporate China has raised $26.1bn from offshore bond sales compared with $21bn at home, according to Dealogic." March 2 - Reuters (Elias Glenn): "China's factory activity expanded for the eighth straight month in February as export orders picked up, a private survey showed..., giving authorities more room to tackle financial risks in the economy as debt continues to rise. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.7 on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from 51.0 in January and beating analysts' forecasts of 50.8." February 28 - Wall Street Journal (Jacky Wong): "China's housing-market party is winding down for now, and the country's biggest developer could have a painful hangover. China Evergrande Group, the poster child for an overleveraged industry, proved again its debt-fueled ambitions haven't yet been reached. According to a filing Tuesday, total borrowings have risen to 565 billion yuan ($82.2bn) as of mid-January, a 48% increase from its June level. Netted out of cash, Evergrande is the most indebted real-estate company globally... The developer, which also owns a soccer club and a plastic-surgery hospital, intends to raise 30 billion yuan by selling stakes in its major subsidiary." February 27 - Financial Times (Tom Hancock): "Bankruptcy cases surged in China last year, indicating growing economic stress as well as progress in the ruling Communist party's efforts to use the country's courts to deal with indebted 'zombie' companies and reduce industrial overcapacity. Chinese courts accepted 5,665 bankruptcy cases in 2016, an increase of 54% from the year before... About 3,600 of those cases were resolved, with 85% of the resolved cases resulting in liquidation. 'It is linked to getting rid of zombie companies and making the economy more efficient,' said Susan Finder, law scholar in residence at Peking University's Shenzhen Graduate School." February 27 - Financial Times (Don Weinland): "Has China's crackdown on capital flight claimed its biggest name to date? The fate of a $1bn deal struck in November by Dalian Wanda, the Chinese real estate and entertainment giant, is in doubt. People with knowledge of Wanda's buyout of the US's Dick Clark Productions, the company behind the Golden Globe Awards, said last week that it was struggling to get approval to move money offshore, putting the transaction at risk. Wanda's deal could survive if approvals come in time, people close to the matter said. But the delay highlights a shift in Beijing's economic priorities." Global Bubble Watch: March 1 - Reuters (Saikat Chatterjee): "Asian factories extended a global manufacturing revival as activity picked up steam in February... Manufacturing surveys for Asia, including for its two biggest economies China and Japan, showed a broadly positive impulse for exports in a welcome sign for many of the companies tapped into the global supply chain. 'Encouragingly, the data indicated that the current upturn in demand remains broad-based across both domestic and international markets, while a further steep increase in purchasing activity raises the prospect of continued production growth in coming months,' said Annabel Fiddes, economist at IHS Markit..." February 28 - Bloomberg (Simon Ballard): "The moment of truth for debt markets beckons. Given the extent to which monetary stimulus in Europe has helped to compress corporate bond spreads and flatten the credit curve, fears may grow over the coming months as to how investors will react to the end of the monetary backstop bid. That will depend on the speed of any reversal. The Bank of England bought 7.4 billion pounds ($9.2 billion) of corporate bonds in the five months through Feb. 22." March 3 - Bloomberg (Katia Dmitrieva): "Toronto home prices jumped more than 20% in February for the sixth straight month as listings dried up, pushing the price of a suburban house beyond C$1 million ($750,000) for the first time, according to the city's real estate board. The average home in Canada's biggest city... climbed 28% to C$875,983 last month from the prior year as active listings were cut in half to 5,400." March 1 - Bloomberg (Emily Cadman): "Dwelling values in Australia's largest city rose at the fastest annual pace in 14-years in February as record-low interest rates outweighed regulatory efforts to avert a housing bubble. Average values in Sydney surged by 18.4%, the biggest jump since December 2002 when the nation was at the tail-end of the early 2000's housing boom, according to... CoreLogic..." Greece Watch: February 26 - Reuters (Michelle Martin): "Greece must not be granted a 'bail in' that would involve creditors taking a loss on their loans, Germany's deputy finance minister said..., reiterating the German government's opposition to debt relief for Athens. 'There must not be a bail-in,' Jens Spahn told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk... 'We think it is very, very likely that we will come to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund that does not require a haircut,' he said, referring to losses that Greece's creditors would have to take if debt was written off." Europe Watch: March 2 - Bloomberg (Maria Tadeo and Lorenzo Totaro): "Euro-area inflation accelerated to the fastest pace since January 2013, providing fresh arguments to those calling for an exit from the European Central Bank's monetary stimulus program. Consumer prices rose 2% in February from a year earlier... In a sign of further increases ahead, producer-price growth jumped to the highest in almost five years, rising 3.5% in January on annual basis..." March 1 - Reuters (Balazs Koranyi): "Euro zone inflation is likely to be sharply higher in 2017 than projected but will still dip towards the end of the year, Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann said..., arguing that accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate. With inflation surging on higher oil prices, and criticism of the European Central Bank (ECB) mounting in Germany ahead of September's elections, pressure has increased on the ECB to at least start a discussion about when and how it would scale back its extraordinary stimulus measures... Weidmann stopped short of calling for any particular measures but argued that keeping borrowing costs low for too long risked getting budgets addicted to cheap cash, making eventual tightening even harder. 'Monetary policy has to avoid the markets' perception that the central bank is only willing to counter downward pressure on financial markets with an accommodative policy stance but refrains from tightening the reins in times of higher price stability risks due to the fear of triggering market turbulences,' he said." March 1 - Reuters (Michael Nienaber): "German inflation, a politically- and emotionally-charged issue for consumers heading for the polls later this year, soared to its highest level in four-and-a-half years in February, bounding past the European Central Bank's euro zone target. Manufacturing was also reported as growing at the strongest rate since 2011, in a further sign that Europe's biggest economy is firing on all cylinders. The inflation data nonetheless triggered fresh calls from Germany for an end to the ECB's loose monetary policy, particularly with the federal election set for September." March 1 - Bloomberg (Alessandro Speciale): "Euro-area manufacturing accelerated for a sixth month in February amid signs that inflation pressures may be starting to build as factories struggle to keep up with demand. A Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to 55.4, IHS Markit said... Companies raised output charges at the fastest pace in more than five years as higher commodity prices and a weaker euro drove up costs, while suppliers took longer to fill orders..." February 28 - Bloomberg (Stefania Spezzati): "France's bonds may suffer the most if there is a greater-than-expected populist election victory in Netherlands in March, one month before the country's own presidential vote. The French securities have recovered in February after falling in recent months, as anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen leads polls for a first round in April but is seeing fading momentum in surveys for a second-round runoff in May. The anti-EU Dutch Freedom Party, or PVV, is forecast in polls to become the largest in parliament and a big victory would again unsettle nerves among investors in euro-area government bonds." Federal Reserve Watch: February 28 - Reuters (Ann Saphir and Jonathan Spicer): "A handful of Federal Reserve policymakers on Tuesday jolted markets into higher expectations for a March U.S. interest rate increase, with comments that suggested rate-setters are worried about waiting too long in the face of pending economic stimulus... New York Fed President William Dudley, among the most influential U.S. central bankers, said on CNN that the case for tightening monetary policy 'has become a lot more compelling' since the election of President Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress. John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said that with the economy at full employment, inflation headed higher, and upside risks from potential tax cuts waiting in the wings, 'I personally don't see any need to delay' raising rates. 'In my view, a rate increase is very much on the table for serious consideration at our March meeting.'" February 28 - Wall Street Journal (Ben Leubsdorf): "U.S. inflation is closing in on the Federal Reserve's long elusive 2% annual target, the latest evidence of firming price pressures that could bolster the case for the central bank to raise short-term interest rates as soon as this month. The personal-consumption-expenditures price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in January from the prior month and climbed 1.9% from a year earlier... Excluding the often volatile categories of food and energy, prices rose 0.3% from December and 1.7% compared with January 2016." March 1 - Bloomberg (Christopher Condon and Matthew Boesler): "One of the Federal Reserve's biggest skeptics about the strength of the global expansion signaled the U.S. economy may be strong enough to withstand an interest-rate increase soon, as key policy makers coalesce around tightening at their next meeting in mid-March. 'Assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path,' Fed Governor Lael Brainard said... 'We are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time.'" U.S. Bubble Watch: March 1 - CNBC (Jeff Cox): "Forget the dot-com boom with its 'irrational exuberance' and the real estate bubble that was supposed to be invincible: Current market sentiment eclipses all of that. In fact, bullishness has never been this high going all the way back to 1987. That's through three rousing bull markets, a couple of crashes, the 'Great Moderation' of the 1990s and all sorts of other history-making events. A market that was supposed to flounder this year under a new president instead has taken off, and investors are pumped. Bullishness is at 63.1% of market professionals responding to the latest Investors Intelligence survey. That's the highest level since the year of the infamous 'Black Monday' Oct. 19, 1987, crash that sent the U.S. market down nearly 23% in one day." March 2 - Financial Times (Robin Wigglesworth): "The number of US exchange traded funds has passed the 2,000 mark, as providers churn out an array of increasingly esoteric products that target investment 'themes' from evangelical values to entrepreneurship and marijuana — with a Trump ETF possibly waiting in the wings. Passive investment funds have continued to suck in record amounts of money this year, despite the improving performance by traditional asset managers." March 3 - Bloomberg (Sid Verma): "Hedge the inauguration, bet the presidency. That's the mantra of investors diving into the U.S. stock rally with only modest downside protection despite a gale of headwinds, from elevated corporate leverage and Federal Reserve rate hikes to U.S. policy risks. Data from Goldman Sachs... show investors have discarded hedges bought in the first leg of the global rally -- between the November election and the end of last year - as they rush headlong into risk. 'Our indicator is now in-line with its most complacent level in the past six years, suggesting investors are generally unhedged across both equities and credit,' derivatives strategists at Goldman, led by John Marshall, wrote..." March 1 - Financial Times (Robin Wigglesworth): "President Donald Trump wants corporate America to invest more in factories, but since the financial crisis more companies have preferred to hoover up their own shares. Yet have buybacks provided bang for their buck? There have been many critics of the recent corporate buyback bonanza, with figures from former US vice-president Joe Biden to BlackRock founder Larry Fink contending companies have eschewed growth-boosting investments in favour of short-term share repurchases, increasingly financing them with cheap debt rather than earnings. But perhaps the most notable thing about the buyback spree — more than $2tn of shares have been repurchased in the past five years — is how it has arguably provided only a modest boost to equity prices, at least compared to the scale of the purchases." March 2 - Bloomberg (Tom Metcalf): "Snap Inc.'s Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy each added $1.6 billion to his fortune Thursday after shares in the photo-sharing mobile app closed at $24.48, 44% above their listing price. Investor appetite for the first technology listing of the year boosted the net worth of each co-founder to $5.3 billion, propelling Spiegel, 26, and Murphy, 28, up more than 150 places on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index..." February 28 - Bloomberg (Austin Weinstein): "Consumer confidence unexpectedly increased in February to the highest level since July 2001 as Americans grew more upbeat about present and future conditions, according to... the... Conference Board. Confidence index advanced to 114.8 (forecast was 111) from a revised 111.6 in January. Present conditions gauge increased to 133.4, the highest since July 2007, from 130..." March 2 - Bloomberg (Patricia Laya): "The fewest Americans in almost 44 years filed applications to collect unemployment benefits last week, indicating the job market continues to power forward. Jobless claims fell by 19,000 to 223,000 in the week ended Feb. 25, the fewest since March 1973..." February 28 - CNBC (Elizabeth Gurdus): "Low inventory and mortgage rates pushed home-price gains to a 30-month high in December, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. The index, which measures all nine U.S. census divisions, found that home prices rose 5.8% year over year, up from November's 5.6% annual gain. The December rise was the highest annual increase since June 2014, when it rose 6.3% vs. to June 2013." February 28 - Financial Times (Adam Samson): "The US equities market as a whole has gotten off to their most tranquil start this year since the mid-1960s, although a look under the hood shows 'major disturbances happening on a stock level,' according to new research from JPMorgan... Over the first two months of the year, the S&P 500 has not posted a gain or loss of greater than 1%, the first time this has occurred since 1966... Underscoring the sense of calm on Wall Street, the Vix index, a measure of expected S&P 500 volatility over the next month, has hovered between 10 - 12 since mid-January, far below the average of 19.6 since 1990..." February 26 - Wall Street Journal (Aaron Back): "Lending growth has recently been slowing in the U.S., a potentially ominous economic signal... Total loans and leases by U.S. commercial banks are currently rising at an annual pace of about 5%, based on weekly seasonally adjusted data from the Federal Reserve. That is down from a 6.4% pace for all of last year and peak rates of around 8% in mid-2016. The deceleration has been broad-based across business, real estate and consumer lending and is at odds with the idea of a stronger economy and rising sentiment. The slowdown has been particularly stark in commercial and industrial lending, which was growing at around 10% in the first half of last year, but is now up just 5.7% from a year earlier." February 28 - Bloomberg (Gabrielle Coppola): "For the first time in his 37 years working at New Jersey car dealerships, Larry Kull had to rent extra space to store unsold new Honda vehicles -- one of the latest signs that the record U.S. auto market is cooling. Across dealer lots in America, inventory is piling up as automakers produce more cars than are being bought. Dealers had about 85 days worth of cars and trucks on hand at the beginning of February -- about 22 days more than at the beginning of 2017 and eight days more than a year earlier, according to Automotive News Data Center." February 26 - CNBC (Stephanie Landsman): "The man often hailed as the original 'Dr. Doom' is warning investors that the U.S. stock market is vulnerable to a seismic sell-off—one that could start any time in a very unassuming way. Marc Faber, the editor of 'The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report,' predicted the rally's disruption won't be caused by any single catalyst. His argument: Stocks are very overbought and sentiment is way too bullish for the so-called Trump rally to continue. 'Very simply, the market starts to go down. As it goes down, it will start triggering selling, and then it will be like an avalanche,' said Faber recently on 'Futures Now.' 'I would underweight U.S. stocks.'" Japan Watch: February 28 - Financial Times (Robin Harding and Elaine Moore): "The Bank of Japan published detailed schedules of planned asset purchases for the first time on Tuesday as it seeks to prove its commitment to a zero per cent cap on 10-year government bond yields. Japan's central bank said it will buy a minimum of ¥1.375tn and a maximum of ¥2.175tn of government bonds during March... Setting out the purchase plan in advance makes it less likely that the BoJ will skip an auction — a common subject of market speculation as the central bank accumulates an ever larger share of outstanding government bonds through its programme of monetary easing." Leveraged Speculation Watch: February 28 - Bloomberg: "Hedge funds are raising their exposure to commodities as prices rally and investors respond to macro shifts including the prospect of accelerating inflation under U.S. President Donald Trump, according to Citigroup Inc. 'After two years of scaling back exposure to commodities, the fund community finally appears to be growing interested in the sector again,' the bank's analysts including Aakash Doshi and David Wilson wrote... They attributed record net-long positions... in markets including Comex copper and Nymex crude oil, at least partly to increased allocation of fund money." Geopolitical Watch: March 3 - Reuters (Adam Jourdan): "South Korean firms are being squeezed in China, in suspected retaliation for Seoul's deployment of a U.S. missile defense system, highlighting the tools China can deploy to hit back at the corporate interests of trade partners it disagrees with. The chill facing Korea Inc, from cosmetics and supermarket chains to autos and tourism, points to a potential risk for American companies... In China, state media and grassroots political groups have led angry calls to boycott popular Korean products. Photos on social media and local news websites showed crowds vandalizing a Hyundai Motor Co. car, and some Chinese tourism firms moved to cancel Korean tours." February 25 - Reuters (Ben Blanchard and Michael Martina): "The PLA Navy is likely to secure significant new funding in China's upcoming defense budget as Beijing seeks to check U.S. dominance of the high seas and step up its own projection of power around the globe... Now, with President Donald Trump promising a U.S. shipbuilding spree and unnerving Beijing with his unpredictable approach on hot button issues including Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, China is pushing to narrow the gap with the U.S. Navy. 'It's opportunity in crisis,' said a Beijing-based Asian diplomat, of China's recent naval moves. 'China fears Trump will turn on them eventually as he's so unpredictable and it's getting ready."     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Author: Doug Noland Doug Noland Credit Bubble Bulletin I just wrapped up 25 years (persevering) as a "professional bear." My lucky break came in late-1989, when I was hired by Gordon Ringoen to be the trader for his short-biased hedge fund in San Francisco. Working as a short-side trader, analyst and portfolio manager during the great nineties bull market - for one of the most brilliant individuals I've met - was an exciting, demanding and, in the end, a grueling and absolutely invaluable learning experience. Later in the nineties, I had stints at Fleckenstein Capital and East Shore Partners. In January 1999, I began my 16 year run with PrudentBear, working as strategist and portfolio manager with David Tice in Dallas until the bear funds were sold in December 2008. In the early-nineties, I became an impassioned reader of The Richebacher Letter. The great Dr. Richebacher opened my eyes to Austrian economics and solidified my lifetime passion for economics and macro analysis. I had the good fortune to assist Dr. Richebacher with his publication from 1996 through 2001. Prior to my work in investments, I worked as a treasury analyst at Toyota's U.S. headquarters. It was working at Toyota during the Japanese Bubble period and the 1987 stock market crash where I first recognized my love for macro analysis. Fresh out of college I worked as a Price Waterhouse CPA. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Oregon (Accounting and Finance majors, 1984) and later received an MBA from Indiana University (1989). By late in the nineties, I was convinced that momentous developments were unfolding in finance, the markets and policymaking that were going unrecognized by conventional analysis and the media. I was inspired to start my blog, which became the Credit Bubble Bulletin, by the desire to shed light on these developments. I believe there is great value in contemporaneous analysis, and I'll point to Benjamin Anderson's brilliant writings in the "Chase Economic Bulletin" during the Roaring Twenties and Great Depression era. Ben Bernanke has referred to understanding the forces leading up to the Great Depression as the "Holy Grail of Economics." I believe "The Grail" will instead be discovered through knowledge and understanding of the current extraordinary global Bubble period.

 A tiny London firm run by a couple of 30-somethings won a slice of Snap's IPO at the last minute Matt Turner Mar. 3, 2017, 2:17 PM 24,441 facebook linkedin twitter email print Drew Angerer/Getty Snap Inc. just raised a greater-than-expected $3.4 billion in the largest US tech initial public offering in over two years. Given that the typical IPO raises less than $500 million, pulling off a sale of this size takes a lot of work. Naturally, Snap drafted some heavyweight banks with huge sales forces for the job. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs led the deal, along with a long list of banks including the likes of JPMorgan, Allen & Company, and UBS. But the list also includes a less familiar name: Connaught (UK) Limited. Connaught, a small London firm set up in 2014, wasn't named in Snap's first IPO filing in early February. But it did appear in Snap's updated filing just a few days ago. It is listed as having sold 307,692 shares, worth about $5.2 million at the IPO price of $17. There's not a lot of information out there about Connaught. It has a basic website with a mailing address and an email address. It was incorporated December 29, 2014, and has three directors: Ian Osborne, Alex Usher-Smith, and Dr. Marcel Reichart. Osborne and Usher-Smith, ages 33 and 35, specialize in advising tech, media, and internet companies. Osborne set up Osborne & Partners, an international strategic advisory firm that once hosted a Davos, Switzerland, party with tech billionaire Sean Parker and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff. Usher-Smith is a former Lazard and Greenhill banker. Reichart is the executive vice president of digital development and partnerships at the German media company Bertelsmann, according to his LinkedIn profile. The role on the Snap IPO is a coup for the firm, which has fewer than 10 employees, according to its LinkedIn profile. Connaught is not a US registered broker-dealer, and so any shares it sold in the US had to pass through Global Alliance Securities. Osborne and Usher-Smith did not return messages seeking comment in time for publication.

 7 questions to make sure your financial adviser is on your side, according to the one who helped Tony Robbins write his second book about money Richard Feloni Mar. 4, 2017, 11:16 AM 7,376 facebook linkedin twitter email print Performance coach Tony Robbins. Sarah Jacobs Tony Robbins became the world's most famous performance coach through decades of energetic seminars and high-profile clients, but he's made spreading personal finance knowledge his mission the past couple years. Around 2010, Robbins began speaking with what would become 50 of the United States' top financial minds, including his longtime client Paul Tudor Jones, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, and JP Morgan Asset Management CEO Mary Callahan Erdoes. One of the recurring themes he found is that the American public — even those who had accumulated a degree of wealth — needed to become better educated about their relationship to financial advisers, and how they could avoid losing thousands of dollars in the longterm. Robbins recently came by Business Insider's New York office for a Facebook Live Q&A where he discussed his latest book based on these interviews, "Unshakeable," a much slimmer version of his 2014 book "Money: Master the Game," with additional insights from Peter Mallouk, who was rated the No. 1 wealth adviser in the US by Barron's three times, and who brought Robbins into his firm Creative Planning in 2016. "If you're watching right now, there's a new word you've got to learn. It's an F word: Fiduciary," Robbins told the audience. He explained that it's crucial to understand the difference between brokers, who will prioritize the interests of their firm, and fiduciaries, who are legally obligated to prioritize their client's interests. It's especially important to know, especially since a proposed fiduciary rule that would require all financial advisers to be fiduciaries looks like it will not pass under the Trump administration. Robbins pointed to seven questions in "Unshakeable" — developed with the help of Mallouk — that everyone needs to ask their financial adviser, whether they're looking to manage a few thousand dollars or significant wealth. 1. 'Are you a registered investment advisor?' Registered investment advisors (RIAs) are fiduciaries, as opposed to brokers. Opponents to a fiduciary rule becoming law, like President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, find it to be an unnecessary restriction on how advisers can serve their clients, who may want to invest in higher-risk funds. But regardless of your approach or politics, you need to know who you're dealing with. 2. 'Are you or your firm affiliated with a broker-dealer? There are approximately 310,000 financial advisers in the US, and about 10% of them are RIAs. "Unfortunately, I uncovered a gray part of the law," Robbins said. "And of the 31,000 people that are RIAs, literally 26,000 of them, so the vast majority, are what we call dually registered. That means they're a broker and they're an RIA." To see if your adviser can switch hats, Robbins recommends looking at the adviser's website and seeing if there's a sentence like, "Securities offered through [adviser's company name], member FINRA [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority] and SIPC [Securities Investor Protection Corporation]." 3. 'Does your firm offer proprietary mutual funds or separately managed accounts?' "You want the answer to be an emphatic no," Robbins writes of the two products, which are less transparent and potentially more expensive than a typical mutual fund.  "It probably means they're looking to generate additional revenues by steering you into these products that are highly profitable for them (but probably not for you)." In a conversation with Mallouk recorded last year, Mallouk noted that it becomes an easy choice to offer your firm's proprietary mutual funds to your clients when you'll be getting an extra commission, especially when you know the people managing those funds. Separately managed accounts are alternatives to mutual funds for wealthy individuals, and they do not come with prospectuses, meaning clients need to perform their own due diligence. If you're not a sophisticated investor who specifically wants this approach, you're better off steering clear.  4. 'Do you or your firm receive any third-party compensation for recommending particular investments?' "This is the ultimate question you want answered," Robbins writes. "Because you need to know that your advisor has no incentive to recommend products that will shower him or her with commissions, kickbacks, consulting fees, trips, or other goodies." 5. 'What's your philosophy when it comes to investing?' Robbins and Mallouk recommend avoiding high-risk investments for the average investor, but however you want to invest your money, you need to understand how it's being invested. 6. 'What financial planning services do you offer beyond investment strategy and portfolio management?' You may only need investment help at your particular stage in life, but you should consider where you want to be headed. "Ideally you want an advisor who can bring tools for tax efficiency in all aspects of your planning — from your investment planning to your business planning to your estate planning," Robbins writes. 7. 'Where will my money be held?' "A fiduciary advisor should always use a third-party custodian [like Fidelity or Schwab] to hold your funds," Robbins writes. "You then sign a limited power of attorney that gives the advisor the right to manage the money but never to make withdrawals." This allows you to switch advisers whenever you'd like without having to move your accounts — and it also helps you keep from falling victim to a con man!

The city of Spokane Valley filed a lawsuit on March 1, 2017 against JP Morgan Chase Bank over this nuisance property at 11112 E. 17th Ave. (Pia Hallenberg / The Spokesman-Review) By Pia Hallenberg piah@spokesman.com(509) 459-5427 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS View full map Neighbors are drawing a sigh of relief after squatters were evicted from a nuisance property at 11112 E. 17th Ave. in Spokane Valley. The rancher has been without power for some time and had broken cars and trash piled in a front yard covered in dog feces. The city of Spokane Valley is now suing JP Morgan Chase Bank, and the unnamed occupants of the property, trying to recoup some of its expenses. “The bank foreclosed on the property within the last couple of months,” said Erik Lamb, Spokane Valley deputy city attorney. “There are limitations under the law as to how the bank can get even squatters out – it can be a lengthy process.” Lamb said squatters were evicted Wednesday because the home was unsafe and unfit for human occupancy, as power and gas to the property had been turned off. Neighbors said squatters burned trash and parts of the interior of the home in the fireplace, and that vehicles were constantly coming and going. Over the years, neighbors made countless calls to authorities and some said they are relieved to see the home boarded up and empty. One neighbor said the home’s residents stole power from her using an extension cord. Lamb said another property in the neighborhood, at 11414 E. 16th Ave., is being cleaned up, too. “That one is a little different as initially we had an order to clean up all the junk around the property,” Lamb said. “But now it has no power and no gas, so it’s unsafe for human occupancy.” Zombie properties – homes that were foreclosed on and are now owned by holding companies and banks located in other states – often fall into disrepair. Lamb said it can be a challenge to find out who exactly owns a ghost property, but this one wasn’t too difficult. “It’s a nice neighborhood. We hope something can get into it and clean it up,” Lamb said. “Though it will probably take a lot of time and money to get it to where you can live there.” Updated: March 4, 2017, 9:36 a.m.  Tags: Erik Lamb, ghost property, JP Morgan Chase Bank, nuisance, Spokane Valley, zombie property Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

UNT finance senior leads presentation to regents By Jenna Duncan Jenna Duncan Denton Record-Chronicle Staff Writer jduncan@dentonrc.com Published: 03 March 2017 11:31 PM To finance seven ongoing construction projects across the University of North Texas System, officials had to sell bonds in January to pay for the work. In addition to the regular finance team, James Verfurth, a senior finance major, accompanied the team for a two-day trip to New York to work with financial service companies JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays to sell $264.1 million worth of bonds. Over two days, Verfurth sat in meetings with UNT and bank officials, watched the bonds go to market and met with a variety of executives at both companies. “It was an eye-opening experience,” Verfurth said of the early January trip. “I genuinely enjoy finance and it was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up — I observed something that directly impacts students.” After, he gave a presentation about the experience and bond sales to the Board of Regents last week in Dallas. Over the course of eight minutes, Verfurth explained the sale of new bonds and refinancing of others, totaling $264.1 million. With refinancing, the system saves $7.1 million and reduces the average debt service the system has to pay. “We definitely entered at a good time and it was a favorable entry point for us into the market,” he told the board. “That gave us a phenomenal focus, and we were definitely center stage and center of attention, as far as what institutions and investors were looking at.” Board members whispered among themselves during his presentation. Neal Smatresk, UNT president, turned back from his seat to Luke Lybrand, the UNT System treasury manager who introduced Verfurth, to tell him, “Good job.” At the end of his presentation, board President Brint Ryan asked if Verfurth was sure he wanted to move to Philadelphia for a job with Wells Fargo in June. After the meeting, Ryan, who has been on the board since 2009, said he had never seen a student give this level of presentation to the board before. “I was very impressed with James’ presentation,” he said in an email. “I’ve never seen a student present to the board at this level and I would have hired him on the spot — if he wasn’t already headed to Wells Fargo.” JENNA DUNCAN can be reached at 940-566-6889 and via Twitter at @JennaFDuncan.

According to SEC filings, lead underwriter Morgan Stanley got 60 million Snap shares, or, 30.2 percent of the shares given to underwriters — which would mean $25.71 million in fees, the biggest cut of any bank. The second biggest —Goldman — sold nearly 50 million shares, or 24.8 percent, amounting to about $21.08 million. Other big chunks went to JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, while a slew of more than 20 other banks sold slivers, each less than 10 percent. (Some of these banks could also have been paid additional fees that haven't yet been disclosed.) Getty Images Signage for Snap Inc., parent company of Snapchat, is displayed on monitors on the floor New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) before the opening bell, March 2, 2017 in New York City. Here's how it works: A group of banks work with Snap and potential early IPO buyers -- mainly large institutional investors -- to figure how how many shares they'll be able to sell at what price. The banks keep a percentage of the total amount raised, and give the rest to Snap. That percentage is subject to negotiation. Snap's $3.4 billion IPO raised more than twice as much as every 2016 venture-backed tech IPO combined, according to Renaissance Capital. But the 2.5 percent underwriting fee for the banks could be the third-lowest ever for a major technology offering, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year. show chapters Snap gets snapped up    Friday, 3 Mar 2017 | 6:35 AM ET | 01:07 Snap's IPO underwriters had a difficult task, Recode reports: They wanted to make sure the IPO price was not too high or too low before it hit the public market, as early investors and founders of the company wanted a fair deal.

That includes one unlikely addition: chief strategy officer Imran Khan. Khan, only at Snap for about two years, has been granted $145 million worth of shares, the company said in a filing on February 2. Those shares will likely be worth a lot more at the IPO price. And he was paid a $5 million bonus last year. Not bad for a guy who, not long ago, was working for “some bucket research shop.” That’s how one Wall Streeter described Khan’s early career. (He did indeed work at a small company, called Fulcrum Global Partners, until about 2004; it shut its doors in 2006.) Khan, 39, joined Snap in early 2015, in part to help chart the company’s path to an initial public offering, though his official role has been to build up revenue, expand the business, and run ad sales. He was hired from Credit Suisse, where he was head of global internet investment banking and was perhaps best known for his leading role on the initial public offering of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group in 2014, the largest share sale ever. When news of his move to Snap broke it made headlines, but Khan is not the only Wall Streeter to wind up playing the “grown-up” in a technology startup. Anthony Noto, once the head of technology banking at Goldman Sachs, was already Twitter’s finance chief. Ruth Porat would make the move from Morgan Stanley to Alphabet, Google’s parent. For Khan, this wasn’t the first major pivot in his then 15-year career. ‘A very strategic thinker’ Business Insider spoke with six executives who worked directly with Khan at various points in his career. They all asked not to be identified for this story. Through a spokesman, Khan declined to comment for this story. Khan’s career has taken him from an investment-banking job at ING Barings, the Dutch financial-services firm, to conducting sell-side research at JPMorgan and eventually running the technology banking franchise at Credit Suisse. His former colleagues describe him as ambitious and strategic in his career choices. Though most spoke in friendly terms, it’s clear that his rise and transition from research analyst to internet banker and now tech-industry millionaire rubbed some the wrong way. One person, for example, felt that Khan failed to credit others for helping him make the switch from research to banking, saying Khan “clawed his way up.” But that kind of talk was dismissed by other colleagues as plain old jealousy among bankers who once would’ve been peers but perhaps have found themselves courting Khan for a role on Snap’s IPO, likely to be the biggest tech flotation since Alibaba’s sale in September 2014. Born and raised in Bangladesh, Khan came to the US as a student, to Colorado, where he graduated from the University of Denver ‘s Daniels College of Business in 2000. After a stint at a tiny Denver-based satellite-broadband startup called WildBlue, he wound up at ING Barings in New York in 2000, according to his profile on BrokerCheck . After the banking business was sold to ABN Amro in 2001, he wound up at Fulcrum (the “bucket research shop”). There, he began to conduct “sell-side” research on technology companies such as Yahoo, Amazon, and eBay. Khan moved to JPMorgan in 2004 where he eventually became head of global internet and US entertainment equity research. He’s been described as steeped in the tech industry, close to executives, and is married to an executive at an Amazon-owned e-commerce company. At JPMorgan, Khan became one of the top-ranked internet analysts on the Street, landing the coveted top or second spot in Institutional Investor’s annual rankings of researchers. He was also one of the youngest managing directors at JPMorgan, having attained the title at 29. Khan’s meteoric rise and the accolades were carefully cultivated, one person said. “He’s a very strategic thinker,” the person said. “He’s the type of guy who ranked at JPMorgan as a research analyst not because he’s the smartest guy or the best stock picker ... but he’s a very affable, likable guy. He knew how to work the system.” This person said that Khan would build up relationships with company CEOs so that he could get the first question on quarterly-earnings calls. “He’s always thinking about that stuff.” ‘A testament to his scrappiness’ That strategic thinking soon had Khan building relationships with China’s budding technology companies, which were flocking to the US IPO market in the mid-2000s. The payoff on those came with his first big switch. He felt like a banker in a research analyst’s clothing. How Imran Khan swapped Wall Street for a huge role at Snapchat Business Insider India When Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, its sale will prove a windfall for a handful of executives who helped grow the company from a tiny startup to a $24 billion juggernaut in five years, reports the Business Insider India.

Check out the latest theme park experiences and attractions Business Uber rides, fancy lounges among credit cards' perks intended to win your business Credit card security in the U.S. French digital security company Oberthur Technologies is hoping to revolutionize credit cards by developing a digital display powered by a micro-thin battery and what it calls Motion Code technology. French digital security company Oberthur Technologies is hoping to revolutionize credit cards by developing a digital display powered by a micro-thin battery and what it calls Motion Code technology. Jonnelle MarteWashington Post Privacy Policy The battle for credit card users is heating up again. On Thursday, American Express announced that it will start offering Platinum cardholders up to $200 a year in Uber credits, expanded access to airport lounges and other perks. It is the second time since October that the company has sweetened its reward system in what credit card experts say is a clear effort to compete against the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which generated a ton of buzz last summer when it launched with a lucrative 100,000 point sign-up bonus. "More than anything Amex wants to hold on to the customers they currently have," says Zach Honig, editor in chief of ThePointsGuy.com, a site that tracks and compares credit card rewards. As part of the changes, Amex Platinum members can receive $15 in Uber credits each month, with an extra $20 in December. Cardholders can also earn up to five times the rewards points on hotel stays if they book through Amex's website. That follows a similar change the company made in October for flights booked directly through airlines or through Amex. JPMorgan Chase disrupted the premier credit card market last year when it introduced the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card with a new customer bonus worth up to $1,500 in rewards for cardholders, credit card experts say. Wells Fargo's collateral damage: Customers' credit scores A Wells Fargo Bank in Palo Alto shown on April 19, 2010. (Associated Press) The unwanted accounts created by Wells Fargo & Co. employees trying to hit aggressive sale goals have already forced the bank to provide some 100,000 customers with refunds averaging $25 for fees and other expenses. But that may be the easy part. There also is the collateral financial damage caused by the scandal, which involved not only more than 1 million savings and checking accounts, but applications for more than 500,000 credit cards.

See more videos Demand was so high the bank temporarily ran out of the metal being used to make the flashy cards. The eye-popping offer yielded a lot of attention from millennials and so-called credit card churners, who have a habit of opening new credit cards just to cash in on the signup bonuses. The bold move was not cheap, reducing the bank's profit by up to $300 million in the fourth quarter, chief executive Jamie Dimon said during an investor conference in December. Competitors mostly sat on the sidelines at first, waiting to see how sustainable the move would be, analysts say. But after Chase slashed the sign-up bonus in half to 50,000 points in January, Amex is stepping up its game and other card companies may follow, says Sean McQuay, a credit card expert for the personal finance website NerdWallet. Financial world eyes interest rates, regulatory rollbacks Marco Santana A continually improving economy should boost the banking industry and consumer finance in 2017, but there's also uncertainty about the impact of the Trump Administration. On one hand, efforts in Washington D.C. to kill regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 could help banks, but others warn...

On one hand, efforts in Washington D.C. to kill regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 could help banks, but others warn... (Marco Santana) "The Chase Sapphire Reserve demonstrated that there is a much larger premium credit card market than anyone thought," says McQuay. "The other premium credit card players have wanted to fight back." While these kind of cards can be attractive, experts say there's on major factor to consider before making the leap: their hefty annual fee. As a part of the latest change, Amex upped the annual fee for the Platinum card to $550 from $450. That makes it more expensive than the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card and the Citi Prestige, which each charge $450 a year. Consumers should also make sure the card they choose offers that match their spending habits, credit card experts say. For example, people who don't use Uber regularly throughout the year may not be able to take full advantage of the new rewards from Amex, which will expire unused credits at the end of each month.

News RELATED STORIES ICBC muscles Goldman Sachs from Asia dollar bond top ten rankings Pimco cuts investment risk in Asia; bullish on India and Indonesia Yuan joins elite club of IMF reserve currencies Bond yields to rise as central banks run out of rope: Pimco Qatar donates $10mn to fund to fight Aids, TB and malaria BlackRock headquarters is seen in New York. BlackRock has said the inclusion of yuan debt in global indexes could be announced in 2017, and that the firm has hired for credit research in China. Text Size: A A A Bloomberg/Hong Kong Speculation that China’s 56.3tn yuan ($8.2tn) bond market is about to go more global is spurring investment funds to hire in the nation. A central bank official said at the end of last year that China will create conditions for the inclusion of yuan debt in global indexes. BlackRock has said inclusion could be announced in 2017, and that the firm has hired for credit research in the nation. Invesco says such a development may come in the next 12 months, and also aims to expand in the country. Adding Chinese notes to global indexes including those from Bloomberg Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup would bring cash into the nation from yield-hungry investors from New York to Tokyo. Managers of that wealth will need to navigate rising defaults and local ratings that many have questioned. Investment firms also want to sell more products to a growing legion of wealthy Chinese investors, after greater market access was allowed. “We are seeing increased interest among global asset managers to develop an investment capability for the onshore Chinese bond market,” said Nick Aylwin-Foster, who runs headhunting firm Sheffield Haworth’s asset management practice for Asia. “Within fixed income, hiring is primarily into the credit research teams.” BlackRock has hired a couple of people in Shanghai who focus on credit research in the domestic bond market, according to Gregor Carle, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income product strategy. “We continue to build that coverage because we see this greater opportunity set coming out of China, and of course, the potential index inclusion that’s further down the line,” he said. Fidelity International is building out its investment team in Shanghai, Jackson Lee, country head for China, said in January. A spokeswoman for the money manager said there is no update to that plan. Amid shifting regulations and hiring challenges, many funds are still deciding on such a move. They must weigh downsides that include “a gap between when you commit to a new market and when you actually start seeing returns,” according to Aylwin-Foster at Sheffield Haworth. Timing on index inclusion is also uncertain. Joining global debt indexes isn’t a priority at this stage and the nation is in no rush for its shares to enter the MSCI Inc’s benchmark indexes, Fang Xinghai, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in January. The People’s Bank of China and other departments will work to improve rules to give foreign investors easier access to the interbank bond market and create conditions for the inclusion of yuan debt in global indexes, Ma Jun, chief economist of the PBoC’s research bureau, said in December. Still, China presents a unique opportunity for fixed-income fund managers. Foreign holdings account for only about 1.4% of the nation’s interbank bond market, making it “one of the most untapped opportunities” in global asset management, according to Nicholas Britz, senior associate at Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. Fidelity International said in January that its wholly foreign-owned enterprise in Shanghai became the first global asset manager to register with the Asset Management Association of China as a private fund management company. The qualification allows the firm to create onshore investment products for Chinese institutional and high-net-worth investors for the first time, it said in a statement. Andrew Lo, chief executive officer at Invesco Asia-Pacific, said in an e-mail interview that the firm has plans for its own wholly foreign-owned enterprise and aims to register it with AMAC to become a private fund management company. “The WFOE will provide on-the-ground support to our Hong Kong-based Greater China investment team that is offering Chinese investment products to global investors,” said Lo. Invesco already has a joint venture with Chinese partners including Great Wall Securities Co and Lo added that the firm is “very committed” to expand its presence in the country. He said he sees “growing demand” from Chinese institutions to diversify fund managers and investment strategies. “The game of managing renminbi fixed income is very much moving to the onshore market,” said Britz at Z-Ben Advisors. “Assuming you can build out an effective renminbi credit team, you’ll definitely be pulling ahead of your global rivals.” Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, owns the former Barclays Risk Analytics and Index Solutions business, including the benchmark indexes, which have been co-branded as “Bloomberg Barclays” indexes. Bloomberg Barclays overhauled its China fixed-income gauges and started a Global Aggregate + China index on March 1, while stopping short of adding the nation to major benchmark indexes. 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

U.S. equities suffered their largest one-day loss since January on Thursday, in a dramatic attitude shift after Wednesday’s massive “meltup” that pushed the Dow Jones industrials index over the 21,000 level for the first time. That jump was at least in part due to apparent excitement over President Donald Trump’s more moderate tone in his address to Congress on Tuesday night. But less than 24 hours later, investor sentiment was chilled by more “Russian influence” headlines for the Trump White House and increasingly hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve ahead of a speech by Chair Janet Yellen on Friday. Other headwinds include a rapid marking down of first-quarter GDP growth expectations, tepid earnings growth and very extended sentiment measures. Investors would do well to use this opportunity to cautiously consider trimming their exposure, rebalancing out of relatively expensive stocks. Watch: Trump to zero in on economy, security in first Congress speech Instead, mom-and-pop investors seem to be doing the exact opposite: A recent report by JPMorgan shows retail investors have poured more than $80 billion into “passive” index funds while institutional investors are backing away.  Here are three good reasons to be nervous. First, the Fed is suddenly making very hawkish noises heading into the March policy meeting in less than two weeks. Futures market odds of another quarter-point hike have pushed above 90 percent, well more than the threshold that triggered rate hikes in December 2015 and December 2016.  Consider this collection of comments this week sharing a common theme that more rate hikes are needed soon: New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for tightening had become a lot more compelling.San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he expects a rate hike to receive a “serious consideration” at the March policy meeting.Fed Governor Lael Brainard, one of the most dovish Fed policymakers, said continued removal of policy accommodation was likely to be appropriate soon. She cited positive momentum in incoming data, evidence of a labor market near full employment and rising inflation pressures.And Fed Governor Jerome Powell told CNBC that the case for a March rate hike had “come together,” while reiterating his expectations for three rate hikes in 2017. A more aggressive pace of rate hikes is a huge change in the monetary policy stance that, frankly, isn’t getting the attention it deserves. Consider that the Fed has raised interest rates only twice in the last 10 years, but it’s poised to accelerate that to two hikes in just three months.  Second, GDP growth expectations are actually moving lower, in sharp contrast to the post-election triumphalism about deregulation, tax cuts and more stimulus from Mr. Trump. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow real-time estimate of first-quarter growth has fallen to just 1.7 percent.  As for earnings, while analysts are looking for S&P 500 profits to grow 9.8 percent in 2017, an aggressive market rally has pushed the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio to 17.9 vs. a 10-year average of 14.4. Third, turning back to Mr. Trump, Wall Street is cooling to hopes that proposed tax cuts and other reforms will be forthcoming. Goldman Sachs has warned taxes are increasingly a story for 2018, not 2017.  UBS strategist Yianos Kontopoulos, in a recent note to clients, warned amid rising complacency that “the market is learning that new U.S. policy initiatives may also be slower to come.” While he doesn’t believe this could necessarily lead to a sell-off, he thinks the “upside in stocks may be moderate” and investors should consider adding some long-term bond holdings to rebalance their risk profile. Wells Fargo strategist Paul Christopher noted that while the president’s “sweeping and conciliatory” speech was well received on Tuesday, a lack of clear policy guidance from the White House means “Congress may struggle with divisions over crucial decisions.” Witness internal stifle within the GOP over plans to reform health care. Amid tepid economic growth and policy tightening from the Fed, investors may realize their enthusiasm went a little too far as Mr. Trump’s economic initiatives get bogged down by typical Washington gridlock.   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Rhonda Schaffler Mar 3, 2017 10:56 AM EST Many families aren't prepared for unexpected bills, and it can take them a year to dig out of the debt they cause. That's one of the findings from a new survey by JPMorgan Chase Institute, which looked at the financial health of American households. The survey found that almost four in 10 families faced unplanned medical, auto repair or tax bills, which cost about $1,500 on average. In some cases, it took those families a full year to recover financially after the payment. Fiona Greig, the institute's director of consumer research, discussed the study with TheStreet's Rhonda Schaffler in New York.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jonnelle Marte By Jonnelle Marte March 3 Follow @jonnelle Credit card companies are stepping up their efforts to compete for high spending customers. (BernardaSv/iStock) The battle for credit card users is heating up again. On Thursday, American Express announced that it will start offering Platinum cardholders up to $200 a year in Uber credits, expanded access to airport lounges and other perks. It is the second time since October that the company has sweetened its reward system in what credit card experts say is a clear effort to compete against the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which generated a ton of buzz last summer when it launched with a lucrative 100,000-point sign-up bonus. “More than anything Amex wants to hold on to the customers they currently have,” says Zach Honig, editor in chief of ThePointsGuy.com, a site that tracks and compares credit card rewards. As part of the changes, Amex Platinum members can receive $15 in Uber credits each month, with an extra $20 in December. Cardholders can also  earn up to five times the rewards points on hotel stays if they book through Amex’s website. That follows a similar change the company made in October for flights booked directly through airlines or through Amex. JPMorgan Chase disrupted the premier credit card market last year when it introduced the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card with a new customer bonus worth up to $1,500 in rewards for cardholders, credit card experts say. Demand was so high the bank temporarily ran out of the metal being used to make the flashy cards. The eye-popping offer yielded a lot of attention from millennials and so-called credit card churners who have a habit of opening new credit cards just to cash in on the signup bonuses. The bold move was not cheap, reducing the bank’s profit by up to $300 million in the fourth quarter, chief executive Jamie Dimon said during an investor conference in December. Competitors mostly sat on the sidelines at first, waiting to see how sustainable the move would be, analysts say. But after Chase slashed the sign-up bonus in half to 50,000 points in January, Amex is stepping up its game and other card companies may follow, says Sean McQuay, a credit card expert for the personal finance website NerdWallet. “The Chase Sapphire Reserve demonstrated that there is a much larger premium credit card market than anyone thought,” McQuay says. “The other premium credit card players have wanted to fight back.” Although these kinds of cards can be attractive, experts say there’s one major factor to consider before making the leap: their hefty annual fee. As a part of the latest change, Amex upped the annual fee for the Platinum card to $550 from $450. That makes it more expensive than the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card and the Citi Prestige, which each charge $450 a year. (This is the first time it has increased the annual fee in more than a decade, an Amex spokeswoman said, noting that the higher fee comes with more generous rewards.) Cardholders can earn some of those fees back in the form of statement credits offered for travel purchases and other perks, the company said. For example, Amex offers a $200 credit for airline fees, in addition to the new Uber credits. The Chase Sapphire Reserve offers a $300 annual credit for travel purchases, such as flights and hotels. Consumers should also make sure the card they choose offers perks that match their spending habits, credit card experts say. For example, people who don’t use Uber regularly throughout the year may not be able to take full advantage of the new rewards from Amex, which will expire unused credits at the end of each month. Basically, the decision should come down to whether consumers think they will be able to take advantage of credits and how savvy they will be about redeeming their points, McQuay says.

That jump was at least in part due to apparent excitement over President Donald Trump’s more moderate tone in his address to Congress on Tuesday night. But less than 24 hours later, investor sentiment was chilled by more “Russian influence” headlines for the Trump White House and increasingly hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve ahead of a speech by Chair Janet Yellen on Friday. Other headwinds include a rapid marking down of first-quarter GDP growth expectations, tepid earnings growth and very extended sentiment measures. Investors would do well to use this opportunity to cautiously consider trimming their exposure, rebalancing out of relatively expensive stocks. Play Video CBS This Morning Trump to zero in on economy, security in first Congress speech President Trump will speak to a joint session of Congress Tuesday for the first time, laying out his legislative priorities for the year to come.... Instead, mom-and-pop investors seem to be doing the exact opposite: A recent report by JPMorgan shows retail investors have poured more than $80 billion into “passive” index funds while institutional investors are backing away. Here are three good reasons to be nervous. First, the Fed is suddenly making very hawkish noises heading into the March policy meeting in less than two weeks. Futures market odds of another quarter-point hike have pushed above 90 percent, well more than the threshold that triggered rate hikes in December 2015 and December 2016.  Consider this collection of comments this week sharing a common theme that more rate hikes are needed soon: New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for tightening had become a lot more compelling. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he expects a rate hike to receive a “serious consideration” at the March policy meeting. Fed Governor Lael Brainard, one of the most dovish Fed policymakers, said continued removal of policy accommodation was likely to be appropriate soon. She cited positive momentum in incoming data, evidence of a labor market near full employment and rising inflation pressures. And Fed Governor Jerome Powell told CNBC that the case for a March rate hike had “come together,” while reiterating his expectations for three rate hikes in 2017. A more aggressive pace of rate hikes is a huge change in the monetary policy stance that, frankly, isn’t getting the attention it deserves. Consider that the Fed has raised interest rates only twice in the last 10 years, but it’s poised to accelerate that to two hikes in just three months. Play Video CBS Evening News What's behind the stock market's Trump rally A new CBS News poll found that 61 percent of Americans believe the economy is in good shape, the highest number since the Great Recession. A surg... Second, GDP growth expectations are actually moving lower, in sharp contrast to the post-election triumphalism about deregulation, tax cuts and more stimulus from Mr. Trump. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow real-time estimate of first-quarter growth has fallen to just 1.7 percent.  As for earnings, while analysts are looking for S&P 500 profits to grow 9.8 percent in 2017, an aggressive market rally has pushed the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio to 17.9 vs. a 10-year average of 14.4. Third, turning back to Mr. Trump, Wall Street is cooling to hopes that proposed tax cuts and other reforms will be forthcoming. Goldman Sachs has warned taxes are increasingly a story for 2018, not 2017.  UBS strategist Yianos Kontopoulos, in a recent note to clients, warned amid rising complacency that “the market is learning that new U.S. policy initiatives may also be slower to come.” While he doesn’t believe this could necessarily lead to a sell-off, he thinks the “upside in stocks may be moderate” and investors should consider adding some long-term bond holdings to rebalance their risk profile. Wells Fargo strategist Paul Christopher noted that while the president’s “sweeping and conciliatory” speech was well received on Tuesday, a lack of clear policy guidance from the White House means “Congress may struggle with divisions over crucial decisions.” Witness internal stifle within the GOP over plans to reform health care. Amid tepid economic growth and policy tightening from the Fed, investors may realize their enthusiasm went a little too far as Mr. Trump’s economic initiatives get bogged down by typical Washington gridlock.   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel 2017 Outlook Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → March → Bank ETFs are Raking in New Assets as Sector Soars Bank ETFs are Raking in New Assets as Sector Soars March 3, 2017 at 9:00 am by Tom Lydon Big financial services exchange traded funds are getting bigger as investors flock to these ETFs as the sector continues soaring. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLF), the largest financial services exchange traded fund, iShares U.S. Financials ETF (NYSEArca: IYF) and Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSEArca: VFH) are gathering assets at a rapid pace as the second-largest sector weight in the S&P 500 ascends to its highest levels in about a decade. “This year, investors have poured a combined $2.4 billion into three exchange-traded funds focused on banks — State Street Corp.’s Financial Select Sector SPDR fund, ticker XLF, BlackRock Inc.’s iShares U.S. Financials ETF, ticker IYF, and the Vanguard Financials ETF, ticker VFH — as a bet that the firms will benefit from Trump’s deregulation policies. The funds’ top holdings are global lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co.,” reports Carolina Wilson for Bloomberg. The Trump administration’s expansionary policies would be especially beneficial for banks since the segment is sensitive to the overall economy. Moreover, the expansionary policies have fueled bets of increased Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to rein in a potentially overheating economy and rising inflation, which further supports lending revenue and their bottom line among bankers and insurers. For target exposure to banks, the First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index Fund (NasdaqGM: QABA), PowerShares S&P SmallCap Financials Portfolio (NYSEArca: PSCF) and PowerShares KBW Regional Bank Portfolio (NYSEArca: KBWR) include large tilts toward small- and micro-cap bank stocks. Bank ETFs are benefiting from speculation that the Federal Reserve will boost interest rates multiple times this year. With a steepening yield curve or wider spread between short- and long-term Treasuries, banks could experience improved net interest margins or improved profitability as the firms borrow short and lend long. XLF is coming off one of its best annual performances since the global financial crisis. While the financial services sector, the second-largest sector allocation in the S&P 500, has some doubters after last year’s impressive rally, some market observers believe the sector can keep tracking higher this year. “Strong fundamentals are also helping to drive finance firms higher. Banks posted a 5 percent increase in profits in 2016, according to a recent report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Financials have been the best performing industry in the S&P 500 over the past 12 months, rising more than 42 percent, and were leading the market higher on Wednesday following Trump’s speech before Congress,” according to Bloomberg.

The February 15 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest in the selected cybersecurity stocks mostly increased. FireEye Inc. (NASDAQ: FEYE) saw its short interest increase to 25.01 million shares from the previous reading of 23.70 million. Shares were last seen at $11.31, in a 52-week trading range of $10.60 to $19.63.

Shares were trading at $98.72, in a 52-week range of $74.34 to $101.77. The number of Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE: PANW) shares short ticked up to 8.03 million from the previous level of 7.64 million. Shares were trading at $153.73, within a 52-week range of $114.64 to $165.69.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 March 2017 by Military News Foresight Solar Fund Limited : Initial Placing, Offer for Subscription, Introduction of Placing Programme, South African Secondary Listing and Private Placement, and Net Asset Value Update THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, INCLUDING THE APPENDIX, IS RESTRICTED AND IS NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO U.S. PERSONS, OR IN OR INTO, THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN OR INTO ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO MIGHT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OR BREACH OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW. PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTICE AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO CONTAIN INSIDE INFORMATION. This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for, or to buy shares in any jurisdiction. This announcement is an advertisement and not a prospectus.  Any investment in any shares referred to in this announcement may be made only on the basis of information in a prospectus to be published by Foresight Solar Fund Limited on or around 3 March 2017, in connection with an initial placing, offer for subscription, private placement and a placing programme of ordinary shares of no par value each, to be admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange plc (“the Prospectus“).  3 March 2017   Foresight Solar Fund Limited Initial Placing, Offer for Subscription, Introduction of Placing Programme, South African Secondary Listing and Private Placement, and Net Asset Value Update   The Board of Foresight Solar Fund Limited (the “Company“) is pleased to announce its intention to raise in excess of £50 million by way of an Initial Placing and Offer for Subscription (the “Initial Placing and Offer“) and a secondary listing (“Secondary Listing“) on the main board of the securities exchange operated by the JSE Limited (“JSE“) and Private Placement in South Africa (the “Private Placement“) of new Ordinary Shares (“New Shares“) (together the “Initial Issues“). The Board of the Company is also pleased to announce its intention to implement a Placing Programme in relation to up to 250 million New Shares less any New Shares issued under the Initial Issues. The Initial Issues and the Placing Programme are together known as the “Issues“.   A prospectus in relation to the Issues and a pre-listing announcement in relation to the Secondary Listing and Private Placement are expected to be published shortly.    The Company also announces its unaudited NAV as at 23 February 2017 of £360 million, resulting in a NAV per share of 105.6 pence (31 December 2016: 102.9 pence). For the avoidance of doubt, this includes the impact of the acquisition of Shotwick and Sandridge announced in February 2017. The Company’s equity discount rate used to value its assets remains unchanged at 7.5% and the methodology for calculating the NAV remains consistent with that used to calculate the 31 December 2016 NAV.   Rationale for the Issues   The Board believes that the UK solar market remains attractive, particularly given the recent recovery in wholesale power prices. Furthermore, the Company and Foresight Group CI Limited (the “Investment Manager“) continue to see attractive investment opportunities in both the primary and secondary UK solar market and wish to be in a position to take advantage of these opportunities as and when they arise. The recent acquisitions of the Shotwick and Sandridge solar plants, which represent the Company’s two largest acquisitions to date, are evidence of the attractive investment opportunities available in the market, which the Investment Manager has been able to source.   The Investment Manager is currently evaluating an investment pipeline of operational UK based solar power plants representing an installed capacity of approximately 250MW.   To date, the Company has used the net proceeds from its equity fundraisings and its Bank Facilities to acquire 18 ground based solar power plants. All of these assets are fully operational and have received accreditation under the RO scheme. The Portfolio has a total operational capacity of approximately 470 MW. Following the recent acquisitions of Shotwick and Sandridge, the Company has drawn down, in aggregate, £255 million under its Bank Facilities (£160 million under its Term Loan Facilities and £95 million under its Revolving Credit Facilities).   The Board has therefore been discussing with its advisers a proposal to raise additional equity by means of the issue of up to 250 million New Shares in aggregate over the following twelve months.   It is currently intended that the net proceeds of the Initial Issues will be used, in the first instance, to repay the Revolving Credit Facilities either in full or in part. The Group may then draw down again under the Revolving Credit Facilities or it may use any remaining net proceeds to invest in or commit to further ground based solar power plants in accordance with the Company’s investment policy.   Any proceeds raised under the Placing Programme will be used to take advantage of investment opportunities in accordance with the Company’s investment policy and/or to repay debt.   Rationale for the Secondary Listing and Private Placement in South Africa   The success of the South African Renewable Energy Program has created a sophisticated understanding and appreciation of solar and other renewable energy assets in South Africa, and interest in the Company.  Due to South African exchange control regulations, South African investors’ ability to invest and hold shares outside of South Africa is restricted in terms of size.  In order to facilitate participation by South African investors in the Issues, the Company has applied and has been granted approval by the Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank for an inward listing of the Company on the JSE and a Private Placement of New Shares to Qualifying South African Investors.  The inward listed shares will be classified as domestic investment on the JSE and will allow South African investors the opportunity to invest in the Company on an unrestricted basis.  The Company believes that the Secondary Listing and Private Placement will: improve the depth and spread of the shareholder base of the Company which should, as a result improve the liquidity and tradability of the Ordinary Shares; provide the Company with access to a wider pool of international capital; and provide the Company with an additional platform to raise equity funding to pursue growth and investment opportunities in the future. Following the Secondary Listing and Private Placement, the Ordinary Shares will be fully transferrable between the UK and South African share registers.  Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited (“RMB“), has been appointed by the Company as South African Bookrunner and JSE Sponsor for the Secondary Listing and Private Placement.    The Initial Issues   The Initial Placing and Offer is being conducted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, through a bookbuild process which will be launched immediately following this announcement.  Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (“Stifel“) is acting as sponsor and joint bookrunner in connection with the Initial Placing and Offer and Placing Programme and J.P. Morgan Securities plc, which carries on its UK investment banking activities as J.P. Morgan Cazenove (“J.P. Morgan Cazenove“), is acting as joint bookrunner in connection with the Initial Placing and Offer and Placing Programme.   The Offer for Subscription is being made in the UK only. The public generally (unless they are located or resident outside the UK) may apply for New Shares through the Offer for Subscription.   The price at which the New Shares will be issued pursuant to the Initial Placing and Offer (“Initial Placing and Offer Price“) will be equal to the NAV per Share on 23 February 2017 plus a premium as determined by the Board and is expected to be announced via RIS on or around 14 March 2017.   The price at which the New Shares will be issued pursuant to the Private Placement (“Private Placement Price“) will be equal to the ZAR equivalent of the Initial Placing and Offer Price determined based on the ZAR/GBP spot rate at the closing of the Private Placement (as quoted on Bloomberg).  The Private Placement Price will be announced by the Company through SENS on 29 March 2017.   The total number of New Shares issued under the Initial Issues will be determined by the Company, Stifel, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and RMB. The Board has reserved the right, in consultation with Stifel, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and RMB, to increase the number of New Shares offered pursuant to the Initial Placing and Offer and the Private Placement to up to the maximum amount for which the Board is seeking shareholder authority pursuant to the Issues, being 250 million New Shares.   The New Shares will be entitled to receive the interim dividend of 1.55p per Ordinary Share in respect of the period from 1 October 2016 to 31 December 2016 which will be paid on 5 May 2017 provided the holders of the New Shares are on the Register on 7 April 2017.   Extraordinary General Meeting   The Issues are subject to Shareholder approval to be sought at an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM“) to be held at 4:30pm on 22 March 2017 at Elizabeth House, 9 Castle Street, St. Helier, Jersey JE4 2QP. A circular and notice of EGM (the “Circular“) to approve, amongst other proposals, the issue of the New Shares without having to first offer those New Shares to existing Shareholders, and to approve by ordinary resolution the Related Party Transaction that may arise if any of BlackRock, Inc. and its Associates, including funds controlled by it or any of them wish to take part in the Issues, are expected to be posted shortly.   Words and expressions that are defined in the Prospectus and the Circular shall have the same meaning where they are used in this announcement, except where the context requires otherwise.   Timetable   The expected timetable for the Issues is as follows:   Event Date Initial Placing and Offer   Initial Placing and Offer opens 3 March 2017 Initial Placing and Offer Price Announced 14 March 2017 Latest time and date for return of Forms of Proxy for the General Meeting 4.30 p.m. on 20 March 2017 General Meeting 4.30 p.m. on 22 March 2017 Results of General Meeting 22 March 2017 Latest time and date for receipt of Application Forms under the Offer 11 a.m. on 28 March 2017 Latest time and date for commitments under the Initial Placing 11 a.m. on 29 March 2017 Results of Initial Placing and  Offer announced  29 March 2017 Admission and dealings in New Shares on the Main Market of the LSE commence 8.00 a.m. on 31 March 2017 Crediting of CREST accounts in respect of the New Shares 31 March 2017 Share certificates in respect of New Shares despatched (if applicable) on or around 10 April 2017 Secondary Listing and Private Placement   Publication of the Pre-listing Announcement on SENS in South Africa 3 March 2017 JSE Private Placement opens 3 March 2017 Publication of the Pre-listing Announcement in the South African press 6 March 2017 Latest time and date for commitments under the Private Placement  12 p.m. (SAST) on 29 March 2017 JSE Private Placement closes 12 p.m. (SAST) on 29 March 2017 JSE Private Placement Price announced 29 March 2017 Results of the Private Placement released on SENS in South Africa 29 March 2017 Notification of allotments 29 March 2017 Anticipated Secondary Listing Date and commencement of trading on the Main Board of the JSE 8.00 a.m. (SAST) on 3 April 2017 Accounts at CSDPs or brokers updated and accounts debited in respect of the Private Placement Shares at the commencement of trade 3 April 2017 Placing Programme   Placing Programme opens 4 April 2017 Publication of Placing Programme Price in respect of each Issue At the time of each Issue Admission and dealings in New Shares commence 8.00 a.m. on each day New Shares are issued Crediting of CREST in respect of New Shares 8.00 a.m. on each day New Shares are issued Share certificates in respect of New Shares despatched (if applicable) Approximately one week following the issue of any New Shares Last date for New Shares to be issued under the Placing Programme 2 March 2018 The dates and times specified above and mentioned throughout this document are subject to change.

With the fourth-quarter earnings season drawing to a close, Stoxx Europe 600 Index members have recorded an 11 percent rise in profits from a year earlier -- the strongest in two years -- versus a 5 percent growth in S&P 500 companies, according to data from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Among factors seen boosting them further in 2017 are a weaker euro, rising commodity prices and a recovery in the previously battered banking sector. Europe’s long-awaited earnings rebound should continue this year as key sectors such as banks and basic resources recover and data signal an acceleration in the economy, according to Emmanuel Cau, an equity strategist at JPMorgan. “The base is low, as euro-zone earnings are still depressed in the historical context,” he said by phone. “Financials’ earnings have been a significant drag on the overall market earnings over the last few years, but they are starting to rebound. Banks have seen more net upgrades than the overall market over the last three months, as bond yields rebounded and credit growth accelerated.” The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up There are signs the robust results from the fourth quarter herald better times ahead. Earnings forecasts are in fact improving following actual reports, breaking the typical pattern of downgrades seen at such times, according to JPMorgan data. Since the start of the year, estimates for European profits have increased by 1 percent, led by upgrades to cyclical shares including miners. By contrast, forecasters have cut predictions for U.S. earnings by 1.7 percent in the same period. There are other positive indications as well. The ratio of the number of European stocks that have seen upgrades in consensus earnings estimates over the past three months versus those that have seen downgrades stands at 1.02, according to strategists at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Anything above parity is historically a strong signal for the region’s equities, they wrote in a Feb. 28 note. Lack of earnings growth over the past years in Europe has been the main reason behind European stocks trailing the performance of Wall Street peers, Barclays equity strategists including Dennis Jose wrote in a Feb. 27 note. That has continued so far in 2017, with the Stoxx 600 up 3.6 percent versus a 6.4 percent rally in the S&P 500. “European companies have failed to grow earnings for nearly seven years now at a time when U.S. earnings have accelerated to prior-cycle highs,” the strategists wrote, saying that companies have struggled to raise their prices given the lack of inflation, which has hit margins. “If inflation picks up, we think pricing should improve, thereby driving an increase in European profit margins.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

A central bank official said at the end of last year that China will create conditions for the inclusion of yuan debt in global indexes. BlackRock Inc. has said inclusion could be announced in 2017, and that the firm has hired for credit research in the nation. Invesco Ltd. says such a development may come in the next 12 months, and also aims to expand in the country. Adding Chinese notes to global indexes including those from Bloomberg Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. would bring cash into the nation from yield-hungry investors from New York to Tokyo. Managers of that wealth will need to navigate rising defaults and local ratings that many have questioned. Investment firms also want to sell more products to a growing legion of wealthy Chinese investors, after greater market access was allowed. “We are seeing increased interest among global asset managers to develop an investment capability for the onshore Chinese bond market,” said Nick Aylwin-Foster, who runs headhunting firm Sheffield Haworth’s asset management practice for Asia. “Within fixed income, hiring is primarily into the credit research teams.” Read more: Getting ready for China’s entry into global bond indexes BlackRock has hired a couple of people in Shanghai who focus on credit research in the domestic bond market, according to Gregor Carle, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income product strategy. Expanding Presence “We continue to build that coverage because we see this greater opportunity set coming out of China, and of course, the potential index inclusion that’s further down the line,” he said. Fidelity International is building out its investment team in Shanghai, Jackson Lee, country head for China, said in January. A spokeswoman for the money manager said there is no update to that plan. Amid shifting regulations and hiring challenges, many funds are still deciding on such a move. They must weigh downsides that include “a gap between when you commit to a new market and when you actually start seeing returns,” according to Aylwin-Foster at Sheffield Haworth. Timing on index inclusion is also uncertain. Joining global debt indexes isn’t a priority at this stage and the nation is in no rush for its shares to enter the MSCI Inc.’s benchmark indexes, Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in January. The People’s Bank of China and other departments will work to improve rules to give foreign investors easier access to the interbank bond market and create conditions for the inclusion of yuan debt in global indexes, Ma Jun, chief economist of the PBOC’s research bureau, said in December. Still, China presents a unique opportunity for fixed-income fund managers. Foreign holdings account for only about 1.4 percent of the nation’s interbank bond market, making it “one of the most untapped opportunities” in global asset management, according to Nicholas Britz, senior associate at Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. Fidelity International said in January that its wholly foreign-owned enterprise in Shanghai became the first global asset manager to register with the Asset Management Association of China as a private fund management company. The qualification allows the firm to create onshore investment products for Chinese institutional and high-net-worth investors for the first time, it said in a statement.

Sign Up Andrew Lo, chief executive officer at Invesco Asia-Pacific, said in an email interview that the firm has plans for its own wholly foreign-owned enterprise and aims to register it with AMAC to become a private fund management company. “The WFOE will provide on-the-ground support to our Hong Kong-based Greater China investment team that is offering Chinese investment products to global investors,” said Lo.  Invesco already has a joint venture with Chinese partners including Great Wall Securities Co. and Lo added that the firm is “very committed” to expand its presence in the country. He said he sees “growing demand” from Chinese institutions to diversify fund managers and investment strategies. “The game of managing renminbi fixed income is very much moving to the onshore market,” said Britz at Z-Ben Advisors. “Assuming you can build out an effective renminbi credit team, you’ll definitely be pulling ahead of your global rivals.” Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, owns the former Barclays Risk Analytics and Index Solutions business, including the benchmark indexes, which have been co-branded as “Bloomberg Barclays” indexes. Bloomberg Barclays overhauled its China fixed-income gauges and started a Global Aggregate + China index on March 1, while stopping short of adding the nation to major benchmark indexes Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Joshua RobertsMore By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Friday it is suspending action on an Obama administration decision in October to probe a long-time practice by some airlines of preventing various travel websites from showing their fares and whether to require transparency in airline baggage and other fees. The U.S. Transportation Department said in a notice Friday it is suspending a public comment period on the review of the practices to "allow the president’s appointees the opportunity to review and consider this action." Airlines generated $3.8 billion in baggage fees in 2015 and the Obama administration said in October it was formally exploring requiring airlines and ticket agents to provide consumers with prices that include service fees for baggage and other services alongside fares at points of sale. Separately, the Trump administration is also extending the compliance date for a new regulation requiring reporting of data for mishandled baggage and wheelchairs in aircraft cargo compartments for one year - until Jan. 1, 2019. Airlines for America, the industry trade group representing American Airlines Group Inc , United Continental Holdings Inc , Southwest Airlines Co and others, praised the decision. "Today’s action is a common sense measure reinforcing that the airline industry is capable of making the decisions that best serve our customers, our employees and the communities we serve," the airlines' group chief executive Nicholas Calio said in a statement. The group added the "airline industry operates under 13,000 regulations across 13 agencies, many of which are outdated, obsolete and in need of reform." President Donald Trump met with airline chief executives last month and asked them to identify regulatory hurdles preventing job growth in the industry. A study commissioned by a travel agencies' trade group, the Travel Technology Association, in 2014 found that restricting the ability to comparison-shop would result in ticket prices increasing more than 11 percent. Airline shares rose on the news. JPMorgan said in a research note Friday that the "the protections never mattered in the first place - the financial impact of the Obama protections was largely irrelevant, in our view." The Obama administration efforts were very modest, JPMorgan said, and did not propose limiting airlines’ ability to pursue ancillary revenue, such as an outright ban on bag fees. But JPMorgan added: "U.S. airlines appear to increasingly have the ear of a sympathetic, regulatory-averse administration."

Both companies have denied any wrongdoing. Charges filed at the High Court in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, allege the companies paid $801 million to former Oil Minister Dan Etete, former Justice Minister Mohammed Bello Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar for the license to OPL 245. Nigeria's government got only $210 million from the deal. "These charges show Nigeria's intention to fight corruption by holding the powerful to account," Simon Taylor of corruption watchdog Global Witness said in a statement Saturday. "The days when oil companies could use their influence to keep backroom deals with corrupt officials under wraps are over." He said the alleged bribes amount to 80 percent of Nigeria's 2015 health budget.

Also charged is Malabu Oil, the company Etete set up secretly and awarded OPL 245 while he was oil minister. Etete, Adoke and Abubakar, all believed to be living in Europe, could not be reached for comment. The charges were laid by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which in January won a court order ceding control of the oil bloc to the government. The commission also has filed new money-laundering charges against Adoke, alleging he corruptly received an additional $2.2 million in 2013 as payment for brokering the deal. advertisement | advertise on newsday The oil companies have declared their innocence, saying the money was paid to Nigeria's government. Shell and Eni paid $1.1 billion into a Nigerian escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase in 2011. Adoke, who was then the justice minister and attorney general, authorized its distribution. The court document alleged the oil companies and their executives "corruptly gave" the money and "thus committed an offense" under Nigeria's Corrupt Practices Act. Global Witness said in a statement that "Shell and Eni have always denied that they knew the money would go to Malabu, but documents seen by Global Witness show that the companies constructed the deal knowing that the money would flow ultimately to Etete's company." Global Witness said the case highlights the need for regulations forcing extractive companies to make public the payments made to governments. President Donald Trump has been expected to overturn such a regulation in the United States. The scandal around OPL 245 has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff Italian prosecutors last month asked for Eni, Shell, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi and 10 others to stand trial for alleged corruption. Eni said it had investigated the allegations and found "no evidence of corrupt conduct." Shell has said that it "takes this matter seriously and is co-operating with the authorities."

(NYSE: VRX) saw its shares hit a multiyear low this past week. There was hope for a turnaround when Joe Papa took over as chief executive officer, but it seems that little has gone his way, especially after the company reported earnings early this week. Some analysts took this opportunity to reevaluate their stance on the stock. Although this might be a buy for some, the returns look to be getting smaller. The company said that it had $1.26 in earnings per share (EPS) and $2.4 billion in revenue. The consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters had called for $1.21 in EPS and revenue of $2.34 billion. The same period of last year reportedly had EPS of $2.50 on $2.79 billion in revenue. The decrease in revenues for the quarter was primarily driven by a reduction in product sales from the existing business of $310 million and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange of $43 million. Revenues in the quarter were further affected by a drop in realized pricing by 3%, along with divestitures and discontinuations of $16 million. In terms of guidance for the 2017 full year, the company expects to see revenues in the range of $8.90 billion to $9.10 billion with an adjusted EBITDA between $3.55 billion and $3.70 billion. The consensus estimates are $4.76 in EPS and $8.97 billion in revenue for the full year. Jefferies looked at the data and maintained its Buy rating but cut its price target by roughly 18%. The firm lowered its price target to $18 from $22, and it wasn’t the only one being cautious. A few other firms followed suit: BTIG reiterated a Neutral rating. BMO Capital Markets reiterated a Market Perform rating but lowered its price target to $19 from $21. JPMorgan has a Hold rating with a $15 price target. RBC lowered it price target to $21. Apart from these, Jefferies detailed the reasoning in its report: Mgt’s rev outlook ($8.9-9.1B) bracketed consensus. However, adj EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.55-3.70B (vs $3.88B consensus) as Valeant plans to further invest in its R&D pipeline and step up promotion to drive longer term value for its key GI franchises (40% increase in reps). As such, adj EBITDA margin should dip to 40.3% (midpoint of guidance) vs 45.7% in FY16. Mgt appears to be of the view that the loss of exclusivities (LOEs) on drugs such as Solodyn and Acanya can be offset by new launches (Siliq, Vyzulta, etc.) with the implication that FY17 could be a “trough” year prior to the potential re-emergence of growth in FY18 and beyond. We cut our FY17 & FY18 rev & EPS estimates to $8.92B & $3.88 and $8.88B & $4.17 (vs $9.08B & $4.95 and $9.12B & $5.37). Shares of Valeant closed Friday down 5% at $13.06, with a consensus analyst price target of $21.34 and a 52-week trading range of $12.90 to $70.43.

Both companies have denied any wrongdoing. Charges filed at the High Court in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, allege the companies paid $801 million to former Oil Minister Dan Etete, former Justice Minister Mohammed Bello Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar for the license to OPL 245. Nigeria's government got only $210 million from the deal. "These charges show Nigeria's intention to fight corruption by holding the powerful to account," Simon Taylor of corruption watchdog Global Witness said in a statement Saturday. "The days when oil companies could use their influence to keep backroom deals with corrupt officials under wraps are over." He said the alleged bribes amount to 80 percent of Nigeria's 2015 health budget. Nigerian High Court papers stamped Thursday and seen by The Associated Press name the accused as the Nigeria subsidiary of British-Dutch Shell and its ex-director Ralph Wetzels, Italy's Eni, Eni's Nigeria subsidiary Agip and directors Roberto Casula, Stefano Pujatti and Sebastiano Burrafato. Also charged is Malabu Oil, the company Etete set up secretly and awarded OPL 245 while he was oil minister. Etete, Adoke and Abubakar, all believed to be living in Europe, could not be reached for comment. The charges were laid by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which in January won a court order ceding control of the oil bloc to the government. The commission also has filed new money-laundering charges against Adoke, alleging he corruptly received an additional $2.2 million in 2013 as payment for brokering the deal. The oil companies have declared their innocence, saying the money was paid to Nigeria's government. Shell and Eni paid $1.1 billion into a Nigerian escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase in 2011. Adoke, who was then the justice minister and attorney general, authorized its distribution. The court document alleged the oil companies and their executives "corruptly gave" the money and "thus committed an offense" under Nigeria's Corrupt Practices Act. Global Witness said in a statement that "Shell and Eni have always denied that they knew the money would go to Malabu, but documents seen by Global Witness show that the companies constructed the deal knowing that the money would flow ultimately to Etete's company." Global Witness said the case highlights the need for regulations forcing extractive companies to make public the payments made to governments. President Donald Trump has been expected to overturn such a regulation in the United States. The scandal around OPL 245 has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Italian prosecutors last month asked for Eni, Shell, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi and 10 others to stand trial for alleged corruption. Eni said it had investigated the allegations and found "no evidence of corrupt conduct." Shell has said that it "takes this matter seriously and is co-operating with the authorities."

Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In Study: Investing and Cocaine Look Same to Brain By David Floyd | March 3, 2017 — 4:07 PM EST Share It's coming any minute now. You're refreshing the investor relations page constantly, cursing your garbage WiFi, twitching in anticipation of the latest earnings report. The stock has been slipping for weeks, and the TV pundits are saying the company's peaked, time to cash out and move on. You know they're wrong. Them: the analysts, the short-sellers. All sheep. And there it is. You click the link, and it's a dazzling sight. Top- and bottom-line beats. And that's not all: [pick your metric] growth that blew even the highest expectations out of the water. After-hours prices are already spiking – up 10 percent, 12 percent, 13 percent. You celebrate by cutting a line, rolling up a Benjamin, and hitting the slopes. From a number of perspectives – the legal one, chiefly – watching a risky financial bet pay off and using cocaine are very different things. But perhaps not to your brain, research suggests. According to a 2001 paper by Harvard Medical School's Hans Breiter and colleagues, "the activations seen in the NAc, SLEA, VT, and GOb in response to monetary prospects and outcomes overlap those observed in response to cocaine infusions in subjects addicted to cocaine." (Those abbreviations, if you were curious, mean nucleus accumbens, sublenticular extended amygdala, ventral tegmental and orbitofrontal cortex, respectively.) In other words, a fat line is to a coke addict what a fat win is to a trader (or gambler). This blurring of the financial and the narcotic sheds light on the behavioral and psychological dimensions of investing, which often go under-appreciated. Investors like to think of themselves as rational individuals with the mental acumen, emotional equilibrium and titanium gut necessary to thrive in turbulent markets. But irrational biases can creep in and hurt results. (See also, How does behavioral economics treat risk aversion?) Among cocaine's most pronounced side effects is the desire for more cocaine, preferably as much and as quickly as possible. If a savvy (or lucky) bet on a particular stock, currency or lotto number drives you to make another bold wager right away, you're likely to do a bit less homework, think a bit less critically and perhaps throw a lot of money away. Fiends aren't renowned for their wisdom. (See also, Unsuccessful Types of Stock Traders.) In his book "Your Money and Your Brain," Jason Zweig mentions the brain's similar reactions to cocaine and paper gains, along with a host of other human foibles that can lead to bad decision-making. "Financial losses are processed in the same areas of the brain that respond to mortal danger," he writes. A hard-wired tendency to expect anything that happens twice to happen a third time has very little to do with real-world probabilities. And most importantly, these effects are not mere mental ephemera: making and losing money produce "a biological change that has profound physical effects on the brain and body." Viewed in this light, spectacular trading losses like that of the London Whale – who made JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) $400 million with a single trade in 2011, then lost $6.2 billion the next year – make a bit more sense. (See also, How Big Data Is Monitoring Good and Bad Traders.) Luckily a bit of discipline and frequent reality checks can dampen the effects of psychological biases. The first step, however, is to accept that you are not quite as steely and objective as you'd like to think. You may go by the numbers, but the brain you use to process those numbers is a squishy, unreliable instrument. It evolved to form kinship bonds, hunt big furry beasts and gather nutritious plant matter. Remarkable as it is, it's no Bloomberg terminal. (See also, Avoid These Common Investing Psychology Traps.)

Airlines generated $3.8 billion in baggage fees in 2015 and the Obama administration said in October it was formally exploring requiring airlines and ticket agents to provide consumers with prices that include service fees for baggage and other services alongside fares at points of sale. The Trump administration suspended an Obama-era proposal on Friday, which was designed to investigate whether to force airlines to be more transparent with baggage and other fees Separately, the Trump administration is also extending the compliance date for a new regulation requiring reporting of data for mishandled baggage and wheelchairs in aircraft cargo compartments for one year - until January 1, 2019. Airlines for America, the industry trade group representing American Airlines Group Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and others, praised the decision. 'Today's action is a common sense measure reinforcing that the airline industry is capable of making the decisions that best serve our customers, our employees and the communities we serve,' the airlines' group chief executive Nicholas Calio said in a statement. The group added the 'airline industry operates under 13,000 regulations across 13 agencies, many of which are outdated, obsolete and in need of reform.' It comes after President Donald Trump met with airline chief executives last month and asked them to identify regulatory hurdles preventing job growth in the industry Airlines generated $3.8 billion in baggage fees in 2015 and the Obama administration wanted to formally explore requiring airlines and ticket agents to provide consumers with full prices President Donald Trump met with airline chief executives last month and asked them to identify regulatory hurdles preventing job growth in the industry. A study commissioned by a travel agencies' trade group, the Travel Technology Association, in 2014 found that restricting the ability to comparison-shop would result in ticket prices increasing more than 11 percent. Airline shares rose on the news. JPMorgan said in a research note on Friday that the 'the protections never mattered in the first place - the financial impact of the Obama protections was largely irrelevant, in our view.' The Obama administration efforts were very modest, JPMorgan said, and did not propose limiting airlines' ability to pursue ancillary revenue, such as an outright ban on bag fees. But JPMorgan added: 'U.S. airlines appear to increasingly have the ear of a sympathetic, regulatory-averse administration.'

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Friday that the Fed is likely to raise its benchmark interest rate this month, barring any unpleasant economic surprises. Yellen's declaration, in a speech in Chicago, capped an intensification in the Fed's communication in recent days as officials put investors on notice that a rate increase is coming sooner than had been expected. "At our meeting later this month, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate," Yellen said, referring to the Fed's policymaking arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. The committee is scheduled to meet on March 14 and 15. Financial markets have taken the Fed's language in stride, which is likely to reinforce the confidence of Fed officials that they can safely raise rates. The Fed last lifted its benchmark rate in December, to a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. Rates remain at a low level by historical standards, supporting economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. But Fed officials have increasingly concluded that the economy is nearing the end of its recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and that maintaining low rates could increase growth to an unsustainable pace. The unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is in a range Fed officials regard as healthy, and inflation is rising back toward the 2 percent level that the Fed considers optimal. Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, echoed Yellen in separate but simultaneous remarks Friday at a conference in New York. "We've seen a lot of substantial change in a relatively short time," Fischer said at the United States Monetary Policy Forum, noting what he described as a marked change in the economic weather since the presidential election on Nov. 8. "There is almost no economic indicator that has come in badly in the last three months." Asked whether Fed officials were engaged in a coordinated campaign to prepare markets for a rate increase later this month, Fischer replied, "If there has been a conscious effort, I'm about to join it." Yellen said she expected the Fed to raise rates by the end of the year to a level that would effectively end the central bank's stimulus campaign — something she said was likely to require three increases, each of 0.25 percentage points. She added that further increases were likely to be necessary in coming years to maintain a neutral stance. "On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat," she said. Just a few weeks ago, Wall Street analysts were skeptical that the Fed would raise rates in March. The Fed issued a measured statement after its last policy meeting in early February, and the meeting minutes, published three weeks later, conveyed little sense of urgency. Now, analysts regard a March increase as highly likely. Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, described the shift in Fed language as "remarkably swift and decisive." Investors put the chances at almost 80 percent in trading on Friday, according to a CME Group analysis of asset prices. The shift began earlier this week. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who in recent years has been one of the most consistent advocates of raising interest rates slowly, suggested Wednesday that she, too, was ready to lift the benchmark rate. "We are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time," Brainard said at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "Assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path."

Another Fed governor, Jerome Powell, issued a similarly blunt notice of intent in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. “I think the case for a rate increase for March has come together, and I think it’s on the table for discussion,” he said.

Masayoshi Son, the billionaire technology entrepreneur from Japan, promised President Donald Trump late last year that he would create 50,000 new jobs in the United States through a $100 billion technology fund. Now, Son and his financial advisers are weighing several major possible deals for Sprint, the struggling U.S. wireless operator controlled by Son’s SoftBank. Be it a tie-up with T-Mobile U.S., Sprint’s closest competitor, or a more ambitious marriage with cable colossus Comcast, a transaction would allow Son to fulfill a long-held ambition to invest aggressively in U.S. wireless networks and enable next-generation mobile technology. Last month, several executives from SoftBank spent a day in Washington talking to senior members of Trump’s economic team, according to bankers briefed on these meetings. The talks and the rush to assess potential deals for Sprint, the country’s fourth-largest mobile operator, highlight how the Trump administration’s push for lighter regulation and lower taxes has been a powerful lure for cash-rich investors the world over. In their presentations, the SoftBank executives said that because of a lack of advanced digital investments, the competitiveness of the U.S. economy was at risk. And the executives made the case, quite strongly, that Son was committed to playing a major role in addressing this issue through a spate of job-creating investments. The discussions were purposely broad in nature, according to investment bankers who were briefed on the discussions. Until the latest government-sponsored auction for spectrum bands finishes in late April, wireless companies are prohibited, owing to concerns about collusion, from pursuing various tie-ups. A Sprint hookup with T-Mobile U.S., Comcast, or any large wireless or cable operator is no slam dunk. For years, federal regulators have opposed such transactions for fear of hurting consumers. Nevertheless, SoftBank seems to be seizing the opportunity of the moment — one highlighted by numerous analyst reports arguing for Sprint and T-Mobile U.S. to come together. Through a spokesman, SoftBank declined to comment on its plans for Sprint. A move this week by the SoftBank-controlled OneWeb, the satellite internet access provider, to merge with Intelsat, the indebted satellite company, is the latest evidence of Son’s ambition, bankers and analysts say. This emphasis on big technology investments as a selling point for the merger rides in part on a wave of hope that the Trump administration will push for a sharp increase in infrastructure investing as a way to kick-start higher levels of U.S. growth. Analysts, however, note that in the past six years when Washington frowned upon wireless mergers — first between AT&T and T-Mobile U.S., and then Sprint and T-Mobile U.S. — consumers benefited from the ruthless price war among the four major carriers. Moreover, this cutthroat environment has forced the two smaller players, Sprint and T-Mobile U.S., to become more innovative and efficient. “The Federal Communications Commission looks very smart for blocking the AT&T T-Mobile deal,” said Philip Cusick, a telecommunications expert with JPMorgan Chase. “Five years ago, Sprint and T-Mobile were irrelevant. Now we are seeing them drive down prices. Why would you want to change that?” While this four-way price-slashing frenzy has led to lower phone bills, a view is also taking hold that the time has come to focus less on the next great plan for unlimited minutes and more on upgrading U.S. digital infrastructure. That would mean pushing the companies to invest aggressively in the type of fiber technology that will support the next generation of wireless investments before it is too late. “You want these companies to invest and compete,” said Jonathan Chaplin, a telecommunications expert at New Street Research who has argued in recent research reports for a Sprint merger with T-Mobile U.S. “This infrastructure will underlie the entire digital economy, and if it remains weak, compared to Japan and China, then the competitiveness of our economy is at risk.” This sums up the view of Son and his top SoftBank executives. And while for regulatory reasons they have been extremely careful to not — publicly or privately — advocate for a merger, they have not been shy in warning about what might happen to the U.S. economy if it continues to fall behind in the race for global digital supremacy. Those in favor of a Sprint deal have also pointed out that the two giants, AT&T and Verizon Communications, while making their own digital investment bets, have been diversifying by pursuing media deals, like Verizon’s acquisition of Yahoo and AT&T’s purchase of DirectTV. So, the argument goes, with the two leading players focused on their media ambitions and with T-Mobile U.S. and Sprint not generating enough cash to invest at the needed scale, a Sprint hookup with its slightly larger peer has never been more critical. Of course, a deal could happen only if Deutsche Telekom, which owns T-Mobile U.S., agreed to merge. Bankers also do not discount the possibility of a cable deal titan like John C. Malone swooping in to buy T-Mobile U.S. At a bit over $70 billion in combined revenue, a merged company would still trail far behind Verizon and AT&T, which generate about $125 billion and $163 billion in sales respectively. Yet a larger third operator could immediately increase investments from the current $5 billion (for the two smaller companies combined) as Son pulls out the stops to make his network the class of the competition, as he has done in Japan. Bankers who have spoken to SoftBank executives say a merged company could easily double its annual outlay to more than $10 billion. While SoftBank and Son have pitched a merger as a boon for investment-starved digital America, it is also true that Sprint, as the smallest, most financially challenged of the four companies, needs to do some kind of deal to stay relevant. Thanks to the financial engineering talents of Rajeev Misra, the former Deutsche Bank executive who has emerged as one of Son’s more influential advisers, Sprint has been able to reduce punitive financing by issuing cheaper bonds secured by the company’s access to spectrum airwaves. These types of flashy innovations are not a long-term strategy, however. And as the company continues its policy of slashing prices to keep pressure on its larger competitors, its financial position will remain precarious, with a debt pile of $33 billion. Sprint, under Son, has become more profitable, and the quality of its network has improved sharply. But analysts and investors remain divided as to how long Sprint can remain a stand-alone company. “It is completely binary,” said Chaplin, the analyst from New Street. “There are those who believe in Masa’s vision and those who believe the company is a house of cards.” What is more, with phone prices still falling, regulators need not be in a hurry to sign off on a merger. “For Sprint,” Chaplin said, “the waiting is more complicated.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Here comes the Fed By Ben White 03/03/17 08:00 AM EST HERE COMES THE FED — It’s becoming clear that Janet Yellen and the Fed will pull the trigger on a rate hike at their meeting later this month potentially setting up a clash with a Trump White House that may not like the central bank pumping the brakes on the economy or the stock market rally that the president loves to brag about. The president has shown a bit more restraint on the Twitters lately but one can imagine something like: “Fed kept rates low for Obama. Now hikes? Sad! JOBS!” We’ll see how it goes. Of course even if Yellen moves, rates will still be really, really low and a hike would be very well communicated to markets in advance. Story Continued Below Manulife’s Megan Greene: “We have changed our view for the next Fed rate hike from June to the FOMC meeting held on March 15th … Fed officials have increasingly spoken publicly to sign post a rate hike would happen fairly soon. … “Notorious dove Lael Brainard said in a speaking gig across the river in Cambridge that she thinks a rate hike could be coming fairly soon. … In addition to recent Fed communication, the market-based probability of a rate hike has soared from around 35 percent last week to nearly 90 percent.” MM SIDENOTE — That could be Brainard’s hip-hop name: “The Notorious Dove.” Pantheon’s Ian Shephardson: “Speeches by Chair Yellen and Vice-Chair Fischer give the two most important Fed officials the perfect platform today to signal to markets whether rates will rise this month. … Chair Yellen and Dr. Fischer have both made it clear that their key focus is on the labor market. Neither official, in our view, is a permanent dove; over the past few years they have been doves by circumstance. “Given that monetary policy works with long lags, and is currently very accommodative … we think the case for further near-term tightening is compelling. We expect both Chair Yellen and Vice-Chair Fischer to suggest today that the Fed will act again soon, leaving the door to a hike this month wide open” DOES YELLEN STILL HAVE A CHOICE? — Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg View: “[T]he dramatic repricing of market expectations of an interest hike in March — from close to 30 percent to more than 80 percent in just a few days — may even force the hand of … Yellen when she delivers a speech on Friday. “Yellen faces a tricky situation when she speaks … In a perfect world, she would have liked to retain greater policy optionality, especially ahead of the jobs report and, to a lesser extent, given the political fluidity in Europe. … [A]ny meaningful attempt to guide the probability significantly lower risks triggering quite a chorus of complaints about inconsistent Fed messaging” WHY SESSIONS MATTERS — The saga over Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s interactions with the Russian ambassador and subsequent decision to recuse himself from any possible DoJ probes into the Trump campaign and Russia is not directly related to finance and economics. But the speed with which the story eclipsed Trump’s well-reviewed joint address to Congress is. The White House got less than 24 hours to bask in the afterglow of the speech before the Sessions story blew it away (and drove Trump back to angry Tweets). Sessions went from denying any misstatements in his Senate confirmation testimony (and getting a strong defense from the White House) to recusal in one day. And last night the WSJ reported that Sessions paid for his travel to the GOP convention in Cleveland, where he claims to have met with the ambassador in his official capacity, with campaign funds. We have no idea what the end game with Sessions will be or what will ultimately be revealed about the many interactions between Trump associates and the Russians. But if the White House can’t get beyond the story and establish a firm political footing, how can it drive its ambitious tax and regulatory agenda through Congress on the extraordinary fast-track that Wall Street expects? Stocks took a slight pause in the bull run Thursday as the Sessions story and Fed expectations dominated headlines. A preview of things to come? SPEAKING OF THAT … . Bloomberg: “Asian equity investors stepped back from Thursday’s gains, following U.S. shares lower as … Yellen prepares to weigh in on the path for interest rates. The dollar weakened after its longest winning streak since May. “‘The markets are in the short-term overextended,’ said Mark Matthews, Singapore-based head of Asia research at Bank of Julius Baer. ‘Longer term, the reason why rates are going up is because the economy is getting better, and that’s good for stocks.’” Read more. TAX REFORM DOMINATES EARNINGS CALLS — According to an analysis of all public company earnings call transcripts by the BUILD Coalition dating to release of the House GOP tax reform blueprint in June of 2016: “Out of the 471 earnings transcripts that discussed tax reform, BAT was the most discussed component of the Blueprint (24.4 percent). … “However, coming in at a close second was interest deductibility (16.6 percent), which was more frequently discussed than repatriation (14.9 percent).” Full report DEBT LIMIT CLOCK — Via The Bipartisan Policy Center: “[A]bsent congressional action, the Treasury Department will no longer be able to pay all of its bills in full and on time at some point in October or November this year. … “The suspension of the federal debt limit expires on March 16, 2017, resetting the limit at around $20 trillion. At that time, the Treasury’s outstanding debt will be up against the limit, forcing the Treasury secretary to take so-called ‘extraordinary measures in order to avoid missing or delaying federal payments” GOOD FRIDAY MORNING — Happy weekend everyone. Email me on bwhite@politico.com and follow me on Twitter @morningmoneyben THIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES — Lorraine Woellert on Chuck Grassley’s criticism of a federal low-income housing program — and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m. — please contact Pro Services at (703) 341-4600 info@politicopro.com DRIVING THE DAY — Huge day for Fed speak as Vice Chair Stanley Fischer speaks at 12:30 p.m. in New York and Chair Janet Yellen speaks in Chicago at 1:00 p.m. … ISM Non-manufacturing Survey at 10:00 a.m. expected to dip very slightly to 56.5 from 56.6 … President Trump heads to Mar-a-Lago … House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi takes part in a POLITICO Playbook breakfast at 8:30 a.m. MORE REAL TALK ON THE TIMETABLE — Pimco’s Libby Cantrill: “The two priority issues for … Trump and congressional Republicans in 2017 — healthcare overhaul and reform of the tax code — are two of the most complex and time-consuming issues Congress can tackle. “To provide some context: Congress has not undertaken tax reform since 1986, when President Reagan had to use significant political capital to advance it (and it still took him several years). Similarly, it took President Obama 14 months to pass the Affordable Care Act … at a time when he had bigger majorities in Congress and a higher approval rating than President Trump currently enjoys” Read more. REAL TALK ON RUSSIA — Horizons’ Greg Valliere: “It will be an endless annoyance for the White House, with hearings that will drag on and on. This will become the Republicans' Benghazi, or worse. We don't think the Russians played a major role in Hillary Clinton's defeat, but that allegation will not die — and neither will speculation about who knew what, and when … “We're still bullish — these … developments aren't powerful enough to derail the surging economy — but it strikes us that the stock market's exuberance is getting frothy. A modest pullback would actually be healthy, as Fed officials undoubtedly have concluded.” KEYSTONE GETS A “BUY AMERICAN” PASS — POLITICO’s Ben Lefebvre: “The Keystone XL pipeline will not be subject to … Trump's executive order requiring infrastructure projects to be built with American steel, a White House spokeswoman said today. … ‘The Keystone XL pipeline is currently in the process of being constructed, so it does not count as a new, retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipeline,’ the White House spokeswoman said” Read more. WARREN FLIPS ON CARSON — POLITICO’s Elana Schor: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren opposed the confirmation of Ben Carson as HUD secretary today, a reversal that comes after taking heat from the left for previously voting for him. After liberals lashed out at Warren for backing Carson during a Senate Banking Committee vote in January, the Massachusetts Democrat explained her decision in a lengthy Facebook post .. “Warren's office did not immediately return a request for comment on the reason for her change of heart. The full Senate approved Carson's nomination on a 58-41 vote. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), a fellow liberal and the top Democrat on the banking committee, voted to confirm Carson, despite anger from progressives” Read more. SESSIONS RECUSES — POLITICO’s Louis Nelson: “Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Thursday that he will recuse himself from any investigations related to campaigns for president, including any probe into potential contacts between Trump's campaign and Russian officials. … Sessions, who maintained support from the White House and President Donald Trump himself, said he consulted senior DOJ staff for their ‘candid and honest opinion about what I should do.’ … “After riding high on Trump’s well-received first address to Congress on Tuesday, the White House found itself mired once again in the scandal over whether Trump campaign officials had frequent contact with Russian officials last year, as Obama officials were looking into allegations that the Russian government was engaging in cyberattacks to try to tilt the election Trump’s way” Read more. THE FREEWHEELING MIKE MAYO — The Street’s Bradley Keoun: “Rabble-rousing bank analyst Mike Mayo is down but not out. After learning during a half-hour meeting late Monday that his brokerage firm, CLSA, was shutting down its U.S. stock-analysis unit immediately, Mayo showed up early the next morning at JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) annual investor conference, where he peppered executives with questions, identifying himself as ‘a freelance analyst.’ “Later in the day, CEO Jamie Dimon publicly lauded his doggedness. Then on Wednesday, Mayo, 53, took the next step toward his future. He visited a Charles Schwab branch in midtown Manhattan to buy at least two shares of every bank he covered, from Bank of America to Zions, he said. The motivation? So he can have the option of attending their upcoming annual meetings as a shareholder” Read more. SNAP SOARS — WSJ’s Maureen Farrell, Corrie Driebusch and Sarah Krouse: “Snap Inc. shares soared on the first day of trading Thursday in an initial public offering that will likely hand the disappearing-message app’s founders, investors and underwriters big profits and provide a boost for the sluggish new-issue market. “The newly public shares, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ‘SNAP,’ surged 44 percent above their offering price to close at $24.48 as investors clamored for a piece of the fast-growing social network. That made for the biggest one-day pop for a U.S.-listed IPO raising at least $1 billion in more than two years” Read more. CATERPILLAR RAIDED — NYT’s Hiroko Tabuchi: “Federal agents raided three Caterpillar buildings near its Illinois headquarters on Thursday, company and law enforcement officials said, in an escalation of an inquiry into the heavy equipment manufacturer’s offshore tax practices. “Caterpillar has been dogged by accusations that it slashed its domestic tax bill by shifting corporate profits from the United States to a subsidiary in Switzerland. A 2014 congressional investigation concluded that a scheme to move cash between the company’s American and foreign subsidiaries cut its tax bill in the United States by $2.4 billion over 13 years” Read more. NO CLEAR BAT SIGNAL FROM TRUMP — FT’s Barney Jopson and Shawn Donnan: “Trump’s refusal to take a clear position on a controversial import tax is perpetuating uncertainty over tax reform and underscoring divisions in the administration and Congress over policies rooted in economic nationalism. “With business desperate for a tax overhaul but specific sectors worried about being hurt, Mr Trump’s elliptical remarks this week on tax — his first big economic test — have muddied the waters for markets struggling to gauge the chances of change. The president’s mixed messages have become emblematic of how his leadership style and reluctance to get involved in policy details is hampering efforts to advance his agenda on Capitol Hill” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — NEW BLOOMBERG BOND SHOW — Via Bloomberg: “Bloomberg Television is launching Bloomberg Real Yield, a new weekly show focused solely on fixed income. Hosted by Jonathan Ferro, Bloomberg Real Yield will air every Friday from 12:00-12:30pm ET” NEW AT CARLYLE — Via Carlyle: “Dave Marchick (Global Head of External Affairs) just hired Stacey Dion from Boeing to join the Carlyle External Affairs team as a Managing Director. Stacey joins March 27th and will be based in the DC office. At Boeing, which she joined in 2008, she was Vice President, Corporate Public Policy. In this role, Stacey will lead our government relations activities for the Americas, reporting to Dave” ** A message from The Americans for Affordable Products: House Republicans’ proposed Border Adjustment Tax would have a devastating impact on the pocketbooks of middle-class Americans. Families in every community across America would pay more for food, gasoline, clothing and other essentials to foot the $1 trillion bill so that highly profitable, multinational companies already exploiting U.S. tax loopholes could pay virtually nothing. The B.A.T is B.A.D. We encourage Congress to implement tax reform that helps businesses of all sizes, and ensures job protection and creation.

Yellen's declaration, in a speech in Chicago, capped an intensification in the Fed's communication in recent days as officials put investors on notice that a rate increase was coming sooner than had been widely expected. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link "On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat," Yellen said. Photo: AP "At our meeting later this month, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate," Yellen said, referring to the Fed's policymaking arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. The committee is scheduled to meet in Washington on March 14-15. Financial markets have taken the Fed's language in stride, which is likely to reinforce the confidence of Fed officials that they can safely raise rates. The Fed last lifted its benchmark rate in December, to a range of 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent. Rates remain at a low level by historical standards, supporting economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. But Fed officials have increasingly concluded that the economy is nearing the end of its recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, and that maintaining low rates could increase growth to an unsustainable pace. Advertisement The unemployment rate, at 4.8 per cent in January, is in a range Fed officials regard as healthy, and inflation is rising back toward the 2 per cent level that the Fed considers optimal. Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, echoed Yellen in separate but simultaneous remarks Friday at a conference in New York. "We've seen a lot of substantial change in a relatively short time," Fischer said at the US Monetary Policy Forum, noting what he described as a marked change in the economic weather since the presidential election on November 8. "There is almost no economic indicator that has come in badly in the last three months." Asked whether Fed officials were engaged in a coordinated campaign to prepare markets for a rate increase later this month, Fischer replied, "If there has been a conscious effort, I'm about to join it." Economic outlook 'encouraging' Yellen said she expected the Fed to raise rates by the end of the year to a level that would effectively end the central bank's stimulus campaign—something she said was likely to require three increases, each of 0.25 percentage points. She added that further increases were likely to be necessary in coming years to maintain a neutral stance. "On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat," she said. Just a few weeks ago, Wall Street analysts were sceptical that the Fed would raise rates in March. The Fed issued a measured statement after its last policy meeting in early February, and the meeting minutes, published three weeks later, conveyed little sense of urgency. Now, analysts regard a March increase as highly likely. Michael Feroli, the chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase, described the shift in Fed language as "remarkably swift and decisive". Investors put the chances at almost 80 per cent in trading on Friday, according to a CME Group analysis of asset prices. Brainard, Powell unusually blunt The shift began earlier this week. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who in recent years has been one of the most consistent advocates of raising interest rates slowly, suggested Wednesday that she, too, was ready to lift the benchmark rate. "We are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time," Brainard said at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "Assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path." Fed officials often bury their latest views on monetary policy at the end of their speeches; Brainard's remarks came at the beginning, to make sure no one missed the point. Another Fed governor, Jerome H. Powell, issued a similarly blunt notice of intent in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. "I think the case for a rate increase for March has come together, and I think it's on the table for discussion," he said. Advertisement HuffPost Australia Pleas For Government To Not Ditch $1b ...

Investors have cited several issues as roadblocks, including lengthy registration processes and confusion over tax rules on capital gains, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) said in a report yesterday. In the past year, China has rolled out various measures to attract foreign money, including opening its US$9 trillion (S$12.7 trillion) bond market to overseas investors, and launching a trading link between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen bourses. The link lets foreigners trade the shares of some of China's fastest-growing companies. Last week, regulators allowed foreign investors in the bond market to buy financial products traded domestically that will let them hedge currency risks, said the report. But while foreigners might have long sought to invest in stocks and bonds in China, where annual economic growth is nearly 7 per cent, they seem hesitant to put their money in the Asian giant, it added. According to WSJ research, overseas investors' Chinese bond holdings had dropped to 1.3 per cent of the total outstanding by the end of last year - down from 1.4 per cent before the market's broad opening in February last year. NO CLEAR INVESTMENT AGENDA No one wants to be at a cocktail party saying they don't have a China strategy. But for most firms, it's more lip service than action. MS CHANTAL GRINDERSLEV, senior adviser at Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai-based strategic consultancy. Money flowing into Shenzhen stocks from Hong Kong has been tepid, averaging just 5 per cent of the daily 13 billion yuan (S$2.66 billion) quota. A similar trend was witnessed for a link between Shanghai and Hong Kong set up in 2014. Investors say they have hesitated partly because of concerns over time-consuming registration procedures and confusing tax rules on capital gains. Some say markets in China are too expensive, the WSJ reported, while the yuan's slide last year has held back many investors. State interventions in the markets, such as massive share buying by government-backed funds whenever stock prices dip, is another reason investors are holding back, as are worries over whether they will be able to get their money out of China given tight capital controls. "There's a risk that at any point the authorities can step in. That risk must be compensated for by, for example, a cheaper market," Mr Lukas Daalder, the chief investment officer at Robeco Investment Solutions, told the WSJ. Restrictions on capital withdrawals have kept stock-index provider MSCI from including mainland-listed Chinese stocks in its key indexes. HSBC analysts have estimated that US$500 billion would pour into China shares if they were included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Capital controls and market regulation are also keeping Chinese bonds from being included in major bond indexes run by banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup that are commonly tracked by global fund managers. Goldman reckons some US$250 billion could eventually flow into Chinese debt markets if the bonds were admitted, said the WSJ report. Yet, there are others who have been eager to jump into China. With regulatory issues gradually being clarified, and investors being given more ability to hedge risks, many are feeling comfortable about making their move. "We're ready, we're finalising" plans to invest in the onshore market, said Mr Jean-Charles Sambor, the deputy head of emerging-market fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London. Still, few foreign asset managers have created funds dedicated to China's onshore bond market, given lack of investor demand, said Ms Chantal Grinderslev, a senior adviser at Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai-based strategic consultancy. "No one wants to be at a cocktail party saying they don't have a China strategy. But for most firms, it's more lip service than action,"she said.

It was actually sort of an inside day inside of and inside day inside of an inside day because all daily ranges subsequent to Tuesday’s have been further compressed. # Concerns over dry weather in eastern Brazil potentially creeping west into Mato Grosso to be a detriment for the second corn crop have shifted to worries over wet weather being a threat to quality for the soybean crop. More rain looks to be on the way for central Brazil over the next five days. # Brazil’s soybean export program is starting off at a record clip. Crops were ready early in the season and had been making their way into shipping position without much trouble before heavy rains cut off the flow of trucks headed to ports along the Amazon River. # The next update of the Supply and Demand tables will come from the USDA on Thursday of next week. Estimates for the South American crop will be the main attraction. Analysts are reaching as high as 108 million tons for Brazil’s soybean crop, which the USDA in January pegged at 104 mt. # Most analysts surveyed by Bloomberg do not see it likely that USDA makes any change to the U.S. corn carryout estimate. The average trade guess looks for soybean ending stocks to drop 5 million bushels to 415 mbu. # The new-crop soybean/corn ratio came in slightly this week as traders begin to do more to price in expectations for acres switch. The multiple currently stand at 2.55 versus 2.33 this time last year. # Active oil rigs in the U.S. increased by two last week, not a big gain, but the total of 756 rigs is up 267 from the 489 in use this time last year. Oil futures were trading higher on the last session of the week despite talk of U.S. inventories growing, in part because of rising imports. # The dollar index initially did not budge much from the day’s low after Fed Chair Yellen mentioned that a March Fed funds rate hike was “likely appropriate.” A notable currency move was the appreciation of the Mexican peso, which was firmer on talk about changes to NAFTA being potentially supportive. # Stocks were mixed with banks the only sector making solid gains. Money lenders like JPMorgan and Bank of America stand to benefit if interest rates are on their way up. ***** April live cattle down $0.17 with the deferred contracts fractionally firmer; feeders up $0.47 to $1.02; hogs drop $1.17 to $1.52. ***** # Better wholesale beef prices and a premium for the cash market help to support cattle futures, but upside looks to be limited by the projections for a rising number of animals slated to come off of feed starting this spring. # Cash hogs turned defensive in reflection of an eroding packer margin. Most cash trades were made at $1 under Thursday’s levels. Slaughters are still running high and have the potential to plug the pipeline before demand can catch up, even though consumption is still pacing robustly.

Record Differential The latest "State of the Automotive Finance Market" report from Experian released on Thursday showed that average loan amount for a new vehicle was a record $30,621 in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $19,329 for used vehicle, with the gap at $11,292. This compares to a differential of $10,701 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Melinda Zabritski, Experian's senior director of automotive finance, attributed this widening gap to the rising cost of new vehicles. "This upward trend is causing many consumers to find alternative methods like extending loan terms, getting a short-term lease or opting for a used vehicle to get what they want while staying within their monthly budget," Zabritsk added.

The percentage of prime+ new borrowers choosing to lease increased to 34.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 32.7 percent for the year-ago period. The average term of loan for a new vehicle was 68 months or roughly 5-1/2 years in the fourth quarter of 2016, up from 67 months in 2015, compared to 36 months for a used vehicle in the fourth quarter of 2016. Average payment for new vehicle loans hit a record at $506 in Q4 2016 from $493 in Q415. Lease payment for new vehicle loans was $414 versus $412 last year. In comparison, average payment for used vehicles was $364. Delinquencies Rise Bloomberg Gadfly columnist Lisa Abramowicz said in a recent column that delinquencies among lower-rated borrowers are at the highest level since 2009. The amount of outstanding auto loans is rising at a record rate and now accounts for a bigger proportion of total U.S. household liabilities in about 14 years, Abramowicz noted. The Bloomberg column also noted that auto lenders such as Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF), Ally Financial Inc (NYSE: ALLY), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc (NYSE: SC) have reported a rising proportion of net charge-offs in recent years. The broader pain in the auto industry and broader consumer creditworthiness will also extend to smaller independent lenders and the captive financing arms at auto companies, the column said. Rising delinquencies and losses would impact the bottom line of these companies. In the eventuality, these companies could underwrite more auto loans at narrower yields. Abramowicz believes the troubles in the auto loan market will cause a lot of headaches and possible insolvencies. Auto lenders, however, cannot afford to be aggressive, as eventually they will be left straddled with worse losses.

In fact, eight out of the 10 largest tech IPOs in history declined between 15 and 71 percent in their first year on the public market. Related Link: Will Snap Be The Comeback Of The Tech IPO? The Snap short trade is a popular idea among retail investors, but shortable shares will initially be hard to come by. Retail investors who were unable to short shares of Snap on Thursday may have better luck on Friday. According to a representative from E*Trade, the firm expects to have Snap shares available to short immediately after the market open on Friday. The representative told Benzinga customers must be enrolled in the firm’s Hard to Borrow program due to Snap being listed as a hard to borrow security. IPO underwriters are forbidden by rule from lending out shares of the IPO stock within the first 30 days of trading. That means that firms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Credit Suisse will not be able to lend their shares for the time being. Fortunately for potential short sellers, they didn’t appear to have missed an opportunity on Thursday. Snap shares are up another 4.9 percent in Friday’s pre-market session.

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process. Those who transact in the Oil sector and finace Industry know this. You can demonise Jonathan, but what is done here is similar hype that sent Jonathan from office. The SS cannot be the weeping child all the time. We all suffered the back lash in Crude shut-in from February 2016 to February 2017. When it relates to foolani and Yoruba, it is a no discuss issue, but once it is South South and Igbo, then the media is deployed to malign. Shell and Eni are fighting back, because they know that all other blocks traded in the past by any other IOC had same thing, including Buhari new in-laws’.

Shahokaya “Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block.” Phd holder indeed. News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A. Group and Rocky Top Services, allegedly received $336,456,906.78.” emmanuel Was Indimi, Mai Deribe, Theophlus Danjuma and the severl foolanis ans Southerners used as their fronts for all other Oil block IOC’s? They all registered their companies to acquire the Oil blocks. Please tell us another story. Etete was Oil Minister, Alakija was a hair dresser, Indimi was a commodity trader, Danjuma was a soldier. nonsense! We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

Despite incredible odds, this businessman has been able to attract the support from heavyweight patrons of all faiths, including Theodore McCarrick, the archbishop emeritus of Washington, D.C.; Prince Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, a senior member of the royal family of Saudi Arabia; and, more controversially, Sheikh Muhammad A. Hussein, the grand mufti of Jerusalem, the Sunni Muslim in charge of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. show chapters The billionaire who’s saving Bethlehem    Friday, 3 Mar 2017 | 8:00 AM ET | 00:57 The task requires a tenacious spirit. On one hand, the unassuming Athens-based construction magnate, one of the family that owns the $5.3 billion Consolidate Contractors Company, is dealing with the Israeli occupational government, which has a say in much of what happens in Bethlehem. The Palestinian city lies just beyond the wall that separates Israel and Palestine, in between Jerusalem and the Jordan River. Khoury also has to cope with Palestinian politics, which are in a perpetual state of disarray depending on support — or the lack of it — from the international community. The long conflict and military occupation have exacted a heavy toll on Bethlehem, which could otherwise be one of the most visited tourism destinations in the world. The GDP per capita in the West Bank and Gaza is $4,300. Bethlehem remains a poor city, where some families live in one-room homes and many young people lack jobs. Last month U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he was backing away from the U.S. commitment to a Palestinian state, as he rebuked Israel for its continual appropriation of Palestinian land in the West Bank. Many observers took Trump's moves — which have knocked both sides and neighboring Jordan off balance — as a sign he intends to reopen peace negotiations. A political morass  Fractured politics mirror the fractured religions: The main attraction in Bethlehem is the Church of the Nativity, said to the be birthplace of Christ. It has been governed for centuries by three denominations whose defense of their "zones" in the church is legendary and has sometimes come to blows: the Franciscan order of Roman Catholics, the Greek Orthodox Church and Armenian Apostolic Church. "They are not businesspeople," said Khoury, sounding pained, recounting the difficulties of getting the lights strung to decorate the Church at Christmas. But, moved by his family's Greek Orthodox and Palestinian roots, Khoury has a new vision for Bethlehem: Within 10 years, he wants to see 3 million tourists a year thronging the narrow streets. Three years in, he said, "We're 5 percent to 10 percent there." Paying it forward Khoury's late father, Said, founded the Bethlehem Development Foundation, a nonprofit that has so far spent $30 million. It aims to raise and spend another $70 million by 2027. "It's a sad city when you enter," said Khoury. "This is the center of Christianity, important for 2 billion people. My father said: 'It is going to be a ghetto if nobody does anything.'" David Silverman | Getty Images A pilgrim lays her hand on the silver star in the Grotto under the Church of the Nativity, which according to tradition marks the sport Jesus was born. Khoury, who picked up the reigns after his father died in 2014, wants to do everything from spur tourism with a new hotel and new agreements with Israeli bus companies, to helping develop jobs-training programs for students at a local university. The streets of Bethlehem are lined with tiny shops, many selling olive wood trinkets and beautifully carved nativity sets, but they are struggling. Bassem Giacaman, one of the shopkeepers, said before the Second Intifada, his shop had revenue of $400,000 a year, and employed 12. Now, it brings in about $100,000 a year, enough to employ three people and earn him a tiny profit, perhaps $10,000. Still, he stays, he said, because he wants to keep his family's workshop alive and because he loves the Church of the Nativity. In 1948, the Christian population of the Holy Land was 18 percent; it's now 2 percent, according to the Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation. Giacaman has tried to make his shop welcoming for everyone: it carries menorahs, nativity sets, Arabic calligraphy— and welcomes tourists who need to use the toilet. "We just try to open the door and keep things going," he said. Khoury said he was in part inspired to continue his father's work when he talked to people like Giacaman. The Foundation, with the initial donation of $30 million from the Khourys in 2011, is helping the Palestinian government manage the much-lauded restoration of the Church, refurbished Manger Square, where tourist buses park, helped start a small museum, and financed a strategic solid waste management plan for the area. It's now working on plans to build a small shopping center and car park, a solar power station that could power small factories, and a small hotel of about 100 rooms. More from Global Investing Hot Spots: Who will win the world's biggest IPO? A $100 billion global arms race Trump wants to win Saudi Aramco taps JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley for IPO; HSBC a contender Some of the projects may be funded via investments – he said he believes some projects could yield 10 percent annually—and some via donations. Though between 1 and 2 million people visit the Church every year – exact numbers are hard to come by – few stay overnight and little economic benefit comes to the town of about 25,000 people. A philanthropic cause Khoury's late father was a Greek Orthodox Palestinian who immigrated to Lebanon, founded CCC, and then moved it to Greece. "He was a true believer," Samer Khoury said of his father. CCC, now run by his three sons, has about 100,000 employees worldwide and had revenue of $5.3 billion in 2016, Khoury said. It builds projects of enormous scale: CCC builds or is a partner on projects such as the giant 60 kilometer Riyadh Metro in Saudi Arabia, a giant expo center in Kazakhstan, and -- in the near future -- oil platforms off the East Coast of Africa, Khoury said. CCC is a part owner of the power plant in Gaza, the southern part of the Palestinian Territory. In Bethlehem, the scale of projects is much smaller. Sometimes, in the complicated politics of the town, the goals can get tripped up by something as small as a string of lights. For instance, stringing lights on the Church of the Nativity opened a fraught negotiation between the three denominations. An extra light hanging on the wrong side of a wall might have been taken as a sign one of the denominations had ceded territory in the church to another. In the Church of the Nativity, the walls, the windows and even a crack in the floor are claimed by one of the three. "It is funny," said Khoury, without laughing even a little bit. "It is not practical." He is a little frustrated, but he is not giving up. Issam Rimawi | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images The Church of the Nativity is seen during its restoration in Bethlehem, West Bank on November 28, 2016. Though there are many nonprofits and aid agencies working in Bethlehem, Khoury's effort is different, observers said, because of its breadth, Khoury's business acumen, the money behind it and the expertise CCC is putting to the task. "What Samer Khoury has developed is an entire mechanism to restore and rebuild Bethlehem; a city whose international reputation precedes it, but whose infrastructure, and most importantly, its people have been neglected for far too long. (He) is working … to bring hope back to the city's inhabitants," said Sir Rateb Rabie, CEO of the Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation and a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre, named by the pope for services in the Holy Land. The Bethlehem Development Foundation has an engineer working in Bethlehem on restoration of the Church, which started three years ago and will probably last for another three or four years, Khoury says. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas first convinced the three denominations to allow the restoration, but Khoury's foundation stepped in to manage payments for the highly specialized contractors doing the work, which has included replacing the 500-year old wooden roof. Now, the restoration is moving on to restoring beautiful golden icons on the walls and an ancient mosaic under the floor that tourists tramp over on their way into the grotto said to mark the birthplace of Christ. Among the discoveries during the restoration: a hole left from a stray bomb that fell during the 1967 War. Against all odds The difficulties of existing in Bethlehem, which lies just beyond the wall that separates Israel from Palestine, have defeated big companies. The InterContinental Hotels Group, for instance, withdrew its contract with the famous Jacir Palace Hotel in Bethlehem after a series of stabbings in Israel and reprisals in the West Bank. Tourists generally travel through Israel, and come via buses from Israeli touring companies, which drive in and out of the town, headed to more developed destinations on the Israeli side, as rapidly as they can. The GDP per capita in Israel is $34,800 a year. Khoury is unfazed. "This is Israel and Palestine," he said. "You have to expect that." He believes that if Bethlehem had more to offer tourists, their numbers would grow, and they would stay and spend more money. Both Israel and Palestine are seen as tourism markets with enormous untapped potential. For instance, in 2010, a comparison between Israel and Jordan found the former got about 2.8 million in tourists, compared with Jordan's 4.5 million. About 648,000 Americans visited Israel in 2016, up 5 percent compared to the last record year. Khoury remains hopeful. To cope with the complicated politics of the region, and the complicated religious politics, Khoury assembled an board of heavyweight patrons of many faiths. Khoury said he invited two Jewish board members and hopes to have one join this year. To raise more money for Bethlehem Khoury is turning to wealthy individuals, especially those with roots in Palestine. "It is like with any startup, you need a track record," he said. "We have that now." On his list of targets: Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire whose father was from Lebanon. Khoury said he believes he'll find many people willing to help. Donations have already begun coming, such as a $1.2 million gift from the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, he said. "I made a big list. These people, like our family, have connections to Palestine and have succeeded." He's convinced the story of Bethlehem will attract givers. He paused, unexpectedly poetic for a businessman. "My song that I sing, I bring many people along," he said. — By Elizabeth MacBride, special to CNBC.com Elizabeth MacBrideSpecial to CNBC.com To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

This Guy Bought the World’s Saddest Bag of Chips For the First Time You Will Be Able To Get Eggslut Sandwiches On The East Coast By Phil Wahba Posted March 03, 2017 Costco Wholesale on Thursday announced a membership fee hike, even as it reported disappointing revenues and profit for its second fiscal quarter. The company, the second largest U.S. retailer after Walmart, will raise the price of its Gold Star membership by $5 per year to $60, and lift its Executive membership fee $10 a year to $120 as of June 1. Costco last increased the fee November 2011 and raises it about every five or six years. The hike was widely anticipated by Wall Street analysts and is revenue that will go straight to Costco’s bottom line: Costco’s 86.7 million card holders spent $2.6 billion on membership fees in fiscal 2016, essentially making up nearly three-quarters of its $3.6 billion in operating income. And the increase could prove to be a boon. Last year, Costco switched its Citi-issued membership credit card to Visa from American Express, making Costco membership available to far more households and vastly increasing Costco’s potential customer base. In a research note earlier this week, UBS predicted consumers would not balk at an increase and noted that the increased incentives from the Visa card, which gives customers 2% cash back on Costco transactions, compared to 1% with the previous AmEx cards, mean that “Costco credit card customers would need to spend just $500 in a year to break even on a $5 membership fee hike.” The Wall Street Journal has reported that J.P. Morgan Chase projects a membership fee increase could add another three to five percentage points to annual earnings growth over the next two years. That would be a welcome boost for a company whose profit growth has slowed in recent years. Still, the news of hike were not enough to overshadow Costco’s results, which sent its shares down 4% in after hours trading. Revenue in the quarter ended Feb. 12, was $29.13 billion, below Wall Street forecasts for $29.86 billion, while earnings per share were $1.17, compared to $1.36. Comparable sales were up 3%, missing expectations for a 3.5% increases. This article originally appeared on Fortune.

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process. Those who transact in the Oil sector and finace Industry know this. You can demonise Jonathan, but what is done here is similar hype that sent Jonathan from office. The SS cannot be the weeping child all the time. We all suffered the back lash in Crude shut-in from February 2016 to February 2017. When it relates to foolani and Yoruba, it is a no discuss issue, but once it is South South and Igbo, then the media is deployed to malign. Shell and Eni are fighting back, because they know that all other blocks traded in the past by any other IOC had same thing, including Buhari new in-laws’.

Shahokaya “Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block.” Phd holder indeed. News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A. Group and Rocky Top Services, allegedly received $336,456,906.78.” emmanuel Was Indimi, Mai Deribe, Theophlus Danjuma and the severl foolanis ans Southerners used as their fronts for all other Oil block IOC’s? They all registered their companies to acquire the Oil blocks. Please tell us another story. Etete was Oil Minister, Alakija was a hair dresser, Indimi was a commodity trader, Danjuma was a soldier. nonsense! We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

Kaykay @shahokaya:disqus : Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not have any spatial awareness in office or ever understood the duties and functions of the office of president he occupied by chance and happenstance. He was lost in space and lost in thoughts unable to think anything through. Goodluck Jonathan left no moral legacy behind but instead left a wrecked country tossed all around in criminal docks for high crimes and untold thefts. ::????????

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES.

Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process. Those who transact in the Oil sector and finace Industry know this. You can demonise Jonathan, but what is done here is similar hype that sent Jonathan from office. The SS cannot be the weeping child all the time. We all suffered the back lash in Crude shut-in from February 2016 to February 2017. When it relates to foolani and Yoruba, it is a no discuss issue, but once it is South South and Igbo, then the media is deployed to malign. Shell and Eni are fighting back, because they know that all other blocks traded in the past by any other IOC had same thing, including Buhari new in-laws’.

Shahokaya “Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block.” Phd holder indeed. News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A. Group and Rocky Top Services, allegedly received $336,456,906.78.” emmanuel Was Indimi, Mai Deribe, Theophlus Danjuma and the severl foolanis ans Southerners used as their fronts for all other Oil block IOC’s? They all registered their companies to acquire the Oil blocks. Please tell us another story. Etete was Oil Minister, Alakija was a hair dresser, Indimi was a commodity trader, Danjuma was a soldier. nonsense! We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence.

Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process. Those who transact in the Oil sector and finace Industry know this. You can demonise Jonathan, but what is done here is similar hype that sent Jonathan from office. The SS cannot be the weeping child all the time. We all suffered the back lash in Crude shut-in from February 2016 to February 2017. When it relates to foolani and Yoruba, it is a no discuss issue, but once it is South South and Igbo, then the media is deployed to malign. Shell and Eni are fighting back, because they know that all other blocks traded in the past by any other IOC had same thing, including Buhari new in-laws’.

News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A. Group and Rocky Top Services, allegedly received $336,456,906.78.” emmanuel Was Indimi, Mai Deribe, Theophlus Danjuma and the severl foolanis ans Southerners used as their fronts for all other Oil block IOC’s? They all registered their companies to acquire the Oil blocks. Please tell us another story. Etete was Oil Minister, Alakija was a hair dresser, Indimi was a commodity trader, Danjuma was a soldier. nonsense! We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

Kaykay @shahokaya:disqus : Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not have any spatial awareness in office or ever understood the duties and functions of the office of president he occupied by chance and happenstance. He was lost in space and lost in thoughts unable to think anything through. Goodluck Jonathan left no moral legacy behind but instead left a wrecked country tossed all around in criminal docks for high crimes and untold thefts. ::????????

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president. However it’s not the case with Jonathan he chose his personal greedy corrupt immature interest over that of Nigeria thereby giving away one of the most priced assets of Nigeria to foreign companies and a few evil Nigerians. As far as i am concerned Jonathan is a rouge thief an immature boy who should have never be president of Nigeria. He must be indicted for this OPL 245 corruption cos without his instructions and approval this corruption saga would never have occurred. emmanuel Osinbade should note that this Oil Block cannot go to any foolani man – period. It must remain in the South South. Those who have handled his visits and the negotiations should inform him. Nigeria must re-open the processes of all Oil blocks allocated in the past or renewed by Buhari last year. They all suffered same fate, so they cannot make the World believe that this is the only one that went through payment of commissions or cuts. Sheer hypocrisy. Buhari’s Magu should re-open the blocks held by Indimi, one of the considerations for the latest marriage; since that automatically remove IBB from the picture (After Mohammed and Indimi’s daughter broke up – the initial seal on the block). Abi dem think say Nigerians dey blind? emmanuel Shhhhhhhh, all Oil blocks allocated from Buhari in 1985 to Obj went through very similar process. Those who transact in the Oil sector and finace Industry know this. You can demonise Jonathan, but what is done here is similar hype that sent Jonathan from office. The SS cannot be the weeping child all the time. We all suffered the back lash in Crude shut-in from February 2016 to February 2017. When it relates to foolani and Yoruba, it is a no discuss issue, but once it is South South and Igbo, then the media is deployed to malign. Shell and Eni are fighting back, because they know that all other blocks traded in the past by any other IOC had same thing, including Buhari new in-laws’.

News Reader How Adoke, Etete, Alhaji Abubakar and General Gusau robbed Nigeria “(MILAN, Oct 1). Italian prosecutors investigating state-backed firm Eni SpA over the purchase of a Nigerian oil field three years ago allege that at least half of the $1.1 billion paid was used to bribe local politicians, intermediaries and others, according to official documents and a person close to the investigation. The Malabu oil scam, which has been under investigation for over four years, relates to the billions of dollars paid by oil giants, Shell and ENI, into a Federal Government account for OPL 245, considered the richest oil block in Africa. The money was allegedly diverted by Adoke and paid into private accounts. Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who is the Chairman of the A. A. Group and Rocky Top Services, allegedly received $336,456,906.78.” emmanuel Was Indimi, Mai Deribe, Theophlus Danjuma and the severl foolanis ans Southerners used as their fronts for all other Oil block IOC’s? They all registered their companies to acquire the Oil blocks. Please tell us another story. Etete was Oil Minister, Alakija was a hair dresser, Indimi was a commodity trader, Danjuma was a soldier. nonsense! We dey hear “Without competitive tendering and with full, unconditional exemption from all national taxes, the OPL 245 block was bought illegally in contravention of domestic laws. In total, $801.5 million was allegedly transferred to Etete’s Malabu accounts; and $466 million out of the amount was used for remunerating government officials, including Jonathan and Alison-Madueke. A suspected “agent” of Jonathan, named Abubakar Aliyu, is alleged to have withdrawn a further $54 million and beneficiaries of the money went on a shopping spree buying property, aeroplanes, armoured cars.” ……..Italy Prosecutors’ filed charges in Italian Court (December, 2016) The Revolutionaries @shahokaya:disqus There’s no peaceful way to resolve Nigeria’s theft crisis. Blood must flow. No country can move forward surrounded by heinous thefts – of stolen money, stolen lands, stolen cars, and stolen status. All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

Kaykay @shahokaya:disqus : Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not have any spatial awareness in office or ever understood the duties and functions of the office of president he occupied by chance and happenstance. He was lost in space and lost in thoughts unable to think anything through.

US stocks pull back; Snap surges in debut Money Friday 3 March 2017 - 6:58am File: Analysts said a pullback in the broader market was to be expected after US stocks gained more than one percent in a heady session Wednesday that left all three indices at records. Photo: EPA NEW YORK - Wall Street stocks retreated from records Thursday amid weakness in energy and financial shares, while Snapchat owner Snap Inc. surged in its first day of trading. Analysts said a pullback in the broader market was to be expected after US stocks gained more than one percent in a heady session Wednesday that left all three indices at records. "A lot of it has to do with that move yesterday," said Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "I think it's just a simple case of profit taking today given the large move in major stock averages yesterday."

The EFCC had in December filed related charges against two former Nigerian ministers, Mohammed Adoke and Dan Etete, and others after concluding investigations on the 2011 controversial‎ sale of OPL 245. The alleged fraud committed by the ex-Nigerian officials and officials of the oil firms, has also led to investigations and charges in Italy. The EFCC had also secured a court order ensuring the return of the OPL 245 to the Nigerian government, pending the determination of the court case against the defendants. Although Shell and ENI have appealed that court order obtained on January 26, both companies were not charged for their roles by the Nigerian government until Thursday. The defendants according to the fresh charge include the Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited; Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited; ENI SPA: the then directors of the oil firms, Ralph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujati Stefeno, and Burrafato Sebastiano; Dauzia Lauya also known as Dan Etete;Mohammed Adoke; Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil and Gas Limited. ‎Messrs Casula and Etete were also among those ‎indicted‎ by Italian prosecutors who have indicated their intentions to file charges against them. According to the charges filed on Thursday, the defendants were accused of committing the crime of conspiracy to commit felony against the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences, ICPC, Act. The oil firms and their then directors were also alleged to have fraudulently paid $801 million to Messrs. Adoke, Etete, Aliyu, and Malabu for the oil block. OPL 245 is considered one of Nigeria’s richest oil blocks and estimated to contain over nine billion barrels of crude. Investigations had revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the handing over of OPL 245 to Malabu, shortly after assuming office in 2010. According to investigations, Mr. Jonathan asked the then Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke, to solidify the transfer of OPL 245 to Malabu, a company then controlled by a fellow Nigerian from the Niger-Delta region, Dan Etete. Despite Mr. Jonathan’s directive that Malabu be given OPL 245, the company really did not exist and had no staff or technical competence to manage the block. Based on advice from desperate businessmen, including an Israeli, Ednan Agaev, Mr. Etete decided to cash in on the block. Through various middlemen, the former minister approached oil giants, Shell and ENI, to buy the block. Knowing Mr. Etete’s history, including the fact that he had been convicted in France for money laundering, the oil firms would not do a direct deal. For the transaction to continue, a legally recognised mediator would have to be found. That mediator turned out to be the Nigerian government, represented by Mr. Adoke. The agreements that were sealed led to Shell and ENI paying the $1.1 billion into a Nigerian government account in JP Morgan Chase in London. The money was to then be transferred to Malabu accounts controlled by Mr. Etete. Although Shell and ENI have repeatedly claimed they did not know the money was going to end up with Malabu, investigations in Nigeria and Italy as well as leaked documents revealed that claim to be false. Mr. Adoke himself would later admit that he, on behalf of the federal government, only acted as a mediator for two willing parties – Malabu and the oil majors. Mr. Adoke was, however, aware of the various fraudulent manipulations of Malabu by Mr. Etete when he authorised the transaction, multiple sources have told PREMIUM TIMES. TRANSFERS TO FRAUDULENT FIRMS To ensure no one stopped the shady transfer of the $1.1 billion to Mr. Etete, the money had to be quickly transferred. More so, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was set to assume office as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and the officials involved were not sure she would play ball. On August 16, 2011, a day before Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala was to assume office, Mr. Adoke and the then Minister of State for Finance, Yerima Ngama, authorised the transfer of the money to Malabu accounts in Nigeria controlled by Mr. Adoke. However, all the $1.1 billion could not be transferred. Emeka Obi, a man who claimed he helped broker the deal between Malabu and the oil majors filed a suit in the UK, that ensured $215 million was frozen of the money. The remaining $801 million was subsequently transferred to Mr. Etete: $400 million was transferred to a Bank PHB account while $401 million was transferred to a First Bank account. Immediately Mr. Etete received the money, curious transfers began. PREMIUM TIMES investigations, now confirmed by the EFCC, reveal that shady companies linked to Abubakar Aliyu received about $479 million dollars from Mr. Etete. Our investigations later showed that most of the companies were non-existent and used fake addresses in their registration documents. The companies – Rocky Top Resource Ltd, Imperial Union Ltd, Novel Properties & Dev. Co. Ltd, A-Group Construction Ltd, and Megatech Engineering Ltd – were all charged in the suit filed by the EFCC last December. While Mr. Etete later admitted that only $250 million of the money paid into his account was his, Mr. Aliyu is believed to have acted as a front for officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration, including Mr. Adoke.

City Lawyers @arabakpura:disqus Mohammed Adoke could be ex-President Jonathan’s Achilles’ heel for assuring Jonathan and the general public that no criminal or civil liability would follow Jonathan’s private business as A BROKER of a private deal between SHELL OIL and MALABU OIL on the illegal sale of OPL 245 under the table in criminal side-step of Nigeria’s Off-Shore and Petroleum laws. Mohammed Adoke, an ignorant fellow, was of course dead wrong on point of law. He said the federal government – i.e. President Jonathan – merely acted as an ‘obligor’ – to sound confident that no liability would ensue. But an obligor does not mean an innocent bystander in law but rather means a full participant as counter-party to a transaction. In June 2015, the United States Justice Department in Washington D.C said it has begun criminal investigation of two counter-parties to Dan Etete’s OPL 245 fraud transaction. On the wording of ‘obligor’ that the daft Muhammed Adoke as attorney general inserted, ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan may just be one of the two ‘counter-parties’ now under investigation for money-laundering in the United States of America for wangling out a whopping $1.2 billion Arabakpura Thanks a lot! … and Jonathan is a good and Peaceful man! sammyctu ode When the people of A country vote for a president it’s cos they have faith and confidence in him to ensure that the interest of that country is well protected by that president.

All treasury thieves in Nigeria now need to be physically attacked and killed. The families of treasury thieves – wives and children – must also be swiftly laid to rest in perfect peace since they are not entitled to inherit stolen assets under any written will. The thefts since October 1st 1960 must all be brought to revolutionary justice on the streets under the death penalty in the Constitution. The deciders of who shall get the death penalty will be the youths – armed as ordinary citizens and formed into cells as well-organized militias. In 30 days of swift and bloody justice on the streets, the story of corruption will end in Nigeria for the grave-diggers to then bury the remains of those consumed by the people’s revolution. Nigerians may delay or dither over this final solution but that is what’s going to happen. The longer it is delayed, the worse for the country now stolen into darkness. Sanssouci We all get ur point but pls consider the following: 1) mohammed bello adoke, aliyu abubakar and aliyu gusau are all northern muslims, and all neck deep in this shit. 2)if indimi, alakija and danjuma all got their oil blocks by performing international fraud why have international authorities not gone after them in the past? 3) since u have facts about indimi, alakija, danjuma that most of us dont, why didnt u urge GEJ to go after them when he was at helm of affairs? 4) doesnt it bother u one bit that a bloc containing 9.23 billion barrels probable reserves was sold for 1.1billion$ at a time a barrel was higher than 100$? Do u sincerely think dan ete and GEJ worked in SS people’s interest in doing so? speechtherapy With due respect bros, there are many sides to this transaction that you and the public in general are unaware of but sadly are quick to jump to judgment about. For one thing, it was not the GEJ govt that agreed a settlement with Malabu, it was OBJs government but were unable to implement it because Shell took them to court to stop it. In fact Shell was close to securing a claim of $2B against the Nigerian govt for same. I work in the oil industry and have followed this case from the onset, the real crime here does in no way include withholding money from the Nigeria purse, in fact the Nigerian govt got $201M in signature bonus themselves instead of the original $20M it had charged for same. Like I said, too many sides to this, I suggest we wait till the court cases commence. Forensics @shahokaya:disqus How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering Goodluck Jonathan may just have been led by the nose into a deadly minefield of international moneylaundering by his usually moronic attorney-general, Adoke Muhammed, but alas, Jonathan may not exit this criminal tangle for the next 20 years, just as Dan Etete himself has not exited it since the year 1998. Goodluck Jonathan is his own undoing. He is a slow thinker and a bad decider of sensible options. Even in his choice of attorney-general he picked the most atrocious of the 100,000 lawyers on offer. Now he has to stew in his own juices. He doesn’t deserve any sympathy. It is even a crime of abetment of felony to support Jonathan over this OPL 245. Were both Jonathan and Adoke possessed of average intelligence the duo could have easily resolved the Malabu Oil tussle with Shell Oil company over OPL 245 without their getting implicated, as has happened, in moneylaundering offences at home and abroad, following from the very daft options both men selected. But see. Adoke does not know the law and Jonathan too does not know the logic. Forensics …….(2) How JONATHAN walked into a minefield of moneylaundering It was Goodluck Jonathan who authorised that Eni Oil company pay $1.1billion. into JP Morgan’s New York bank account of Nigeria’s NNPC state oil company to disguise it as official payment. Within weeks Jonathan then authorised that the entire funds be transferred to JP Morgan’s branch in London en route Dan Etete; where the loot was then shared out to seven criminal co-conspirators, including a Russian citizen. Already the Italians have signaled intention to subpoena Dan Etete for trial. The currently filed case in Nigeria will not preclude simultaneous criminal trial in Italy because no double jeopardy doctrine is legally invocable for distinct criminal offences committed in two different jurisdictions. Dan Etete himself is now frustrated and flustered and has begun to squeal on his accomplices. Dan Etete has said late last year that $800 million out of the $1.1 billion bribe money was pocketed by other people in the deal, as he only took $250million. That means he will now be ready to squeal on all those other people who spirited away the $800million., most likely including Goodluck Jonathan and General Aliyu Gusau whom Italian investigators have specifically fingerpointed in the charges filed in court in Milan, Italy, to begin the criminal prosecution of all the bribe-takers. Reckoned in historical years, Dan Etete who practically stole OPL 245 (by corrupt self-award as Petroleum Minister) has been struggling in vain since the year 1998 to get away with the 250 million dollars loot he got from his criminal brace, but he’s only got more entangled as defendant in severe criminal prosecutions; both in Italy and Nigeria. Even in his self-chosen profession of looting Dan Etete is a failure after 20 years of failing to run away from his own crime scene. But now, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Adoke Muhammed may become Dan Etete’s heirs or successors, and locked into this criminal case with him; having been his privies in the daft conspiracy to coax Eni oil company in Italy to fork out the $1.1billion. Pastor J.J.Jones “The love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they erred from faith and pierced themselves with sorrows. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro, of those who seek death. There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked. One who guards himself prudently will stay far from the crooked”.

Kaykay @shahokaya:disqus : Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not have any spatial awareness in office or ever understood the duties and functions of the office of president he occupied by chance and happenstance. He was lost in space and lost in thoughts unable to think anything through. Goodluck Jonathan left no moral legacy behind but instead left a wrecked country tossed all around in criminal docks for high crimes and untold thefts. ::????????

Mayo, who wrote “Exile on Wall Street: One Analyst’s Fight to Save the Big Banks From Themselves,” introduced himself as a “ free agent” Tuesday at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s annual Investor Day. He gave no indication Thursday where he might be headed next, though he noted that he’s been fired about three times in his career and resigned five times. “There’s always room for those who are good at their job,” Mayo said.

Sign Up President Donald Trump has called for a moratorium on new rules so existing measures can be reviewed, and he’s signed directives aimed at starting the process of rolling back restrictions put in place to prevent another financial crisis. Among his targets are rules that guard against predatory lenders and force brokers to lower fees for retirees, as well as the Dodd-Frank Act, the sweeping overhaul of U.S. financial regulation put in place after the financial crisis. “My message to Washington, D.C., is: Don’t sacrifice one iota of the strength of the banking industry,” Mayo said. “But once you’ve done that, eliminate all the red tape, the complications. I mean, you have seven different regulators overseeing mortgage finance. That’s just too many.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Analysts said a pullback in the broader market was to be expected after US stocks gained more than one percent in a heady session Wednesday that left all three indices at records. "A lot of it has to do with that move yesterday," said Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "I think it's just a simple case of profit taking today given the large move in major stock averages yesterday." The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5 percent to close at 21,002.97 after breaking through 21,000 for the first time Wednesday. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.6 percent to end the day at 2,381.90, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.7 percent to finish at 5,861.22. Leading banking shares, which had piled on more than three percent Wednesday, were among the biggest losers, with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America falling more than one percent. Energy shares also fell on lower oil prices. Snap, parent of the instant messaging service Snapchat, jumped 44 percent after raising $3.4 billion, in the richest US tech company listing since Facebook in 2012. The company saw its share price end its debut trading session at $24.48 well above its initial price of $17. Dow member Caterpillar slumped 4.3 percent after federal investigators descended on the industrial giant's facilities in and around its Peoria, Illinois headquarters. Company officials did not comment on the nature of the probe, but local media said there were officials from the Internal Revenue Service and other US agencies. Monster Beverage jumped 12.7 percent after reporting fourth quarter net income rose 24.7 percent to $172.9 million.

AmEx is announcing a new set of features for its Platinum Card, the popular charge card aimed at well-off and frequently traveling customers. Platinum Card customers will get a $200 credit on Uber and the ability to earn five points per dollar on hotels. The card is also getting a redesign and will be issued in stainless steel instead of plastic. (Photo: AP) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE American Express Co. is escalating the rewards war for premium credit cards, offering Platinum customers $200 of free Uber rides while raising the annual fee. Redesigned in stainless steel, the card will cost new holders $550 starting on March 30, a $100 increase that will take effect for existing users when they renew after Sept. 1. It’s the first fee hike in more than a decade, according to Janey Whiteside, AmEx’s senior vice president for global charge products, benefits and services. But AmEx, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Chenault, is providing more sweeteners. In addition to the credit for Uber Technologies Inc.’s car-hailing service, users will be able to earn five-times rewards points at eligible hotels booked through the lender’s website. And AmEx is expanding its collection of airport lounges. The largest U.S. credit-card issuer by purchases is under pressure to defend its dominance. Rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. made a splash in August with a Sapphire Reserve card featuring an initial sign-up bonus of 100,000 points, drawing so many applicants it temporarily ran out of materials to mint it. Earlier this week, AmEx consumer services chief Doug Buckminster called the offer “a full-frontal assault” on the Platinum portfolio, noting that attrition temporarily increased among those holders after the Sapphire Reserve’s debut. “We view today’s announcement as an attempt to stop the bleeding,” Bill Carcache, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst who recommends investors sell AmEx shares, said Thursday in a note to investors. “A significant portion” of platinum card billings shifted to Sapphire Reserve last quarter, when AmEx “increased its investments to record levels without moving the needle on billings growth,” he wrote. AmEx shares fell 1.4 percent to $80.77 at 11:28 a.m. in New York, the worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Still, Whiteside said American Express’s changes are a response to customer feedback, not to competitors. The company declined to specify the new Platinum card’s sign-up bonus. “We’ve worked to refine and evolve the card,” Whiteside said in an interview. “We’re really redefining the playing field here.” Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2mymBY7 TOP VIDEOS Sen.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:20 AM, March 4, 2017 Updated: 12:50 AM, March 4, 2017 NEW YORK - Two tools that the Federal Reserve heavily relies upon to predict U.S. inflation in fact provide little practical help, and the Fed would be wise to only modestly overshoot its 2-percent price target, concludes a high-profile paper published on Friday. The research, presented by five top economists to a small gathering of Fed officials and others in New York, focused on inflation's slow-moving mean since 1984, a period of relatively stable prices and what is seen as mostly effective monetary policy. With prices now edging higher, the findings could inform how aggressively the Fed hikes interest rates this year. The paper takes aim at two of the Fed's favorite gauges to predict price swings - inflation expectations, which are derived from markets and surveys; and labor market "slack," or the amount of workers actively looking for employment - and attempts to undercut their mystique. Both "contribute very little to our ability to predict movements in inflation," write the authors. "We are not claiming that slack and expectations are irrelevant; instead we are suggesting that in the current low-inflation environment they do not warrant any special status and should at least be augmented by a wider array of indicators." The Fed's preferred inflation gauge has drifted below the target since 2008 and has moved relatively little in that time even while unemployment has fallen to less than half of its crisis-era high of 10 percent, a shift that has squeezed most or all of the slack from the labor market. With inflation edging close to 2 percent, Fed officials aim to nudge rates higher this year so prices don't overshoot. Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer and regional Fed presidents Charles Evans, Jeffrey Lacker and Robert Kaplan were among those at the forum on Friday, with some offering critiques. The paper noted the Fed should aim for no more than a "modest" inflation overshoot, likely only a fraction of a percentage point over one or two years. The authors were Peter Hooper of Deutsche Bank and Michael Feroli of JPMorgan, as well as professors Anil Kashyap of University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Stephen Cecchetti of Brandeis International Business School, and Kermit Schoenholtz of New York University Stern School of Business.
