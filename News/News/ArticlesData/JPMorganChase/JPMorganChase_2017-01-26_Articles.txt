ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search This MLP ETF Just Surged To Fresh 52-Week Highs January 27, 2017 11:16am NYSE:AMJ ShareTweet Investors looking for ETFs with rising momentum should begin to consider the JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ). This product just hit a new 52-week high of $33.93 today, and is now up 66.16% from its 52-week low price of $20.42 per share. Will this ETF continue its string of recent wins? Let’s take a closer look at the fund, its recent gains, the category it resides in, and its ratings and outlook to get a sense of whether its momentum is sustainable or not. Inside AMJ’s Rise As mentioned earlier, AMJ has now gained 66.16% from its 52-week low, which was hit back on February 11, 2016. The fund has now returned 6.79% over the past month, 12.33% over the past three months, and 8.89% in the past six months. Those returns compare quite favorably to the benchmark S&P 500 index’s 2.05%, 8.37%, and 6.62% returns in the same periods, respectively. AMJ currently sits above its 10-day, 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages (MAs), which from a technical standpoint suggests a very strong possibility that the recent gains can continue. That’s because the shares have no short-term overhead resistance to bump up against, which is to be expected for a product that’s at its yearly highs. A Look Under The Hood JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN is a Equity-focused product issued by JP Morgan Chase. Its expense ratio of 0.85% makes it the #10 cheapest ETF among 22 total funds in the MLP ETFs category. AMJ currently boasts $3.80B in assets under management (AUM), placing it #2 of 22 ETFs in its category, and #119 of 1922 total ETFs in the U.S. exchange traded universe. The investment objective of the JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN is to provide investors a way to gain exposure to midstream energy MLPs. The ETNs pay a variable quarterly coupon linked to the cash distributions paid on the MLPs in the index, less accrued tracking fees. With MLPs surging over the past year or so amid rising energy prices, it shouldn’t be surprising that AMJ is hitting new highs. Donald Trump’s promise to get a couple of controversial pipeline projects completed is helping as well. It’s also worth nothing that AMJ has a 6.5% yield, making it it highly attractive to yield-seeking investors amid a low interest rate environment. AMJ SMART Grade: More Gains Ahead? AMJ currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #2 of 22 funds in the MLP ETFs category. A SMART Grade of A suggests very strong future price growth potential, so it’s reasonable to expect even more gains ahead. Given the rebound in the energy markets and still-low interest rates, AMJ receives our highest approval. For more information about this ETF, including full ratings, news, data, and more, please visit AMJ’s ticker page. Want Important ETF Info Delivered Straight To Your Inbox?

  Markets Stocks Indices Commodities Currencies Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds News SIGN IN BUSINESS INSIDER       PORTFOLIO SEARCH Markets Stocks Indices Commodities Currencies Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds News CANCEL One of the most powerful women in finance on protectionism, China, Dow 20k, and 'Brexit on steroids' Tina Wadhwa Jan. 27, 2017, 08:20 AM Bessemer Trust Business Insider recently caught up with Rebecca Patterson, the chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, to hear about her outlook for the global economy in 2017. Bessemer Trust, a privately owned wealth and investment management firm, oversees more than $100 billion in assets. Patterson was the former Chief Markets Strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management and former  Global Head of Foreign Exchange and Commodities for the JPMorgan Private Bank. She started her career in journalism as a reporter for Dow Jones in London. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Federal Reserve's Investor Advisory Committee and the Economic Club of New York. American Banker named her one of "The 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance" in 2014, 2015, and 2016. In the interview, Patterson discusses protectionism, China and where she sees value.  This is part one of a series. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Tina Wadhwa: The Dow finally hit the "landmark" number of 20k on Wednesday. Is this overrated, is this relevant? Does it actually mean anything for the markets or is it just a psychological high? Rebecca Patterson: The Dow reaching 20,000 is more psychological in my view than anything. What’s more important is what’s happening behind the scenes. Economic data in the U.S. and overseas that is generally improving, better earnings news from US companies, and growing hopes that policy will translate into even faster economic activity. Of those, I worry mainly about the policy. So much is being discounted into valuations now that it will be increasingly important that Congress and the White House show action quickly to back up the rhetoric. If legislation gets watered down or significantly delayed, or if policy focus turns more towards global trade restrictions, we could quickly see at least a short-term pullback in stocks. Business InsiderWadhwa: So this week marked President Trump’s first full week in office and he has embarked on some pretty protectionist measures. He pulled the US out of the TPP, and in a meeting with business leaders said he was going to impose a "very major border tax" on US companies that move overseas and export back into the US. There’s also his likely renegotiation of NAFTA. What is the impact of this and how do you think a more inward looking US will affect the global economy? Patterson: We’ve been saying since well before the election that how the US economy and how the financial markets would fare under Trump would depend in part on which Trump we got - a President Trump focused on deregulation, tax reform and infrastructure or a trade focused Trump. Our view has been and continues to be that if Trump focuses relatively more on trade and getting more introspective as a country or inward looking as a country, we see a lot less upside for equities. In fact we could see quite a bit more downside risk. Some of this I feel like is going to be a bit of a tango, we’ll take two steps forward, one step back. We may have a day where he has meetings and announcements on tax reforms and we’ll see equities rise and then we’ll have a day where he decides to have some aggressive rhetoric on trade and markets will consolidate ot sell-off. That’s largely the pattern we’ve been seeing since November 9th. I think at the end of the day, as easy as it is to focus on the hour by hour, as there is so much news focus on this right now, you need to take a more medium to long-term view. So base case at the end of 2017, where do you think you’re going to be? We think, even though it’s not going to be happen in the first 100 days, by the end of this year we are going to get some kind of corporate tax reform. That is our base case. We think Congress is making it a priority because they know if they don’t deliver it, the mid-term elections are going to be a lot more tough for them. People expect it, and they’re going to be very disappointed if it doesn’t happen. So we do think you’re going to get some kind of tax reform, corporate, as individual is a lot more difficult. We do think we’re going to get some deregulation, they announced Keystone. One could argue that’s less regulation around energy policy. So that’s all positive and we think that is, at the margin, going to be stimulative for the economy especially towards the end of the year and into 2018. And that will help support business confidence and hopefully actual business activity. Business InsiderThat said, we also do expect we are going to get some trade hits - the question to me is how aggressive is it and what actually happens. Trump had campaigned that he was going to have China called a currency manipulator on day one. And guess what, it didn’t happen. And I’m delighted it didn’t happen. To me, if that had happened, that would have been a major negative catalyst for global equity markets because a trade war with the second biggest economy in the world doesn’t end well. For anybody, including the United States. So I’m happy that didn’t happen. Yes he announced he’s renegotiating NAFTA, but what does that look like? If it ends up being very modest changes, and it’s more of a marketing win rather than a huge economic change, then that negative for the markets isn’t that great. And Mexico probably wants this clarified as soon as possible so they can move forward. I could see them giving something to Trump so he can go back to his base and to the country and say "hey I got you a better deal, and it’s done." And if Mexico can keep 85% or 90% of NAFTA benefits, and they can put this behind them and the peso is no longer in free fall, they’re happy too and so I think he can strike a deal there and probably get it done quite quickly. If he can do things like that and avoid the border adjustment tax or a major trade war with China, I think that negative risk around Trump is at a minimum. So that’s my hope. The problem is you just don’t know. When you look at the people he’s appointed to key positions on trade, like Navarro,  Leithauser, etc. they historically have been pretty tough on China, especially Navarro. I think in terms of financial markets this year, policy direction is going to be very important. It’s something we all are going to have to keep following and understanding. How it evolves is going to be a major factor in how cyclical assets perform. If there is relatively more progress on tax reform and deregulation, it’s better for equities. If the trade stuff ends up being more marketing than real, I think that’s good news. What worries me is if you have a big trade effort like the border adjustment tax which ends up being stagflationary and/or a major trade issue with China. Those would be the risks I’m watching for. Wadhwa: Markets as a whole have been rallying since Trump got elected, and there seems to be a lot of optimism for the economy right now. Do you agree with this reaction, or have we failed to price in the uncertainty you spoke about? Patterson: I think the initial reaction to Trump was a repositioning. The consensus view going into the election, for good reason as that’s what all the polls were suggesting, was that Hillary was going to win and so people had gone in expecting an economy that was sort of the same - modest growth, equities chugging along slowly. When we got a different outcome, a lot of investors went to reposition their portfolios as quickly as possible. So we saw this huge rotation. And then once that positioning was largely done, everyone was kind of sitting on their hands waiting what to do next. Business InsiderI think there is quite a bit of good news discounted in the market. Valuations are already high. Our view on equities is that we’re constructive but not euphoric. We’re neutral equities for a typical client versus our benchmark. So we’re not overweight stocks because we think the valuations are high. If Trump succeeds with tax reforms etc., then we probably also have higher wages, more inflation and the Fed tightens a little bit faster, and so we’re probably still looking at a recession during his term. At this point in the cycle, I would rather be neutral than overweight. And then within our positioning, focus on areas that should benefit if we do get the tax reform, but also think about what would we want to own if some of those risks play out. We’re aggressively overweight US stocks. We have a tilt towards more domestically oriented names, more cyclical names, we’re quite overweight the dollar, but we haven’t abandoned the non-Trump trades, if you will. We still have a healthy amount of consumer staples in our portfolio. We still have some managed volatility strategies in our portfolio. We still have a modest degree of select non-US exposure in our portfolio, and what’s been fascinating to me is that the non-US and the non-Trump trades have outperformed. And that gets me back to the year being a tango. We’ll take a step forward and a step back. I think that’s going to be the story of the year. It’s just going to be a see-saw back and forth within the sectors. Wadhwa: When you say non-US, are you looking towards Europe, Asia, the emerging markets? Where do you see value? Patterson: We’re so overweight the US that mathematically we have to be underweight everything else. I’d say where we feel more strongly about the underweight is the UK. We think as the Brexit negotiations get going in earnest, you’re likely to see Sterling fall further, even from current levels. The Current Account Deficit there is enormous as a percent of GDP, and they’re going to have a hard time attracting the capital flows to offset that. We also think that as Brexit negotiations get going and people see how difficult those are, business confidence in the UK is probably going to worsen. Business InsiderWith Europe, we’re less nervous. I want to love Europe. It’s killing me, not to love Europe. Because you’ve got a Central Bank that’s still easing, in contrast to the US, and you have much better equity valuations compared with the US. For the first time in a while we’re actually seeing some good economic momentum. So if you look at the business confidence surveys, consumer confidence surveys, bank lending, all these things are saying, okay you’ve got some positive momentum that could help corporate earnings here, which is great. With all of that, I should be buying this and not the US, but then you get to the election calendar, and you’re stopped dead in your tracks. Because the French election in April and May, it’s Brexit on steroids. Le Pen is highly unlikely to win the election, but now we’ve seen time after time after time polls can be wrong. She’s campaigned on exiting the euro currency block, and that to us is a much bigger deal than Brexit because it would throw into question the credibility of the entire single currency for Europe. So it’s a big enough risk that despite a lot of positives for continental European equities, we’re going to stay underweight. We have some exposure, but pretty minimal, and then we’ll see how that election story plays out. We might be late into it, but if she doesn’t win and you get someone a bit more centrist in that seat in May, you could have a really nice second half of the year for Europe, all else equal. So that’s an area we’re keeping a close eye on. In Japan, the weakening yen with the strengthening dollar, all else equal, is good for Japanese stocks. Japan is very sensitive to US growth, so if the US is doing better, that tends to be good for Japan. Again we’re keeping a close eye on all of these trade talks, because if he doesn’t like weak currencies helping foreign economies - I see Japan in the crosshairs a little bit. So again underweight there but not as a strong a view as the UK. With emerging markets, we’re just looking for selective companies which we think are less sensitive to possible trade situations under the Trump administration. China is the one we care most about. Mexico needs America. 25% of their GDP comes from exports to America, so they don’t have a choice. If Trump wants to deal, they have to deal. China is not nearly as reliant on exports to America as Mexico is. So if we go after China, I don’t think they are just going to sit there and take it. They’re going to retaliate in some fashion. They could threaten to lighten the amount of US Treasuries they hold or they could devalue their currency to offset any tariffs we place on them. They could also retaliate in a more indirect way. It could be militarily in the South China Sea by taking a greater stand there for example. There’s lots of things they can do. I think it was fascinating to see President Xi at Davos talking about how China is open for business. He sees an opportunity for China to strengthen its global footprint and its leadership role in the world. We’ll see how successful he is, but certainly with the trade agreement they’re working, ARCEP, he could end up benefitting greatly from this opportunity. But do we buy Chinese stocks? If we wake up and there’s a tweet about a Chinese manipulator or a Chinese tariff, the short term reaction is going to be China equities lower and greater expectations for a weaker renminbi. Then you’ll see the spillover effects to any country that has trade relations with China. That will include Asia but also a lot of the commodity exporters like Chile. It will have a global impact. The risk is great enough that even though there’s some interesting things going on with Asia right now, we’re just keeping our exposure modest and the security selection very selective.   SHARE THIS POST Gainers & LosersMore Dow Jones S&P 500 NASDAQ 100 Microsoft Rg 65.78 2.35 % Caterpillar Rg 98.99 1.82 % Johnson & Johnso Rg 113.38 1.38 % Goldman Sachs Gr Rg 236.95 -1.10 % Wal-Mart Stores Rg 65.66 -1.60 % Chevron 113.79 -2.37 % your MARKET VIEW Your Personalized Market Center Find News GO Home / News / Stock News / One of the most powerful women in banking on protectionism, China, Dow 20k, and 'Brexit on steroids' Follow us Need help?

Photo Credit: John Cumming/Getty Images The best rewards credit cards boast attractive cash back percentages, travel rewards, appealing sign-up bonuses and simple redemption models. Rewards credit cards can be divided into two general categories: travel and cash back cards. Some rewards cards offer a combo of those and points instead of straight cash back. The card that's best for you depends on your lifestyle and personal financial goals. Travel rewards cards typically offer perks and bonuses for spending on items such as airline purchases, dining, restaurants and hotels. CARD SEARCH: Compare the top rewards credit cards. <!-- iframe --> Cash back cards generally offer a percentage back for daily spending, cash back on specific categories and bonus cash for spending a specific amount within a certain time frame. CreditCards.com recently rounded up some of the best credit cards from its partners, including the best rewards credit cards. Here are the some of the best rewards credit cards, according to CreditCards.com: The best rewards credit cards Credit Card Variable APR Category Chase Freedom Unlimited 15.49 percent to 24.24 percent variable Top all-around rewards card Citi® Double Cash Credit Card 13.49 percent to 23.49 percent variable Top no annual fee rewards card Blue Cash Preferred® Card 13.49 percent to 23.49 percent variable Top cash-back rewards card Chase Sapphire Reserve 16.49 percent to 23.49 percent variable Top travel and airline rewards card Chase Sapphire Preferred® 16.49 percent to 23.49 percent variable Top points rewards card 1. Top all-around rewards credit card: Chase Freedom Unlimited CreditCards.com rated the Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card as one of the best for all-around rewards. Highlights: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card pays 1.5 percent cash back on every purchase. Chase Freedom Unlimited cardholders earn a solid $150 bonus statement credit for spending $500 purchases within the first 3 months of opening an account. This card allows you to redeem rewards for cash in any amount at any time. Those cash back rewards don't expire as long as the account is open. Chase Ultimate Rewards® points, worth 1 cent, can be transferred to other Chase cards that earn Chase Ultimate Rewards® points. Points can be redeemed for gift cards and trips booked through Chase. Fees and APR: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card has no annual fee. This card offers a 0 percent intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers. After the initial introductory period, the Chase Freedom Unlimited card offers a variable APR of 15.49 percent to 24.24 percent. There's a balance transfer fee of 5 percent of the amount transferred with a $5 minimum on the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card. Who should get this card: The Chase Freedom Unlimited is ideal for the consumer who wants a straightforward card for everyday purchases. Anyone looking for a wide range of redemption options will enjoy this card's versatility. The Chase Freedom Unlimited is especially useful for those who already hold other high-end Chase cards – like the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the Ink Plus Business Card -- since Chase Ultimate Rewards® can be transferred to other Chase cards. Disadvantages: While the Chase Freedom Unlimited has its perks – like unlimited rewards points – it has its limitations as well. Its cash-back rewards are middle of the road. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card's rate on cash back is good, but it's not the highest flat-rate available. The Citi® Double Dash Card offers 1 percent cash back on every dollar spent plus an additional 1 percent on every dollar that's paid off. There are no bonus categories. Perhaps the biggest downside to the Chase Freedom Unlimited is that it doesn't offer bonus categories. Those who spend frequently in one area may find that a card with bonus categories offers more value. Bottom line: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is a solid all around choice as a flat-rate card for rewards on everyday spending. It might be best utilized alongside another Chase card or bonus category card that offers higher percentages on spending in specific categories.   2. Top no annual fee rewards card: Citi® Double Cash Credit Card The Citi® Double Cash Credit Card recently took first place in CreditCard.com's cash back credit card competition for its industry-leading cash back on everyday purchases. But it also made the site's rewards card list as the top no annual fee credit card. It has a simple rewards structure with no categories to track, no caps on cash back and no annual fee. Highlights: The opportunity to earn generous rewards using the Citi® Double Cash credit card is what makes it stand out from the crowd. It offers 1 percent cash back on general purchases and an additional 1 percent when you pay your bill on time. There's no limit on what you can earn in cash back with this card. You can start redeeming for as little as $25. Redemption options include a statement credit, a gift card or a check. As a perk for some, the Citi® Double Cash credit card has no rotating categories requiring cardholders to remember to opt in and score rewards. The Citi® Double Cash card has no annual fee, making it cheaper than some competing cards, such as the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express. Not only does the Citi® Double Cash offer generous cash back rewards, it has perks including purchase protection and trip cancellation protection. Citi® Double Cash cardholders can benefit from the Citi Price Rewind program. The company will automatically search for lower prices on items registered online and refund the difference on better deals. Fees and APR: There's no annual fee with the Citi® Double Cash credit card. This card comes with a 0 percent APR on balance transfers for 18 months. That makes it a good option for those interested in consolidating and paying down debt. This card comes with a variable APR between 13.49 percent to 23.49 percent. Who should get this card: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is best for those who would like a flat-rate, everyday cash back card with no limits on rewards and an easy-to-use rewards structure. Those looking for simplicity in a card will also find this card ideal. There's no chasing bonus categories, no rotating categories and no annual fee. Disadvantages: The opportunity to earn cash back twice and the simplicity of this card make it a very attractive option, but there are some drawbacks. Carrying a balance can eat up rewards with this card. Interest charges can add up quick on this card's 13.49 percent to 23.49 percent variable APR. You have to pay on time. In order to earn cash back twice, the card requires you to pay your bill on time each month. If you typically carry a balance, or often fail to pay on time, this may not be the card for you. There's no sign-up bonus. Sign-up bonuses are something you'll find on many competing cards, but not on the Citi® Double Cash. There are no bonus categories. This card certainly has a high rewards rate, but there's no opportunity to earn more for spending in certain categories. If you frequently spend big on a particular category – like groceries – you may want to consider another card. Bottom line: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is a great option for straight cash back rewards. It doesn't offer bonus categories, but it's a great go-to card for earning rewards on daily purchases. Consider using this card alongside another card that offers more for where you spend the most.   Compare Rewards Credit Cards 3. Top cash back card: Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express tied for second place with the Chase Freedom Unlimited card in CreditCard.com's recent cash back card competition. Highlights: The Blue Cash Preferred® is a top-notch card for high rewards rates on categories. It offers 6 percent cash back at U.S. supermarkets up to $6,000 per year. It also offers 3 percent cash back at U.S. gas stations and select department stores. On general purchases, this card pays 1 percent. For the 1st 6 months, the Blue Cash Preferred® card offers 5 percent cash back on eligible travel purchases up to $200. The Blue Cash Preferred® offers a $150 statement credit after spending $1,000 within the 1st 3 months of opening an account. Other perks with the Blue Cash Preferred® include a cash back tracker, purchase protection, return protection and roadside assistance. Fees: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card has a variable APR between 13.49 percent and 23.49 percent, comparable to the other cards on this list. This card has a $95 annual fee, which is on the high side. But the generous rewards program, when used properly, can offset that fee. Who should get this card: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card is best for those who spend big on groceries, gas and department stores. Those who already have a card for everyday spending might find this card as a nice supplement. Pair this card with an everyday flat-rate card to get more for your money where you spend the most. The zero percent APR on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months make the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card a good option for anyone interested in financing a big purchase or consolidating and paying down debt. Disadvantages: The outstanding rewards on categories make the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card from American Express an attractive option, but it's not without its limitations. It has a spending cap. The $6,000 annual spending cap on groceries means the most you could earn is $360 at 6 percent before the relatively low 1 percent rate kicks in. It's not as widely accepted. American Express isn't as widely used as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. That might make it necessary to keep a backup card, or to use this card strategically with others. The $95 annual fee is higher than other cash-back cards. You'll need to make sure you spend often in this card's bonus categories to get the most value. Bottom line: The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express can be used as an everyday card, but it really shines as a bonus category card. It might best be used alongside a card like the Citi® Double Cash or Chase Freedom Unlimited.   CARD SEARCH: Compare the top rewards credit cards. 4. Top travel and airline credit card: Chase Sapphire Reserve The Chase Sapphire Reserve cards earns high ratings on CreditCards.com's best rewards card list for its travel and airline rewards. It offers generous bonus points, an annual travel credit and a top-notch rewards system. Highlights: The Chase Sapphire Reserve offers 3x Chase Ultimate Rewards® points per dollar spent on travel and dining at restaurants worldwide. It offers 1x points per dollar spent on other purchases. Chase Sapphire Reserve cardholders can receive up to $300 in statement credits annually as a reimbursement for travel purchases on things like airfare and hotels charged to the card. Points can be redeemed for 1.5 cents per point through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. This card offers access to more than 900 airport lounges worldwide with complimentary Priority Pass Select membership. Cardholders can get up to a $100 application fee credit for Global Entry or TSA Pre√®. As another perk, there are no blackout dates or travel restrictions with this card. If there's a seat on the flight, it can be booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards. Cardholders can transfer points to one of Chase's partner airline or hotel loyalty programs at a 1:1 rate. Fees: The Chase Sapphire Reserve card has an annual fee of $450, similar to other cards in its class like the Citi Prestige® Card. This card comes with a variable APR between 16.49% and 23.49%. Who should get this card: The Chase Sapphire Reserve card is best for the avid traveler who spends big on travel and dining and is fine with redeeming rewards through Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. Disadvantages: The Chase Sapphire Reserve offers big rewards to the frequent traveler, but it's not without its downsides. The card's hefty $450 annual fee can certainly eat into rewards if you're not spending heavily on travel and dining related expenses. You'll get the most benefit from this card by redeeming through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. If it's not a program you're fond of, it might be best to find another card. The bottom line Overall, the Chase Sapphire Reserve card is a solid choice for the frequent traveler. Its points program and bonus can more than make up for the somewhat hefty $450 annual fee. But you'll need to spend big in order to enjoy the benefits of this card.   5. Top points rewards credit card: Chase Sapphire Preferred® card Generous points, a stellar sign-up bonus and a low annual fee put the Chase Sapphire Preferred® card on the map as the best points rewards card. Highlights: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® offers cardholders two points per dollar on travel and restaurants worldwide. All other purchases on this card earn one point per dollar. Cardholders can earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 within the first 3 months of opening the account. Notably, that's $625 toward travel when redeemed through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. For adding an authorized user within the first 3 months of opening an account, this card offers $5,000 bonus points. Cardholders can transfer points to one of Chase's partner airline or hotel loyalty programs at a 1:1 rate. There are no blackout dates or travel restrictions with this card. If there's a seat on the flight, it can be booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. Fees: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® credit card has no introductory fee for the first year. After that, the fee is $95 per year, or $355 less than the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. This card has a variable APR from 16.49% to 23.49%. There are no foreign transaction fees with this card. Who should get this card: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® card is ideal for someone interested in an everyday, low-fee travel card with an outstanding sign-up bonus. Frequent travelers who are comfortable using the Chase Unlimited Rewards will find this card even more useful. When redeemed through the program, points are worth 25 percent more. Disadvantages: The generous points and sign-up bonus make the Chase Sapphire Preferred® a go-to for the frequent traveler, but it has a few disadvantages. Those who don't spend enough to earn the sign-up bonus or pay for the annual fee won't benefit much from this card. Travel options are somewhat limited with this card. You'll need to fly on one of Chase's travel partners – like United, Virgin Atlantic or Southwest – to get the most out of it. The bottom line: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® credit card is a great choice if you spend big on travel and dining at restaurants. It's also a good option if you typically use Chase's travel partners. But if you're not a big spender and need more flexible traveling options, it's wise to choose a different card.

By John Manganaro editors@assetinternational.com | January 26, 2017 Page 1 of 3 View Full Article Fiduciaries of the internal JPMorgan Chase 401(k) plan are facing a proposed class-action suit, brought by an employee who argues the retirement plan’s fees were not properly controlled and that conflicts of interest damaged net-of-fee performance. The suit, filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, names as defendants JPMorgan Chase Bank, as well as the company’s board, various benefit committee members, human resources executives and others. The complaint echoes allegations that are by now very familiar to retirement plan industry professionals: “Plan’s fiduciaries breached their duties of loyalty and prudence to the plan and its participants by failing to utilize an established systematic review of the investment options in its portfolio to evaluate them for both performance and cost, regardless of affiliation to JPMorgan Chase … This failure to adequately review the investment portfolio of the plan led thousands of plan participants to pay higher than necessary fees for both proprietary investment options and certain other options for years.” In no uncertain terms the lawsuit alleges “blatant self-dealing” that occurred when fiduciaries “allowed higher than necessary fees to continue to be paid on their own proprietary options.” Again like a long list of other proposed class action suits filed in recent months and years, participants say the large size of the plan, valued between $14.64 billion and $20.94 billion during the class period, should have been enough to allow plan fiduciaries to negotiate fees down to levels near the lowest available in the market—regardless of whether a proprietary or outside provider was utilized. The specific charges include a failure to adequately review the investment portfolio of the plan to ensure that each investment option was prudent, both in cost and performance and without regard to the option’s affiliation with JPMorgan Chase. Plaintiffs also want an accounting of why the plan continued to retain proprietary mutual funds, from the bank and its affiliated companies, within the plan “despite the availability of nearly identical lower cost and better performing investment options.” Finally, participants accuse plan fiduciaries of “failing to affect a reduction in fees on 20 different investment options at an earlier date, most of them proprietary funds; and failing to offer commingled accounts, separate accounts, or collective trusts in lieu of the proprietary mutual funds in the plan, despite their far lower fees.” NEXT: Details from the complaint  Prev 1 2 3 Next View Full Article Tagged: Litigation, related articles related research most e-mailed Saxon Angle Why Fee Policy Statements?

The bank's funding will support the Utah Export Acceleration Grant, which will be managed by World Trade Center Utah to help companies in the state to grow their business internationally. Grant money may be used for legal and consulting work, doing international market research, translation services and attending trade missions. "We support initiatives that provide opportunities for businesses striving to take their products and services to international markets," said Craig Zollinger, JPMorgan Chase's managing director in Salt Lake City. "This type of grant can transform small businesses." VIDEOS TOP JOBS Derek Miller, president and CEO of World Trade Center Utah, agrees. "Often, the only thing preventing small to medium-sized businesses from competing in the global marketplace is adequate resources and opportunity," he said. "The grant program will provide the financial means for companies to take that leap and show the world the great products and services Utah has to offer." Miller maintained JPMorgan is supporting Utah because its businesses already have done well making inroads into foreign markets and the state has a "strong, emerging economy." Salt Lake County's economic-development strategy clearly promotes exports. The County Council has adopted a regional export plan and Mayor Ben McAdams has led the county's involvement in the Global Cities Initiative, whose goal of increasing exports from metropolitan Salt Lake is likely to benefit from these acceleration grants. "Salt Lake County is primed for a new era of economic development, which includes focusing on global opportunities," McAdams said. "This generous grant will help kick start our regional export plan and will lead to more hiring by businesses that are serving global customers." One of Trump's first orders of business upon taking office was to issue an executive order that could lead the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. Trump's talked tough about undoing the North American Free Trade Act, too, while suggesting he'd like to form closer trade ties with the United Kingdom. Companies may apply for up to $10,000, depending on their specific needs for global expansion. Application forms are available at www.wtcutah.com. Miller noted that submissions will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, so companies may apply any time within the next year for funding. The program was launched at the Winter Innovation Summit, held Wednesday and Thursday at the Salt Palace Convention Center and co-sponsored by the county and Sorenson Impact Center. mikeg@sltrib.com   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES The battle over MormonLeaks -- two websites with one name and one goal: target the LDS Church ROTC may move from BYU to UVU after colonel bristles at Honor Code SLC shirks Trump, refuses to enforce his immigration edict Garrison Keillor: Help us, GOP, you're our only hope Dana Milbank: Don't get distracted by Trump's 'dead cats' ELEVATE H&R Block Announces Two New Offers: Refund Advance of Up to $1,250 and Free Federal 1040EZ   Professional-in-Residence Jim Mortensen Prepares Students to Become Top Advisors   3 Unforgettable Date Night Ideas   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah $200K grant to help small Utah businesses expand globally By Jasen LeeDeseret News@JasenLee1 Published: Jan. 25, 2017 5:10 p.m. Updated: Jan. 25, 2017 5:20 p.m. + Leave a comment SALT LAKE CITY — Utah small businesses are getting a boost to promote international trade. JPMorgan Chase & Co., World Trade Center Utah and Salt Lake County announced Wednesday the launch of the Utah Export Acceleration Grant at the Winter Innovation Summit — a meeting of policymakers and other leaders focused on enhancing social impact around the world. The grant will help local companies with funding to offset the costs associated with global expansion, said Derek Miller, president and chief executive officer of World Trade Center Utah. The agency will be tasked with managing the $200,000 contribution from JPMorgan Chase & Co., making grant awards of up to $10,000, he said. “(The funds) are for us to make small grant awards to small- and medium-sized businesses in order for them to increase their capacity to do international business,” Miller said. “We think it’s a great way for Utah to continue its successes in international business.” Global trade is an important segment of the state economy, he noted. In 2015, Utah shipped $13.3 billion in goods internationally — up 9 percent from the prior year, Miller said. The grant awards will provide access to resources companies need to begin exporting for the first time or spread into new international markets, he added. “We support initiatives that provide opportunities for businesses striving to take their products and services to international markets,” said Craig Zollinger, managing director for JPMorgan Chase in Salt Lake City. “It’s this type of grant that can transform small businesses, and we view this as a critical step in providing a successful framework as it relates to export acceleration.” Recently, World Trade Center Utah and Salt Lake County partnered with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and the Brookings Institution, based in Washington, D.C., on the Global Cities Initiative — a five-year plan to help U.S. metro areas reposition their local economies for enhanced engagement in global markets. The result of the collaboration was a strategy to increase exports in the Salt Lake Valley, and this new initiative will continue that effort, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams said. “Salt Lake County is primed for a new era of economic development, which includes focusing on global opportunities,” he said. “This generous grant will help kick-start our regional export plan and will lead to more hiring by businesses that are serving global customers.” Funds from the grant must be used to pay for services or resources that help the recipient’s company grow internationally, such as legal and consulting work, funding for international market research, costs of translation services or trade mission funding, Miller explained. Applications are available online at the World Trade Center Utah website, with submissions reviewed on an ongoing basis, he said. “Companies in Utah are well-positioned for international expansion, and this grant will provide the means for them to get the help they need,” Miller said. Meanwhile, the new grant comes during the same week President Donald Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a global trade agreement between 12 countries. Miller said Utah is among a few states that stand to lose economically from the executive action. “We’re one of only eight states to see an increase in exports (in 2016),” he said. “It would be bad for Utah and the United State to take a protectionist position against the world.” Comment on this story He said Utah could show other states a prime example of how to be successful and competitive in the global marketplace. Among the primary strategies would be to retrain workers who “have been left behind” by the tech economy. “If there are people who were trained in a certain trade and that trade — for whatever reason — can’t land them a job because those jobs are gone, then they have opportunities to be retrained,” Miller said. “They can be trained in areas where we see job growth, such as advanced manufacturing, life sciences or information technology.” He said the best way to mitigate the current national trade situation is to learn to better manage the challenging issues, rather than move to an isolationist strategy. “The answer is to retrain, not to retreat,” Miller said. + Leave a comment Like that?

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon By Dan Freed Citigroup Inc (C.N) has quietly launched a website to make small business loans of up to $1 million, the latest effort by a big bank to make the process of smaller loans more technology-friendly. Citigroup's online toe in the water comes after similar moves by several other banks. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) announced a partnership with online lender On Deck Capital Inc (ONDK.N) in December 2015 and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) launched a fast-decision online small business loan product some eight months ago. Banks have been cautious about entering the online lending space despite the proliferation of online non-bank lenders such as On Deck, LendingClub Corp (LC.N) Prosper Marketplace and other startups. Early optimism about prospects for such companies soured after LendingClub's CEO resigned over a loan-selling scandal. Citigroup's website is run by Biz2Credit, a New York-based startup. Borrowers visiting the Citigroup website are directed to a separate website run by Biz2Credit where they fill out an online worksheet before following up with a Citigroup small business banker. Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora said being online makes it easier for Citigroup to fulfill its obligations to small and underserved borrowers under the Community Reinvestment Act because it allows access for customers who live far from a branch. Citigroup and Biz2Credit chose not to publicize the effort because it is still in very early stages, Arora said. "If you make a premature announcement the expectations go very high and then you're in the public eye all the time," he said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment. Separately, a small business lending website backed by Citigroup and the U.S. Treasury Department and run by Biz2Credit will shut down. Launched in May 2015, DCSmallBizLoans.com was intended to bring online lending technology to small businesses in underserved Washington D.C. communities. The website matched up small businesses with four Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), government-backed lenders that serve low-income communities. Citigroup had agreed to fund the website for two years, after which it was expected to become self-sustaining, said Steve Glaude, president and chief executive officer of the Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development, a non-profit that organized the effort. Though it would only have cost each CDFI about $1,000 per month to keep the site operating, there was not enough interest to warrant even so small an investment, according to Glaude. "In some ways I think we were ahead of our time," he said.

Dimon was seen leaving the West Wing by reporters Friday afternoon. He told the press that he had been meeting with Gary Cohn, who had just become head of President Trump’s National Economic Council after leaving Goldman Sachs, where he had been the firm’s president. Dimon did not detail the topic of their conversation, but the two men have a history together at the top of Wall Street’s food chain. And both men are also expanding their Washington footprint in a significant way following Trump’s election. ADVERTISEMENT Dimon’s named had previously been floated as a possible Treasury secretary for Trump. However, that never moved past the speculation phase, as both sides eventually professed no interest in the arrangement. In December, Dimon was also named the head of the Business Roundtable, a Washington association that represents some of the biggest businesses in the country. For his part, Dimon has typically identified himself as a Democrat but has also been a fierce critic of the party on economic policy, particularly when it comes to regulations on the financial sector.   View the discussion thread.

According to market research firm Euromonitor International, Vita Coco holds a 26 percent share of the $2.5 billion global coconut water market. Sold in 30 countries, Vita Coco saw a 19 percent increase in sales last year. In response to an emailed inquiry from BevNET, Arthur Gallego, Vita Coco’s director of corporate communications, stated “the Reuters article is speculative, and Vita Coco has no further comment past that,” Both Vita Coco and JP Morgan declined Reuters’ request for comment on the possible sale. In 2007, private investment company Verlinvest acquired a stake in Vita Coco and in 2014, Vita Coco sold a 25 percent stake to the owner of Red Bull China. Verlinvest also has stakes in Le Blon cachaca and Oatly. It was an early Glaceau investor, which sold to Coca-Cola in 2007 for $4.1 billion. The news comes nearly five months after Reuters first reported on a possible sale of enhanced water brand Bai. Approximately five months after the report, Dr Pepper Snapple Group announced that it would acquire Bai for $1.7 billion. Bai’s early investors included Ken Sadowsky and Rohan Oza, both of whom hold stakes in Vita Coco.

JPMorgan Chase & Co., the world’s biggest investment bank by revenue, boosted its 2016 bonus pool for traders dealing in government bonds, swaps and other assets tied to interest rates by about 20 percent, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing compensation. At Morgan Stanley, the bonus pool for rates traders climbed more than 10 percent, and at Bank of America Corp. the average bonus for those employees increased more than 10 percent, other people said.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Bond traders got their first pay bump since 2012 after political events set off a frenzy of transactions last year, even as pressure to keep compensation in check still rules at investment banks, especially at struggling European firms. Rates trading in particular fueled the 15 percent increase in fixed-income revenue at the five biggest Wall Street banks. The boost came late in the year, when the U.S. election roiled expectations for interest rates and economic growth. Rates traders outperformed most of their peers in fixed income. For instance, at JPMorgan the bonus pool for credit traders rose by 10 percent, the people said. Employees were told of their compensation this month and receive the awards in February. Not all banks took part in the rates-trading party. UBS Group AG incurred losses in its macro business, which typically includes rates and currencies trading, after being caught wrong-foot following President Donald Trump’s surprise victory in November. The broader rebound in fixed-income revenue may continue in 2017. Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said this month that momentum from a strong fourth quarter is continuing at the start of the year as clients reposition portfolios and put cash to work.

JPMorgan Chase reached an accord Wednesday to settle its longstanding dispute with Intuit, which owns Mint, in a blueprint that could allow other big banks to end their disagreements with financial data companies. The deal had no financial component. Chase and Intuit have agreed to develop software that will let Chase customers directly send their data to Mint for budgeting and financial tracking purposes, without Intuit having to hold onto that person's name and password through third-party software, which is how it had often been structured. Intuit also agreed to never to sell Chase customer data. Mint and other popular personal finance websites pull customers' financial data from all their various banks, brokerages and credit card companies to create a fuller picture of a person's financial life. That allows customers to more actively budget, or even create short-term and long-term financial goals. While convenient, the way these services worked had several flaws. The companies would store, either directly or through a third party, the bank customers' login information - which could expose crucial personal information to identity thieves or other criminals. The data also would be gathered by actively logging into a bank's online service, which put a strain on the bank's servers. The data the companies would gather would happen whether or not the customer was actively using the service, so a Mint account someone hadn't touched in months could still be actively gathering data on that Chase customer. JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon had been a particularly vocal critic of these services. In his annual shareholder letter, Dimon said he was "extremely concerned" about how much data they were gathering. "When we all readily click 'I agree' online or on our mobile devices ... it is fairly clear that most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to or how that information might be used by a third party," Dimon said. The Chase-Intuit agreement could set a standard for other banks to reach accords with Mint and other personal finance sites. Companies like Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo had expressed similar reservations about these services and concern that their customers' data might be at risk. An Intuit spokesman also said this announcement could act as a framework for other deals. A Chase spokeswoman said it plans to roll out the upgrade in the coming months. The upgrade will go first to existing Chase customers who are signing up for Mint for the first time, followed by existing Mint customers. _____ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 5:04pm on 27 Jan 2017 That's all for this week - thanks for reading this blog and posting your comments. We'll be back Monday from around 9am. Have a good weekend. 4:42pm on 27 Jan 2017 Shares have ended the first week of the Trump administration higher, as investors looked past the new President's protectionist rhetoric to focus on pro-growth initiatives such as tax and regulation cuts as well as the approval of a controversial pipeline project. The business-friendly moves lit a fire under stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Dow Jones index above 20,000 points. The local ASX 200 was buoyed by the rally and ended 0.75 per cent higher for the day at 5714, up 1.05 per cent for the week. While the materials sector was the big winner of the week, rising 2.6 per cent as commodity prices continued to advance, on Friday mining stocks took a breather. BHP was the biggest drag on the index, falling 1.3 per cent, but gold miners were the real losers of the week as the precious metal retreated back below the $US1200 mark. Newcrest slid 2.7 per cent, Evolution Mining fell 2.7 per cent and Northern Star Resources dropped 5.1 per cent. It was the other way around for financials, which had an average week, nudging up just 0.1 per cent, but a strong Friday session, led by the big banks. Westpac gained 1.8 per cent, CBA was up 0.9 per cnt, NAB added 1.4 per cent and ANZ rose 1 per cent. Fairmont Equities managing director Michael Gable said some traders had feared the markets would end their bull run after Donald Trump's inauguration. "The fact that they've done the opposite and made new high s has given our market a short-term boost," he said.  "But I think that will start to evaporate over the next week as we start to concentrate on our local reporting season. As we saw with the Brambles profit warning a few days ago we need to be a little cautious holding stocks at elevated levels coming into reporting season. "The last couple of weeks on the market have mostly been built on all these external factors - Trump and the US market - but we will need to start focusing more domestically. Reporting season is often a minefield of disappointments and misses, and we're starting to see that already."  The week's biggest winners and losers.  4:02pm on 27 Jan 2017 Farewell the Monkey, hail the Rooster. Lunar New Year is tomorrow and that should bring us a good year for markets, at least if past performance is any indicator. Rooster years have historically been good for stocks, but volatile, says CMC which has crunched the numbers. "The long-term average returns for Rooster years have generally been very positive with stock markets around the world gaining well in excess of 10 per cent in Rooster years, way above their 8 per cent long-term average return," chief market strategist Colin Cieszynski says. That being said, a more in-depth analysis shows that Rooster years can really go either way, he adds. The local sharemarket had its best Rooster year in 1994, when it soared more than 50 per cent, while in 1982 it slumped 16.5 per cent. Overall, it adds up to a tidy 13.7 per cent average return, according to CMC. 3:53pm on 27 Jan 2017 High-flying Domino's Pizza Enterprises insists a recent fall in its share price is not connected to the introduction of a 10 per cent surcharge on orders placed on Sunday. Domino's is one of the ASX's most expensive stocks but it has dipped on concerns the surcharge, introduced on January 8, will slow demand among its price-sensitive customers. Domino's introduced the surcharge in early January to help pay for a 25 per cent loading for drivers and store staff working on Sundays. These workers had missed out on penalty rates thanks to an old deal with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA). The deal, struck in 2009 and but expiring in 2013, left staff with overall pay rates well below the current legal minimum. Domino's is now negotiating a new deal with the SDA, and is still waiting on a separate ruling from the industrial watchdog on weekend penalty rates. Domino's increased pay for workers in August, meaning adult drivers were paid $21.18 an hour plus $2.27 per delivery (with average deliveries of between three and five an hour), and an adult instore is paid $24.53 an hour. Domino's did not answer whether it would increase pay again this month, as flagged by its chief executive in September. The sharemarket darling attracted scrutiny in July when investment bank Deutsche Bank suggested Domino's workers were missing out on penalty rates worth at least $32 million.  "We believe penalty rates will need to be paid at some point, which could have a significant impact on [Domino's] profitability," retail analyst Michael Simotas said, tipping pay rises would slash the Domino's profit by nearly 25 per cent. "It pays a lower base than competitors and doesn't pay the weekend penalty rates stipulated in the award." Domino's told the market on Friday that it had seen "no evidence to support comments from unnamed analysts in the press in relation to a link between share price and the recent introduction of a Sunday surcharge." Shares are up 0.7 per cent at $61.04 today, but have dropped nearly 6 per cent over the week. Here's more Not whetting investor appetite this week. Photo: Glenn Hunt 3:27pm on 27 Jan 2017 Paladin Energy has surged nearly 40 per cent to 13.5 cents in heavy trading but the uranium miner says it's as baffled as anyone about the jump. The company said there is no pending announcement and it's not aware if any of its earlier announcements may have caused the trading uptick. It added that uranium market conditions continue to improve. The uranium spot price hovered around $US24 per pound, up about 7 per cent from last week's levels and 39 per cent higher than its recent low in mid-December.Back to top 3:01pm on 27 Jan 2017 Gold is stuck near two-week lows hit in the previous session as the US dollar regains ground, with selling ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays adding pressure and leaving the metal on track to record its first weekly loss since late December. Spot gold prices are down 0.4 per cent at $US1184 per ounce, their lowest since January 11. "A combination of things including a strong US dollar, thin volumes ahead of the Chinese New Year and weak longs is putting pressure on the market," said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. "Most of Asia is already off for the holidays, which is a good time for many to short the metal ... You can see the bids are very weak, which shows the demand right now," he said. The week-long holiday that many in Asia take for the Lunar New Year is likely to keep the markets quiet, traders said. The US dollar edged up on Friday, rebounding from a seven-week low on optimism over the US economic outlook and corporate earnings, although US President Donald Trump's protectionist policies raised uncertainties for global trade. "The government will publish its first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP on Friday, expected to come in around 2.2 per cent," said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir. "We suspect the number will likely be stronger, leading to a stronger dollar and exerting more pressure on gold before Trump possibly comes to the rescue with another market surprise." The slide in gold prices has put the stocks of local gold miners under pressure, with the All Ordinaries gold index down 4.4 per cent, its biggest slide in more than a month. Gold miners are under pressure today. Photo: Ryan Stuart 2:09pm on 27 Jan 2017 Here's a recap of today's session: banks are leading gains on the stock market, while miners have been dragged down by lower base metal and gold prices. With the market closed for Australia Day yesterday, investors are playing catch-up after the Dow Jones topped 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, putting the ASX on track to rise 1 per cent for the week. "We are catching up with that respectable rally of Wall Street," said Paterson Securities economist Tony Farnham. The big four banks have given back some of their early strong gains but are still up by around 1 per cent, with NAB and Westpac leading the charge, up 1.6  and 1.7 per cent respectively. Local banks have rallied since Donald Trump's election victory, with investors betting fiscal stimulus and deregulation will trigger inflation and stoke a rise in interest rates. "Combination of local investors less nervous about the outlook for banks... and offshore interests from a currency perspective who have to find some way to invest those funds is pushing up local financials," Farnham said. Gold stocks lost as much as 6.0 per cent to hit their lowest since January 5, as a strengthening US dollar and improving appetite for risk assets dragged it to a two-week low. Newcrest Mining, Northern Star Resources and Evolution Mining are among the worst performers. Miners are also suffering from declines in most base metal prices, especially copper. BHP Billiton has shed 1.3 per cent, but Rio is up 1 per cent. "People are worried about what is happening with global trade, particularly with Mexico, and what could potentially happen to China," said Mathan Somasundaram, market portfolio strategist at Blue Ocean Equities. The White House on Thursday floated the idea of a border tax on goods from Mexico to pay for a wall on the US border, deepening tensions between the neighbours. 1:51pm on 27 Jan 2017 Today's export/import price data means Australia's terms of trade spiked 12.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, the largest quarterly rise since 2010 - but that's about as good as it will get, says JPMorgan. The pop higher in export prices (+12.4 per cent) was broadly expected and came on the back of the striking rally in iron ore and coal prices from mid-2016, economist Tom Kennedy said. "The surprise relative to our forecast was on the import side (+0.2%), where the strength in petroleum import prices was largely offset by broad-based weakness in the remaining sub-components." Kennedy expects Australia's terms of trade to move lower in coming quarters as prices for key export commodities normalise. Hard coking coal spot prices are already more than 40 per cent below last quarter's peak and will be a drag on aggregate price growth in the first quarter of 2017. JPMorgan commodity analysts expect iron ore spot prices to decline in coming months as more supply comes on line. On the other side of the ledger, Brent crude prices so far in January are tracking above the 4Q average, and will likely buoy import prices in 1Q. "Given these dynamics, our base case is for Australia's ToT to move lower from early 2017," Kennedy says. But before then it's worth adding that the terms of trade - through the commodities bonanza - is delivering the biggest boost to national income in 6-1/2 years. "If export prices are outpacing the price of imports, this indicates a broad-based lift to incomes in Australia. The lift in export prices – especially iron ore and coal – also serve to benefit the bottom line of the government accounts," says CommSec . 1:43pm on 27 Jan 2017 Get ready for an inflation surge, the AFR's Chris Joye writes: It is curious to think that we do not know with certainty the current state of economic affairs, let alone that which might materialise 12 or 24 months hence. The RBA was slashing rates last year because it was worried that Australia's weak inflation pulse would pull down consumer expectations for future price growth that could make achieving its official 2 per cent to 3 per cent inflation target hard. And yet the latest ANZ/Roy Morgan survey reports that consumer inflation expectations hit a five-year peak of 4.8 per cent in January, miles above the top of the RBA's target band. The Melbourne Institute's measure likewise jumped to 4.3 per cent in January, its loftiest level since 2012. Commsec's Savanth Sebastian says that "inflation expectations have now held above 4 per cent for the past six months", opining that "there is no doubt that inflationary pressures have bottomed out and are starting to lift". HSBC's Paul Bloxham and Goldman Sachs' Tim Toohey agree. Both argued that the December quarter inflation data published this week implied that price pressures had "troughed" with domestically produced, or "non-tradeables", inflation accelerating from 1.6 per cent over the year to June to 2.1 per cent in December. "The platform is now set for inflation to surprise RBA forecasts to the upside through 2017," Toohey surmised. Here's more 1:05pm on 27 Jan 2017 Some of hedge fund billionaire George Soros's short positions dating back to 2012 were published on the Dutch financial market regulator's website this week due to "human error", according to the regulator AFM. The short positions, bets on a stock declining, were "between 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent," of shares outstanding in the companies shorted, AFM spokesman Ward Snijders said. The Dutch regulator publishes shorts of 0.5 per cent or higher on its website on a daily basis. The smaller amounts were posted by mistake, he said. The Financial Times earlier reported that some of the positions, including bets against Dutch banks, including ING Groep, appeared briefly on the website on Tuesday evening. ING declined to comment on Thursday. Soros, whose fortune is estimated at $US25.2 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is in the same league as Warren Buffett when it comes to investors copying their trades as they try to ride the coattails of the super successful. Short positions, which are typically closely guarded, in Deutsche Bank jumped when it was revealed in June that Soros had bet that the stock would fall after the UK voted to leave the European Union. The German bank fell 14 per cent on the first day after the ballot. The 86-year-old investor lost about $US1 billion by betting against the market after the election of US President Donald Trump, according to the Wall Street Journal this month. The hiring of a chief investment officer may reduce Soros's role, the paper reported. Luckily, Soros exited many of his bearish bets late last year, avoiding further losses. Photo: Simon Dawson Back to top 12:21pm on 27 Jan 2017 Google parent Alphabet has posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates, hurt by a higher tax rate, but analysts cheered the company's progress in diversifying its business beyond advertising. While advertising still accounts for the lion's share of Google's revenue, rising 17.4 per cent to $US22.4 billion in the quarter, Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business - pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company's other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 per cent to $3.4 billion. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 per cent to $US838 in extended trade after closing at $US856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 per cent, compared to 19 per cent for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability. "If you look above that, it's business as usual," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "There has been no margin compression in the actual business." Eventually, investors' worst fears about Google may come true. Just not yet, says Bloomberg's Shira Ovide: "Essentially the world's second-most valuable company is a one-trick pony - although it is perhaps the best pony ever created. And if the pony ever goes lame, so does Google. "The horror story about Google's end days plays out something like this: As more people surf smartphones and not computers, they won't need to search on Google for a new winter coat, a hotel room in Hawaii or the winner of the 1984 Super Bowl. They'll simply go directly to Amazon, Expedia or ask Siri for the answer. If the zeal to Google things slowly ebbs, that will allow Facebook and others to chip away at Google's commanding share of the $US200 billion global market for online advertisements. "Despite the earnings miss, it's tough to find evidence that the pony is anywhere close to be putting out to pasture." Google remains a one-trick pony, but one that's unlikely to be put out to pasture anytime soon. Photo: PAUL SAKUMA 11:48am on 27 Jan 2017 Former Billabong CEO Matthew Perrin has been sentenced to eight years' imprisonment after he was found guilty of faking his ex-wife's signature to get a $13.5 million loan. The 43-year-old was convicted of three counts of fraud and six of forgery after a week-long trial in Brisbane District Court in December last year. The jury had been unable to decide on three further forgery charges. Crown prosecutor Glenn Cash told the court approximately $4 million had been recovered to the Commonwealth Bank after it was defrauded of the $13.5 million.  Perrin was sentenced to eight years for three counts of fraud, six years for four counts of forgery and seven years for two further counts of forgery. Ex-Billabong chief Matthew Perrin was found guilty of forging his wife's signature on mortgage documents.  Photo: Glenn Hunt 11:41am on 27 Jan 2017 Some second-tier eco data out today:  Producer prices rose 0.5 per cent over the fourth quarter, picking up from a 0.3 per cent growth rate in the previous three months, and 0.7 per cent over the year, from 0.5 per cent. Similarly to consumer prices, which were published on Wednesday, it looks like PPI has bottomed, but there's also no price surge in sight. Export prices soared 12.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, their biggest jump in six years, profiting strongly from big rises in key commodities iron ore and coal. The jump will provide a massive boost to Australia's terms of trade as import prices edged up just 0.2 per cent. In the previous quarter export prices had gained 3.5 per cent, while import prices slipped 1 per cent. The Aussie dollar shrugged off the data and remains stuck at around US75.35¢. 11:18am on 27 Jan 2017 It's not only Australia where inflation remains weak. Consumer prices in Japan dropped for a 10th straight month, though the pace of decline eased, supporting expectations for a return to inflation later this year. A weaker yen and pickup in oil prices are likely to drive up inflation this year, though questions remain on whether the expected gains in CPI will be sustainable, given poor growth in wages and lackluster consumer spending. The central bank isn't expected to change policy when board members meet January 30-31, but there is some prospect it could upgrade its forecasts for economic growth, or even inflation. Even if consumer prices reach 1 per cent this year, BoJ, officials would rather be late than early when it comes to raising their 10-year bond yield target from zero per cent, according to people familiar with the central bank's discussions. "It's fair to say that Japan's inflation has bottomed out, thanks to a weak yen and oil prices," Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said. "But we're not where the BoJ can has its inflation target in sight, so the best it can do now is to keep policy unchanged to stimulate the economy." "Hitting the bottom is just a baby step compared with what the BOJ is trying to deliver," Yasuhide Yajima, chief economist at NLI Research Institute, said. "Achieving 2 per cent inflation remains unrealistic." 10:47am on 27 Jan 2017 In a bid to fill the empty air time that is the trading world in January, news outlets have trumpeted the closure of the Dow Jones at 20,000 points for the second day in a row. But very few fund managers or investors care much for the milestone, pointing out the Dow Jones is a collection of unsystematic companies, indexed by share price rather than market capitalisation and is far more random than the S&P 500, which is a 500-stock index based on share market value rather than share price. "Look, it does not matter what Dow Jones does at all," says Randal Jenneke, head of Australian equities at T. Rowe Price. "It's an ancient relic." 42 days to go from 19k to #Dow20k. Here is where that ranks all-time. https://t.co/dORcs3WkFT pic.twitter.com/Xqe3S6R16D— Ryan Detrick, CMT (@RyanDetrick) January 26, 2017 Established in 1896, before computers existed, the Dow Jones is not designed to calculate total returns, meaning it's impossible to compare the price gains or losses plus reinvested dividends with any of the other indices.  Instead, the Dow Jones industrial average is a 30-stock average based on stock prices and includes heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Walt Disney and McDonald's.  Goldman Sachs has largely been the driving force behind the Dow's crusade to 20,000 points, contributing 36.6 per cent to the Dow's post-election rally of 1600 points.  And while there are other American stocks that have performed much better than Goldman Sachs, because the stock itself is the most expensive in the Dow Jones pool it has the most influence on the price-weighted index. At around $US240 a share, Goldman Sachs is worth nearly eight times more than "cheap" Dow stocks like General Electric.  "The index itself is a product of history and its construction is highly unusual." says Tom King, portfolio manager at Nanuk Asset Manager. "As such the technical 20,000 level is kind of meaningless." But the risk-on sentiment that has swept through financial markets and sent them soaring higher is likely to continue giving Australian stocks a boost, say fund managers, pointing to Australia's proliferation of resource, financial and global cyclical stocks as beneficiaries. Back to top 10:33am on 27 Jan 2017 Shares have bounced in early trade as the local sharemarket plays catch-up following the Australia Day holiday, with gains in banks offsetting losses in miners. The ASX is nudging 5700 points, up 0.5 per cent, despite  a 1.3 per cent slide in the materials sub-index. The big four banks are all up more than 1 per cent, with NAB's 2 per cent gain leading the charge. Woolies and Wesfarmers are also in demand, rising 2.1 per cnt at 1.3 per cent respectively. On the other side, BHP has dropped 1.6 per cent, Rio is down 0.5 per cent and South32 has fallen 0.7 per cent. But the real carnage is among gold miners, which are all deep in the red after the precious metal's price slid back below $US1200 an ounce. Newcrest has plunged 5 per cent, Northern Star Resources is down 9.1 per cent and Evolution Mining has shed 6.6 per cent.   9:55am on 27 Jan 2017 SPONSORED POST The markets seem to have decided that 'Trumponomics' is back on and after a period of reflection, we can see that the reflation trade is back on, says IG's Chris Weston: There has been some hesitation to push markets higher in the overnight US session, though, with most of the moves taking place on Wednesday night. The US 10-year treasury is back at 2.50%, moving up from 2.30% on 12 January and eyeing a move into 2.63%. The S&P 500 has broken out of the recent consolidation pattern and even poked its head above 2300, and on the weekly chart is looking ominously poised to print a bullish outside week reversal (where price traded below last week's low and closes above last week's high). US banks are finding buyers, amid the move higher in bond yields (and the translation effect of higher net interest margins). Of course, the Dow breaking 20,000 has been widely noted and the deafening sounds of households staging a Dow 20k party were heard amid yesterday's Australia Day celebrations. Hardly…it is merely a round number, and market participants exposed to US equities are going to celebrate anything it would be the S&P 500 at all-time highs and the fact is the bulls are in control here. As mentioned before a market trading at all-time highs is undeniably bullish and must be traded as such. US earnings have been generally supportive and a nice tailwind to the optimism that perhaps Trump can generate higher nominal growth. Some 30% of S&amp;P 500 corporate having released numbers and we can see 75% have beaten on the earnings line and 52% on sales. The leads for Asian markets are clearly positive, with SPI futures 0.7% higher than the ASX 200 close on Wednesday. Our call then for the ASX 200 sits at 5700 (+29 points). One should expect support for the banks, but the open for mining stocks will be interesting with BHP down for the past two sessions in London and the ADR suggesting an open 2.4% weaker. Here's more 9:50am on 27 Jan 2017 Here's the overview how global markets performed overnight: SPI futures down 2 points to 5649 (but up 0.7% from Wednesday) AUD -0.5% to 75.32 US cents On Wall St, Dow +0.2%, S&P 500 -0.1%, Nasdaq flat In New York, BHP -1.3%, Rio -2.4% In Europe, Stoxx 50 -0.2%, FTSE flat, CAC -0.2%, DAX +0.4% Spot gold -0.8% to $US1191 an ounce Brent crude +1.9% to $US56.15 a barrel Iron ore +1% to $US83.34 a tonne Steam coal -0.1% to $US83.60, Met coal +0.0% to $US185.00 LME aluminium -0.7% to $US1820 a tonne LME copper -1.4% to $US5858 10-year bond yield: US 2.50%; Germany 0.48%; Australia 2.73% 9:47am on 27 Jan 2017 President Donald Trump has endorsed a plan by Republican lawmakers to make Mexico pay for his border wall by imposing a 20 per cent tax on all imports into the United States from Mexico, raising billions of dollars that would cover the cost of the new barrier. The proposal, which Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the President discussed privately with congressional Republicans before giving remarks at a party retreat in Philadelphia, would be a major new economic proposal that could have far-reaching implications for consumers, manufacturers and relations between the two governments. President Trump had previously criticised the proposal as too complicated. "When you look at the plan that's taking shape now, using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico, if you tax that $US50 billion at 20 per cent of imports," Spicer said, "by doing that we can do $US10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. " Spicer said the tax would easily pay for a border wall that is estimated to cost between $US8 billion and $US20 billion. The value of imported goods from Mexico in 2015 was $US296 billion. Spicer said taxing imports is something that 160 other countries already do. The new tax would be imposed on Mexico as part of a tax overhaul that Trump intends to pursue with the Republican Congress. Mr Spicer said the tax initially would apply only to Mexico, but that the President supports imposing a 20 per cent tax on all imports. Later, Spicer summoned reporters to his office and said the tax was only one idea to finance the wall, and that its economic impact would have to be examined. Trump would need new legislation to enact such a comprehensive tax on Mexican imports. The cross-border sparring prompted a drop in the Mexican peso, which fell 0.7 per cent to trade at 21.2149 per US dollar following Pena Nieto's announcement. Mexico's currency has plunged almost 14 per cent since Trump's election on concern that Trump will renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement. After Pena Nieto said in an address Wednesday that his country would refuse to pay for a barrier on the US southern border, Trump blasted him with a tweet Thursday morning. "If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting," Trump wrote. Pena Nieto, who was to meet with Trump January 31, responded a few hours later with his own tweet: "This morning we've informed the White House that I won't attend the working meeting scheduled for next Tuesday with @Potus." Esta mañana hemos informado a la Casa Blanca que no asistiré a la reunión de trabajo programada para el próximo martes con el @POTUS.— Enrique Peña Nieto (@EPN) January 26, 2017 Mexico doesn't pay for the wall," said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "American consumers who shop at places that import, like Walmart and Target, pay for the wall, making it a regressive tax supporting a dumb, wasteful idea." 9:28am on 27 Jan 2017 US stocks were little changed overnight as investors paused following a two-day rally that pushed the Dow Jones above the 20,000 mark, while the latest wave of earnings rolled in. The post-election rally reignited this week following a solid start to earnings season and optimism over US President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives, giving the benchmark S&P 500 its best two-day performance in seven weeks and catapulting the Dow above 20,000 for the first time. Trump's business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged higher at the open to hit record levels but finished the day little changed. Qualcomm weighed on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq as the chipmaker fell 5.0 per cent to $US54.05 after posting a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. Early fourth-quarter US corporate earnings have boosted sentiment and are expected to show growth of 7 per cent, their biggest increase in two years. "If all the economic data is good, if the earnings are good and the market doesn't really seem to think anything (Trump) says or does is negative, I don't see any downside," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 32.4 points, or 0.16 per cent, to end at 20,100.91, the S&P 500 lost 1.69 points, or 0.07 percent, to close at 2,296.68 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to finish at 5,655.18. European shares climbed to a one-year high supported by merger and acquisition-related optimism. Johnson & Johnson's $US30-billion deal to buy Actelion lifted shares in the Swiss biotech firm. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.21 per cent at 1,451.12. The US dollar rebounded from its slide in recent weeks, but gains were tempered by persistent uncertainty surrounding Trump's leanings toward protectionist trade policy. Still, investors believed the US dollar could make up some lost ground in the next few weeks, with the Federal Reserve holding its first policy meeting this year on February 1. "Although the Fed is not expected to raise rates further at that meeting, the central bank is likely to provide a clearer outlook for rate hikes in 2017, especially in view of the projected US inflation trajectory under Trump's proposed fiscal stimulus plans," said James Chen, head of research at Forex.com. The Mexican peso weakened 0.7 per cent after the White House said Trump wants a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico to pay for a wall on their shared border, deepening a crisis after a planned summit between the countries' leaders fell through. Wall Street has been smashing all-time highs in recent weeks.  Photo: AP Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

Retail IT VAR Of The Future Smart VAR Summit White Paper Chase Manhattan Mortgage Cuts Recognition Errors from 45% to 1% Chase Manhattan Mortgage has helped millions of Americans realize the dream of home ownership. The company is one of the largest mortgage originators and servicers and is a key component of JP Morgan Chase, the nation's third-largest bank. Chase Manhattan Mortgage manages thousands of paper documents each day. Charged with the task of updating the company's document management system, Rick Duff, Chase Manhattan Mortgage's manager of software development and imaging, put together a combination of hardware and software products to meet the company's growing content management requirements. Chase now scans over 2.5 million documents per month with Kofax hardware and software. The Challenge Chase Manhattan Mortgage developed Quest, its first document management system, internally in 1992. Their toolkit included C and Visual Basic application development software, the Informix database application and Plexus' Optical/Storage Management product for storing and retrieving multimedia data objects. In 1999 the company added ImageFIRST Office, Plexus' integrated software solution providing document image processing, Computer Output to Laser Disk (COLD), workflow, and document management. The system supported the company's loan default divisions and converted customer financial documents into images, enabling customer service representatives to access account information immediately. "This system used ICR [hand printing recognition] for automated indexing, but its lack of image cleanup features led to high error rates, which required a lot of costly manual intervention. Skewed documents were the biggest issue," Duff said. "Our bar codes were also obscuring important information. It was obvious that changes had to be made because we were scanning 100,000 new mortgage documents per day and growing fast." The Solution Chase Manhattan Mortgage chose Kofax Ascent Capture software and Adrenaline scanner controller boards for their second-generation system. Ascent Capture offers fast, accurate document deskew and a wide range of other image enhancement options. Its production-oriented architecture, user interface and stability made it well suited for Chase's large and rapidly growing operation. The Adrenaline scanner controllers provided reliable high-speed scanning operation, additional image enhancement features, plus fast, accurate bar code recognition. They worked so well that Duff changed his automated indexing method from hand printing recognition to Adrenaline bar code recognition. The enhancements dropped the manual correction rate from 45 percent to less than one percent. The Kofax products also gave Chase the flexibility to meet its future needs without forfeiting its initial investment. For example, Ascent Capture enables users to index, validate and release to back-end systems not only scanned paper, but also electronic documents, Web forms and other digital data streams, such as XML. Chase recently began taking advantage of Ascent Capture 5's electronic data capture capabilities. The company now captures mainframe print streams using Ascent's Import Controller, converts them to image (Group IV TIFF) files, and then extracts index values from the images with Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Ascent Capture 5 permits Chase to run the same workflow process used on scanned paper-based documents. No additional applications or programming were required. By applying consistent indexing and validation processes to all data as well as using a single user interface for all media, Ascent Capture minimizes capture errors and streamlines the capture process. Since Chase buys and services a high volume of mortgages from other financial institutions, this integrated process means Chase can quickly and easily assign loan numbers to mortgages from any source. Ascent Capture has not only integrated the validation process for multiple data types, it has also eliminated the need to program the lookup and validation of index data acquired from external databases. "Prior to the implementation of Ascent Capture 5, it was necessary for Chase to write a custom validation module which took a considerable amount of time and added to the overall processing of loan documents," Duff said. "Since the database validation module is now embedded in Ascent Capture, it took Chase only minutes to get the system up and running and we no longer require custom programming to maintain the validation process." Chase has also begun to take advantage of Ascent Capture 5's ability to integrate simultaneously with more than one document or content management system. Kofax offers free, fully tested and supported integration modules for dozens of the leading back-end systems. Each one sends images and index data in the native formats and to the appropriate fields of the chosen data repository. The Bottom Line "The cost improvements are significant. Chase has lowered the company's software and hardware costs and reduced scanning costs from 10 cents to 6 cents per page," Duff said. "The company also reduced its staffing requirements due to the system's ease of use. Chase Manhattan Mortgage staff can now prep documents for scanning quicker and spend less time on manual indexing. In addition, system errors are now less than one percent."

The funds were “more expensive than necessary and not justified on the basis of their economic value to the plan,” according to the proposed class-action lawsuit, Beach v. JPMorgan Chase Bank et al, filed Wednesday in New York district court. During the class period, 2010-15, roughly half of the investment options in the 401(k) were proprietary funds, according to the plaintiff, Terre Beach, who also claimed the bank maintained “lucrative business arrangements” with BlackRock Institutional Trust Co. that caused a “flooding of the plan” with BlackRock funds. Additional allegations include the failure to adequately review investment options to ensure each was prudent in cost and performance; failing to offer commingled accounts, separate accounts or collective trust funds in place of mutual funds, despite their “far lower fees”; and failing to adequately monitor fiduciaries managing plan assets. JPMorgan disagrees. “We have received the complaint and are reviewing it. We disagree with the central allegations and look forward to defending the claim in court,” said Jennifer Lavoie, a spokeswoman for the firm. The lawsuit is the most recent in a string of class-action cases brought against other financial services companies for self-dealing in their 401(k) plans, largely within the past year, including Edward Jones, Morgan Stanley, Neuberger Berman, Franklin Templeton, New York Life Insurance Co. and American Century Investments. Record-keeping firms Voya Financial, Fidelity and Xerox HR Solutions have also recently been sued over alleged pay-to-play schemes involving advice firm Financial Engines. 0 Comments What do you think?

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 26, 2017 at 12:23PM With earnings season in full swing, we now have a good sense for how the nation's biggest banks performed in the final months of 2016. As The Motley Fool's Michael Douglass and contributor John Maxfield discuss on this week's episode of Industry Focus: Financials, two of the nation's biggest banks had breakout quarters, while two more reported particularly dismal results. Listen in to hear why, as well as to learn the one bank stock they think is best positioned to benefit going forward. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 23, 2017. Michael Douglass: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Monday, Jan. 23, and we're talking big bank earnings. I'm your host, Michael Douglass -- Gaby Lapera has a cold -- and I'm joined on Skype by fool.com's banking expert, John Maxfield. John, it's good to be able to talk to you again on the podcast. It's been a little while. John Maxfield: It has been way too long, Michael. What were we just talking about before the show? Was it two years ago since we did this show together? Douglass: [laughs] Something like that, it was scarily long ago. Fortunately, the podcast has improved. I'm not sure I have. But listeners, listen, send us an email at industryfocus@fool.com if you think that, with me here, we sound reasonably good. Help me out here, give me a small ego boost. Maxfield: Be kind, be kind to him! Douglass: Yeah, please be kind! [laughs] All right, let's talk about bank earnings. Before we get into specific banks, let's talk about the big overall drivers. The first one, of course, trading revenue. Maxfield: Yeah. This was one of those quarters where a ton of stuff happened in it. But, if there was one thing in particular that impacted bank stocks, it was the presidential election. The reason the presidential election impacted bank stocks -- or, one of the principal reasons -- was because it caused trading revenues at these large universal banks, which are banks that have both commercial banking operations and investment banking operations to soar by double digits on a year-over-year basis. And the reason trading revenue soared on a year-over-year basis as a result of the election was because institutional investors had to reposition their portfolios in the wake of the election because of the unexpected outcome. Anytime you have institutional investors in the market buying and selling different types of securities because banks are market makers, i.e., the ones that are facilitating those transactions, and they earn commission on those transactions, they're going to make a lot more money. That's one of the principal reasons it was such a good quarter for these big banks. Douglass: Right. Certainly, bank stocks moved a great deal after the election because of expectations of deregulation, and perhaps some expectations that things like trading revenue would improve, but this is where we actually get to see some of that fall through to the bottom line. It's like, trading revenue was actually boosted by quite a bit. Maxfield: Yeah, that's a really good point, actually, Michael. If you look at the stock prices, they shot up 25% to 30%. And that was because of the expectation for reduced regulations and all these things that could happen under the new presidential administration. But if you're talking about the fundamentals of the bank, to your point, it was the trading revenues. Douglass: Exactly. Let's also talking short-term and long-term interest rates. People always talk about interest rates like they're one thing, but there are two different main streams to talk about. Maxfield: Yeah. If you think about banks, what are banks? The way I like to simplify in my own head, because I have a pretty simple mind [laughs], is that a bank is really nothing more than a retail type of operation, but instead of a bookstore that sells books, banks sell money. And interest rates are the price of money. I.e., when you get a loan, the bank is basically selling you that money to use for a time being. The price that you are paying for that is the interest rate on that. So, as interest rates go up, the price of money goes up. And as the price of money goes up, well, so do bank revenues. So, that is a really good thing. But here's the thing. The banks have been talking now for a few years, waiting for interest rates to come up, hoping for them to come up because profitability in the sector has been so hard. But, in the fourth quarter, when they did come up, the short-term rates didn't come up until December, when the Federal Reserve, the committee that sets monetary policy, when they decided to increase interest rates, that didn't happen until December, so, a little bit more than two-thirds of the way through the quarter. Long-term interest rates, which are also are beneficial to banks, they shot up in the immediate wake of the election, just like bank stocks did. And they shot up, actually, by quite a bit, by 90 basis points. If you talk about that on a percentage basis, that means 0.9%. Now, that doesn't seem like a lot. But if you look at all these banks, in their regulatory filings, put out interest rate sensitivity analysis. And Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said that, if short and long-term interest rates increase by 100 basis points, which is almost how much long-term rates shot up, it would earn $5.3 billion more over the following 12 months in net interest income. And net interest income is really high-margin revenue that essentially just falls to the bottom line. Then, we factor in that a bank like Bank of America makes like $5 billion a quarter, then basically, just by interest rates increasing by 1% would basically give Bank of America a full 'nother quarter of earnings on top of what it's already earning. So, it is a really big thing. But, because they came up so late in the quarter, the banks really aren't going to see that benefit until this year. That's why, I think, investors can and should feel bullish about bank stocks at this point. Douglass: Yeah. Certainly, those year-over-year comparisons look like they're going to look pretty darn good for the rest of 2017. Of course, no one has a crystal ball and can predict the future. But that's what things look like right now. But, an interesting thing about interest rates -- and John, you and I were talking about this a bit before the show -- earnings obviously improve as interest rates go up, or they tend to, but book value will tend to go down. Why is that? Maxfield: When you think about what a bank is, it's a highly leveraged investment fund. And in that fund, it holds two different types of assets. I'm speaking very generally. One type of asset are loans. The other type of assets are fixed income securities, things like a 10-year Treasury bill, mortgage-backed securities that are issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, things like that. Well, as interest rates come up, the value of the securities comes down, because those securities were issued under lower interest rates. So, as the new securities, which are basically fungible -- a 10-year Treasury issued in December for all intents and purposes isn't really different from a 10-year Treasury issued in October, except for the fact that if the interest rates go up, investors are going to earn a lot more from those, so they're going to be willing to pay more for those securities that are issued in a higher interest rate environment. What happens then is that all those securities that were existing and on their portfolio, their prices go down. So, what we saw in the fourth quarter was -- and this is a statistic that Dick Bove, a well-known bank analyst, publicized in a recent report, is that if you look at 18 of the biggest banks in the United States, the ones that have thus far reported their earnings, their cumulative book values have fallen by between $17 [billion] to $18 billion. Now, here's the interesting thing about that. You think that there's some give and take here, higher interest rates are good for the income statement but they're bad for the balance sheet. But here's what's so interesting about this. Because of where we are right now, and because the way the regulatory environment has unfolded over the last few years, banks have to hold so much capital that it makes them look less profitable. Because, the way that banks estimate profitability is through the return on equity calculation, where you have income divided by capital. If you have more capital, then your return on equity is going to go down. So, what has happened now is, as these banks have had to revalue their portfolios down, that is actually going to make them look even more profitable, because their return on equity is going to go up. So, there's all these different moving pieces when you're talking about interest rates. Some are good, some are bad. But it looks to me like -- and I think this is probably the consensus out there -- is that as a general rule, higher interest rates are almost indisputably good for banks. Douglass: Yeah. On balance, a net positive. John, I like to talk, and I know you do, sometimes, too. So, I'm going to go ahead and institute a 30-second rule. We're going to talk about three big banks and we're going to talk about each of them in 30 seconds. Sounds good? Maxfield: That sounds great. Douglass: OK, let's talk specifically Bank of America, go. Maxfield: Awesome quarter. $4.3 billion in net income applicable to common stockholders. 50% better than the fourth quarters in the average of the four quarters in the three preceding years. That's great. They are boosted by trading revenue in particular. Going forward, they're going to earn a lot more money, to the point we made about interest rates, $600 million more per quarter this year, if everything else stays equal. However, the one thing that remains out there for Bank of America is that it still needs to get its profitability up. But, it's going in the right direction. Douglass: Cool. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). And, I'll go ahead and insert here, wow, what a barnburner of a quarter for them. Maxfield: [laughs] Yeah. Monster quarter. I mean, JPMorgan Chase earned $6.7 billion. Let me put this in perspective. If you look at earnings over the last 12 months of all the companies on the S&P 500, only one company in the United States earns more money, that's Apple. So, what we're seeing now is the true value of the franchise that CEO Jamie Dimon has built. He built it in large part during the financial crisis by buying a number of other banks for pennies on the dollar. We're really starting to see that value come to fruition. Douglass: All right. Citigroup (NYSE:C)? Maxfield: Citigroup had a really tough quarter. If you just look at its top-line revenue, it fell on a year-over-year basis. Anytime revenue falls on a year-over-year basis, that's not good, particularly when you consider that Citigroup has substantial trading operations that also benefited from trading. So, the fact that they benefited from that, but everything else fell, was not a good sign. The one thing I would say about Citi that shareholders should take note of is that the fourth quarter was the last time that it will separately report the performance of Citi Holdings, which was the entity that it created after the financial crisis, and stuffed full of toxic non-core assets. So, it marks a demarcation point between Citi and the financial crisis that basically, going forward, it will be difficult to even tease out the impact of the financial crisis from Citi's financial statements any longer. Douglass: Let's talk about Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), the fallen angel of the big bank stocks. What happened with these guys? Maxfield: Wells Fargo had a really tough quarter. Like I was telling you, it kind of reminded me of my first semester in college. I still had a pretty good semester, but it was pretty messy when you looked at all the details. In fact, my parents probably didn't know too much about that. [laughs] But, anyway, Wells Fargo has struggled in the quarter. We saw that scandal come out. And that really impacted its top and bottom lines. Douglass: Yeah. Let's face it, reduced credit card and checking account deposits, that's going to be a problem long-term. And all of that work that they're having to do, trying to respond to everything that happened. Let's go ahead and take a step back for those of our listeners who might not be familiar with what's going on with Wells Fargo over the last six months. Maxfield: In September, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau came out and revealed that Wells Fargo, employees in its branches, had been opening fake accounts for customers in order to boost Wells Fargo's cross-sell ratio, and on the individual basis, when you look at the bankers who were doing it, it was in order to meet their sales quotas, these really high sales quotas that they were obligated to meet in order to win bonuses and also to keep their jobs. So, that came out. And then, later in the month, the Office of the Comptroller Currency, which is the primary regulator for national banks, because of the scandal, it is now requiring Wells Fargo to seek regulatory approval for any changes in officers and directors. When you think about it, the company can't even hire or fire the main people anymore without the regulators weighing in on it. That's a pretty stiff penalty. Then, later in the quarter, in December, the Federal Reserve came in and said that Wells Fargo had messed up on this really important financial submission that all the big banks have to submit each year, and as a result of it being the only large bank in the United States to mess up on that, it can't expand internationally without regulatory approval, and also can't make acquisitions without regulatory approval. And then, the icing on the cake -- what a horrible cake it would be to eat -- is there are all these ongoing investigations into Wells Fargo. The one that we know for sure is going on is being run by the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, that is looking into whether Wells Fargo retaliated against employees who tried to bring that sales scandal to light over the past few years as it was happening, and then when they did bring it to the attention of their supervisors, it is alleged by many, many employees and the media over the last few months that they were either fired, or faced some sort of adverse employment action as a result of bringing it to light. Douglass: Yeah, just a multilayered cake of bad stuff going on. That's pretty much the Wells story in a nutshell. Let's widen back out. Going forward over the next couple quarters, and the rest of 2017, even, what are the major things folks should be watching for across big banks? Maxfield: The major things you're going to want to be watching are, I would say, you're going to want to watch, for sure, the direction of interest rates. When the Federal Reserve met in December, they raised interest rates, the short-term interest rates, the Fed Funds rate, by 25 basis points. But they also said, "Look, a plurality of members on that committee thinks that they will raise interest rates three more times this year." To put that in perspective, the Fed has only increased rates twice since the financial crisis eight years ago. So, that would be a huge boost to banks if that were to come to fruition. The other thing to listen and watch for are the language coming out of the presidential administration about what steps they're going to take on the regulatory front, and what impacts that will have on banks. As I'm looking at it -- and just today, Trump came out and said that they're going to decrease regulations, and I don't know how you'd quantify this, but by 75% -- well, if they do that in the bank industry, which is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the United States, banks are going to earn more revenue, they're going to have lower compliance costs, and their profitabilities are just going to soar. Douglass: We're an investing podcast, so if you had to pick one of the big four we talked about today -- that's Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan -- if you had to pick one right now as your favorite big bank stock, which would it be? Maxfield: I would have to say -- it's tempting to say that Citigroup is because the value of the stock is so low. But the problem with Citigroup is -- and we detailed this earlier in the show -- is that it's going to struggle going forward, particularly, to get back to the policy question, if the presidential administration goes in a protectionist direction, because Citigroup is such an internationally focused bank, that could really impact it. So, even though Citigroup is the cheapest, I don't think that's the direction that I would go in as an investor. The direction I would go in as an investor at this point is JPMorgan Chase. Again, to the point we made earlier, because the value of that franchise ... as these interest rates come up, and assuming that they do, the value of that franchise is really going to come through. And it is now, as of the fourth quarter, the most profitable multitrillion dollar bank in the quarter. And going forward, I just don't see that trend abating at all. Douglass: Good thing to end on.

 JPMorgan gives Intuit access to customer data BI Intelligence Jan. 26, 2017, 11:43 AM 1,096 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Fintech could be bigger than ATMs, PayPal, and Bitcoin combined US fintechs are lobbying for access to customer data Here's why France might steal the UK's fintech crown This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Fintech Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. In late 2015, several major US banks upset customers and fintechs when it emerged that they had temporarily suspended the flow of customer data to third-party data aggregators, prompting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to launch a data-sharing inquiry. Now, JPMorgan Chase, one of the banks involved in the suspension, has reached an agreement with a tech company temporarily denied access, called Intuit, which uses data aggregation to power its solutions, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Intuit's solutions include Mint.com, a personal finance management app, QuickBooks, an SMB accounting solution, and TurboTax Online, a tax management app. Such fintechs have been demanding access to customer data in order to be able to provide a customized service for clients, and roll out more efficient new products. Customers, meanwhile, want such providers to access their information to achieve better financial management. The deal will let Chase customers authorize the bank to share their data with Intuit's apps electronically. Previously, customers had to give Intuit their banking passwords to view their account information, which the bank said compromised cybersecurity. Under the new agreement, Chase customers who wish to use third-party aggregator apps will give Intuit permission to access their banking data, after which the bank has to confirm that the request came from the customer. It will then issue a token which Intuit uses to access the data, until and if a customer chooses to end the company's access. Customers' data will be shared with third parties by the bank using an application programming interface (API). This is an important step toward open banking in the US, but it might not be far-reaching enough. JPMorgan Chase and Intuit are both leaders in their respective fields, and it is promising that a bank of such stature has facilitated access to its customer data. On the other hand, however, this is a discretionary agreement between two companies, and the benefits seem unlikely to trickle down to customers of other banks. For truly open banking to emerge, whereby APIs are open to multiple third parties, regulations will likely have to be introduced at a federal level. Given the push toward open banking from both fintechs and federal agencies like the CFPB recently, such regulations may well be introduced in the near future. As this situation unfolds, it's become increasingly clear that we’ve entered the most profound era of change for financial services companies since the 1970s brought us index mutual funds, discount brokers and ATMs. No firm is immune from the coming disruption and every company must have a strategy to harness the powerful advantages of the new fintech revolution. The battle already underway will create surprising winners and stunned losers among some of the most powerful names in the financial world: The most contentious conflicts (and partnerships) will be between startups that are completely reengineering decades-old practices, traditional power players who are furiously trying to adapt with their own innovations, and total disruption of established technology & processes: Traditional Retail Banks vs. Online-Only Banks: Traditional retail banks provide a valuable service, but online-only banks can offer many of the same services with higher rates and lower fees  Traditional Lenders vs. Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces: P2P lending marketplaces are growing much faster than traditional lenders—only time will tell if the banks strategy of creating their own small loan networks will be successful  Traditional Asset Managers vs. Robo Advisors: Robo advisors like Betterment offer lower fees, lower minimums and solid returns to investors, but the much larger traditional asset managers are creating their own robo-products while providing the kind of handholding that high net worth clients are willing to pay handsomely for. As you can see, this very fluid environment is creating winners and losers before your eyes…and it’s also creating the potential for new cost savings or growth opportunities for both you and your company. After months of researching and reporting this important trend, Sarah Kocianski, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has put together an essential report on the fintech ecosystem that explains the new landscape, identifies the ripest areas for disruption, and highlights the some of the most exciting new companies. These new players have the potential to become the next Visa, Paypal or Charles Schwab because they have the potential to transform important areas of the financial services industry like: Retail banking  Lending and Financing  Payments and Transfers  Wealth and Asset Management  Markets and Exchanges  Insurance  Blockchain Transactions  If you work in any of these sectors, it’s important for you to understand how the fintech revolution will change your business and possibly even your career. And if you’re employed in any part of the digital economy, you’ll want to know how you can exploit these new technologies to make your employer more efficient, flexible and profitable.

The areas of fintech attracting media and investor attention are changing. Insurtech, robo advisors, and digital-only banks are only a few of the segments making waves. B2B fintechs are also playing an increasingly prominent role in the ecosystem.  It's not all good news for fintechs. Major hurdles, including customer acquisition and profitability, remain. As a result, many are becoming more willing to enter partnerships and adjust their business models.  Incumbents are enacting strategies to ensure they remain relevant. Many financial firms have woken up to the threat posed by fintechs and are implementing innovation strategies to stave off disruption. The majority of these strategies involve some interaction with fintech firms.  The relationship between incumbents and fintechs continues to evolve. Fintechs are no longer viewed exclusively as a threat, nor can they be ignored. They are increasingly viewed as partners, but that narrative alone is too simple — in reality, a more nuanced connection is taking hold.  This exclusive report also: Assesses the state of the fintech industry.  Gives details on the drivers of its growth.  Explains which areas of fintech are gaining traction.  Outlines the range of current and potential models for fintech and incumbent interaction.  The Fintech Ecosystem Report: Measuring the effects of technology on the entire financial services industry is how you get the full story on the fintech revolution.

News 3 0 0 January 25, 2017 Dow Jones Industrial Average Hits Stock Market Record High Of 20,000: Why Are People Freaking Out? Amanda Katherine People are freaking out right now because the Dow Jones Industrial Average just hit 20,000 points for the first time in stock market history. According to Mic, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is considered to be a snapshot of where the stock market is headed because the index includes a lot of the country’s largest and most profitable companies like McDonald’s, General Electric, and IBM. Finally. #dow20k pic.twitter.com/B0LnxCEX9Z — Sara Eisen (@SaraEisen) January 25, 2017 The index first topped 19,000 on November 22. The past month and a half or so have been the second fastest 1,000 point run in Dow Jones Industrial Average’s history. However, the Dow does only include 30 companies, which is a fairly small sample size. Many of the stocks within the Dow are considered to be predictable and “boring.” [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] The best performing Dow stocks over the last month or two have been Goldman Sachs, Disney, and Boeing. Spikes in Caterpillar, Boeing, JPMorgan, and Travelers helped push the Dow over the 20,000 market on Wednesday. Chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, Jeff Kleintop, said that the election has definitely impacted the Dow. Cramer: To get to the next level, we need Trump’s tax breaks 1 Hour Ago | 01:50 Wall Street’s bull should keep running even after its race to Dow 20,000 from its last thousand-point milestone, but it’s much more likely to slow to a trot before it reaches 21,000. The Dow crossed 19,000 on November 22 and continued to gain, as the Trump trade swept the market higher. The best performing Dow stocks since then are Goldman Sachs, Disney, and Boeing. Gains in Caterpillar,Boeing, JPMorgan, and Travelers helped push the Dow across the 20,000 marker on the opening Wednesday. “Individual investors have started buying again, really since the election. “A psychological number like 20,000 helps to continue that trend, helps to bring in investors that have been sitting in cash and it really helps to keep the money flow coming in. “We see this as a positive year, largely because of the individual investor, and not just corporations buying back stock any more.” People are also at odds because the Dow weighs stocks with a high share price more heavily than its modern competitors like the S&P 500, which is more representative of the broader market and contains 500 stocks. A stock’s share price is pretty meaningless without taking into account the number of outstanding shares. ALERT: Dow Jones Industrial Average comes within 44 points of striking the 20,000 level https://t.co/kmLAoeL2sc pic.twitter.com/NjPIi4FZxf — CNBC (@CNBC) January 6, 2017 The 20,000-point stock market rise has been expected for a while now. Of course, not everyone is excited or obsessed over the five-figure milestone. Investor and financial writer Douglas Kass called the buzz surrounding the stock market points “asinine” on Twitter. In one word – the DJIA 20k watch is … Assinine. Stated simply. — Douglas Kass (@DougKass) January 6, 2017 Some market watchers are becoming concerned that stocks are getting too expensive and that the post-election gains have come way too fast. “Expensive” stocks have a share price that is higher than what you would expect, given the company’s profits, earnings, or whatever else. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] The cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio (CAPE) was developed by economist Robert Shiller. The CAPE is beginning to dance around the danger zone. Right now, the CAPE is around 28. The CAPE has only been this high a few times in history: before the 1929 stock market crash, the 2000 internet bubble crash, and the 2007 housing market crash. Other financial skeptics believe that the market is pricing in enthusiasm over some of President Donald Trump’s policies, including business tax breaks. However, other potential risks, like the increased possibility of a trade war or even nuclear war, have been ignored. It is likely that it will be a slow trot before the Dow reaches 21,000 points.

Detroit Workforce System Leadership Development Academy Inaugural Class Announced 22 Individuals to Participate in 12-Month Program to Enhance Career Pathway Strategies in Detroit January 26, 2017 06:00 AM Eastern Standard Time DETROIT--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase & Co., in partnership with Corporation for a Skilled Workforce (CSW) and The Aspen Institute, today announced the selection of twenty-two participants for the first ever Detroit Workforce System Leadership Development Academy (Academy). The Academy will leverage and build on the expertise of leaders across the workforce ecosystem through an intensive twelve month learning program, led by local Detroit leaders and guest faculty from across the nation, providing the group with an opportunity to collaborate on developing practical solutions to solve some of the city’s most challenging workforce issues. As part of JPMorgan Chase’s $100 million commitment to the city’s economic recovery, the company awarded $200,000 to CSW to allow the Academy to leverage and build on the expertise of leaders across the workforce community to help these workforce leaders to better engage employers, understand industry workforce needs, develop successful career pathway strategies and strengthen connections between training providers, job seekers and employers. “As a result of this program, this exciting group of local leaders will be able to come up with innovative and practical solutions that connect Detroiters to open jobs in a way they’ve never done before. The Academy will help advance the city’s focus on creating high-quality jobs and reducing the skills mismatch between local employers and job hunters,” said Chauncy Lennon, Head of Workforce Initiatives, JPMorgan Chase. The program includes an opening retreat in late January, five full day working sessions from March to September, a second retreat in November, and a closing capstone presentation event in December. The Academy is anchored in a world-class sector skills development model, grounded in practical application of innovative practices, and backed by an executive-level Detroit-based council of leaders. It is one in a number of strategies aimed at preparing the City’s next cohort of workforce system leaders to help offer solutions to some of Detroit’s most intractable workforce issues. “Effective workforce development strategies are developed within a particular local context and take account of a variety of factors including the specifics of their local labor market, the assets and needs of the people whose careers they seek to advance, and the resources and capacities of the local institutions with which they partner,” said Sheila Maguire, Senior Fellow with Aspen Institute Economic Opportunities Program. “Skilled local leaders, who can work within their organization and in partnerships with other stakeholders, are essential for success.” The academy participants will join leaders in a growing network of fellows from academies in Baltimore, Seattle, and Toronto, Canada. The following 22 individuals comprise Detroit’s 2017 cohort: Kristen Barnes-Holiday, Director of Program Outcomes for Reading Works Detroit Sister Janice Brown, Executive Director for Dominican Literacy Center Jacqueline Burau, Senior Program Officer for Detroit Local Initiative Support Corporation Devon Buskin, Director of Workforce Development for The Greening of Detroit Emily Dieppa, Executive Director for CarePath Career Center Brittany Foley, Program Manager for Michigan Community Services Shawna Forbes, Vice Chancellor, School of Continuing Education and Workforce Development for Wayne County Community College District Mary Freeman, Director, Workforce Development for Southwest Solutions Naheed Huq, Manager of Talent and Economic Development for Southeast Michigan Council of Governments Marcus Jones, Director for the Detroit Training Center Tammie Jones, VP, College and Career Pathways, and CEO for Linked Learning, UW-SEM Ann Leen, Assistant Vice President of Youth Services for SER Metro Ricardo Marble, Director of Youth Services for the city of Detroit Teresa McFadden, Director of Operations-Detroit for Vehicles for Change Chioke Mose-Telesford, Deputy Director of Workforce Development Office for the city of Detroit Stephanie Nixon, Director of Program and Service Innovation for Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation Hachem Ossarian, Operations Manager for ACCESS Veronica Sanchez Peavy, Sr. Assistant Vice President (Adult Programs) and Regional Director for SER Metro Sarah Sebaly, Senior Program Manager, Workforce Intelligence Network/Southeast Michigan Community Alliance Robert Shimkoski, Director, Policy Planning & Resource Development for the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation Edward Steinberger, Director- Detroit Career Center for Goodwill Industries Rashida Thomas, Director, Workforce Development & Education for Focus:HOPE “This cohort of 22 leaders represents a direct investment in the bedrock of the Detroit workforce system that will influence organizations key to the city’s growth and pay dividends for years to come,” said Jeannine La Prad, President and CEO, CSW. Academy project leaders from CSW and Aspen Institute sought potential Academy Fellows in mid-to-senior level management positions with authority to implement organizational and program changes and who are high-performing, high-potential candidates for more senior roles within their own organizations or elsewhere in the system. Applications were solicited from candidates working in diverse organizations, including public workforce, economic development, health and human service agencies, nonprofit job training and work-readiness providers, community colleges or universities, community-based and faith-based organizations, business associations, unions, and other relevant agencies. Selections were made based on comprehensive application submissions from the candidates, with input and feedback from the Academy advisory council members. Corporation for a Skilled Workforce (CSW) is a national non-profit organization that partners with philanthropy, government, business, and community leaders to connect workers with good jobs, increase the competitiveness of companies, and build sustainable communities.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News BUDGET 2017 Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Dollar gains capped by concerns over Trump's policies Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Tokyo, Jan 26:   The dollar rose against the yen and euro on Thursday but the prospect of stronger US economic growth was not enough to drive the currency significantly higher as the weight of bets on a stronger greenback made some investors nervous. While equities and Treasury yields have continued to rise, fuelled by US President Donald Trump's signals that he plans to increase public spending, expectations of a boost to growth have had a diminishing impact on the dollar in the past 10 days. Currency market players have offered a variety of explanations for that breakdown, from concerns about Trump's protectionist bent to his warning over the dollar's strength and worries about his approach to geopolitical and social issues. Either way, the squeeze on the huge bets on the dollar built up at the end of last year has now lasted almost a month. “Positioning does seem to have overtaken the dollar bull arguments and there is an issue of credibility with Trump,” said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment at currency fund Millennium Global in London. “It really has just been a position annihilation.” Speculators have gradually cut their net bets on a stronger dollar from $25.43 billion in the week ending January 3 to $24.44 billion in the week to January 17, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and calculations by Reuters show. The dollar index was flat on the day at 100.01, having hit a seven-week low of 99.793 earlier in the day. It gained 0.1 per cent to $1.0741 against the euro and 0.4 per cent to 113.68 yen. Trump has made several corporate-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday, including executive orders to reduce the regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers and to clear the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. However, his broad but divisive plans to reshape US immigration and national security policy rattled some investors, partly because the US needs foreign capital to finance its large current account deficit. If protectionism is the issue, it has not shown up in the currencies of some of the Asian exporting economies that, theoretically, should be most exposed. The Singapore dollar dipped with the yen on Thursday but is trading around its highest since mid-November. The Korean won hit its highest since November 10 in Asian trading. Mexico's peso strengthened to a three-week high of 20.9300 pesos on Wednesday. Among the group of G10 developed world currencies, the biggest gainer of the past fortnight has been sterling, up almost 6 per cent from troughs hit on January 16. All eyes were on fourth-quarter GDP data “The market has been seeing the pound in a different light over the past week or so,” analysts from currency exchange LMAX said in a morning note. “While there remains risk for a hard Brexit, it seems more clarity on the matter has been alleviating some stress. At the same time, the big sell-off in the dollar has also contributed to sterling strength.” (This article was published on January 26, 2017) Post Comment Related NEWS Stocks bask in afterglow of Dow breaking past 20,000 TOPICS economy (general) | currency value | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

ByNatalie Gagliordi for Small Business Matters | January 25, 2017 -- 17:18 GMT (09:18 PST) | Topic: SMBs CBSNews.com An agreement has been struck between JPMorgan Chase and Intuit that gives joint customers real-time access to their data. Specifically, the deal allows Chase customers to link their bank accounts to Intuit's cloud accounting products without turning over their Chase-affiliated usernames and passwords. What's Hot on ZDnet Microsoft's multi-pronged robotics play takes shape Trump aides' use of encrypted messaging may violate records law ​Ex top Mozilla dev: Ditch all antivirus except Microsoft's Defender Students team aims to brew beer on the moon According to both companies, the agreement "aligns closely" with a set of consumer data-sharing principles announced in October and "sets the bar for how banks and technology companies" work together to provide services for shared customers -- a feat that has proved contentious in the past. A little more than a year ago, a number of banks temporarily blocked data from flowing to financial technology platforms such as Intuit's. The concern was that the data could be picked off by hackers and cause the banks to incur costs from potential identity theft or fraud. With this new data-sharing pact, the companies will use the Open Financial Exchange API to authorize Chase to electronically share financial data with Intuit products such as Mint, TurboTax Online, and QuickBooks Online. The API utilizes tokenization technology that will allow Intuit to download account information from Chase without asking users to give Intuit their Chase user name and password. "We're pleased to deliver a great experience for our shared consumer and small-business customers," said Intuit CEO Brad Smith. "Intuit products, such as Mint, TurboTax Online and QuickBooks Online, provide tens of millions of people with a complete picture of their finances, so that they can make informed decisions for themselves or their business." Looking ahead, both companies said they plan to make similar agreements with others in the financial services and technology industries.

Sabrina WillmerCharles SteinHugh Son BlackRock has made no secret that it planned to put more pressure on vendors. President Rob Kapito said in a conference call last year that it would seek concessions as it tries to keep a lid on expenses. Photo: Reuters Boston/New York: BlackRock Inc. yanked custody services from State Street Corp. on more than $1 trillion in client assets as the asset manager seeks to cut costs by putting pressure on vendors. The move of assets to JPMorgan Chase & Co. is part of BlackRock’s strategy to exact lower fees, according to a person familiar with the matter. The bank said the deal was one of the largest shifts of custody assets ever. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, found a partner in JPMorgan, which has been growing its custody business and now services about $20.5 trillion in assets. The bank has invested in automation technology that helps it offer services more cheaply, said another person with knowledge of the situation. The bank is expected to make tens of millions of dollars in annual fees from the deal. “Many of BlackRock’s clients will experience cost savings through decreased operating expenses at the fund level,” Derek Stein, senior managing director and head of business operations and technology at BlackRock, said in an emailed statement Wednesday. BlackRock has made no secret that it planned to put more pressure on vendors. President Rob Kapito said in a conference call last year that it would seek concessions as it tries to keep a lid on expenses. Profit margins JPMorgan’s corporate and investment bank chief Daniel Pinto has said he was focusing on the custody business because of its profit margins and steady fees. One priority is improving efficiency through automation technology, he said in a February presentation. That has helped the business generate margins of greater than 25%. Pinto said in a Wednesday statement that the deal is a “validation of the investments we’ve made and the resources we’ve added to the custody and fund services business.” The firm said it increased business with existing custody clients by 10% over the last 12 months. State Street investors saw the move as a blow. The company’s shares fell 4.3% as of 2:50pm in New York, the most since June. This “may be the first inning of a trend of JPMorgan uniquely being able to grab business from the trust banks,” wrote Glenn Schorr, a senior banking analyst at Evercore ISI, in a client email. The average fee rate for custody assets is 1.81 basis points, meaning that the loss to JPMorgan could sap about 3% of State Street’s earnings, he wrote. ‘A one-off’ State Street chief executive officer Jay Hooley said Wednesday that BlackRock approached the Boston-based custody bank as it sought to diversify its custodians. Hooley said that as BlackRock grew into a $5.15 trillion money manager it decided it needed another partner. The shift isn’t indicative of a trend in the industry because most companies are looking to use fewer providers, Hooley said on the company’s earnings conference call. “We appreciated where they were coming from,” Hooley said. “It’s a one-off adjustment for BlackRock to get better diversified.” State Street had assets under custody and administration of $28.8 trillion as of the fourth quarter. It said in a presentation Wednesday that it would remain a service provider to BlackRock even after the move. Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the largest custody bank, reported $29.9 trillion in assets under custody and administration. Fee pressure Price competition is fierce among the top players in the industry. Improvements in technology are driving servicing costs lower and customers are demanding those savings be returned to them, Richard Bove, an analyst with Rafferty Capital Markets, said in an interview Wednesday. “It is a significant loss at a time when State Street’s fees are already under pressure,” said Bove. JPMorgan expects to take over administration of the assets during the next two years. Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend securities for institutional investors. They also manage money for individuals and institutions. “Shifts of this size are pretty rare,” Jonathan Watkins, editor of Global Custodian, a London-based publication that covers the industry, said in a telephone interview. “Big managers tend to keep these custody relationships in place for decades.” Bloomberg Sabrina WillmerCharles SteinHugh Son Topics: BlackrockJPMorganasset managerState StreetRob Kapito More From Livemint READ MORE L&T Q3 rises 39% to Rs972 crore 5 soldiers trapped under heavy snow along LoC, army launches rescue operation Donald Trump’s trade-policy wild card puts US growth momentum at risk First Published: Thu, Jan 26 2017. 08 20 AM IST Editor's Picks Why we should be wary of ‘viral’ narratives about economic policy BSE listing: Sebi sets process to address potential conflict A portrait of a soldier’s wife Latest News 5 soldiers trapped under heavy snow along LoC, army launches rescue operation Donald Trump’s trade-policy wild card puts US growth momentum at risk Sunanda Pushkar’s death: Medical board fails to make any conclusion in report Pakistan hopes to host Saarc soon, accuses India to impede process Google recalls staff to US after Donald Trump immigration order Mint On Sunday How India chased off the run-chase blues Why Kamaraj does not have to wake up early this year The humanity of intelligence Dangal: Do we celebrate a father like this?

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, January 28, 2017 Updated: 5:50 AM, January 28, 2017 Citigroup Inc <C.N> has quietly launched a website to make small business loans of up to $1 million, the latest effort by a big bank to make the process of smaller loans more technology-friendly. Citigroup's online toe in the water comes after similar moves by several other banks. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> announced a partnership with online lender On Deck Capital Inc <ONDK.N> in December 2015 and Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> launched a fast-decision online small business loan product some eight months ago. Banks have been cautious about entering the online lending space despite the proliferation of online non-bank lenders such as On Deck, LendingClub Corp <LC.N> Prosper Marketplace and other startups. Early optimism about prospects for such companies soured after LendingClub's CEO resigned over a loan-selling scandal. Citigroup's website is run by Biz2Credit, a New York-based startup. Borrowers visiting the Citigroup website are directed to a separate website run by Biz2Credit where they fill out an online worksheet before following up with a Citigroup small business banker. Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora said being online makes it easier for Citigroup to fulfill its obligations to small and underserved borrowers under the Community Reinvestment Act because it allows access for customers who live far from a branch. Citigroup and Biz2Credit chose not to publicize the effort because it is still in very early stages, Arora said. "If you make a premature announcement the expectations go very high and then you're in the public eye all the time," he said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment. Separately, a small business lending website backed by Citigroup and the U.S. Treasury Department and run by Biz2Credit will shut down. Launched in May 2015, DCSmallBizLoans.com was intended to bring online lending technology to small businesses in underserved Washington D.C. communities. The website matched up small businesses with four Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), government-backed lenders that serve low-income communities. Citigroup had agreed to fund the website for two years, after which it was expected to become self-sustaining, said Steve Glaude, president and chief executive officer of the Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development, a non-profit that organized the effort. Though it would only have cost each CDFI about $1,000 per month to keep the site operating, there was not enough interest to warrant even so small an investment, according to Glaude. "In some ways I think we were ahead of our time," he said.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 Mail News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Citigroup quietly launches small business lending website By Dan Freed ReutersJanuary 27, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Reflections are seen on the glass facade of a Citibank branch in Beijing, China, April 18, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonMore By Dan Freed (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc <C.N> has quietly launched a website to make small business loans of up to $1 million, the latest effort by a big bank to make the process of smaller loans more technology-friendly. Citigroup's online toe in the water comes after similar moves by several other banks. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> announced a partnership with online lender On Deck Capital Inc <ONDK.N> in December 2015 and Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> launched a fast-decision online small business loan product some eight months ago. Banks have been cautious about entering the online lending space despite the proliferation of online non-bank lenders such as On Deck, LendingClub Corp <LC.N> Prosper Marketplace and other startups. Early optimism about prospects for such companies soured after LendingClub's CEO resigned over a loan-selling scandal. Citigroup's website is run by Biz2Credit, a New York-based startup. Borrowers visiting the Citigroup website are directed to a separate website run by Biz2Credit where they fill out an online worksheet before following up with a Citigroup small business banker. Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora said being online makes it easier for Citigroup to fulfill its obligations to small and underserved borrowers under the Community Reinvestment Act because it allows access for customers who live far from a branch. Citigroup and Biz2Credit chose not to publicize the effort because it is still in very early stages, Arora said. "If you make a premature announcement the expectations go very high and then you're in the public eye all the time," he said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment. Separately, a small business lending website backed by Citigroup and the U.S. Treasury Department and run by Biz2Credit will shut down. Launched in May 2015, DCSmallBizLoans.com was intended to bring online lending technology to small businesses in underserved Washington D.C. communities. The website matched up small businesses with four Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), government-backed lenders that serve low-income communities. Citigroup had agreed to fund the website for two years, after which it was expected to become self-sustaining, said Steve Glaude, president and chief executive officer of the Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development, a non-profit that organized the effort. Though it would only have cost each CDFI about $1,000 per month to keep the site operating, there was not enough interest to warrant even so small an investment, according to Glaude. "In some ways I think we were ahead of our time," he said.

(AMZN) Stock Deserve More Credit? Here's why AMZN stock is still a winner By , Street Authority  |  Jan 25, 2017, 6:00 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Does Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Deserve More Credit? International Business Machines Corp. Is Back! (IBM) Recent Posts: International Business Machines Corp. Is Back! (IBM) Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation a Defense Contractor On the Move (BAH) Consider This All-In-One Biotech Fund With a 10% Yield (CHI) View All Posts Membership now has its privileges at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The e-commerce giant recently announced its new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature credit card, giving Prime shoppers more ways to buy and earn cash back in the process. Meanwhile, critics who continue to bet against AMZN stock — citing outdated valuation arguments — must prepare for more losses, while the longs ride these shares higher. Source: Shutterstock The new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card, in partnership with JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), gives Prime shoppers a whopping 5% cash back on all Amazon purchases. AMZN: Too Good to Be True or too Good to Pass Up? The card also rewards members with 2% cash back at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores, and 1% back on all other purchases. There is no cap on the amount of rewards cardholders can earn. The card has no annual fee and does not charge foreign transaction fees, and charges 14.74% to 22.74% annual percentage rate (APR) on unpaid balances versus the average credit card interest rate of 16.35%. Still undecided? According to Zach Honig, editor in chief of rewards site The Points Guy, Amazon’s new card is a good choice for someone looking for “a very simple option for getting the greatest return on Amazon purchases.” Honig said, “If you want something really straightforward, one card to use for all Amazon purchases, this is the way to go.” To reap these benefits, all Amazon wants you to do is become a Prime member, which itself costs $99 per year to join. And here’s the thing: When new cardholders sign up, they will receive a $70 Amazon gift card. In other words, the net cost to be a Prime Member is only $29. The announcement pushed AMZN stock above $800 per share for the first time since October. But this is only the beginning. Here’s why the shares will go higher. AMZN Is Betting On Itself Right away, the first thought that comes to mind is why would Amazon do this? To give 5% cash back, which is 3 percentage points above the previous card’s rate, means a narrower profit margin for the company. And lack of profits has been a popular criticism of AMZN stock. From my vantage point, however, it seems that Amazon is betting on itself. The company sees this card as another way to lock shoppers into its ecosystem. At the same time, the announcement of the new card should send chills down the spine of the brick-and-mortar competition. Why? At a time when the likes of Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) and J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE:JCP) are scaling back stores and cutting their workforce, Amazon is implying it has so much business and room for expansion that it can afford this type of expense. AMZN seems even more intent than ever to boost capital expenses to achieve its main objective: to disrupt every type of retail. And with the new card reportedly to be made out of metal, Amazon wants to take on the persona of, say, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) and provide the prestige that comes with membership. A Win-Win Situation for Amazon Stock Last week, AMZN announced it would create 100,000 jobs by the middle of next year. Bezos touted the addition of new jobs across multiple areas of the company’s operations — from fulfillment centers to logistics to machine learning and cloud services. Of course, the mainstream immediately called the job creation plan an attempt by Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, to win political favor with then-President-elect Donald Trump. I won’t presume to know Bezos’ motivation, but he didn’t become the world’s third-richest person without focusing on the bottom line.

The S&P 500 Index, along with related funds including the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEArca: SPY), iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEArca: IVV) and Vanguard 500 Index (NYSEArca: VOO), were 0.2% lower Thursday. The unimpressive corporate results gave little reason to investors to keep U.S. stocks pushing toward new heights after Chevron revealed quarterly profits falling short of expectations, reports Saqib Iqbal Ahmed for Reuters. “Earnings have really just been fine,” David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, told Reuters “They haven’t been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think ‘fine’ might not be enough in the near-term, and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay.” Additionally, stocks lost a step after the Commerce Department revealed gross domestic product rose at a 1.9% annualized rate last quarter, compared to the prior quarter’s 3.5% expansion, due to the biggest drag from trade in six years and moderate consumer spending, reports Sho Chandra for Bloomberg. Nevertheless, market sentiment remains supported by president Donald Trump’s potential plans on tax reform and fiscal stimulus, which will help maintain growth in 2017, despite his protectionist stance. Economists expect U.S. growth to range from 1.7% to 2.9%. “We’re still reasonably positive on the market,” Graeme Bencke, fund manager at PineBridge Investments, told the Wall Street Journal. “Short-term actions the administration can take should be relatively market-friendly,” Bencke added, pointing to policies such as reducing taxes and regulation.

Weakness in Europe weighed on the index and it found little support on Wall Street.Lackluster corporate results gave little reason to investors to push U.S. stocks higher.Chevron fell 2.5 percent to $113.67 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes."Earnings have really just been fine," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco."They haven't been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think 'fine' might not be enough in the near-term, and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 18.91 points, or 0.09 percent, to 20,082, the S&P 500 lost 3.62 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,293.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.07 points, or 0 percent, to 5,655.24.European shares eased with UBS dragging bank stocks lower after posting a drop in full-year profit, while Britain's biggest supermarket, Tesco, surged after a 3.7 billion-pound takeover of a supplier.The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.4 percent at 366.04.The greenback, which has climbed for two straight days from a seven-week low against a basket of major currencies, was buoyed by hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies will further bolster the U.S. economy. Increasing expectations of tax reforms and fiscal stimulus, which support the dollar, are temporarily soothing concerns about Trump's stance on trade protectionism, said Karl Schamotta, director of global product & market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.The dollar retreated a little against a basket of currencies after data showed U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected to 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter but recouped losses to trade up 0.19 at 100.57.The greenback rose to a one-week high of 115.37 against the yen.The Mexican peso, which slumped on Thursday after the White House said Trump wants a 20-percent tax on imports from Mexico to pay for a wall on their shared border, strengthened more than 1 percent after the two countries agreed not to talk publicly for now about payment for the wall. In bond markets, U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors reached for U.S. government debt following the disappointing fourth-quarter GDP data.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was down 2 basis points at 2.486 percent.Oil prices extended losses after data suggested drilling is ramping up in the United States, easing the focus on efforts by OPEC and other producers to support prices by cutting supplies.Brent crude was down 1.64 percent at $55.32 a barrel, while U.S. crude was down 1.56 percent at $52.94.Gold was on track for its first weekly loss of the year as persistent dollar strength prompted some traders to cash in on this week's rally to two-month highs.

Óscar Laínez and Jorge Herrera, executives of Compañía de Servicios Múltiples S. de R.L. (Cosem), allegedly used a Panamanian firm called CA Technologies to make transfers of more than $2.5 million to a JP Morgan Chase bank account in the United States belonging to a company called CM Motors, according to an investigation by the National Fiscal Support Unit (Unidad Nacional de Apoyo Fiscal). Mario Zelaya -- former director of the Honduran Social Security Institute (Instituto Hondureño de Seguridad Social - IHSS) who has been jailed and is facing charges in the IHSS case -- and his brother Carlos, are both partners of CM Motors.  According to La Prensa, the Cosem executives paid these bribes in 2010 in order to "expedite" a $19.7 million contract with the IHSS to digitalize their registration system. The bribes were paid to then-Director Mario Zelaya, then-Vice Minister of Health Javier Pastor, and then-Deputy Secretary of Jobs Carlos Montes.  Cosem executives Laínez and Herrera are both key witnesses in the money laundering and bribery case against Zelaya, Pastor and Montes.  Raul Pineda Alvarado, a lawyer and expert in criminal law who spoke to La Prensa, told the media outlet the United States could take legal action against Laínez or Herrera, or place sanctions on JP Morgan.  InSight Crime Analysis  The announcement of this investigation comes at an awkward time for Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who is readying his bid for re-election. In 2015, the Honduran Supreme Court controversially overturned a constitutional ban on re-election, allowing Hernández to run for another term as president. While Hernández was not in office when Mario Zelaya and several of his colleagues from the IHSS were arrested and charged, the case impacts his National Party and could impact his reelection bid. SEE ALSO: Honduras News and Profiles  Hernández admitted in 2015 that companies linked to corruption cases in the IHSS had contributed nearly $150,000 to his presidential campaign in 2013. As Honduran authorities investigated corruption within IHSS, they discovered "the creation of over 10 ghost companies that allegedly delivered checks and wired monthly installments to the National Party's central committee." As further revelations surface regarding corruption in the IHSS, details could emerge that may prove damaging to Hernández's re-election bid.   What are your thoughts?

SOME': Comments of the week Why banks should consider taking a page from Facebook on security keys Can AI make banks as good as Amazon at knowing customers? search goes here The data access debate is about to get a lot more interesting By Mary Wisniewski Published January 27 2017, 3:27pm EST More in Data security APIs PFM Dodd-Frank Bank technology Print Email Reprints Share Share on The long-running feud between banks and fintech companies over screen scraping is morphing into a more nuanced and important debate about how to exchange consumers' financial data securely and fairly. White papers are being written, lobbying groups are forming and interpretations of the law are being put forth. The questions are more complex than whether third-party data aggregators should be permitted to access consumers' accounts using their credentials. The new Matryoshka dolls include: Is the industry legally obligated to improve the way data is shared between banks and third-party apps like Mint or Digit? Will replacing screen scraping with something more secure and reliable also prevent third-party apps from capturing valuable data such as interest rates? Should the industry collaborate more on standards so smaller banks aren’t locked out of digital advancements? The stakes are nothing short of the ability to innovate with financial apps – including some bank apps – at a time when most Americans live paycheck to paycheck and could use new tools to plan, save and borrow. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also been taking an interest in the issue of data access, meaning that if the industry doesn't converge on a solution, one may eventually be foisted upon it. The answers may require banks to rethink their business models, which rely to a degree on consumer lock-in. "On the face of it, it looks like tech issue," said Kristin Moyer, a research vice president at Gartner’s banking and investment services practice. "But it forces you to think about what it means to be a bank." One wrinkle is that competing approaches to grabbing financial records are multiplying. Big banks have been landing application programming interface deals with fintech companies. This week, JPMorgan Chase and Intuit announced a partnership to make sharing financial data easier and safer through an API (specifically the OFX 2.2 API). Wells Fargo made a splash last year when it announced an API deal with an accounting software firm called Xero. Banks, large and small, have the Open Financial Exchange (OFX) and Durable Data API standards at their disposal at a time when screen scraping is still in wide use. “It will get worse before it gets better in terms of number of competing API-type solutions,” Moyer said. Essentially, individual partnerships may be good advertising for the benefits of data sharing, but they hinder the development of an ecosystem built on standards. Lack of standardization, some say, could stall innovation and ultimately harm consumers. “Imagine a small bank with limited resources,” said Beth Brockland, a managing director with the Center for Financial Services Innovation in Chicago. Such a bank will lack the time and resources to negotiate one-off agreements with aggregators. To address a challenge that ultimately affects consumers, the center is among those advocating for more collaboration. In a recent BankThink post, Brockland and her colleague, CFSI President and CEO Jennifer Tescher, wrote: But an end-state that involves innumerable one-off deals between banks and third parties would be a bad outcome for consumers and for the industry as a whole. We need a broader set of industry-wide standards and best practices if we are to arrive at solutions that support consumer choice and innovation. The center has been helping to shape the conversation by publishing a framework on data portability – a principles-based vision for how the industry can come together on data-sharing practices. Without getting into technical specifics, the CFSI sets a clear goal: Make sure the apps consumers depend on to manage their money are spitting out accurate insights. Among the firms that contributed to CFSI’s framework was the data aggregator Finicity, based in Murray, Utah. Nick Thomas, a co-founder and president of the company, said he ultimately wants the industry to unite on a single standard to address what he sees as a big challenge. His vision includes a unification of the DDA and decades-old OFX standards – the latter of which, Thomas readily admits, needs to evolve away from its XML data format. Some, however, say it’s unrealistic to ask most small banks to invest in a spec that promises no revenue right away. “From the bank’s perspective, there is a big lift with no immediate reward,” said William Hockey, a co-founder and chief technology officer of Plaid, a provider of financial technology infrastructure. “You're not always met with open arms. I don’t fault them. But it's a balance, because it's ultimately about what customers want.” The obstacles to coming to a consensus on something that introduces new forms of risk are many. “Standards are a very tough thing to achieve,” said Gartner’s Moyer. John Schulte, the chief information officer at Mercantile Bank of Michigan, is among the bankers in favor of one standard – developed in partnership between banks, the fintech community and other stakeholders. However, his bank offers customers aggregation capabilities; not all banks do. As Schulte sees it, smaller banks that don't offer aggregation and financial health tools are the most threatened and most likely to resist allowing aggregation of their data by outsiders. “The question we have to ask ourselves as community banks is whether we want to own the role of being our customers' partner in managing their financial health/goals, or let others (big banks, fintech, others) fill that gap,” Schulte said. Unlike in Europe, where regulators have directed banks to open up their data to APIs and third parties, the legal motivation for U.S. banks to move quickly on something that costs money is, for now, nebulous. The new Consumer Financial Data Rights lobbying group, for instance, is citing Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act as codifying consumers' right to access their financial data through third-party apps. Whether that’s what Congress intended with the section is a matter of debate. “They are taking what I consider to be an aggressive posture on 1033,” said Brian Knight, a senior research fellow for the financial markets working group at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. As Knight sees it, the language in Section 1033 seems to contemplate a direct relationship between a customer and bank rather than through a third-party app. Further complicating the issue are proposed cybersecurity rules that could put banks in a quandary if separate regulations mandated third-party access. (Currently, the CFPB is in the midst of a request for information on data portability.) “Banks feel torn,” Knight said. " 'One regulator will ding me if I make it too hard to get information. One regulator will ding me if it’s too easy. What do I do?’ " Mary Wisniewski Mary is the deputy editor of the BankThink blog.

Weakness in Europe weighed on the index and it found little support on Wall Street.Lacklustre corporate results gave little reason to investors to push U.S. stocks higher.Chevron (CVX.N) fell 2.5 percent to $113.67 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes."Earnings have really just been fine," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco."They haven't been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think 'fine' might not be enough in the near-term, and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 18.91 points, or 0.09 percent, to 20,082, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 3.62 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,293.06 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.07 points, or 0 percent, to 5,655.24.European shares eased with UBS (UBSG.S) dragging bank stocks lower after posting a drop in full-year profit, while Britain's biggest supermarket, Tesco, surged after a 3.7 billion-pound takeover of a supplier.The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.4 percent at 366.04.The greenback, which has climbed for two straight days from a seven-week low against a basket of major currencies, was buoyed by hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies will further bolster the U.S. economy. Increasing expectations of tax reforms and fiscal stimulus, which support the dollar, are temporarily soothing concerns about Trump's stance on trade protectionism, said Karl Schamotta, director of global product & market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.The dollar retreated a little against a basket of currencies after data showed U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected to 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter but recouped losses to trade up 0.19 at 100.57.The greenback rose to a one-week high of 115.37 against the yen JPY=.The Mexican peso MXN=, which slumped on Thursday after the White House said Trump wants a 20-percent tax on imports from Mexico to pay for a wall on their shared border, strengthened more than 1 percent after the two countries agreed not to talk publicly for now about payment for the wall. In bond markets, U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors reached for U.S. government debt following the disappointing fourth-quarter GDP data.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR was down 2 basis points at 2.486 percent.Oil prices extended losses after data suggested drilling is ramping up in the United States, easing the focus on efforts by OPEC and other producers to support prices by cutting supplies.Brent crude LCOc1 was down 1.64 percent at $55.32 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 was down 1.56 percent at $52.94.Gold was on track for its first weekly loss of the year as persistent dollar strength prompted some traders to cash in on this week's rally to two-month highs. On Friday, spot gold XAU= was little changed at $1,189.81.

After weeks of close calls, the Dow made history on Wednesday by blowing past that key level for the first time ever. The historic milestone leaves the Dow up a stunning 1,667 points since President Donald Trump’s victory in November. The achievement is evidence of how optimistic investors have become about the prospects for the U.S. economy. “The stock market has given him this extraordinary vote of approval. Happy days are here again,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Wall Street is clearly betting that Trump’s plans to slash taxes, ramp up infrastructure spending and cut regulation will make the American economy grow faster. If that happens, without any disruptions to global trade, it could propel corporate profits, the lifeblood of stock prices. But the jump in stocks is also a reflection of the solid economy Trump inherited from former President Obama. The U.S. has added jobs for a record 75 straight months and the unemployment rate is sitting near a 10-year low. The Dow 20,000 milestone also shows how much has changed in the U.S. economy over the past eight years. The index crashed to a low of 6,440 in March 2009 as Wall Street feared a complete collapse of the American financial system. The astounding 13,500-point rise since then has been fueled by a consistent, albeit imperfect, economic recovery combined with the U.S. central bank’s massive stimulus program and near-0% interest rates. While the economic rebound from the Great Recession has been slower than many hoped, the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since 2007 and corporate profits have climbed to record highs. “The economy has come a long way in eight years. Overall, it’s a healthier economy and does justify a much higher stock market than eight years ago,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Few expected the Dow to rise so much, especially after a Trump victory. In fact, many feared a market crash if Trump upset Hillary Clinton. Instead, Wall Street embarked on a very impressive post-election rally that carried the Dow above both the 19,000 and 20,000 levels. But the Trump rally cooled off in recent months and Wall Street hit a bit of a psychological roadblock leading up to the 20,000 level. On January 6, the Dow got incredibly close, rising to 19,999.63 before backing off. Traders on Wall Street had fun with it, with some creating hats that said: Dow Almost 20,000. One reason for the pause: investors want more details on the timing and effectiveness of the stimulus plans rolled out by the new administration. “We’ve scaled this peak. We’re going to enjoy this view for a while and hit the pause button,” said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. Bank stocks have been among the biggest winners during the post-election party on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have soared more than 20%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) is up nearly 30%, as investors bet on higher interest rates and less regulation under Trump. But JPMorgan’s Kelly worries that “markets seem to be pricing in the positives, and not worrying too much about the negatives” such as a potential trade war or fiscal stimulus that overheats the economy. Quinlan agrees that trade remains a serious risk given Trump’s anti-trade rhetoric during the campaign. Already, Trump has scrapped the TPP trade deal and plans to swiftly start renegotiating NAFTA. “We need open borders, open trade and open flow of capital. If we start going down this deglobalization road, this market is going to lose its euphoric underpins pretty quickly,” Quinlan said. Yardeni said the verdict is still out on whether the enthusiasm on Wall Street is overdone. “Is the market irrationally exuberant or will Trump prevail in a way that’s bullish for the economy,” he said. “The bottom line on Trump is: love him or hate him, you don’t want to bet against him.” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Posted 27 Jan 2017 20:15 Updated 28 Jan 2017 05:35 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as the Dow Jones Industrial Average passes the 20,000 mark shortly after the opening of the trading session in New York, U.S., January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks edged lower for a second consecutive session on Friday as some underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data offset recent enthusiasm over policy actions by President Donald Trump. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists and the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter. Chevron fell 2.4 percent to US$113.79 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The S&P energy index , down 0.9 percent, was the worst performing of the 11 major S&P sectors. Starbucks curbed gains on the Nasdaq. Its shares dropped 4.0 percent to US$56.12 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. "The market has rallied on expectations of good things to happen in the future but as we are getting the data that is factual of what is going on, it is not as good as people are hoping," said Andrew Slimmon, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in Chicago. "Which tells you, this earnings recovery that is expected in 2017, a good chunk of it is already baked into the market." Even with some disappointing corporate results, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to show growth of 6.8 percent, which would mark the biggest increase in two years and second straight quarter of growth, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow remained above 20,000 for the third straight day, after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday as the post-election rally reignited. For the week, the Dow rose 1.3 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.9 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.13 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,093.78, the S&P 500 lost 1.99 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,294.69 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,660.78. Microsoft rose 2.3 percent to US$65.78, while Intel gained 1.1 percent to US$37.98 after both reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet lost 1.4 percent to US$845.03 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. Colgate-Palmolive slumped 5.2 percent to US$64.68 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 116 new highs and 26 new lows. About 5.81 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.56 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan had sought up to 16 months in prison for Michael Murgio, a former Palm Beach County School Board member who pleaded guilty in October to obstructing an examination of a credit union linked to the bitcoin exchange. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan instead sentenced Murgio, 66, to one year of probation, a $12,000 fine and 200 hours of community service, saying he was "far less" culpable than his co-defendants and had shown remorse. "None of us are the worst thing we have done in life," Nathan said in court. Prosecutors said bitcoin exchange Coin.mx was operated by one of Murgio's sons, Anthony Murgio, and was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli accused of overseeing a hacking scheme that resulted in information being stolen for more than 100 million people. The companies that were hacked included JPMorgan, which in 2014 disclosed a breach involving records for more than 83 million accounts. The Murgios were not charged in the hacking case. But they and four other men were charged in connection with Coin.mx, which prosecutors said exchanged, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin and was run through a front called "Collectables Club." To evade scrutiny of Florida-based Coin.mx, Anthony Murgio, 33, and others in 2014 acquired control of now-defunct Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, by bribing its chairman, Pastor Trevon Gross, prosecutors said. After the National Credit Union Administration in 2014 deemed Anthony Murgio's board picks ineligible due to their residency, Michael Murgio drafted a letter falsely claiming Collectables Club was based in New Jersey, court papers said. "I wish there was a way to take it back, but there isn't," Michael Murgio said in court on Friday. Anthony Murgio, who cried during his father's sentencing, pleaded guilty on Jan. 9 to charges stemming from Coin.mx's operation. Gross and Yuri Lebedev, who prosecutors say worked on Coin.mx, are scheduled to face trial on Feb. 6. Shalon, who prosecutors said was also involved in stock manipulation schemes and online gambling businesses, has pleaded not guilty. The case is U.S. v. Murgio et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.

General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a bit of a bore, and that’s putting it mildly. In fact, of the thousands of investments available, GE stock is the one I dread analyzing. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the sexy industry, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has the sexy CEO — or so I’ve been told — and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) basically owns sex. General Electric? It has a 3.23% dividend yield — I think you’re getting my drift. Source: Shutterstock That’s not to say that GE stock is irrelevant in the current markets. This week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 20,000 points for the first time in history. Not only is General Electric a component of the Dow 30, it was a strong contributor to the record. GE stock turned in a 1.23% performance against its prior session. The average gains for the Dow-listed companies on the record-breaking day was only 0.6%, which is surprisingly low. In fact, there were only six companies that posted better numbers than GE, and these were the usual suspects. In increasing order, they were International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and standout Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), which ringed up an impressive 4% move. Besides the obvious point that these companies are proudly red, white and blue, it’s easy to see why they performed so well over the others. President Donald Trump has promised fewer regulations stymieing business, more support for the military industrial complex and keeping jobs stateside. General Electric belongs among the titans of American industry; hence, yesterday’s robust gains. But is the recent surge of GE stock based on optimism for President Trump, or a reaction from pronounced volatility? The answer to that question is critical for investors. GE Stock Is Exciting, and That’s Bad! GE has shed its boring image, but for all the wrong reasons. Click to Enlarge While it’s very early into the new year, nevertheless, it’s worth pointing out that shares are down 4%. I should also mention that at this price point, GE stock is firmly below its 50-day moving average, and only a hair above its 200-DMA. I don’t think the volatility should be ignored as a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo. Just a few days ago, General Electric shares were down 6%. More worryingly, traders haven’t pushed the needle that far since GE faltered under the weight of an uninspiring and anemic fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings results. Rightfully, people are concerned. True, GE stock is a reliable investment, making steady gains through all sorts of economic cycles. At the same time, its stable nature can work against the investor if there’s a sharp downfall. It may take an inordinate amount of time for General Electric to gain 10%, but it could be gone in a flash. As an example, GE returned 6% last year — and we’ve basically burned through two-thirds of that profit. I don’t care how high the dividend yields are for General Electric. No one can afford to lose that much capital and justify the losses due to the passive income. Unless GE stock was offering double digits, it’s a bad deal. Of course, the question would then become, why are they offering double digits?

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Wall St little changed as earnings, GDP data disappoint By Reuters Published: 13:04 EST, 27 January 2017 | Updated: 13:05 EST, 27 January 2017 e-mail By Tanya Agrawal Jan 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed on Friday as investors paused after a recent rally following underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists and the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter. Chevron fell 2.2 percent to $113.98 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The Nasdaq was weighed down by Starbucks, whose shares dropped 3.6 percent to $56.34 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. "Earnings have really just been fine," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco. "They haven't been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think fine might not be enough in the near term and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay." However, the Dow stayed above 20,000 for the third straight day, after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday as the post-election rally reignited. All three major indexes were also on track to post weekly gains. Still, investors retreated to a wait-and-see mode as they sought more clarity on President Donald Trump's policies and the new administration's ability to clear legislature hurdles in its quest to reduce regulation and cut taxes. "There's definitely a gap between expectations and reality. I think the new administration has probably until the summer time to show some forward momentum and progress on getting policy changed and implemented through Congress." said Lyon.

Fourth-quarter revenue from foreign exchange, rates and credit trading dropped 12 percent to 341 million francs ($341 million), the bank said Friday. That missed the consensus estimate of 434 million francs, according to a note from JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Kian Abouhossein. The drop was offset by a 22 percent surge in equities revenue to 891 million Swiss francs, which topped estimates on a boost from derivatives trading, Abouhossein said.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter UBS suffered trading losses in its macro business in the volatility surrounding the U.S. election, according to a person with knowledge of the results, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public. That contrasts with the five biggest U.S. investment banks, who said they benefited from market swings -- which included a rally in the dollar and a rise in interest rates -- on their way to posting a 43 percent increase in total debt trading revenue. “We weren’t as well positioned as we obviously ideally would have liked to have been to benefit from the trends in volatility following the U.S. election,” UBS Chief Financial Officer Kirt Gardner said on a call with analysts Friday. “We have very low inventory.” Ceding Share The losses exacerbated UBS’s headwinds from revenue declines in emerging market products and interest-rate options. The 12 percent drop excluded a one-time gain. The bank also said it had a less favorable business mix for activity in the quarter. UBS has pulled back from many bond-trading businesses in recent years to focus on wealth management amid harsher capital rules. Other European banks such as Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc have also ceded share in trading businesses to the big Wall Street lenders, which were faster to take losses and restructure after the financial crisis. “The steepening of curves and the narrowing of credit spreads benefited players that had strong presence in credit markets as well as rates, and in particular structured credit products,” Gardner said. “That benefited two asset classes that we don’t participate in in a very meaningful way. Our business is much more macro- and FX-focused.” To read more about trends in global securities trading, click here UBS’s jump in equities revenue outpaced all of the U.S. firms, which posted a collective 3 percent climb. The stock unit produced two-thirds of the bank’s trading revenue for 2016, whereas the U.S. firms get about two-thirds of their revenue from the bond side. While praising a “strong” equities result, Citigroup Inc. analyst Andrew Coombs highlighted fixed-income revenues were “far weaker than U.S. peers, which management attributed to a stronger fourth quarter 2015 comparison, and lower inventory levels.” As a result Coombs, who has a buy rating on the stock, gave the investment bank a "mixed" grade. Overall the securities unit, led by Andrea Orcel, reported pretax profit rose to 306 million francs from 80 million francs a year earlier, as it benefited from a one-time gain and lower restructuring costs. The unit’s cost-income ratio dropped to 85 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 93 percent a year earlier. For the full year, Orcel cut costs by 4 percent as headcount fell by more than 500 people to 4,734 at the end of December. UBS said Friday it’s on track to reach its cost savings target at the end of this year. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 11:37AM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 11:37AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index slipped on Friday as some heavyweight natural resource stocks weighed, while electronics manufacturer Celestica Inc jumped to a 12-year high. Celestica surged 11.2 per cent to $18.56 after its adjusted earnings beat expectations and it said it would exit the oversupplied solar panel manufacturing market. The energy group retreated 0.8 per cent as oil prices slipped on an increased focus on U.S. production increases that could lessen the impact of an OPEC agreement to reduce supply. TransCanada Corp fell 1.1 per cent to $62.83 as the country’s energy regulator said it would restart from the beginning a hearing into the company’s proposed Energy East pipeline. Fellow pipeline operator Enbridge Inc declined 2.4 per cent to $56.73 after announcing it would pay about $170-million to take private Midcoast Energy Partners LP. At 11:29 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index fell 42.68 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 15,572.68. The index was heading for a 0.6-per-cent gain on the week and is within striking distance of an all-time high hit in 2014. Rogers Communications extended a rally to its highest level since August as investors cheered Thursday’s results that suggested its turnaround was on track. It advanced 1.6 per cent to $56.91. Restaurant Brands International Inc advanced 1.1 per cent to $65.35. The company said it would expand its coffee and doughnut chain, Tim Hortons, into Mexico. Industrials rose 0.1 percent, although plane and train maker Bombardier Inc fell 1.2 per cent to $2.54 as Brazil said Canada had signaled a willingness to negotiate to resolve a feud over government support that threatens to turn into an international trade dispute. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, gained 0.6 per cent. However, Potash Corp and Agrium Inc both fell 1.6 per cent. The companies, which plan to merge by mid-2017 to cut costs, are struggling with the deepest slump in a decade for the oversupplied potash fertilizer market. Five of the index’s 10 main groups were in negative territory. Wall Street was slightly lower on Friday, weighed down by underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists. Chevron fell 2 per cent to $114.21 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts’ expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. Starbucks dropped 4 per cent to $56.12 after the world’s biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. The stock weighed the most on the Nasdaq. “Earnings have really just been fine,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco. “They haven’t been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think fine might not be enough in the near term and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay.” However, the Dow stayed above 20,000 for the third straight day after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday, helped by the reignition of the post-election rally earlier this week. All three major indexes were also on track to post weekly gains. Still, investors retreated to a wait-and-see mode as they sought more clarity on President Donald Trump’s policies and the new administration’s ability to clear legislature hurdles in its quest to reduce regulation and cut taxes. “There’s definitely a gap between expectations and reality. I think the new administration has probably until the summer time to show some forward momentum and progress on getting policy changed and implemented through Congress.” said Lyon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 18.56 points, or 0.09 per cent, at 20,082.35. The S&P 500 was down 3.39 points, or 0.14 per cent, at 2,293.29. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.63 points, or 0.03 per cent, at 5,653.55. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index’s 0.77-per-cent fall leading the decliners. Microsoft rose 2.1 per cent to $65.59, while Intel gained 1.8 per cent to $38.24 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet was down 0.4 per cent at $853.40 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates. Colgate-Palmolive fell 6.8 per cent to $63.59 after the personal products maker’s fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Oil prices slipped on Friday, giving up gains from earlier in the day, as the market shifted its focus towards production increases in the United States and away from efforts by OPEC and other producers to support prices by cutting supplies. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading at $55.56 per barrel at 10:43 a.m. EST (1543 GMT), down 68 cents from their previous close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at 53.25 a barrel, down 53 cents. U.S. crude is poised to gain nearly 2 percent on the week. “We’re in a holding pattern at this point in time,” said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Private Client Group. “Supply is a big factor right now and you have the U.S. really filling that gap that OPEC has left open.” Prices had risen during Asian trading, though activity was thin due to the start of the Lunar New Year holiday in much of that region, including China and Singapore. During U.S. trading, the market pulled back as traders brace for another potential uptick in U.S. production when the Baker Hughes rig count data is released at 1 p.m. EST. Growing domestic production is expected to offset proposed global cuts. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 to relieve a two-year supply overhang. But U.S. oil production has been rising, with the International Energy Agency forecasting total U.S. output growth of 320,000 bpd in 2017 to an average of 12.8 million bpd. Analysts said investors who bet on rising prices were taking profit in advance of U.S. rig count data due later in the day from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, which could signal further increases in U.S. production. Oil research firm PetroMatrix said the rig count data, “will be a weekend risk as another surge will negatively impact the start of next week.” There were fundamental factors that impacted prices this week, such as gains in Iran’s monthly oil exports in February and resilient production in Libya. A glitch in North Sea Buzzard crude production provided support. But market participants warned of more volatility ahead as speculators react to even small developments in the physical markets. “Given that speculative net long positions in Brent and WTI are already at a record-high level, the correction potential is therefore growing all the time,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said in a note.

McAdams May 16, 2016 A Twitter Tribute to Holocaust Victims Candice Norwood Jan 27, 2017 Bourree Lam Jan 26, 2017 Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Economists studying women and work have consistently cited career interruptions as a one of the main reason that a variety of workplace inequalities persist—from long-term pay penalties for dropping out, to missing promotions that would (theoretically) put women in leadership positions. In fact, the gender pay gap is the most dire for married women. And while the overall pay gap has been slowly closing for decades, the motherhood penalty—whereby women with children experience wage penalties that women without children and men don’t—has not diminished over time. The term “off-ramping” is used to describe women who are voluntarily leaving their job for an extended amount of time. In a 2015 survey from Pew Research, nearly 40 percent of women with children reported taking a significant amount of time off work, and 27 percent reported quitting their jobs for responsibilities at home. And for these women, the “on ramps” can be hard to locate when they’re ready to rejoin the workforce. “I guess I had always just expected in my head that I would finish up to a certain point with my children, and then go back to work. When that time came, it was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be,” said Lisa Stephens, who left the workforce in 1992. Stephens had worked at IBM in the software department, and decided to stay home to raise her two sons. Twenty years later, Stephens wanted to go back to work and started strategizing how she could make that happen. She took courses online on software development, and started to pursue an advanced degree, but wasn’t seeing much interest from employers. Her break came in the form of an internship designed specifically for women who had taken career breaks with the data company Return Path. Stephens was part of the inaugural class or a 20-week paid “return internship” at the company, and was hired on full-time as a software engineer at the conclusion of the internship. The term returnship was coined (and trademarked) by Goldman Sachs in 2008, when the investment bank started a 10-week program for women and men with career gaps who were looking to get back to full-time work. Since then, the returnship has gained momentum in the banking sector. Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan all have work re-entry programs, and last year General Motors added one as well. A group of companies in the tech sector have also joined the endeavor, led by Path Forward, a non-profit that Return Path created last year. While return internship options are largely available for only white-collar jobs at the moment, it’s this population of professional women who tend to marry husbands with enough income to afford becoming a single-earner household while women in lower-paying jobs cannot afford to drop out. There’s evidence that the success rate post-internship has been high: At the conclusion of the program, GM extended full-time offers to nine participants. The program at Goldman is similarly popular: The program sees hundreds of applications every year for the 20 to 30 spots available, and the company reports that about half of the returnship program participants now work at the company full-time. While promising, these re-entry programs are only part of the solution. The programs are small in size, in white-collar sectors, and demand outstrips actual positions. For example, GM’s Take-2 career re-entry program had 400 applicants competing for 10 internships. Tami Forman, the executive director of Path Forward, says she sees reentry programs as a step toward helping women get back to work. Forman says that for tech companies struggling with diversity and competing for talent, these programs make business sense because it taps into a population of highly qualified women. Currently, Path Forward works with 20 companies, including PayPal, Instacart, and Quantcast on return-to-work programs. “What I think is also going to start to happen is as these companies see success with this model, they will grow that program over time and see that they can find great people who they want to hire and keep and who become really amazing employees,” said Forman. But the question that remains is whether a woman with significant work experience would be interested in an internship instead of a full-time job—and if that’s her best option. That it’s even a consideration points to how difficult it can be to re-enter to workforce after a significant break, as well as how hard it is to find employers who will hire professional women with resume gaps. “For a woman who’s been out for 15 years, it is a welcomed opportunity,” says Jennifer Gefsky, the co-founder of Après, a networking site for women with gaps in their resumes that boasts 20,000 members. Gefsky says that the women on Après have generally been out of the workforce for around two years, and 41 percent says they intend to return full-time. “There is not this message coming from corporate America saying ‘we want women who have gaps in their resumes.’ They don’t really think like that,” says Gefsky. “The more examples we can show of successful returners, the easier it is for companies to feel like they’re not taking a huge leap of faith.” Gefsky, who was the deputy general counsel for Major League Baseball before she took a career break, says that confidence is big part of the issue. She argues that return internship program helps women who have dropped out feel less isolated, with networking and job training helping to build confidence—the latter of which is particularly important since there’s an established confidence gap between men and women, which is exacerbated by dropping out of the workforce. “There’s so much fear factor,” says Gefsky. “I think it’s essential for women who are returning to work to network with one another. It makes the process easier, and the process is not easy. There will be rejection and it will take time. It can be scary.” For Stephens, the internship was exciting and validating. But she also she felt unsure about whether it would jump-start her career. “Would that internship have been enough to have other employers take me seriously as a candidate? I still don’t know the answer to that. After being out for 20 years, would three months be enough?” reflects Stephens. On the part of the companies, Forman says that it’s crucial to address these concerns by providing training and work that actually fill the resume gap. “The return internship needs to produce mission-critical work for the company,” explains Forman. For these programs to work for both parties, the company needs assign “real work” so to speak in order to reap value from the return internship. In turn, this aspect is important for the participants as well. Forman explains that doing real work, and not busy work often associated with post-college internships, is what helps women returning to the workforce to update her resume with relevant experience. Further, Forman says that companies shouldn’t feel like they’re getting a discount. Once returnship interns become employees, they should be compensated at the same rate as others in the same job function. Of course, another part of the solution is to make sure that the off-ramps don’t turn into dead ends. Forman says that in addition to return internships, better paid-leave policies and measures to ensure that women return to the workforce faster can help. According to research by economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn at Cornell University, the U.S. has fallen far behind other OECD countries in female labor-force participation in the last decade as other countries embraced and expanded family-friendly workplace policies. (On the flip side, however, they speculated that generous leave mandates could lead to women taking longer leaves, and employers discriminating women for high-level positions in anticipation that they’ll drop out.) For women who return to the workforce via return internships, Forman says most don’t mind starting off in a temporary, intern position, “What they want is to get back and be able to be productive and accomplish things again.” With the rise of return internships, there’s at least some hope that employers are taking note of just how serious the need to support women in the workplace is, as well as how they can create better incentives and policies that keep women in the workforce long-term.

Twitter Email Most Popular Presented by Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP How Trump’s Executive Orders Could Set America Back 70 Years Jeremi Suri The president is taking the United States back to the nightmares of the world before the Second World War: closed borders, limited trade, and a go-it-alone national race to the bottom. Despite all the lies and distortions, President Donald Trump has spent his first week in office assembling a coherent and well-planned framework for foreign policy. It is hiding in plain sight—frequently missed in the storm of tweets and the attacks on domestic enemies. Read as a whole and in detail, with attention to their larger single-minded purpose, Trump’s executive orders are the blueprints for the most significant shift in American foreign policy since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The latest drafts of executive orders, several of which the president will reportedly sign Friday at the Pentagon, are bold and breathtaking in their reach. They are strategic and transformative. They are also poised to destroy the foundations for the last 70 years of American-led peace and prosperity. The orders question the very ideas of cooperation and democracy, embodying an aggressive commitment to “America First” above all else. So much for the “defense of the free world,” and the “march of freedom”—obvious soft-headed “loser” ideas for the new team of White House cynics.

She is not in need of the sympathy. Did you see the gif? The one that features Melania Trump, the newly installed first lady of the United States, radiantly smiling as her husband gazes upon her … and then, as he turns away, allowing the grin to melt into a frown? Grin-grimace, grin-grimace, grin-grimace, looping into eternity. Call it a Kinsley gif: The image seemed to reveal, in its frozen fluidity, an unspoken truth—about Melania, about her marriage, about all of us. During a time of Much News, it quickly became conversation fodder. Slate offered “A Detailed Forensic Analysis of Melania Trump’s Creepy, Devastating Inauguration Smile/Frown.” Jezebel shared it with the sardonic declaration that “Melania Trump Definitely Loves Her Husband and Is Very Happy to Be Here.” New York magazine did a fact-check of the video the gif came from to assure us, finally, that “That Awkward Clip of Donald and Melania at the Inauguration Is Definitely Real.” (Snopes agreed, but warned that the video is inconclusive when it comes to its ability to reveal Melania’s emotions.) #FreeMelania trended. Continue Reading Lenny Ignelzi / AP Which Christians Are Telling Donald Trump to Keep Out Refugees? Emma Green Many religious groups have urged the president not to give Christians priority in seeking asylum, but some conservative political organizations back his new policy. President Trump has signed an executive order that temporarily suspends the U.S. refugee program and bars Syrian refugees. It will likely suspend immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries and bars the admission of anyone who engages in “acts of bigotry or hatred,” including “the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own.” It also allows the the secretaries of State and Homeland Security to jointly admit individuals on a case-by-case basis, “including when the person is a religious minority ... facing religious persecution.” In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday, Trump clarified what this means: Christians refugees will be given priority status. “They’ve been horribly treated,” the president said. “Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible.” People overseas “were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians,” he added, “so we are going to help them.” Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Bettman / Getty A Twitter Tribute to Holocaust Victims Candice Norwood A new social-media project commemorates refugees turned away by the United States in 1939. Software developer Russel Neiss and Rabbi Charlie Schwartz have collaborated on a number of projects that use technology to bring awareness to Jewish issues, history, and culture. But last night they dreamt up the St. Louis Manifest, a Twitter project sharing the story of some 900 Jews who fled Nazi Germany in 1939 on the MS St. Louis in an attempt to gain entry into the United States. After being turned way, the passengers were forced to return to Europe, where a number of countries accepted them as refugees; 254 of them were killed in the Holocaust. This story, Neiss and Schwartz believe, serves as a fitting tribute to International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Friday, and a reminder of a time in American history when the country closed its doors to refugees. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters What Does the Billionaire Family Backing Donald Trump Really Want? Rosie Gray The Mercers are enjoying more influence than ever with their candidate in the White House—but no one seems to know how they intend to use it. She owns a cookie store. He loves model trains. They both hate the Clintons. And beyond that, not much is clear about the motivations of the Mercer father-daughter duo of Republican megadonors who have become two of the most powerful people in the country over the last 18 months. Hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah were among the earliest and strongest backers of Donald Trump while other elite donors still disdained him. It turned out to be a good investment. But now, with their favored candidate freshly installed as president of the United States, it remains unclear what they believe, or what they hope their investment will yield. The Mercers have been a quiet but constant presence in the background of Republican politics since the beginning of the 2016 cycle. They started the campaign as backers of Ted Cruz, pouring millions into one of the main super PACs supporting his candidacy. Their data firm, Cambridge Analytica, was hired by the Cruz campaign. They switched to support Trump shortly after he clinched the nomination, and he eventually hired Cambridge Analytica, as well. Their top political guru is Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart News chairman and White House chief strategist. They’re close, too, with Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who also has a senior role in the White House. They never speak to the press and hardly ever even release a public statement. Like Trump himself, they’ve flouted the standard playbook for how things are done in politics. Continue Reading Stoyan Nenov / Reuters The Coldhearted Folly of Trump's Proposed Immigration Order Graeme Wood The countries likely affected are not those whose nationals have actually perpetrated the most ghastly attacks on Western targets. When I first started talking to ISIS propagandists and supporters, I was much impressed by one of their favorite Koranic verses: “We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein.” The verse is a reminder of God’s omnipresence, and his Santa Claus-like awareness of our deepest selves, our sins, and our good deeds. In time, I came to associate that unsettling proximity (He is closer than you think) not only with God, but also with ISIS. They too were less distant than they seemed. What seemed at first like a movement of barbarians with alien origins and impulses looked increasingly like a human phenomenon, with human flaws and virtues (mostly flaws). The more I investigated the group’s supporters, the more I found people who at one point had shared my culture and community, even if they tried to throw it all away in the service of something wicked. In the end I discovered that one of the most important figures in the Islamic State, a mysterious ideologue named Yahya Abu Hassan, was not Syrian or Iraqi at all, but a 33-year-old American, a dope-smoking theological prodigy from my own hometown.

It’s a little before 3 p.m. on a sunny Friday afternoon and Laugardalur Park, near central Reykjavik, looks practically deserted. There’s an occasional adult with a stroller, but the park’s surrounded by apartment blocks and houses, and school’s out—so where are all the kids? Walking with me are Gudberg Jónsson, a local psychologist, and Harvey Milkman, an American psychology professor who teaches for part of the year at Reykjavik University. Twenty years ago, says Gudberg, Icelandic teens were among the heaviest-drinking youths in Europe. “You couldn’t walk the streets in downtown Reykjavik on a Friday night because it felt unsafe,” adds Milkman. “There were hordes of teenagers getting in-your-face drunk.” Continue Reading Jon Woo / Reuters Can the U.S. Military Compete With China’s Rooster-Dancing Capabilities? Uri Friedman Behold the awesome power of the People’s Liberation Army. The Chinese government clearly received the message when Donald Trump pledged to not only rebuild the U.S. military, but also show it off with parades down Pennsylvania Avenue and flyovers of New York City. In response, Beijing has sent America’s new president a signal that it too can play that game. That signal comes in the form of a rooster, which, in Chinese astrology, is associated with people who are hardworking, supremely confident, and demanding of attention. In marking the dawn of each new day, one Chinese scholar observes, roosters are in charge of “time.” The Chinese government’s point—at a time of serious tensions between the world powers over trade, Taiwan, and the South China Sea—is unambiguous: Trump may want to Make America Great Again, but the coming century belongs to China, not America. Continue Reading Ian Allen My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next In the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was.

By Arliss Coates @ Econsultancy 0 comments As we approach the early 2017 launch date of Zelle, an inter-bank peer-to-peer payment system a la Paypal and Venmo, online banking customers remain unaware of the coming feature. It could be that banking is about to take a major and disruptive step toward digital, but how are digital transactors supposed to catch on to Zelle without a prior marketing campaign? Though it was in August of 2016 that the Wall Street Journal first broke word of the banks' coming "Venmo-killer," spasmodic coverage by a few publications in August and October has slackened to total media silence in the time since. My own cursory quizzing of colleagues and tech-savvy friends on the existence of Zelle mostly confirms what one might expect: no one has heard of this thing. As advertising in American banking goes, Zelle's understated introduction to the world is a definite departure from the norm; JPMorganChase, promoting a payment feature much like Zelle, though exclusively for Chase customers, launched a sweepstakes to promote awareness, while Bank of America takes care to promote the updates to its mobile app with large red letters on the BoA homepage. As TechCrunch reported in October, the current list of banks enrolled in the Zelle program includes the United States' four largest - JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup - as well as Ally Bank, BB&T, BECU, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, FirstBank, First Tech Federal Credit Union, Frost Bank, Morgan Stanley, PNC, USAA, and U.S. Bank. That's an impressive lineup! But more importantly, most Venmo users don't know why Venmo needs fixing. As it happens, the near ubiquitous app has two major security problems: Account theft Venmo is an app, and apps live on phones. Because users often leave themselves logged into Venmo, fortunate phone thieves sometimes find themselves in possession of more than just an expensive device. Worse still, Venmo users who connect their credit cards, debit cards and/or routing numbers to the app may find themselves robbed of larger sums than just their Venmo balances. Cases like that of Chris Grey, a New York web developer who discovered the theft of $2,850 from his routing number-linked Venmo account, should give pause to those looking for easier ways to transact from their mobile phones. The bogus check method As others have pointed out, Venmo is not instantaneous, though it would like you to believe that it is.   Its "so-and-so has paid you x for y" message leads many to believe that transactions performed through the app move money the moment a user presses the pay button. In fact, Venmo transactions take a couple of days to process, and are therefore more similar to checks than to QuickPay systems like the one Chase bank provides its customers for intra-bank use. Taking advantage of this common misunderstanding of Venmo's operating procedure, fraudsters cheat vendors the same way one would with a bogus check. The practice of "paying" for a service, receiving the service, and then cancelling payment before the transaction can be processed is the reason Venmo encourages users to limit their use of the app to transferring funds between friends, relatives, and trusted acquiantances. What Zelle's pitch should be By being a non third-party service, Zelle largely solves the former problem, and by being truly instantaneous in its transactions, completely solves the latter. It's hard to see how adopting Zelle wouldn't be a good idea. This makes the decision by Zelle's backers not to inform the public of Venmo's flaws through an information campaign an odd one. The PayPal-owned app already defends itself from a position of strength, enjoying a good amount of brand loyalty from its users, as Fortune points out. Furthermore, Venmo's customer base is millennial. Even without millennial antipathy to the banking sector, the 18-40 year old market is notoriously tough to win over. Digital marketers, take note - it will be an instruction to watch how this banking alliance tackles a tough set of marketing problems after a bad start.

Whether it’s using financial management apps like Mint or Albert to track their spending or relying on Digit to help them set aside savings, Americans have grown accustomed to real-time access to their financial information. Gone are the days of waiting 30 days for the next bank statement or keeping a shoebox full of receipts. The growing popularity of these digital tools has raised questions from both bankers and policymakers about the technology that powers them. In the fall of 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that several major financial institutions temporarily shut off access to third-party data aggregators. The banks claimed the aggregators put customers’ bank accounts at risk and created unpredictable, and sometimes unmanageable, loads on banks’ servers. In response to these and similar reports, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, citing its authority under Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, issued a Request for Information in October to better understand how data aggregation technology works and what the benefits — and risks — are for consumers. Thus far, much of the focus in the debate has been on the risks of using consumers’ login credentials to collect their data from their bank accounts (a method often referred to as screen scraping). Most seem to agree that the industry needs to move toward more secure solutions. Increasingly, banks are developing application programming interfaces to make their customers’ data available to third parties, either on open platforms or through one-on-one relationships with data aggregators or specific apps. The latest example is the data-sharing agreement between JPMorgan Chase and Intuit – an agreement that enables users of Intuit products to authorize the bank to share their financial information without providing their bank login credentials. Last summer, a similar deal was announced by Wells Fargo and the accounting software provider Xero. Many more deals are likely in the works. This trend holds promise for consumers and for the data-sharing ecosystem. Direct data feeds via APIs can be more reliable and secure than other methods of data access, collection and transmission. But an end-state that involves innumerable one-off deals between banks and third parties would be a bad outcome for consumers and for the industry as a whole. We need a broader set of industrywide standards and best practices if we are to arrive at solutions that support consumer choice and innovation. Consumers benefit from having a choice of financial providers — and this includes both their banking relationships and the apps they use to manage their financial lives. Yet consumer choice is severely limited when smaller institutions, like community banks or credit unions, can’t connect with digital tools like Mint or Digit. Today, screen scraping is the only technology that enables all of the thousands of small financial institutions to participate in the data-sharing ecosystem. Most small institutions lack the resources to invest in developing APIs or negotiate individual deals with countless fintech apps. Industrywide collaboration is needed to develop solutions that are inclusive of smaller financial institutions and their customers. Without broader industry coordination around standards and best practices, consumer choice suffers in another way. Having to code to numerous banks’ API specifications and negotiate individually with each of the companies would be a nearly impossible task for a young startup. Of course, banks have a significant interest in ensuring that the third parties accessing their systems are legitimate actors that have the technical and operational capacity to keep customer data safe. There is likely a role for vetting and certification of trusted actors in the ecosystem. But there are clear benefits to innovation, and ultimately to consumer choice, when there are common standards and protocols available to anyone with a new product idea. These are thorny issues, but they are not insurmountable. The industry can come together to develop shared standards and protocols that will lead to greater transparency, trust and inclusiveness in the system. The Center for Financial Services Innovation has proposed a set of consumer-focused principles for data sharing that provides a starting point. Data aggregators likely have an important role to play as intermediaries between banks and third-party apps, particularly when it comes to vetting. With its authority under Section 1033, the CFPB can also play a constructive role through principles-based guidance that ensures consumers’ interests are at the center of any proposed solution. In today’s increasingly digital world, having access to all of one’s financial data in one place is no longer a nice-to-have. What’s more, consumers need to trust that their data is up-to-date, accurate and complete (not to mention that it’s secure) when making financial decisions based on an app’s recommendation. The industry needs to come together to ensure that this is the rule. Jennifer Tescher Jennifer Tescher is president and CEO of Center for Financial Services Innovation.

News Business Business News Nigeria seizes $1.2bn oil field and announces prosecution of Shell and Eni for alleged corruption Court says Anglo-Dutch company, along with Italy's Eni bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" Michelle Faul Friday 27 January 2017 17:06 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The Nigerian government says it only received $210m from the deal with the rest of the money appropriated by a corrupt official Reuters Nigeria is seizing back one of Africa's richest oil blocs and will prosecute petroleum giants Shell and Eni in a $1.2 billion corruption scandal that has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and Holland, according to a Nigerian Federal High Court document. The court on Thursday ceded control of Oil Prospecting Licence 245 to the government while the West African country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the "Malabu Oil scam," according to a statement from the commission. The commission's petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip — now Eni — bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the $1.2bn payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe. The state oil company got only $210m from the deal. Read more Nigeria's Borno region faces world's worst food crisis, Unicef warns The government is preparing further charges of "conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money-laundering" against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges already have been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. Read more Shell pays out bumper £11.1bn dividends in 2016 thanks to Brexit Shell to tie executive bonuses to climate goals Shell says oil demand could peak in five years "This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense," said Simon Taylor of the anti-corruption body Global Witness. "Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do backdoor deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price." Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini told The Associated Press. "Eni denies any wrongdoing," he said. Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan said he had no comment. The oil companies paid the $1.2bn into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, and former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorised its distribution. The commission last month filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar.

The Dow’s gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. “Earnings have come in strong, for sure,” said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don’t go up or down in a straight line.” The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,375.60. It’s been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration’s policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator’s stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. New Commerce Department data indicating sales of new U.S. homes fell 10.4 percent in December didn’t weigh on PulteGroup. The homebuilder’s quarterly earnings and sales beat financial analysts’ estimates, lifting its shares 74 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $21.18. United Rentals led the gainers in the S&P 500. The equipment rentals company announced it would acquire construction company NES Rentals for $965 million. United Rentals vaulted $12.80, or 11.2 percent, to $127.06. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel’s latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99. Investors also were put off by McKesson’s fiscal third-quarter results, which were hurt by weaker-than-expected prices. McKesson lost $12.55, or 8.3 percent, to $138.55. Whirlpool tumbled 8.5 percent after the appliance maker said Britain’s impending departure from the European Union hurt its profits. The stock fell $16.26 to $173.94. Beyond the ongoing wave of company earnings reports, investors will be looking Friday to a key gauge of the U.S. economy’s health when the Commerce Department delivers its estimate of what the nation’s gross domestic product was in the final quarter of 2016. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Thursday. Germany’s DAX rose 0.4 percent, while the CAC-40 in France slipped 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was flat. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged 1.8 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.8 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 1.4 percent. Markets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and other Asian countries are about to begin holidays of varying lengths to mark the lunar new year, curtailing trading across much of the region. Bond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 2.50 percent from 2.52 percent late Wednesday. The dollar increased to 114.42 yen from 113.60 on Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.0692 from $1.0743. Energy prices moved broadly higher. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.03, or 2 percent, to close at $53.78 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.16, or 2.1 percent, to close at $56.24 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.54 a gallon, while heating oil added 3 cents to $1.64 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.38 per 1,000 cubic feet. In other commodity trading, the price of gold fell $8, or 0.7 percent, to $1,189.80 an ounce. Silver slid 13 cents to $16.85 an ounce. Copper gave up 4 cents to $2.67 a pound.     Tags: percent, earnings, company, index, cents, stock, Other stories from today: Indexes drift down; Dow ekes out gain PayPal meets 4Q profit forecasts How did the Dow get to 20,000?

(TSLA) Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) (BK) Cut to Hold at Zacks Investment Research January 27th, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Latisha Jones Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet Zacks Investment Research cut shares of Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) (NYSE:BK) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research note published on Tuesday. According to Zacks, “BNY Mellon's shares underperformed the Zacks categorized Major Regional Banks industry, over the last one year. However, strong fundamentals should help the stock perform better in the coming days. Moreover, the company’s fourth-quarter 2016 earnings improved year over year, driven by a rise in total revenue along with lower expenses. The company’s cost-saving initiatives along with improving revenues should further support profitability in the long run. Also, the gradual ease in margins is expected to support top-line in the quarters ahead. Nonetheless, BNY Mellon is largely dependent on fee income as a source of revenue. This is likely to create concentration risks, thereby affecting its financial position. Also, the adverse impact of various financial reform laws on profitability remains a key concern for the company.” BK has been the subject of several other research reports.

Problem is, the VIX is tied to the US S&P500 index. Take a step back to look at the global picture, and the early days of 2017 are showing elevated jumpiness similar to that seen in the past two years. Emerging-market currencies lead the pack, illustrating both the dangers and potential returns from investing in assets ranging from Egypt’s pound to China’s yuan. An investigation into price fluctuations across financial markets over the past two decades by Bloomberg shows how the beginnings of the past two years have had the biggest volatility since 2009, when the world was reeling from the Lehman shock and the money market breakdown it unleashed. Volatility is likely to trend higher through the course of the year as markets react to a range of unknowns, not least the impact of US. President Donald Trump’s agenda, observers say. Economic policy structures are being reshaped in ways unseen perhaps since before World War II, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists said in putting a premium on liquidity in new US stock portfolios. “I don’t think investors have really felt like volatility is falling relative to the last couple of years,” Stuart Rumble, investment director with the multi-asset team at Fidelity International, said in a phone interview from Hong Kong. “We’ve seen such a dominant trend over the last couple of months in markets, as investors have been positioning for economic growth and higher inflation following the US election.” Looking at 250 assets across market classes that include equities, sovereign bonds and commodities, eight currencies were volatility outliers based on their year-to-date price swings, or Z-scores, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Jan. 20. A Z-score is a normalised measure based on price standard deviation, which gauges a security’s moves compared with a longer-term average (1997 to 2017). For all the disruptions Trump has brought to long-standing US policies and practices “- from trade to regulation “- this month is still somewhat less volatile than the past two Januaries. Markets were roiled by confusion over China’s currency tactics and stock slide at the start of 2016 and by Switzerland’s surprise removal of a cap on the franc in early 2015. Three weeks into 2016, there were 19 outliers: 16 currencies and three benchmark equity indexes. At the same stage in 2015, there were 10. That followed a five-year period of relative calm preceded by an eye-popping 53 outliers at the start of 2009. The Egyptian pound shows up as the most volatile asset in the study’s universe so far this year. With a Z-score of 4.15, it has been more than twice as volatile as the digital currency bitcoin and six times more jumpy than the Bloomberg Dollar Index. To be classified as an outlier in this study, an asset needs an absolute Z-score of 2.575 or more, which means its movements have less than a 1 per cent chance of happening. The greater the score, the greater the volatility. Looking just at the commodity sphere, lean hog futures posted a Z-score of 1.86, making them the most volatile in that group. Hogs also led the commodity herd in early 2013 and 2015. While a global sell-off in bonds since Trump’s presidential election victory spurred some to call the end of a three-decade bull run in debt, sovereign securities don’t stand out as volatile based on their Z-score calculations. On the policy front, one danger for investors to be aware of is that, unlike in past years, central banks may not be the security blanket during times of volatility that they have been. “Investors can no longer anticipate that automatic response of additional monetary policy when economies or markets take a downturn,” Rumble said. “That’s really what’s different going forward over the next several years, and it means when we see those key risk events, we could see some shock and volatility.” More from Markets Wall Street slightly lower at open Yes Bank turns Rana Kapoor into billionaire Stock research moves past PDFs Bunds set for worst week since US election Gold posts longest slump of 2017 US stock indexes edge higher in early trading Qatar Investment Fund Q4 NAV falls Credit Suisse stays overweight on UAE indices tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNDonald Trump follow this tag on MGNSwitzerland follow this tag on MGNChina follow this tag on MGNEgypt follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsMarkets tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDonald Trump follow this tag on MGN+ MGNSwitzerland follow this tag on MGN+ MGNChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGNEgypt follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In MarketsWall Street slightly lower at open Business Gallery Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Highlights: Detroit Auto Show Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Stock Look Up Search Latest share prices Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Gold hits 2-month high on Trump uncertainty 02UAE markets to remain closed on Sunday 03Trump trade talk fuels yen rally Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Inside Emirates airline's engineering hangar Sep 20, 2015 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 20Images Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Jan 18, 2017 9Images Pictures: Mohammad Bin Zayed in Mumbai Feb 13, 2016 34Images Dubai Shopping Festival 2012 in pictures Jan 31, 2012 10Images LG unveils flagship V20 smartphone Sep 07, 2016 Markets International Commodity Prices Error - No Data As on 2017-01-28 11:30:28 Most Popular on Gulf News Mohammad concludes three-day India visit No visa-free facility for Indians here...

AP Photo/Mark Lennihan Hong Kong - The world's most famous measure of volatility in financial markets is flashing a sign akin to boredom — languishing around levels that prevailed before the global crisis. Problem is, the VIX is tied to the US S&P 500 index. Take a step back to look at the global picture, and the early days of 2017 are showing elevated jumpiness similar to that seen in the past two years.  Emerging-market currencies lead the pack, illustrating both the dangers and potential returns from investing in assets ranging from Egypt's pound to China's yuan. An investigation into price fluctuations across financial markets over the past two decades by Bloomberg shows how the beginnings of the past two years have had the biggest volatility since 2009, when the world was reeling from the Lehman shock and the money-market breakdown it unleashed. Volatility is likely to trend higher through the course of the year as markets react to a range of unknowns, not least the impact of US President Donald Trump's agenda, observers say. Economic policy structures are being reshaped in ways unseen perhaps since before World War II, JPMorgan Chase & Co strategists said in putting a premium on liquidity in new US stock portfolios. "I don't think investors have really felt like volatility is falling relative to the last couple of years," Stuart Rumble, investment director with the multi-asset team at Fidelity International, said in a phone interview from Hong Kong. "We've seen such a dominant trend over the last couple of months in markets, as investors have been positioning for economic growth and higher inflation following the US election."Looking at 250 assets across market classes that include equities, sovereign bonds and commodities, eight currencies were volatility outliers based on their year-to-date price swings, or Z-scores, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Jan. 20. A Z-score is a normalized measure based on price standard deviation, which gauges a security's moves compared with a longer-term average (1997 to 2017).  For all the disruptions Trump has brought to longstanding US policies and practices — from trade to regulation — this month is still somewhat less volatile than the past two Januaries. Markets were roiled by confusion over China's currency tactics and stock slide at the start of 2016 and by Switzerland's surprise removal of a cap on the franc in early 2015. Three weeks into 2016, there were 19 outliers: 16 currencies and three benchmark equity indexes. At the same stage in 2015, there were 10. That followed a five-year period of relative calm preceded by an eye-popping 53 outliers at the start of 2009.  The Egyptian pound shows up as the most volatile asset in the study's universe so far this year. With a Z-score of 4.15, it has been more than twice as volatile as the digital currency bitcoin and six times more jumpy than the Bloomberg Dollar Index. To be classified as an outlier in this study, an asset needs an absolute Z-score of 2.575 or more, which means its movements have less than a 1 percent chance of happening. The greater the score, the greater the volatility.  Looking just at the commodity sphere, lean hog futures posted a Z-score of 1.86, making them the most volatile in that group. Hogs also led the commodity herd in early 2013 and 2015. Argentina's Merval Index, which hit a record high this week, is the most volatile of equity indices for the second year in a row. It had a z-score of  1.84 this year and 3.62 in the first three weeks of 2016, shortly after new president Mauricio Macri let the peso float freely. While a global selloff in bonds since Trump's presidential election victory spurred some to call the end of a three-decade bull run in debt, sovereign securities don't stand out as volatile based on their Z-score calculations. On the policy front, one danger for investors to be aware of is that, unlike in past years, central banks may not be the security blanket during times of volatility that they have been. "Investors can no longer anticipate that automatic response of additional monetary policy when economies or markets take a downturn," Rumble said. "That's really what's different going forward over the next several years, and it means when we see those key risk events, we could see some shock and volatility."

This issue marks the successful debut of Jain Irrigation in the US dollar bond market, it said. The notes are proposed to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. “The proceeds from the issuance will be used to repay existing third—party indebtedness and for general corporate purposes,” Jain Irrigation said. The offering is scheduled to close on February 1, 2017. Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan acted as joint global coordinators, and Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Barclays, Nomura and Rabobank were joint bookrunners. The company’s Netherland—based wholly—owned subsidiary Jain International Trading BV will issue the bonds. Jain Irrigation Systems MD Anil Jain said: “We are pleased on the successful outcome of this transaction which is testimony to our business model. “The transaction also is a reflection of our ability to raise funds from international bond markets... The initiative is reflective of our continual efforts to diversify our investor base and reduce our financing costs.” The Jalgaon—based Jain Irrigation is into manufacturing of micro—irrigation systems, PVC and HDPE pipes, plastic sheets, agro—processed products, renewable energy solutions, tissue culture plants, financial services and other agricultural inputs for the past 34 years.

Image: wk1003mike/Shutterstock As phishing attacks have risen, so too has the backing of email security start-ups. In 2006, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe introduced Data Protection Day to the calendar, marking out 28 January as a day to raise awareness of data protection and inform citizens of their rights and of good practices. While this kind of awareness campaigning can inform users on why and how their personal data is managed and processed by faceless software programmes, data awareness must also take into account the responsibility of the user in protecting information. This is most apparent in the case of phishing scams, which have been the undoing of many a massive corporation and political organisation in recent times. User awareness will help the cause of data protection, but human error will always pose a risk. And so, to counter the rampant scamming, we can turn to security software to help. This month, 10 email security start-ups were singled out by CB Insights as ‘ones to watch in 2017’. The shortlist was derived from CB Insights data and a predictive algorithm called Mosaic, which is funded by the US National Science Foundation. Mosaic uses machine learning and advanced language processing to determine a company’s health based on obvious signals such as financial strength and market viability, as well as non-traditional signals such as momentum. This spread of data offers a better measure of emerging companies with less historic data to go on. That said, the companies below range from early-stage start-ups to more established brands stepping up from funding round to funding round. All have raised at least $1m, and each and every one of them obtained funding in the last year – a testament to their current relevance. We wanted to know more about these need-to-know companies, and here’s what we found. Ionic Security Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Ionic Security is a data security start-up that has already attracted some significant investors. Founded by Adam Ghetti in 2011, the start-up helps employees of major companies protect their personal data, but also that of the company, using a specifically tailored dashboard. .@PwC_LLP is working with Ionic Security to control and protect data no matter where it goes and on any device.https://t.co/uWEeNzOBUt — Ionic Security (@IonicSecurity) October 25, 2016 In its five years, Ionic Security has accumulated $122m in funding, most recently with a $45m Series D investment in July 2016 led by funders including Amazon and Goldman Sachs. Previous investors include Google Ventures and other major VC firms like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, allowing the company to double in size to more than 200 employees. PhishMe In 2011, Rohyt Belani and Aaron Higbee came together to launch PhishMe, a Virginia start-up that saw the rapid rise in the number of phishing attempts made against both the general public and companies in particular. PhishMe clients are provided a set of tools to help employees spot malicious phishing emails, and also to help flag them immediately with a relevant cybersecurity team. The company had its largest funding round to date in July of 2016 when it raised $42.5m as part of an investment led by Paladin Capital Group, to help it expand its range of products and research. Agari Data Having raised almost $44m across four funding rounds to date, California-based Agari Data’s main product is its Agari Email Trust Platform.

With almost $40m raised to date, the service is aimed at providing a simple, almost invisible level of security.

KnowBe4 Founded in 2010 by Stu Sjouwerman, KnowBe4 offers security awareness training for employees as well as phishing tests to check the security of organisations. Its major pull is its chief hacking officer, Kevin Mitnick, who is considered one of the world’s most-wanted hackers.

With Votiro solutions, all incoming files and email messages undergo an active cleansing process that neutralises unknown exploits without having to rely on signatures. Last summer, Votiro raised $4m in a Series A round led by Redfield Asset Management. GreatHorn Based in Belmont, Massachusetts, GreatHorn was founded in 2015 by Kevin O’Brien and Raymond Wallace. The company focuses on cybersecurity for cloud communications infrastructure. GreatHorn focuses on two converging trends: the rapid adoption of cloud infrastructure for core business services, like email, as well as the increase in data breaches through spear-phishing attacks. The company’s product can be integrated into platforms like Office 365.

McAdams May 16, 2016 A Twitter Tribute to Holocaust Victims Candice Norwood Jan 27, 2017 Bourree Lam Jan 26, 2017 Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Economists studying women and work have consistently cited career interruptions as a one of the main reason that a variety of workplace inequalities persist—from long-term pay penalties for dropping out, to missing promotions that would (theoretically) put women in leadership positions. In fact, the gender pay gap is the most dire for married women. And while the overall pay gap has been slowly closing for decades, the motherhood penalty—whereby women with children experience wage penalties that women without children and men don’t—has not diminished over time. The term “off-ramping” is used to describe women who are voluntarily leaving their job for an extended amount of time. In a 2015 survey from Pew Research, nearly 40 percent of women with children reported taking a significant amount of time off work, and 27 percent reported quitting their jobs for responsibilities at home. And for these women, the “on ramps” can be hard to locate when they’re ready to rejoin the workforce. “I guess I had always just expected in my head that I would finish up to a certain point with my children, and then go back to work. When that time came, it was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be,” said Lisa Stephens, who left the workforce in 1992. Stephens had worked at IBM in the software department, and decided to stay home to raise her two sons. Twenty years later, Stephens wanted to go back to work and started strategizing how she could make that happen. She took courses online on software development, and started to pursue an advanced degree, but wasn’t seeing much interest from employers. Her break came in the form of an internship designed specifically for women who had taken career breaks with the data company Return Path. Stephens was part of the inaugural class or a 20-week paid “return internship” at the company, and was hired on full-time as a software engineer at the conclusion of the internship. The term returnship was coined (and trademarked) by Goldman Sachs in 2008, when the investment bank started a 10-week program for women and men with career gaps who were looking to get back to full-time work. Since then, the returnship has gained momentum in the banking sector. Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan all have work re-entry programs, and last year General Motors added one as well. A group of companies in the tech sector have also joined the endeavor, led by Path Forward, a non-profit that Return Path created last year. While return internship options are largely available for only white-collar jobs at the moment, it’s this population of professional women who tend to marry husbands with enough income to afford becoming a single-earner household while women in lower-paying jobs cannot afford to drop out. There’s evidence that the success rate post-internship has been high: At the conclusion of the program, GM extended full-time offers to nine participants. The program at Goldman is similarly popular: The program sees hundreds of applications every year for the 20 to 30 spots available, and the company reports that about half of the returnship program participants now work at the company full-time. While promising, these re-entry programs are only part of the solution. The programs are small in size, in white-collar sectors, and demand outstrips actual positions. For example, GM’s Take-2 career re-entry program had 400 applicants competing for 10 internships. Tami Forman, the executive director of Path Forward, says she sees reentry programs as a step toward helping women get back to work. Forman says that for tech companies struggling with diversity and competing for talent, these programs make business sense because it taps into a population of highly qualified women. Currently, Path Forward works with 20 companies, including PayPal, Instacart, and Quantcast on return-to-work programs. “What I think is also going to start to happen is as these companies see success with this model, they will grow that program over time and see that they can find great people who they want to hire and keep and who become really amazing employees,” said Forman. But the question that remains is whether a woman with significant work experience would be interested in an internship instead of a full-time job—and if that’s her best option. That it’s even a consideration points to how difficult it can be to re-enter to workforce after a significant break, as well as how hard it is to find employers who will hire professional women with resume gaps. “For a woman who’s been out for 15 years, it is a welcomed opportunity,” says Jennifer Gefsky, the co-founder of Après, a networking site for women with gaps in their resumes that boasts 20,000 members. Gefsky says that the women on Après have generally been out of the workforce for around two years, and 41 percent says they intend to return full-time. “There is not this message coming from corporate America saying ‘we want women who have gaps in their resumes.’ They don’t really think like that,” says Gefsky. “The more examples we can show of successful returners, the easier it is for companies to feel like they’re not taking a huge leap of faith.” Gefsky, who was the deputy general counsel for Major League Baseball before she took a career break, says that confidence is big part of the issue. She argues that return internship program helps women who have dropped out feel less isolated, with networking and job training helping to build confidence—the latter of which is particularly important since there’s an established confidence gap between men and women, which is exacerbated by dropping out of the workforce. “There’s so much fear factor,” says Gefsky. “I think it’s essential for women who are returning to work to network with one another. It makes the process easier, and the process is not easy. There will be rejection and it will take time. It can be scary.” For Stephens, the internship was exciting and validating. But she also she felt unsure about whether it would jump-start her career. “Would that internship have been enough to have other employers take me seriously as a candidate? I still don’t know the answer to that. After being out for 20 years, would three months be enough?” reflects Stephens. On the part of the companies, Forman says that it’s crucial to address these concerns by providing training and work that actually fill the resume gap. “The return internship needs to produce mission-critical work for the company,” explains Forman. For these programs to work for both parties, the company needs assign “real work” so to speak in order to reap value from the return internship. In turn, this aspect is important for the participants as well. Forman explains that doing real work, and not busy work often associated with post-college internships, is what helps women returning to the workforce to update her resume with relevant experience. Further, Forman says that companies shouldn’t feel like they’re getting a discount. Once returnship interns become employees, they should be compensated at the same rate as others in the same job function. Of course, another part of the solution is to make sure that the off-ramps don’t turn into dead ends. Forman says that in addition to return internships, better paid-leave policies and measures to ensure that women return to the workforce faster can help. According to research by economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn at Cornell University, the U.S. has fallen far behind other OECD countries in female labor-force participation in the last decade as other countries embraced and expanded family-friendly workplace policies. (On the flip side, however, they speculated that generous leave mandates could lead to women taking longer leaves, and employers discriminating women for high-level positions in anticipation that they’ll drop out.) For women who return to the workforce via return internships, Forman says most don’t mind starting off in a temporary, intern position, “What they want is to get back and be able to be productive and accomplish things again.” With the rise of return internships, there’s at least some hope that employers are taking note of just how serious the need to support women in the workplace is, as well as how they can create better incentives and policies that keep women in the workforce long-term.

Twitter Email Most Popular Presented by Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP How Trump’s Executive Orders Could Set America Back 70 Years Jeremi Suri The president is taking the United States back to the nightmares of the world before the Second World War: closed borders, limited trade, and a go-it-alone national race to the bottom. Despite all the lies and distortions, President Donald Trump has spent his first week in office assembling a coherent and well-planned framework for foreign policy. It is hiding in plain sight—frequently missed in the storm of tweets and the attacks on domestic enemies. Read as a whole and in detail, with attention to their larger single-minded purpose, Trump’s executive orders are the blueprints for the most significant shift in American foreign policy since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The latest drafts of executive orders, several of which the president will reportedly sign Friday at the Pentagon, are bold and breathtaking in their reach. They are strategic and transformative. They are also poised to destroy the foundations for the last 70 years of American-led peace and prosperity. The orders question the very ideas of cooperation and democracy, embodying an aggressive commitment to “America First” above all else. So much for the “defense of the free world,” and the “march of freedom”—obvious soft-headed “loser” ideas for the new team of White House cynics.

She is not in need of the sympathy. Did you see the gif? The one that features Melania Trump, the newly installed first lady of the United States, radiantly smiling as her husband gazes upon her … and then, as he turns away, allowing the grin to melt into a frown? Grin-grimace, grin-grimace, grin-grimace, looping into eternity. Call it a Kinsley gif: The image seemed to reveal, in its frozen fluidity, an unspoken truth—about Melania, about her marriage, about all of us. During a time of Much News, it quickly became conversation fodder. Slate offered “A Detailed Forensic Analysis of Melania Trump’s Creepy, Devastating Inauguration Smile/Frown.” Jezebel shared it with the sardonic declaration that “Melania Trump Definitely Loves Her Husband and Is Very Happy to Be Here.” New York magazine did a fact-check of the video the gif came from to assure us, finally, that “That Awkward Clip of Donald and Melania at the Inauguration Is Definitely Real.” (Snopes agreed, but warned that the video is inconclusive when it comes to its ability to reveal Melania’s emotions.) #FreeMelania trended. Continue Reading Lenny Ignelzi / AP Which Christians Are Telling Donald Trump to Keep Out Refugees? Emma Green Many religious groups have urged the president not to give Christians priority in seeking asylum, but some conservative political organizations back his new policy. President Trump has signed an executive order that temporarily suspends the U.S. refugee program and bars Syrian refugees. It will likely suspend immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries and bars the admission of anyone who engages in “acts of bigotry or hatred,” including “the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own.” It also allows the the secretaries of State and Homeland Security to jointly admit individuals on a case-by-case basis, “including when the person is a religious minority ... facing religious persecution.” In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday, Trump clarified what this means: Christians refugees will be given priority status. “They’ve been horribly treated,” the president said. “Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible.” People overseas “were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians,” he added, “so we are going to help them.” Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Bettman / Getty A Twitter Tribute to Holocaust Victims Candice Norwood A new social-media project commemorates refugees turned away by the United States in 1939. Software developer Russel Neiss and Rabbi Charlie Schwartz have collaborated on a number of projects that use technology to bring awareness to Jewish issues, history, and culture. But last night they dreamt up the St. Louis Manifest, a Twitter project sharing the story of some 900 Jews who fled Nazi Germany in 1939 on the MS St. Louis in an attempt to gain entry into the United States. After being turned way, the passengers were forced to return to Europe, where a number of countries accepted them as refugees; 254 of them were killed in the Holocaust. This story, Neiss and Schwartz believe, serves as a fitting tribute to International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Friday, and a reminder of a time in American history when the country closed its doors to refugees. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters What Does the Billionaire Family Backing Donald Trump Really Want? Rosie Gray The Mercers are enjoying more influence than ever with their candidate in the White House—but no one seems to know how they intend to use it. She owns a cookie store. He loves model trains. They both hate the Clintons. And beyond that, not much is clear about the motivations of the Mercer father-daughter duo of Republican megadonors who have become two of the most powerful people in the country over the last 18 months. Hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah were among the earliest and strongest backers of Donald Trump while other elite donors still disdained him. It turned out to be a good investment. But now, with their favored candidate freshly installed as president of the United States, it remains unclear what they believe, or what they hope their investment will yield. The Mercers have been a quiet but constant presence in the background of Republican politics since the beginning of the 2016 cycle. They started the campaign as backers of Ted Cruz, pouring millions into one of the main super PACs supporting his candidacy. Their data firm, Cambridge Analytica, was hired by the Cruz campaign. They switched to support Trump shortly after he clinched the nomination, and he eventually hired Cambridge Analytica, as well. Their top political guru is Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart News chairman and White House chief strategist. They’re close, too, with Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who also has a senior role in the White House. They never speak to the press and hardly ever even release a public statement. Like Trump himself, they’ve flouted the standard playbook for how things are done in politics. Continue Reading Stoyan Nenov / Reuters The Coldhearted Folly of Trump's Proposed Immigration Order Graeme Wood The countries likely affected are not those whose nationals have actually perpetrated the most ghastly attacks on Western targets. When I first started talking to ISIS propagandists and supporters, I was much impressed by one of their favorite Koranic verses: “We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein.” The verse is a reminder of God’s omnipresence, and his Santa Claus-like awareness of our deepest selves, our sins, and our good deeds. In time, I came to associate that unsettling proximity (He is closer than you think) not only with God, but also with ISIS. They too were less distant than they seemed. What seemed at first like a movement of barbarians with alien origins and impulses looked increasingly like a human phenomenon, with human flaws and virtues (mostly flaws). The more I investigated the group’s supporters, the more I found people who at one point had shared my culture and community, even if they tried to throw it all away in the service of something wicked. In the end I discovered that one of the most important figures in the Islamic State, a mysterious ideologue named Yahya Abu Hassan, was not Syrian or Iraqi at all, but a 33-year-old American, a dope-smoking theological prodigy from my own hometown.

It’s a little before 3 p.m. on a sunny Friday afternoon and Laugardalur Park, near central Reykjavik, looks practically deserted. There’s an occasional adult with a stroller, but the park’s surrounded by apartment blocks and houses, and school’s out—so where are all the kids? Walking with me are Gudberg Jónsson, a local psychologist, and Harvey Milkman, an American psychology professor who teaches for part of the year at Reykjavik University. Twenty years ago, says Gudberg, Icelandic teens were among the heaviest-drinking youths in Europe. “You couldn’t walk the streets in downtown Reykjavik on a Friday night because it felt unsafe,” adds Milkman. “There were hordes of teenagers getting in-your-face drunk.” Continue Reading Jon Woo / Reuters Can the U.S. Military Compete With China’s Rooster-Dancing Capabilities? Uri Friedman Behold the awesome power of the People’s Liberation Army. The Chinese government clearly received the message when Donald Trump pledged to not only rebuild the U.S. military, but also show it off with parades down Pennsylvania Avenue and flyovers of New York City. In response, Beijing has sent America’s new president a signal that it too can play that game. That signal comes in the form of a rooster, which, in Chinese astrology, is associated with people who are hardworking, supremely confident, and demanding of attention. In marking the dawn of each new day, one Chinese scholar observes, roosters are in charge of “time.” The Chinese government’s point—at a time of serious tensions between the world powers over trade, Taiwan, and the South China Sea—is unambiguous: Trump may want to Make America Great Again, but the coming century belongs to China, not America. Continue Reading Ian Allen My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next In the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was.

Jones industrial average inched further into record territory Thursday, eking out a gain while the broader U.S. market indexes drifted lower. The Dow’s gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. “Earnings have come in strong, for sure,” said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don’t go up or down in a straight line.” The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,375.60. It’s been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration’s policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator’s stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel’s latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99.

 We asked pharma executives the one question they didn't want to hear about drug pricing Lydia Ramsey Jan. 23, 2017, 11:46 AM 3,580 facebook linkedin twitter email print Skye Gould/Business Insider It's shaping up to be another rough year for the drug industry. At his first press conference since being elected, on Jan. 11, President Donald Trump said drug companies are "getting away with murder," and suggested that the US government needs to negotiate drug prices.  Biotech and pharma stocks fell on the comments and haven't really recovered. Investors might fear that a tweet from the president attacking a company over a high drug price could hit at any moment. It's not just Trump, of course: the public's been upset about the rising cost of drugs for the past few years. The outrage started with "bad apples" that were taking extreme measures to jack up prices, but slowly expanded to hit companies where list-price increases are routine. Several politicians, both Democrat and Republican, have spoken out about this. To counter that pressure, a handful of companies have already committed to sticking to only single-digit price increases on their drugs, and only increasing those prices once a year.  So, during the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco this month, Business Insider spoke to drug company executives about how their jobs would be impacted if the price increases that the industry takes every year—  sometimes twice a year or even quarterly — stopped being standard practice. Some insisted it wouldn't change their jobs or their companies because their growth is driven by volume instead of price increases Others brought up the need to start pricing better right off the bat when a drug gets on the market Many pointed to the discrepancy between high-rising list prices and either declining or similar net prices thanks to other players in the supply chain Keeping investors interested Drug development is a risky business, and often hypotheses don't pan out and a drug fails in clinical trials. It means investors need other reasons to back companies, and routine price increases are a way to ensure that those investors will stay interested. Removing price hikes from the business model could mean that research and development budgets within major drugmakers could get hit, as well as investor interest in very early-stage projects that could be a decade or two away from reaching the market, some executives warned. "There's a wellspring of innovation that needs to be fed coming out of the academic community in order for us have the foundation to build up the therapies of tomorrow," Scott Brun, head of AbbVie Ventures, the drugmaker's venture arm, told Business Insider.  "You need people willing to invest in that, or they're going to invest in something else." To do that, he said, there are some questions that would need to be answered, including making sure those investors have enough certainty to stick around despite the risks associated with development. If investors do leave to fund more sure bets, he said, "I think we will all lose as a consequence there." List price increases don't always translate to growth Another common defense on the issue of drug prices is to point to all the other parts of the system of getting a drug to a patient. It's true, drugmakers are part of a complex system, filled with middlemen who all get a piece of a drug's sale, and they say that system means they don't actually profit off of price hikes. So, stagnant drug prices, without any other change to the system, would just erode their profits to the pharma companies. Drugmakers pay rebates out to pharmacy benefits managers and insurance companies, and those rebates are increasing in part just so the companies can ensure their drug is kept on the list of approved drugs for a certain treatment.   Enrique Conterno, the president of Lilly's diabetes unit, offered up an example. Lilly makes Humalog — an insulin that's seen it's price steadily increase. Conterno said that the net price for Humalog, or what the drugmaker actually collects, was down 24% in the third-quarter of 2016, from the third-quarter of 2015.  Right now, there isn't a great alternative to the middlemen though, both for the drugmakers and the employers and insurance companies who count on pharmacy benefits managers.  A Type 1 diabetes patient holds up bottles of insulin. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson "I was asked a question why doesn't the whole industry just price at a different level and not do all these rebates," Horizon Pharma CEO Tim Walbert said. "And I think everyone would give the same answer: If I could just make my medicine and get it to the consumer directly, we all would." Many executives Business Insider spoke to said their businesses are driven by the volume of prescriptions they make for patients, rather than price increases. So even if list prices were to stay the same after they were originally set, the growing payout to the middlemen would mean profit erosion at the drugmaker.  Setting an initial price so high that doesn't need to be increased In the debate over drug prices, there have been two kinds of drugs that have grabbed headlines: the new drugs start out with astoundingly high prices (think of the hepatitis C treatment that has a $84,000 list price), and old drugs that have seen their price climb — suddenly or steadily over the years — (like the EpiPen, or the prices of insulin).  One response to a hypothetical world without price increases would simply be to set an initial price that is so high that it'll just reflect any foregone hikes. There are some drugs that are already priced this way, but right now the prices for those are extraordinary — think hundreds of thousands — and Big Pharma's trade organization, called PhRMA, has a new ad campaign that launched Monday to try and explain where these come from. "It's really a question of what is the initial price," said Jan Lundberg, Lilly's executive vice president of science and technology and the president of Lilly Research labs. "Our aim is to have differentiated products that can motivate a very good starting price and that's what we clearly do." Sean McCarthy, CEO of CytomX, a biotech that's developing safer ways to administer cancer immunotherapies, echoed that the initial price setting is a key issue. "I think that we need to pay a lot more attention to where we initially set price." Secretary Health and Human Secretary nominee Tom Price Alex Wong/Getty Images Will we see legislative changes to the way drugs are priced? In this hypothetical situation, the conversation was more around self-policing and changes at the company level. But Trump has said he wants to have the US negotiate prices and importing drugs from Canada, which would mean that that the way drugs are priced drastically changes.  But negotiating drug prices for Medicare wasn't something Trump's HHS pick Tom Price would commit to in a hearing Wednesday despite being pushed on it by Democratic senators. Analysts have noted that it's not a part of the Republican's healthcare plan, but with drug pricing striking such a chord with Trump, it's only a matter of time before a tweet or another soundbite sends biotech stocks into even more uncertainty.  SEE ALSO: Donald Trump just took the joy out of the drug industry's biggest investor conference DON'T MISS: A Nevada woman died from a bug that resisted 26 antibiotics — here's why it's so hard to develop new ones NOW WATCH: Here's the massive gap in average income between the top 1% and the bottom 99% in every state Loading video...

Rudin Management and Boston Properties landed a $250 million loan for Dock 72, their tech-focused office building at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The developers secured financing for the $410 million project from J.P. Morgan Chase, M&T Bank Corp. and U.S. Bank, the Wall Street Journal reported. Rudin and Boston Properties broke ground on the 16-story building at 652 Kent Avenue last year. The 675,000-square-foot building will be anchored by WeWork, which agreed to lease 222,000 square feet. Asking rents in the 17-story building will be between $60 and $70 per square foot, Rudin Management vice president Michael Rudin previously said. The developers acquired a 99-year ground lease for the property in 2015. Dock 72 is part of the massive 4.5 million-square-foot redevelopment of the area. Dock 72 is set to be complete in early 2018.

Photograph: Matt Mawson/Getty Images Cities is supported by About this content Kate Connolly in Frankfurt Friday 27 January 2017 02.15 EST Last modified on Friday 27 January 2017 14.07 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close In the heart of the Frankfurt banking district of Westend, Luise Hoepfner serves a steady stream of office workers her lunchtime menu of organic salads, soups and spelt-flour savoury tarts. The 28-year-old worked in event management for several years before opening her restaurant Vif (old German for “chipper” or “lively”) on Mendelssohnstrasse in September. “I am convinced this is the right time to invest in Frankfurt,” Hoepfner says. “It’s cheaper than London – just – and it’s growing all the time. When Brexit happens, whatever form that takes, it will only increase the demand.” With a shabby-chic interior that would not look out of place in Greenwich Village or Brick Lane, Vif offers quite a contrast to the stereotypical view of Germany’s banking capital (and home of the European Central Bank) as a dull, boring, grey-suited metropolis. The age-old German afternoon tradition of kaffee und kuchen (coffee and cake) attracts customers in the afternoon, and a fridge is full of rieslings, craft beers and ciders for after-work gatherings. “I heard British bankers like their craft beers,” Hoepfner says. This city of more than 730,000 inhabitants is quietly gearing itself up for Brexit – even if, like everyone else, it doesn’t yet know what that might entail. While publicly at least, the Germans have been reluctant to appear to be “cashing in” on what London stands to lose if it can no longer serve as the financial hub for global firms looking to do business in the EU, there are growing indications that Frankfurt cannot fail to gain. Frankfurt is the cocaine capital of Germany, with an important electronic music scene Anonymous banker A recent research paper by Prof Dirk Schiereck of the Technical University in Darmstadt concluded that the merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse (which commissioned the paper) increases the probability of Frankfurt securing a large chunk of post-Brexit spoils. The report predicts the German city will become “the clear European centre for financial market regulation and … the European centre for supranational risk management”. Frankfurt’s politicians and marketing board have been busy with a charm offensive, sending roadshows to London as well as setting up a walk-in information centre in the city for would-be movers. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Frankfurt is home to the headquarters of the European Central Bank. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Meanwhile, international banks and businesses currently based in London have been sending scouts to Frankfurt in large numbers to gather information on everything from the availability of villas and international schools, to the labour laws and how easy it is to find English-speaking workers. A recent survey of 360 London bankers by the Boston Consulting Group put Frankfurt in a prime position, ahead of rivals such as Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin or Luxembourg. Its advantages were its central location, sophisticated infrastructure and property prices considerably lower than in London or Paris. And while banks and businesses have kept their cards close to their chests regarding any planned moves, there is much anecdotal evidence that some will take place before, not after, Britain’s exit. The decision announced last month by Swiss bank UBS to set up a new entity called UBS Europe SE in Frankfurt is being widely interpreted as the first major Brexit-influenced move. UBS also plans for its continental European investment banking and wealth management operations to set up shop in the German city, according to reports. The move could mean the bank shifting 1,500 people – or a third of its London staff – from the UK. Sources within Citigroup have acknowledged the investment bank is contemplating moving some of its London-based traders to Frankfurt, though there has been no official confirmation. Executives from JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, have said they are sure to move staff from London in the case of the UK losing so-called “passporting rights”, but have refused to be drawn as to which city they favour. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The new bistro Vif in Westend. Photograph: Luise Hoepfner Frankfurt itself talks of between 8,000 and 20,000 jobs moving here from London, incrementally. Real estate agents are said to be feverishly fielding property enquiries from companies, with the main question being not so much an interest in prices – which are considerably lower than in London or Paris – but the availability of luxury housing. “A CEO’s main priorities are to find out whether there are enough qualified personnel in their particular field, what is the regulation like here, how close is the airport,” says Michaela Kahle of FrankfurtRheinMain GmbH, the regional marketing agency. “They will make decisions on cost grounds. But they also want to know how many international schools we have, and what the shopping facilities are like. “In many regards, Frankfurt cannot begin to compete with London – it’s considerably smaller and quieter. An investment banker with more money than he knows what to do with might rather choose Paris or Berlin,” says Kahle. “But for families with children there’s a lot to be said for the short distances; the fact that schools, houses and living facilities are nearby, and that you can cycle from one side of the city to the other in a short time. The atmosphere is arguably more relaxed, less hectic than in London.” Florian, a 41-year-old German working in the financial sector for a major German company – who, because of the sensitivity of his role in conjunction with Brexit, did not wish his surname to be used – remembers being very unimpressed with the city on his first visit. “It was the mid 90s and I came to visit a university friend who was doing an internship with a bank. I thought it was so dull. To coin a German phrase, was as if they’d folded up the pavements.” But 20 years on, and now settled here with his psychologist wife and their two children, he can hardly imagine wanting to live anywhere else. “It has changed immensely,” he says. “It’s a very lively, international city, and becoming more so all the time.” It does not boast the vibrancy of somewhere like Berlin, he admits, “but it’s a completely different type of city.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Frankfurt’s financial district could see thousands of jobs move from London. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images From his own experience, “it’s a great place in which to combine city living and family life”. His family lives in a 1930s rented house with a small garden, three minutes’ walk from a metro station and a short commute to work in the centre of the banking district. The weekends often involve a hike in the nearby Taunus mountains. “It’s easy to manage the public transport in this city with prams and small children, unlike London, where there are a lot of barriers,” he says. As to fears that an influx of London-based bankers to Frankfurt – estimates range between 8,000 and 10,000 – might have an adverse effect on the city, Florian says: “Maybe it’ll be the case that these play hard, work hard people will also start to enjoy the slower pace and the proximity of nature. Rather than them changing Frankfurt, maybe Frankfurt will change them.” Frankfurt is not under pressure to retain its cool image like Berlin is Phoebe Escott-Kenny One banker commenting anonymously told the Guardian that while the city might lack the “frisson” of London, Frankfurt had, as he saw it, much to offer. He called it the “cocaine capital of Germany, with an important electronic music scene”. But according to David Hughes, an HR manager in an international law firm who moved to the city six years ago, “there’s probably a lot less cocaine in Frankfurt than in London. If I were working in London it would likely take wild horses to get me to Frankfurt.” He was keen to add his remark had nothing to do with the availability of cocaine. The 33-year-old Dublin native lives in a 807 sq ft, maisonette flat (monthly rent €1,100 (£940) a month with his boyfriend, a Spanish architect. “In the mornings I just hop on my bike and roll down the hill for 10 minutes to get to work. I don’t waste six hours of my week in a dirty tube.” Neither did he believe that an invasion or a trickle of bankers arriving from London would manage to change the city. “It would have to be a really massive influx to tip the balance in the social ecosystem. You pass by so many languages when you walk down the street already,” he says. The downsides of life he speaks of could actually apply to all of Germany. “Poor customer service, Sunday closing, and the lack of rugby,” he says. “After six years here they remain the most frustrating factors”. Passport to Paris? City rolls out red carpets to arrivals from Brexit London Read more Phoebe Escott-Kenny, an Australian who moved to Frankfurt in 2011, offers corporate training to German and Russian business people as well as keeping up a travel blog. “People are constantly asking me: ‘you left Australia for Frankfurt?’” she says. “The trouble with Frankfurt is that it’s not obvious if you come here with no guidance as to what it’s got going for it, it reveals itself slowly,” she says. “Frankfurt is not under pressure to retain its cool image like Berlin is.” She and her boyfriend, Dominik Felsmann, a management consultant from Stuttgart, live in Bahhofsviertel, the neighbourhood around the railway station and in the centre of the city’s red light district, which they refer to as “mini Berlin”. “Every man and his dog wants to live here,” says the 28-year-old Escott-Kenny. “It’s the most buzzing part of town. Every week a new bar or speakeasy opens up, a restaurant or a coffee shop. Six years ago you couldn’t get a decent cup of coffee, now it’s burgeoning with good cafes. The only annoyances are the dog turds and drug users’ needles outside the front door.” Dominik, her boyfriend, says he travels a lot, “so I can compare Frankfurt to other places. And I can say it’s a typical anglo-Saxon/American city in many regards, more so than Munich or Berlin. You can get your €100 steak and live in a castle or live closer to gritty real life – it depends what you want.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive here More features Topics EU referendum and Brexit Germany Europe Frankfurt holidays Foreign policy More… European Union Banking Financial sector Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The Dow’s gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. “Earnings have come in strong, for sure,” said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don’t go up or down in a straight line.” It’s been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration’s policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator’s stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel’s latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99.

Ogg January 25, 2017 1:55 pm EST Print Email Tweet CenturyLink Inc. (NYSE: CTL) remains a rather controversial stock, even after its acquisition of Level 3 Communications Inc. (NYSE: LVLT). This carrier comes with a massive $2.16 annualized dividend, which generates a current dividend yield of 8.4%. It turns out that several analysts have been making big calls here ahead of earnings. 24/7 Wall St. has followed some of these high-yield dividend payers for years. Many of these high-yield dividend structures are often very hard to follow. After all, they can come from EBIT measures and distributable cash flows rather than from a traditional earnings per share measurement that investors are used to. CenturyLink has scheduled its earnings report for Wednesday, February 8, 2017. That leaves a couple of weeks before many things will be stated by the company. When considering this merger with CenturyLink as the acquirer, it is important to keep in mind that Level 3 has a market cap of $21.3 billion, versus $14 billion for CenturyLink. One such consideration is obviously that CenturyLink is a heavily shorted stock. At the end of December, its short interest was a massive 71,133,000 shares (over 10% of its entire float). On January 25, 2017, Jefferies raised CenturyLink’s rating to Hold from Underperform. Other analyst calls have recently been made by Merrill Lynch, S&P, JPMorgan and Macquarie. When Jefferies upgraded CenturyLink, the firm also raised its official price target to $26 from $20. In effect, the analysts now see a price that is slightly higher than the current share price, rather than one with is about 20% under the current share price. The key takeaway from Jefferies: We are upgrading shares of CenturyLink from Underperform to Hold as NOLs and synergies from the pending acquisition of Level 3 reduce the near-term risk to the dividend. The implied 8.3% dividend yield provides support for the stock, in our view. Our prior outlook hinged on challenging fundamentals and an inconsistent dividend policy. CenturyLink faces on-going secular and competitive pressures; however, the combination should lead to meaningful financial benefits and accretion. Merrill Lynch said in its most recent telecom and data center research tome: We estimate ’17 revenue of $17.2b (consensus of $17.2 billion) and EBITDA of $6.36 billion (matches consensus) …. We estimate the deal, using a blended average 5% pre-tax cost of debt, could be 44% accretive to CenturyLink’s free cash flow per share in Year 1 (2018E) …. CenturyLink announced a deal to sell the majority of its data center business to a consortium. … We will look to the call for any insight CenturyLink can provide on the potential benefits from tax reform. Standard & Poor’s issued a refresh to its research on January 21. Its rating is Buy and it has a $28 price target. S&P said at the time: Our Buy opinion reflects the pending Level 3 Communications (LVLT 54 Buy) deal, CTL’s attractive dividend stream (over 8% yield) and our view of fundamentals. We remain cautious about ongoing legacy declines and higher cash taxes next year, but see higher growth in strategic revenues. We think the pending acquisition of Level 3 Communications will further leverage CTL s balance sheet but note benefits from cost synergies, free cash flow improvement and potential usage of LVLT s near $10 billion in net operating losses (NOLs). We also think the combination offers CTL a greater geographic footprint and scale (more than 2/3 of combined revenue in strategic growth areas). Right at the start of 2017, JPMorgan raised its rating to Overweight with a $28 price target. That was based on a 9.1% dividend yield and on revenue stability. JPMorgan’s investment thesis and valuation were noted in that report as follows: We now have more confidence in the value of CenturyLink due to the positive implications of the Level 3 deal. We believe the Level 3 deal is a significant positive for CenturyLink as it brings a higher enterprise mix (~75% of pro forma revenue), increased scale, revenue and EBITDA stability, and tax protection to help CenturyLink pay its dividend. Despite the benefits, CenturyLink’s dividend yield is at record levels vs the 10 year Treasury as well as T/VZ dividend yields. … We maintain our year-end 2017 price target of $28. We reached our price target by our DCF analysis, which assumes a 0% terminal growth rate and 7.0% discount rate. At the end of December, Macquarie called the CenturyLink and Level 3 merger a “Wild Cat Merger.” Its view was a mere Neutral rating at the time, but the price target was listed as $30, compared with a current share price of $24.06. The firm did note at the time that the company’s own S-4 filing projections were slightly above its own estimates and that it sees room for upside. CenturyLink shares were last seen up 0.6% at $25.72 on Wednesday, in a 52-week range of $22.86 to $33.45 and with a consensus analyst target price of $28.08. Level 3 shares were up 0.3% to $59.15. Its 52-week range is $41.73 to $59.31, and it has a consensus target price of $62.31. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

The former Tinseltown studio boss is starting an investment fund called WndrCo LLC, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday. The 66-year-old entertainment-sector heavyweight has already raised nearly $600 million for the fund, which is expected to search for acquisitions in the digital media and tech industries. The Post first reported Katzenberg’s plans for a venture capital fund on July 23. Katzenberg’s new corporate digs are listed at 9355 Wilshire Boulevard. The filings suggest that two executives will be joining Katzenberg in his latest venture — Ann Daly, the former president at his former company, DreamWorks Animation, and Sujay Jaswa, who was a chief financial officer at Dropbox. Jaswa is also a former senior adviser to JPMorgan Chase and joined Katzenberg in August, according to his LinkedIn page. The filing suggests the fund won’t accept outside investments of less than $25 million. The filing also says the firm has already booked $591.5 million in the fund. Forbes said Katzenberg’s net worth was $900 million after he sold DreamWorks Animation — creator of the Shrek character — to Comcast for $3.8 billion in 2016. Katzenberg is believed to have pocketed $391 million in proceeds from the deal. While running DreamWorks Animation, Katzenberg launched a digital content company aimed at youngsters, called AwesomenessTV. Verizon paid $159 million for a 24.5 percent stake. Hearst holds a similar stake. That firm is now part of Comcast, though DreamWorks New Media counts Katzenberg as chairman. He collects 7 percent of AwesomenessTV’s profits in perpetuity. Katzenberg might be eager to put his digital media learnings to work in the market. He was a longtime director of gaming company Zynga. With all that money already raised, perhaps Katzenberg can buy a few vowels for his fund’s name.

The Dow's gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. "Earnings have come in strong, for sure," said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don't go up or down in a straight line." The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,375.60. It's been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration's policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator's stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. New Commerce Department data indicating sales of new U.S. homes fell 10.4 percent in December didn't weigh on PulteGroup. The homebuilder's quarterly earnings and sales beat financial analysts' estimates, lifting its shares 74 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $21.18. United Rentals led the gainers in the S&P 500. The equipment rentals company announced it would acquire construction company NES Rentals for $965 million. United Rentals vaulted $12.80, or 11.2 percent, to $127.06. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel's latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99. Investors also were put off by McKesson's fiscal third-quarter results, which were hurt by weaker-than-expected prices. McKesson lost $12.55, or 8.3 percent, to $138.55. Whirlpool tumbled 8.5 percent after the appliance maker said Britain's impending departure from the European Union hurt its profits. The stock fell $16.26 to $173.94. Beyond the ongoing wave of company earnings reports, investors will be looking Friday to a key gauge of the U.S. economy's health when the Commerce Department delivers its estimate of what the nation's gross domestic product was in the final quarter of 2016. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Thursday. Germany's DAX rose 0.4 percent, while the CAC-40 in France slipped 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was flat. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 surged 1.8 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.8 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.4 percent. Markets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and other Asian countries are about to begin holidays of varying lengths to mark the lunar new year, curtailing trading. Bond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 2.50 percent from 2.52 percent late Wednesday. The dollar increased to 114.42 yen from 113.60 on Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.0692 from $1.0743. Energy prices moved broadly higher.

A sharper focus on the more profitable mass market is paying off for casino operators, while VIP punters are starting to return after their wings were clipped by Chinese President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on corruption. Betting in Macau rose 10 per cent last quarter to 60.4 billion patacas (US$7.6 billion). The signs of recovery are scaring away the bears. Rattled by the recent slowdown, casinos and resorts in Macau looked to middle-class tourists to revive sales. Wynn Macau’s new casino on the Cotai strip and Sands China’s Parisian -- a hotel complex with a half-size replica of the Eiffel Tower -- are attracting crowds, while restrictions on cash machine withdrawals weren’t as harsh as some had feared. Macau is set for a further boost over the week-long Lunar New Year holiday marking the start of the Year of the Rooster, which this year starts on Jan. 27. This is usually peak season for visitors. DS Kim, a Hong Kong-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said booking trends for junkets and hotels are upbeat and might be on track to surpass the Golden Week holiday in October last year. “We stay bullish on the sector for genuine upturns in demand, profits and cash flows in 2017 and onward,” he said. Las Vegas Sands offered a note of caution when it kicked off casino earnings season in the U.S. on Wednesday. Results missed forecasts largely because of the success of punters at the newly launched Parisian in Macau, it said. In the earnings call, the company’s president Rob Goldstein singled out one gambler in particular. “She wins every day and she is doing very well. And, she affected the numbers,” he said. Over the past 12 months, returns on a Bloomberg gauge of casino stocks were almost three times higher than those of the Hang Seng Index. In January 2016, Wynn Macau’s shares touched a record low and Sands China was trading at the lowest level since 2012. They’re up 84 per cent and 52 per cent from this time last year. Galaxy Entertainment Group, another industry leader, has jumped 72 per cent. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam said in a recent note that Macau’s mass gaming revenue growth will peak at 15 per cent in 2019, as the Chinese travelling population grows and the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and light rail transit alleviate capacity constraints and help increase visitors. Growth will taper to high single digits through 2025, Tam said. While valuations have come off November highs, when the Bloomberg Intelligence Macau Gaming index had a price-earnings multiple of 29, the highest since April 2010, the gauge is still trading at 25 times estimated earnings. “It all comes down to valuation,’’ said Angelamaria Hanlee, an analyst at China Merchants Securities (Hong Kong) Co. ”Although the long term growth looks pretty good, it’s more like the market already knows about it so I don’t think there is much room to improve.’’ Risks to the recovery include a wider smoking ban in VIP gaming areas later this year and potential for Chinese government policies restricting capital outflows. “Capital flight controls from the continued depreciation of the yuan could limit VIP growth and junket operators’ financing capabilities,” said CICC Research, which is “cautiously optimistic” on the Macau gaming sector.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Founder of Biel Crystal pays HK$2.8 billion for The Peak mansion 2 Hard times ahead for China’s economy, says Alibaba’s Jack Ma 3 Are New Zealand’s air farmers selling hope or hot air to China? 4 Trump taps ex-Hong Kong businessman for US Navy secretary 5 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs Shared 1 Founder of Biel Crystal pays HK$2.8 billion for The Peak mansion 2 Are New Zealand’s air farmers selling hope or hot air to China? 3 Hard times ahead for China’s economy, says Alibaba’s Jack Ma 4 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 5 Nothing to love about McDonald’s China private equity deal Commented 1 China ‘steps up preparedness for possible military conflict with US’ 2 Government slammed over HK$40m office for chief executive-elect 3 Victim loses HK$12m in city’s biggest phone scam in a year 4 Patten questions UK’s ‘sense of honour’ over city’s future 5 Beijing’s trust in me not an issue, Tsang says, as he criticises Lam Promotions Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like Hong Kong Joshua Wong hopes Netflix airing of film will raise awareness 26 Jan 2017 - 12:23am 55 Smart-home kits keep pet owners connected In partnership with: HKT PREMIER China Millions on the move in China’s Lunar New Year rush 25 Jan 2017 - 3:04pm 3 Opening hearts and minds in Cambodia Sponsored by: The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hong Kong Hong Kong denies Beijing role in seizure of Singaporean troop carriers 26 Jan 2017 - 4:13pm 70 China invests billions in the US ... who gets the most? 25 Jan 2017 - 1:36pm 2 Geopolitics Hong Kong to return seized armoured vehicles to Singapore 25 Jan 2017 - 12:24pm 87 China How does China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ match up against the TPP? 24 Jan 2017 - 11:17pm 3 China China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 23 Jan 2017 - 11:26pm 26 Lifestyle Lunar New Year feng shui: how to decorate your home Jan 25th 2017, 5:42pm Insight & Opinion Hong Kong must understand the limits of its autonomy 23 Jan 2017 - 8:49pm 17 Hong Kong CIA files reveal anxiety over Hong Kong’s future under Chinese rule 21 Jan 2017 - 11:18pm 43 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration's policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator's stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. New Commerce Department data indicating sales of new U.S. homes fell 10.4 percent in December didn't weigh on PulteGroup. The homebuilder's quarterly earnings and sales beat financial analysts' estimates, lifting its shares 74 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $21.18. United Rentals led the gainers in the S&P 500. The equipment rentals company announced it would acquire construction company NES Rentals for $965 million. United Rentals vaulted $12.80, or 11.2 percent, to $127.06. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel's latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99. Investors also were put off by McKesson's fiscal third-quarter results, which were hurt by weaker-than-expected prices. McKesson lost $12.55, or 8.3 percent, to $138.55. Whirlpool tumbled 8.5 percent after the appliance maker said Britain's impending departure from the European Union hurt its profits. The stock fell $16.26 to $173.94. Beyond the ongoing wave of company earnings reports, investors will be looking Friday to a key gauge of the U.S. economy's health when the Commerce Department delivers its estimate of what the nation's gross domestic product was in the final quarter of 2016. » Next page...

Betting in Macau rose 10 percent last quarter to 60.4 billion patacas (USD7.6 billion). The signs of recovery are scaring away the bears.  Rattled by the recent slowdown, casinos and resorts in Macau looked to middle-class tourists to revive sales. Wynn Macau Ltd.’s new casino on the Cotai strip and Sands China Ltd.’s Parisian – a hotel complex with a half-size replica of the Eiffel Tower – are attracting crowds, while restrictions on cash machine withdrawals weren’t as harsh as some had feared.  Macau is set for a further boost over the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which this year starts today. This is usually peak season for visitors. DS Kim, a Hong Kong-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said booking trends for junkets and hotels are upbeat and might be on track to surpass the Golden Week holiday in October last year. “We stay bullish on the sector for genuine upturns in demand, profits and cash flows in 2017 and onward,” he said.  Las Vegas Sands Corp. offered a note of caution when it kicked off casino earnings season in the U.S. on Wednesday. Results missed forecasts largely because of the success of punters at the newly launched Parisian in Macau, it said. In the earnings call, the company’s president Rob Goldstein singled out one gambler in particular. “She wins every day and she is doing very well. And, she affected the numbers,” he said. Over the past 12 months, returns on a Bloomberg gauge of casino stocks were almost three times higher than those of the Hang Seng Index. In January 2016, Wynn Macau’s shares touched a record low and Sands China was trading at the lowest level since 2012. They’re up 84 percent and 52 percent from this time last year. Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd., another industry leader, has jumped 72 percent.   Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam said in a recent note that Macau’s mass gaming revenue growth will peak at 15 percent in 2019, as the Chinese traveling population grows and the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and light rail transit alleviate capacity constraints and help increase visitors. Growth will taper to high single digits through 2025, Tam said.  While valuations have come off November highs, when the Bloomberg Intelligence Macau Gaming index had a price-earnings multiple of 29, the highest since April 2010, the gauge is still trading at 25 times estimated earnings.  “It all comes down to valuation,’’ said Angelamaria Hanlee, an analyst at China Merchants Securities (Hong Kong) Co.  “Although the long term growth looks pretty good, it’s more like the market already knows about it so I don’t think there is much room to improve.’’ Risks to the recovery include a wider smoking ban in VIP gaming areas later this year and potential for Chinese government policies restricting capital outflows. “Capital flight controls from the continued depreciation of the yuan could limit VIP growth and junket operators’ financing capabilities,” said CICC Research, which is “cautiously optimistic” on the Macau gaming sector.

"We think low inventory levels and healthy lead times, imports constrained by trade cases, and potential further trade actions will all help support steel sheet prices," analyst Michael Gambardella wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. "STLD has leverage to any higher prices, while increases in infrastructure spending could meaningfully benefit its long products operations." Steel Dynamics shares are up 19 percent since the Nov. 8 election through Wednesday on optimism over President Donald Trump's economic agenda.

See Offers Business Posted January 26 increase font size Dow heads further into record territory The Dow's gain comes a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. By ALEX VEIGAAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article The Dow Jones industrial average inched further into record territory Thursday, eking out a gain while the broader U.S. market indexes drifted lower. The Dow’s gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. “Earnings have come in strong, for sure,” said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don’t go up or down in a straight line.” The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,375.60. It’s been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time.

The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Thursday. Bond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 2.50 percent from 2.52 percent late Wednesday.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.4 percent to 19,474.15, helped by the dollar's surge against the Japanese yen, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1 percent to 23,356.57. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.6 percent to 5,703.30. Markets in China, South Korea, Taiwan were closed while Malaysia was open only for the morning session. LUNAR NEW YEAR: Many Asian countries are going on holiday for varying lengths, curtailing trading across much of the region. Mainland China will take the longest break, shutting down for an entire week. TRUMP: With little in the way of market-moving events expected in Asia, investors were focusing on the latest moves by U.S. President Donald Trump. He plans to slap a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico to pay for his promised border wall, in an announcement that left markets uncertain about what it means for trade. Trump's joint press conference with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May scheduled for later Friday could also provide trading catalysts, especially for the pound. QUOTEWORTHY: "What worries me is that Mexico accounts for only around 8 percent of American's trade deficits," said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore. "Whereas U.S.'s trade deficit with the Pacific Rim is approximately six times larger than that of Mexico. His hard stance toward Mexico could give us a hint of his future trade policies against the Pacific Rim countries, especially China." US DATA: Fourth-quarter U.S. economic growth estimates are due out later along with the latest round of corporate earnings. The numbers will provide fresh insight on the world's biggest economy and help guide Fed officials as they plan further interest rate increases this year. WALL STREET: Major U.S. benchmarks had a mixed finish. The Dow Jones industrial average inched further into record territory, rising 0.2 percent to 20,100.91. But the broader S&P 500 index fell 0.1 percent to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 0.02 percent to 5,655.18. CURRENCIES: The dollar climbed to 114.89 yen from 114.46 in late trading Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0681 from $1.0684. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 8 cents to $53.87 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract added $1.03, or 2 percent, to close at $53.78 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, crept 1 cent higher to $56.50 a barrel in London.

It's been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Published January 26. 2017 10:27AM | Updated January 26. 2017 5:13PM By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press The Dow Jones industrial average inched further into record territory Thursday, eking out a gain while the broader U.S. market indexes drifted lower. The Dow's gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. "Earnings have come in strong, for sure," said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don't go up or down in a straight line." The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,375.60. It's been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration's policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator's stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. New Commerce Department data indicating sales of new U.S. homes fell 10.4 percent in December didn't weigh on PulteGroup. The homebuilder's quarterly earnings and sales beat financial analysts' estimates, lifting its shares 74 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $21.18. United Rentals led the gainers in the S&P 500. The equipment rentals company announced it would acquire construction company NES Rentals for $965 million. United Rentals vaulted $12.80, or 11.2 percent, to $127.06. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel's latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99. Investors also were put off by McKesson's fiscal third-quarter results, which were hurt by weaker-than-expected prices. McKesson lost $12.55, or 8.3 percent, to $138.55. Whirlpool tumbled 8.5 percent after the appliance maker said Britain's impending departure from the European Union hurt its profits. The stock fell $16.26 to $173.94. Beyond the ongoing wave of company earnings reports, investors will be looking Friday to a key gauge of the U.S. economy's health when the Commerce Department delivers its estimate of what the nation's gross domestic product was in the final quarter of 2016. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Thursday. Germany's DAX rose 0.4 percent, while the CAC-40 in France slipped 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was flat. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 surged 1.8 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.8 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.4 percent. Markets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and other Asian countries are about to begin holidays of varying lengths to mark the lunar new year, curtailing trading across much of the region. Bond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 2.50 percent from 2.52 percent late Wednesday. The dollar increased to 114.42 yen from 113.60 on Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.0692 from $1.0743. Energy prices moved broadly higher. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.03, or 2 percent, to close at $53.78 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.16, or 2.1 percent, to close at $56.24 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.54 a gallon, while heating oil added 3 cents to $1.64 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.38 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) The Dow Jones industrial average inched further into record territory Thursday, eking out a gain while the broader U.S. market indexes drifted lower. The Dow’s gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 per cent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. “Earnings have come in strong, for sure,” said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don’t go up or down in a straight line.” The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 1,375.60. It’s been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration’s policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 per cent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator’s stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 per cent, to $95.64. New Commerce Department data indicating sales of new U.S. homes fell 10.4 per cent in December didn’t weigh on PulteGroup. The homebuilder’s quarterly earnings and sales beat financial analysts’ estimates, lifting its shares 74 cents, or 3.6 per cent, to $21.18. United Rentals led the gainers in the S&P 500. The equipment rentals company announced it would acquire construction company NES Rentals for $965 million. United Rentals vaulted $12.80, or 11.2 per cent, to $127.06. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel’s latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 per cent, to $25.99. Investors also were put off by McKesson’s fiscal third-quarter results, which were hurt by weaker-than-expected prices. McKesson lost $12.55, or 8.3 per cent, to $138.55. Whirlpool tumbled 8.5 per cent after the appliance maker said Britain’s impending departure from the European Union hurt its profits. The stock fell $16.26 to $173.94. Beyond the ongoing wave of company earnings reports, investors will be looking Friday to a key gauge of the U.S. economy’s health when the Commerce Department delivers its estimate of what the nation’s gross domestic product was in the final quarter of 2016. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Thursday. Germany’s DAX rose 0.4 per cent, while the CAC-40 in France slipped 0.2 per cent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was flat. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged 1.8 per cent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.8 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 1.4 per cent.

Chalk one up for the market prognosticators. Bank of America Corp. predicted investors would shift away from growth stocks in favor of value names this year as part of its list of "violent rotations" to expect in financial markets this year. On Tuesday, withdrawals from Vanguard's growth exchange traded fund, ticker VUG, reached $900 million, the second most in its 12-year history. With $23 billion in assets, it's the second-biggest such product in the world. JPMorgan Chase & Co. says the hoped-for acceleration in the rate of economic expansion under the Trump administration has fostered an environment that bodes well for value stocks, generally defined as having share prices that don't reflect their fundamental worth. Growth stocks, those whose earnings are expected to rise faster than the market average, tend to outperform during stretches in which expansion is muted. "We’ve seen this in value stocks as well as ETFs, since the election—it’s the first time in a long time that value outperformed growth," said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA. "We’re starting to see investors tilt back into what works and chase some of that performance." Vanguard's growth ETF has climbed 5.5 percent since Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, while its value fund has jumped more than 8 percent. Investors have taken note, sending nearly $215 million a day to value-oriented ETFs with more than $2 billion in assets, compared with just $53 million for their growth-focused counterparts. The trend not only speaks to the shift in positioning among investors, but also—somewhat counter-intuitively—to the increasing dominance of Vanguard in ETFs. Inflows into Vanguard’s offerings usually come in a relatively steady drip compared to their competitors. This massive outflow points to the use of VUG by institutional investors, which had in the past tended to gravitate toward similar products that have more turnover. "Looks like a big investor betting the recent rally in growth is over," said Eric Balchunas, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "This also speaks to Vanguard’s penetration into the institutional market as it attracts bigger investors who have typically used only the highly traded products from BlackRock and State Street."

New Delhi: IT major Wipro on Wednesday announced allotment of 18,819 shares, worth about Rs one crore at the current market price, to eligible employees. The shares are being issued to the employees under the restricted stock unit plans of 2005 and 2007, the company said. "Administrative Committee of Board of Directors has passed a resolution in their meeting held on April 20, 2015 to issue and allot 18,819 equity shares of Rs 2 each pursuant to exercise of the stock options by the eligible employees under Restricted Stock Unit Plan 2005 and Restricted Stock Unit Plan 2007," the company said in a filing on the BSE. Besides, the Committee also passed a resolution to issue and allot 7,813 equity shares of par value of Rs 2 to JP Morgan Chase Bank, its depository as underlying shares in respect of ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) to be issued and allocated to the purchasers, pursuant to the exercise of the stock options granted to the employees under the ADS Restricted Stock Unit Plan- 2004. The country's third largest software services firm Wipro on Tuesday reported 2.1 per cent rise in fourth quarter net profit to Rs 2,286.5 crore, while it elevated founder Azim Premji's son Rishad to the board. The company had a net profit of Rs 2,239.1 crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2014.

Grogan | CNBC Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Deutsche Bank on Thursday revealed its favorite financial stocks, selecting Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo as its top picks given the earnings potential in the months ahead. "We continue to prefer market sensitive banks over large regionals. This reflects our view that leverage to rising rates may already be mostly (or more) priced in while there may still be upside to capital market businesses (particularly in FICC [fixed income, currencies and commodities]) from a stronger economy and a less onerous regulatory environment," equity analyst Matt O'Connor wrote in a note to clients. Deutsche Bank believes balance sheet growth will be as important as higher interest rates in 2017 and beyond, a trend that some investors might be missing by blindly buying the entire financial sector.

While Wall Street celebrates yet another stock market record, surpassing 20,000 on the Dow Jones industrial average on Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017, most of America has little reason to cheer. The wealthiest one-tenth of Americans owns 80 percent of stock market wealth. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) Updated at 4:11 p.m. The Dow Jones industrial average inched further into record territory Thursday, eking out a gain while the broader U.S. market indexes drifted lower. The Dow's gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. "Earnings have come in strong, for sure," said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don't go up or down in a straight line." The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,375.60. It's been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration's policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator's stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. New Commerce Department data indicating sales of new U.S. homes fell 10.4 percent in December didn't weigh on PulteGroup. The homebuilder's quarterly earnings and sales beat financial analysts' estimates, lifting its shares 74 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $21.18. United Rentals led the gainers in the S&P 500. The equipment rentals company announced it would acquire construction company NES Rentals for $965 million. United Rentals vaulted $12.80, or 11.2 percent, to $127.06. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel's latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99. Investors also were put off by McKesson's fiscal third-quarter results, which were hurt by weaker-than-expected prices. McKesson lost $12.55, or 8.3 percent, to $138.55. Whirlpool tumbled 8.5 percent after the appliance maker said Britain's impending departure from the European Union hurt its profits. The stock fell $16.26 to $173.94. Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Beyond the ongoing wave of company earnings reports, investors will be looking Friday to a key gauge of the U.S. economy's health when the Commerce Department delivers its estimate of what the nation's gross domestic product was in the final quarter of 2016. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Thursday. Germany's DAX rose 0.4 percent, while the CAC-40 in France slipped 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was flat. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 surged 1.8 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.8 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.4 percent. Markets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and other Asian countries are about to begin holidays of varying lengths to mark the lunar new year, curtailing trading across much of the region. Bond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 2.50 percent from 2.52 percent late Wednesday. The dollar increased to 114.42 yen from 113.60 on Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.0692 from $1.0743. Energy prices moved broadly higher. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.03, or 2 percent, to close at $53.78 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.16, or 2.1 percent, to close at $56.24 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.54 a gallon, while heating oil added 3 cents to $1.64 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.38 per 1,000 cubic feet. In other commodity trading, the price of gold fell $8, or 0.7 percent, to $1,189.80 an ounce. Silver slid 13 cents to $16.85 an ounce. Copper gave up 4 cents to $2.67 a pound.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.4 percent to 19,474.15, helped by the dollar's surge against the Japanese yen, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1 percent to 23,356.57. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.6 percent to 5,703.30. Markets in China, South Korea, Taiwan were closed while Malaysia was open only for the morning session. LUNAR NEW YEAR: Many Asian countries are going on holiday for varying lengths, curtailing trading across much of the region. Mainland China will take the longest break, shutting down for an entire week. TRUMP: With little in the way of market-moving events expected in Asia, investors were focusing on the latest moves by U.S. President Donald Trump. He plans to slap a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico to pay for his promised border wall, in an announcement that left markets uncertain about what it means for trade. Trump's joint press conference with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May scheduled for later Friday could also provide trading catalysts, especially for the pound. QUOTEWORTHY: "What worries me is that Mexico accounts for only around 8 percent of American's trade deficits," said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore. "Whereas U.S.'s trade deficit with the Pacific Rim is approximately six times larger than that of Mexico. His hard stance toward Mexico could give us a hint of his future trade policies against the Pacific Rim countries, especially China." US DATA: Fourth-quarter U.S. economic growth estimates are due out later along with the latest round of corporate earnings. The numbers will provide fresh insight on the world's biggest economy and help guide Fed officials as they plan further interest rate increases this year. WALL STREET: Major U.S. benchmarks had a mixed finish. The Dow Jones industrial average inched further into record territory, rising 0.2 percent to 20,100.91. But the broader S&P 500 index fell 0.1 percent to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 0.02 percent to 5,655.18. CURRENCIES: The dollar climbed to 114.89 yen from 114.46 in late trading Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0681 from $1.0684. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 8 cents to $53.87 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract added $1.03, or 2 percent, to close at $53.78 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, crept 1 cent higher to $56.50 a barrel in London.

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Jan 26, 2017 at 11:42AM It is my general opinion that investing in high-quality dividend stocks with the potential for growth is the best path to stock market wealth. However, not all dividend stocks are the same. Here are two in particular -- one real estate investment trust, or REIT, and one bank -- that could be excellent additions to your portfolio as we head into 2017. Image Source: Getty Images. Steady income and big growth potential Data center REIT Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) could be an excellent combination of dividends and growth for your portfolio. As of this writing, Digital Realty owns 144 data center properties consisting of 25 million rentable square feet. While the space is leased to more than 2,000 individual tenants, the company's 20 largest tenants make up more than 42% of the rental income, and are essentially a "who's who" of major tech and financial firms. Just to name a few of the largest, the tenant roster includes IBM, AT&T, Facebook, and JPMorgan Chase. The reasons to love Digital Realty are simple. Mainly, the data storage industry has grown tremendously, and continues to do so. According to projections by Cisco, global IP traffic is expected to grow by 91% from 2016 to 2019, and mobile data traffic is expected to grow even faster. To further support this, demand is growing much faster than supply of new data centers in many key markets. For example, in the Chicago metropolitan area, market absorption is three times the rate of new data center construction, and Digital Realty's new properties from the last 12 months are already 100% leased. Image Source: Digital Realty Trust Because of this growth, Digital Realty has grown its FFO per share at a 13.1% annualized rate, including strong growth during the great recession. As a result, its dividend (which only represents 62% of its 2016 core FFO) has more than tripled in that time. With a strong balance sheet and high occupancy levels, there's no reason to believe the company won't continue its market-beating performance in the coming years. The worst performing bank of 2016 Despite the financial sector rising 20% in 2016, New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) fell by about 3%, making it the worst-performing big U.S. bank stock of the year. NYCB data by YCharts However, the bank's business is completely fine. It's still the leader in its niche market of lending on rent-controlled apartment buildings in New York City. The reason for the poor performance? Well, at first, investors weren't thrilled about the proposed merger with Astoria Financial, as it would not only push NYCB over the $50 billion regulatory threshold, but was sure to compromise the bank's efficiency and asset quality -- its key competitive advantages. And, the merger meant that the bank was sure to cut its high dividend. Then, in December, the merger agreement was surprisingly called off. I was delighted by this news -- after all, as a shareholder myself, I like New York Community Bancorp just the way it is. The market apparently disagreed, as the bank gave up all of its "Trump rally" gains in the latter weeks of the year. It's understandable that the uncertainty caused by these developments would worry investors, but I look at this as a major buying opportunity for a bank that has one of the most rock-solid business models in the industry, not to mention a generous 4.2% dividend yield. Invest for the long term To be perfectly clear, I'm suggesting both of these as long-term investments. Over shorter periods of time (say, five years or less), investors are better off looking elsewhere. For example, while rising interest rates in the coming years could be great for NYCB, they could potentially be terrible for Digital Realty's stock price. Similarly, a recession could send the entire banking sector lower, even if it doesn't have much to do with the health of the banking sector, or NYCB in particular. The point is that both stocks have some major risk factors, but most of them apply to the short-term. Over the long run, these companies both have winning business models that should produce excellent returns for shareholders, as they have in the past.

Vita Coco's parent company -- whose investors include celebrities Madonna and Matthew McConaughey -- has hired JP Morgan to advise it on a sale, three sources said. They declined to be identified as the matter is private. Any sale of U.S.-based Vita Coco would come as traditional fizzy drink sales continue to slow and consumers increasingly turn to healthier drinks like coconut water. The business could attract interest from beverage companies such as PepsiCo, Coca-Cola or Dr Pepper Snapple , which late last year paid $1.7 billion for antioxident drink maker Bai Brands. PepsiCo and Coke are already the No. 2 and 3 producers of coconut water. Founded in 2004 by two childhood friends in New York, Vita Coco now has sales in 30 countries and is the global leader in coconut water, with 26 percent of a market worth $2.5 billion, according to data tracker Euromonitor International. Extracted from young, green coconuts, coconut water now enjoys prime placement in coolers across North America and Europe and was the world's fastest-growing cold drink last year, according to Euromonitor, with sales up 19 percent. "The surging demand for packaged, convenient and enhanced water products is the new engine for the beverages industry," said Euromonitor analyst Howard Telford. "Energy drinks, ready-to-drink brewed beverages and super-premium juices – most notably, coconut water – were all top global performers." Vita Coco and JP Morgan declined to comment on a possible sale. Private investment company Verlinvest, which owns a significant stake in the company, was not immediately available for comment. Verlinvest, the family office of one of the Belgian families related to Anheuser Busch InBev, took a stake in Vita Coco in 2007. In 2014, Vita Coco sold a 25 percent stake to the owner of Red Bull China in a deal that brought the drink to the world's most populous country, and valued its parent company, All Market, at $665 million. Verlinvest, founded in 1995, manages assets worth more than 1.4 billion euros, in sectors including food and beverages, e-commerce and retail. Its current food and drink investments include Popchips snacks, Le Blon cachaca and Swedish oat drink Oatly. It was an early investor in vitamin water maker Glaceau, which Coca-Cola acquired for $4.1 billion in 2007.

Photo Credit: Dan Dalton/Getty Images The best cash-back credit cards offer generous rewards and sign-up bonuses. But the card that's best for you depends on your spending habits and financial situation. Choosing the right card can mean hundreds or thousands of dollars back on your purchases annually. Some cash-back cards offer a flat-rate percentage on purchases, while other cards come with bonuses on specific categories and a flat-rate percentage on general purchases. CreditCards.com recently rounded up the best cash-back credit cards for its annual cash-back card competition, and the finalists were then rated by a panel of judges to narrow down the top three. CARD SEARCH: Compare cash back credit cards. Notably, the judges declared a tie for second place in this category. <!-- iframe --> Here are the three best cash-back credit cards, according to CreditCards.com: 1. Citi® Double Cash Credit Card The Citi® Double Cash Credit Card earns first place in the competition for its generous 1 percent cash back on everyday purchases and 1 percent when you pay your credit card bill on time. It has a simple rewards structure with no categories to track, no cap on cash back and no annual fee. Highlights: The Citi® Double Cash credit card offers a chance to earn cash back twice: 1 percent cash back on general purchases and an additional 1 percent when you pay your bill on time. With that 1-percent-plus-1-percent cash-back structure, this is an industry-leading card for cash back on general purchases. In addition to generous cash back, the Citi® Double Cash credit card has perks including purchase protection, and trip cancellation and interruption protection. This card comes with a 0 percent APR on balance transfers for 18 months. That makes it a good option for those interested in consolidating and paying down debt. Citi® Double Cash cardholders may also benefit from the Citi Price Rewind program. If you register your purchases online, the company will search for lower prices on those items and refund you the difference on better deals. Fees and APR: There's no annual fee with the Citi® Double Cash credit card. This card comes with a variable APR between 13.49 percent and 23.49 percent. Notes: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is best for those who would like an affordable everyday cash-back card with generous rewards on all purchases and an easy-to-use rewards structure. Perhaps the best feature of the Citi® Double Cash card, aside from the chance to earn cash back twice, is its simplicity. There's no chasing bonus categories, no rotating categories and no annual fee. Disadvantages: Carrying a balance can eat up rewards with the Citi® Double Cash card. And this card requires you to pay on time monthly in order to earn an additional 1 percent cash back. If you typically carry a balance, or often fail to pay on time, this may not be the card for you. There's also no sign-up bonus, something you'll find on other competing cards. 2. Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express The Blue Cash Preferred® card tied for second place with the Chase Freedom Unlimited card. Very generous rewards – 6 percent cash back at U.S. supermarkets and 3 percent cash back at gas stations and select department stores – make the Blue Cash Preferred® a top competitor in the cash-back category. Highlights: The Blue Cash Preferred® offers 6 percent cash back at U.S. supermarkets up to $6,000 per year. It also comes with 3 percent cash back at U.S. gas stations and select department stores. On general purchases, this card pays 1 percent back, filling in gaps between its bonus categories. This card offers a $150 statement credit after spending $1,000 on the card within the 1st 3 months of opening an account. Other perks with the Blue Cash Preferred® include a cash back tracker, purchase protection, return protection and roadside assistance. Fees: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card has an APR between 13.49 percent and 23.49 percent, comparable to the other two cards on this list. This card has a $95 annual fee, which is on the high side. But the generous rewards program, when used properly, can offset that fee. Notes: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card is best for those who spend big on groceries, gas and department stores. If you're looking for a card that has rewards for more general spending, another cash-back card may be more beneficial. In addition to its sign-up bonus and rewards, this card offers 0 percent APR on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months. That makes it a good option for anyone interested in financing a big purchase or consolidating and paying down debt. Disadvantages: The $6,000 annual spending cap on groceries means the most you could earn is $360 at 6 percent before the relatively low 1 percent rate kicks in. In addition, American Express isn't as widely accepted as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. That might make it necessary to keep a backup card or use this card strategically with others. 3. Chase Freedom Unlimited Card The Chase Freedom Unlimited card tied for second place with the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card for its low-maintenance rewards and 1.5 percent cash back on every purchase. It's ideal for the busy cardholder who doesn't have time to worry about spending on bonus categories. Highlights: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card pays 1.5 percent cash back on all purchases. While that isn't as generous as competing cards, its simplicity and reliable rewards system makes up for the lower rate. This card offers a $150 statement credit for spending $500 within the first three months of opening an account. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card allows you to redeem for cash anytime at any amount. Cash-back rewards don't expire as long as the card stays open. This card offers a 15-month 0 percent APR period on purchases and balance transfers, making it a good card for those looking to finance a large purchase or pay off debt. Car rental insurance, roadside assistance, price protection and extended warranties are included with this card. Fees: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card comes with a variable APR between 15.49 percent and 24.24 percent. There's no annual fee with this card, making it a more affordable option than the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card from American Express, but on the same fee level as the Citi® Double Cash credit card. Notes: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is best for those who want an easy-to-use everyday cash back card with rewards for all purchases. Those who sign up for the Chase Freedom Unlimited will enjoy its flat 1.5 percent cash back on all purchases, easy redemption, large sign-up bonus and 15-month 0 percent APR period. Disadvantages: While this card can boost your rewards across the board, it isn't ideal if you do a lot of spending in one particular area. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries, the Blue Cash Preferred® card might be a better option. This card also comes with a lower flat rate (1.5 percent) than other cards in its class. The Citi® Double Cash card offers a higher 1 percent cash back on all purchases plus 1 percent cash back for paying your bill on time. Compare Cash Back Cards The bottom line The best cash back credit cards offer generous rewards and easy redemption options, but the card that's ideal for you depends on your spending habits. If you're looking to maximize your rewards across the board, a flat-rate cash back card is your best bet. Likewise, if you spend a lot in certain areas, look for a card with a high cash back rate on particular bonus categories.
