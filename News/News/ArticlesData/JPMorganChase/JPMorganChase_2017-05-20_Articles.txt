Photographer: Bandar Algaloud/Saudi Royal Council via Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Defense contractors were the big winners, but President Donald Trump’s first day in Saudi Arabia yielded a slew of high-profile investment deals that showcased the administration’s ability to draw support from major corporations. Top executives who descended on Riyadh for a CEO summit timed to coincide with Trump’s visit included JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, Blackstone Group LP CEO Steve Schwarzman, and Marillyn Hewson, the CEO of Lockheed Martin Corp. Saturday’s meeting, the “Saudi-U.S. CEO Forum,” drew the kind of corporate firepower Trump suggested he could harness when he ran for the Oval Office as a Washington outsider/business executive who would reach outside the Beltway and enlist other executives in support of the administration’s economic goals. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up More than 30 CEOs of major U.S. companies were on hand for the summit, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Riyadh. Some later joined Trump and Saudi officials at the Royal Court Palace for a deal-signing ceremony. Those who spoke to reporters said they weren’t put off by drama surrounding the Trump White House. “We’re just seeing tremendous opportunity with Trump coming here,” said Steven Demetriou, CEO of Jacobs Engineering Group. Dimon gave a thumbs-up to Trump’s deregulatory agenda in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Most of us in business think that regulations have been holding back growth,” he said. Arms to Infrastructure Arms deals and intentions alone announced on Saturday totaled some $110 billion, in what would be the largest arms package in U.S. history. Meanwhile, Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity manager, announced an agreement with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to invest $100 billion in infrastructure projects, mainly in the U.S. Derided by Trump at times over the cost of the F-35 fighter jet program, Lockheed seemed to have made peace with the White House. Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner phoned Hewson while meeting a Saudi delegation, suggesting Lockheed lower the cost of an anti-missile system it was pitching to the Saudis. Price cut or not, Lockheed racked up more than $28 billion in sales and intentions, the company said in a statement, covering integrated air and missile defense, combat ships, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs. Also on hand in Riyadh was Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg; Trump has at times encouraged Boeing and Lockheed to compete for pricey U.S. defense contacts. “This is a great vote of confidence by the United States in the business environment of Saudi Arabia,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, traveling with the president, said during a press conference. Array of Sales The military sales and intended deals fall broadly into five categories: border security and counterterrorism; maritime and coastal security; air force modernization; air and missile defense; and cybersecurity and communications upgrades, according to a State Department statement. Few details were provided on specific transactions beyond what was announced earlier. Tillerson said some of the systems would help Saudi Arabia conduct more “precise and targeted” air strikes against rebel forces in Yemen. The package “bolsters the Kingdom’s ability to provide for its own security and continue contributing to counterterrorism operations across the region, reducing the burden on U.S. military forces,” the State Department said. It was unclear how details of the sales will be conveyed, including the submission of formal notifications to Congress and publication of memos of understanding to proceed with potential sales that normally take years to complete. Obama-Era Deals Still, “when completed, it will be the largest single arms deal in American history,” Vice Admiral Joe Rixey, head of the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency, said Friday from Saudi Arabia on a conference call with analysts, according to a White House transcript. The package includes deals begun under President Barack Obama’s administration -- and initial steps toward others that may take years to complete. From 2009 to 2016, the Obama administration approved $115 billion in potential sales to the Saudis. The S-70 helicopter deal is a new direct commercial sale between Lockheed and the Saudi government that’s separate from any weapons system proposal administered by the U.S. as part of the formal Foreign Military Sales program, company spokesman Paul Jackson said in an email. Under the umbrella of “Border Security and Counter Terrorism,” the U.S. offers capabilities such as “aerostats, tanks, artillery, counter-mortar radars, armored personnel carriers” and helicopters, the State Department said. Chinook Helicopters People familiar with the transaction told Bloomberg News this week the U.S. and Saudis also planned to sign a letter of agreement for about $500 million in what could become a $3.5 billion deal for as many as 48 CH-47 Chinook helicopters and related equipment built by Boeing. That sale was approved by the State Department and Congress in December. Similarly, the agreement also includes a letter of agreement completing a sale approved in August for about 115 M1A2 tanks made by General Dynamics Corp., as well as munitions, and heavy equipment recovery systems, said people familiar with the deals. Under naval and coastal security improvements, the State Department listed systems such as Lockheed Martin’s Multi-Mission Surface Combatant ship, as well as “helicopters, patrol boats, and associated weapons systems.” The multi-mission vessels are modified versions of the Littoral Combat Ship that Lockheed is building for the U.S. Navy, and would be the first international sale of the vessel, which includes munitions such as Raytheon Co.’s Evolved Sea Sparrow air defense missile. The State Department statement also listed Lockheed’s Patriot and Thaad anti-missile systems as intended to “help Saudi Arabia protect itself and the region from missile or other airborne attacks.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he remains optimistic about the global economy and the prospects for regulatory reform under U.S. President Donald Trump. “Japan is growing more than it has grown in 15 years, Europe is doing well all things considered, America is chugging along,” Dimon said in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg TV on Saturday in Riyadh, where he attended a Saudi-U.S. CEO forum held to coincide with Trump’s visit to the kingdom. “Even the IMF, which is always warning about stuff, is saying the world will grow faster than expected.” Jamie Dimon Photographer: Christophe Morin/Bloomberg Dimon said he’s comfortable about JPMorgan’s future given its positioning in emerging markets like Saudi Arabia, which is moving to privatize assets and gaining increased attention from international investment banks seeking advisory mandates. He also signaled that the bank is unlikely to boost its market share in some businesses even further after recent gains, and repeated his call for fine-tuning bank regulation in the U.S. “The Trump administration wants to deregulate certain things, and most of us in business think that regulations have been holding back growth,” Dimon said. “I’m still optimistic that you’ll have some regulatory reform. Even my Democratic friends understand that it makes sense to look at what was done, what can be done better, what can simplify the burden on businesses.” To read about the bank’s most recent earnings, click here.

Sign Up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this month that breaking up the biggest banks would be a “huge mistake,” just weeks after Trump said his administration was reviewing whether a split made sense. Some administration officials have suggested they are in favor of Congress passing an updated version of the Depression era Glass-Steagall law that split commercial and investment banking, though they have been vague about what that means. It was repealed in 1999. ‘Ability to Compete’ “When they’re talking about Glass-Steagall, they’re saying, would you regulate smaller banks differently than the bigger banks, and that’s perfectly understandable,” Dimon said. “I don’t think it’s going to stop our ability to compete.” In April, the bank beat analysts’ first-quarter profit estimates on better-than-expected trading results and lending margins. Trading revenue rose for a fourth quarter, the longest streak in at least a decade, with a 17 percent advance in fixed income and a surprise increase for equities. “It will be hard to gain” further share in fixed income, Dimon said. Future Acquisitions Dimon also said the bank may consider making acquisitions in financial technology or payment processing in the future, though he’s not considering any deals at the moment. “There is no area we can’t grow organically,” he said. American corporate titans are gathering in Riyadh to boost bilateral ties as the nation moves to diversify its economy. JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc., which received its long-sought after investment-banking license in the kingdom last month, helped arrange a $17.5 billion Saudi bond sale last year and a $9 billion Islamic bond issue in April. Dimon said JPMorgan’s Saudi operations had boomed from two staff during his first trip to the kingdom to about 80 employees today. The bank employs about 30 women locally, including several managing directors. Saudi-U.S. gathering: the background “We’re part of the banking system here, part of the brokerage system here,” Dimon said. “We bank the government and many corporates. We’ll be getting bigger over time as Saudi Arabia and the Middle East grow.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Among those who demurred, a common reason cited at the Wall Street bank's annual meeting in Wilmington, Del., on Tuesday was President Donald Trump, who won the electoral college decisively but lost the popular vote and has ignited criticism with an attempted Muslim travel ban and a pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border. Investors linked Trump's politics to JPMorgan in part to convince Dimon to leave the president's Strategic and Policy Forum, a panel of corporate leaders created to advise the president on creating jobs and fostering economic growth. They also want the largest U.S. lender to refrain from providing financing for private prison operators such as Geo Group and Core Civic  that stand to benefit from roundups of the illegal immigrants Trump pledged to target. The Center for Popular Democracy's organizational development director, Hilary Klein, said during a presentation on behalf of a shareholder that more than 4,000 people have used the Backers of Hate campaign's website to send messages to Dimon urging him to distance himself from the president. The center is one of two groups leading the campaign, which opposes Trump's immigration stance and lists companies from banks to manufacturers that could make money from the president's policies. JPMorgan and other banks that lend to detention facilities indirectly benefit if the Trump agenda is fully implemented, Klein said in a telephone interview after the meeting. "The more people we lock up in prison, the more immigrants we detain in these detention centers, the more these companies stand to profit. So we're calling on them to do the right thing, to distance themselves from the Trump agenda." Dimon, who said he would review the concerns Klein and others described, still declined to leave Trump's advisory panel. He agreed to serve on the committee because he's a patriot, he said, but "that doesn't mean we agree with all the policies his administration comes up with." As president, Trump's role is akin to that of an airplane pilot, Dimon added; he sees himself and JPMorgan as passengers attempting to help. It's an argument not dissimilar from that of Jeffrey Immelt, the General Electric CEO, when responding to questions about why he agreed to serve on former President Barack Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in 2011. "When the president asks, you don't say 'no,'" Immelt said at the time. Dimon's statement that he doesn't always agree with Trump is backed up in his annual letter to investors, where he cited the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement that buoyed U.S. commerce with Mexico; the president had criticized the treaty on the campaign trail as a bad deal and promised to renegotiate it. JPMorgan is a major bank in America's neighbor to the south, garnering $400 million of revenue a year, Dimon said in the letter. NAFTA "helps ensure that the young democracy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist and anti-American leaders," such as former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, he continued. "While there are some clear, identifiable problems with NAFTA," Dimon said, "I believe they will be worked out in a way that is fair and beneficial for both sides. The logic to do so is completely compelling." JPMorgan climbed 0.3% to $87.61 in New York trading after the meeting, pushing its gains over the past year to 42%. All 12 directors nominated by the company were elected to board seats, with none garnering less than 96% support, and a shareholder proposal to split the roles of CEO and chairman was rejected, with 66% of investors voting against it.

Kelly and a lively question and answer session with finance, transportation and urban planning experts. Westchester County, NY (PRWEB) May 15, 2017 The Real Estate Institute at Fordham University’s School of Professional and Continuing Studies and The Business Council of Westchester co-hosted the successful Real Estate Mastermind Forum: 24-Hour Cities - Emerging Trends in Transactions, Technology and Transportation on Wed, May 10. The event, which took place at the University’s West Harrison campus, brought together industry experts and County leaders for a discussion on the future of the real estate market and the makings of a 24-Hour city. Keynote speaker Hugh F. Kelly, PhD, CRE, shared research on Westchester cities’ population density threshold, public safety ratings and office and multifamily transactions. Trends in Metro North ridership and walkability scores were also analyzed. “According to Metro North statistics, there are 64% more commuters on Metro North east of the Hudson Line than there were three decades ago, and only half of the growth is in commutation to and from Manhattan,” said Kelly. “Once you get off the train, Westchester’s downtowns are quite walkable. Walk Score, an algorithmically-based statistic that measures how close residents are to amenities such as coffee shops, restaurants, gyms, etc., ranks many of the County’s downtowns as ‘Walkers Paradises.’ Typically you have to achieve a score of 90 out of 100 to get that ranking, and you see that in towns like White Plains, New Rochelle, Mount Vernon and Yonkers, among others.” Kelly continued, “To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that any organization has tried to look at this from the point of view of suburban cities, so you’re at the cutting edge here in Westchester.” Kelly is a Special Advisor to the Real Estate Institute at Fordham University’s School of Professional and Continuing Studies, a world-renowned economist and the head of his own consulting practice, Hugh F. Kelly Real Estate Economics, as well as the author of 24-Hour Cities: Real Investment Performance, Not Just Promises. A thought-provoking question and answer session with industry experts followed Kelly’s presentation, featuring Michael Patrick Davidson (Managing Director – Global Real Estate, Head of the Americas & World Headquarters, JP Morgan Chase and Co.); Rosemary Scanlon (Chair of the Board, TransitCenter, a nonprofit advocate for public transit; former Chief Economist for PANYNJ; former Divisional Dean at NYU); and David Schiff, AICP (from Kimley-Horn and chair of Westchester/Fairfield Urban Land Institute). In addition to Westchester real estate professionals, Mayor Thomas Roach of White Plains and Mayor Richard Thomas of Mount Vernon were also in attendance. “The inaugural Real Estate Mastermind Forum was a great introduction for Fordham’s Real Estate Institute here in Westchester County, as well as a springboard for a future Master’s program. We were thrilled to work alongside The Business Council of Westchester on such an important event,” said Anthony R. Davidson, PhD, MBA, dean of Fordham’s School of Professional and Continuing Studies. “Between Hugh Kelly’s impressive research and our other industry experts’ thought-provoking questions, we truly brought some of the leading minds together to take a deep look at the potential success and continued growth of Westchester’s cities.” Marsha Gordon, President and CEO of the Business Council of Westchester, said that the program was part of a larger BCW economic development initiative focused on revitalizing Westchester’s urban areas. She said the BCW would be presenting a “Playbook” outlining strategies for the county’s urban areas in the coming months. “We have many vibrant downtowns in Westchester: White Plains, Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle,’’ said Gordon. “Our goal is to focus on attracting companies and developers to these areas as part of an overall economic development strategy. Today’s program offered some very valuable information toward this goal." The Real Estate Mastermind Forum: 24-Hour Cities - Emerging Trends in Transactions, Technology and Transportation was sponsored by Bank of America, Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc., First American Title Insurance Company, and The Yonkers Industrial Development Agency (IDA). ABOUT THE REAL ESTATE INSTITUTE AT FORDHAM’S SCHOOL OF PROFESSIONAL AND CONTINUING STUDIES The Real Estate Institute at Fordham’s School of Professional and Continuing Studies currently offers a comprehensive array of professional certificates and industry events, with an anticipated launch of graduate degrees in the near future.

(WTNH) — The Connecticut Department of Labor has announced that they will be replacing the debit cards with new ones for people using them for unemployment insurance benefits. The Labor Department says they have notified individuals opting to receive their benefits using the debit cards currently issued by Chase Bank that a new KeyBank card will be replacing it. This transition is set to begin at the end of May. The decision is being made because JP Morgan Chase is discontinuing its prepaid card program. Once the red-colored Key2Benefits debit card has been issued to a claimant, any unemployment benefits an individual is entitled to will be placed on the new card. Card holders though should have received a letter to all claimants stating that they should continue to use the Chase debit card until there is no balance left. Any funds remaining on the Chase debit card cannot be transferred to the new KeyBank card. While debit card holders will not see any changes in how benefits are deposited to the card, several new features include free AM balance inquiries at specified banks, free mailed statements, and unlimited free calls to KeyBank’s customer service center. “Although the majority of our customers filing for benefits prefer direct deposit to their savings or checking account, debit cards issued through our bank vendor are always an option,” said State Labor Commissioner Scott D. Jackson. “However, claimants wanting to switch to direct deposit can do this at any time by visiting our secure website at Claimants making the switch to direct deposit must select the green button/message box on the website and after logging in can access the payment method option and provide the necessary banking information. Those seeking additional information about the KeyBank debit card can access a “Frequently Asked Questions” site at Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Done Editing Tags 44 Comments Share this article 52 52 52 Becoming a parent is one more aspect of life poisoned by economic inequality in the United States, with people who are paid more than $75,000 a year twice as likely to get paid leave as people who are paid less than $30,000. And even companies that have touted their parental leave programs leave many of their workers out, giving paid leave to their salaried staff at corporate headquarters but not to the workers standing behind the cash registers or making the cappuccinos or fried chicken. A new report from Paid Leave for the United States highlights the inequality within major U.S. companies: Starbucks has one of the most unequal policies—they provide 18 weeks of fully-paid leave for new mothers and 12 weeks fully paid for new fathers in corporate headquarters, but only six weeks for birth moms who are in-store employees (like baristas) and nothing for dads or adoptive parents in this employment category. Starbucks employs ~5,000 people in its corporate headquarters and ~150,000 in stores; meaning their highly-touted policy affects about 3% of their total U.S. workforce. The nation’s largest private employer, Walmart, provides twelve weeks of paid leave for birth mothers who are corporate employees—but only 6-8 weeks at partial pay for birth moms who are among the 1.2 million hourly employees in their stores - if they work full time. Yum! Brands offers 18 weeks paid parental leave to birth mothers, and 6 weeks to dads and adoptive parents who work in the corporate office only. Field employees, who work for franchises such as KFC and Pizza Hut, receive no paid family leave. A few companies do have equal leave policies for their corporate and frontline workers: Ikea, Levi’s, Nordstrom, Nike (though it leaves out part-time employees), Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Hilton, and Apple.  Just six percent of low-wage workers have any paid leave at all, which is why a quarter of new mothers are back on the job within 10 days. That means that not only are new mothers leaving their newborn babies, they’re working before they are physically recovered from childbirth. And no paid leave can also mean no flexibility even for emergencies; a Walmart worker named Jasmine Dixon told PL+US that: “I had no paid leave and had to go back to work at Walmart two weeks after childbirth. I took Zyon to his first 2-week doctor’s check-up and found out that he needed to go back to the hospital urgently. They took him away in an ambulance – I was terrified for him, and that I might be risking my job at Walmart by coming in late that day. I called my manager to let them know I had to go with my baby to the children’s hospital, but it didn’t matter – my store manager penalized me for missing work.” This decision should not be left to individual companies. The baby of the worker behind the cash register deserves parents at home with her just as much as the baby of the worker behind the computer. Workers shouldn’t have to hope that they’re working at Ikea rather than Starbucks when they have a baby. Paid family leave should be the law of the United States as it is the law of most countries. But we already knew that Republicans hate children. 44 Comments Share this article 52 52 52 44 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

No financial terms were disclosed for the deal that’s expected to close in the third quarter of this year. Steward is backed by Cerberus Capital Management LP while IASIS’s majority shareholder is TPG Capital. PRESS RELEASE BOSTON, May 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Steward Health Care LLC (“Steward”) and IASIS Healthcare LLC (“IASIS”) today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement to merge their operations. The transaction will make Steward the largest private for-profit hospital operator in the United States with 36 hospitals across ten states, managed care operations in Arizona, Utah and Massachusetts, and projected revenues of almost $8 billion in 2018, the first year of consolidated operations. The merger is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2017, subject to customary regulatory approvals, terms and conditions. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Steward currently operates 18 hospitals and directly employs more than 1,300 multi-specialty physicians in locations across Massachusetts, Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania. IASIS operates 17 hospitals and one behavioral health hospital in locations across Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. Through this transaction, Steward will operate nearly 7,500 patient beds across ten states with approximately 38,000 employees including more than 1,800 directly employed multi-specialty physicians and several thousand aligned physicians. The merger with IASIS positions Steward to leverage IASIS’s multi-state operating experience to bring Steward’s new model of health care and its award-winning health care services to patients across the nation. As part of the merger with IASIS, Steward will also begin managing the Health Choice managed care operations, which covers more than 680,000 lives. This will bring the total number of covered lives within Steward’s managed care and health insurance products to more than 1.1 million. “Our physician-driven accountable care model focused on keeping patients healthy is transforming the health care industry as this transaction demonstrates,” said Dr. Ralph de la Torre, Chairman and CEO of Steward Health Care. “Our model shows how the industry can successfully shift toward a more cost-effective local, coordinated approach that puts patients first.” The new model of health care practiced by Steward emphasizes quality care and wellness. Steward pioneered its health care model in Massachusetts, where it turned around some of the state’s most struggling hospitals into a thriving health system that improved outcomes, lowered costs, and decreased overall health care spending. W. Carl Whitmer, President and Chief Executive of IASIS, said, “Since its formation nearly 20 years ago, IASIS’s mission has been to deliver high-quality, cost-effective healthcare to our patients and the communities we serve. We have accomplished this goal by investing in our growing hospitals and talented employees and by providing a broad and differentiated set of capabilities and assets to our high-growth, community-focused urban and suburban hospital markets. Steward’s innovative approach to reducing health care cost and improving quality of service will further this mission. It will be business as usual while all of us work toward a seamless merger of our operations.” IASIS Healthcare’s 18 hospitals will all be merging under Steward Health Care, including: Arizona Mountain Vista Medical Center (Mesa, AZ) St. Luke’s Behavioral Health Center (Phoenix, AZ) St. Luke’s Medical Center (Phoenix, AZ) Tempe St. Luke’s Hospital (Tempe, AZ) Arkansas Wadley Regional Medical Center at Hope (Hope, AR) Colorado Pikes Peak Regional Hospital (Woodland Park, CO) Louisiana Glenwood Regional Medical Center (West Monroe, LA) Texas The Medical Center of Southeast Texas (Port Arthur, TX) The Medical Center of Southeast Texas – Victory Campus (Beaumont, TX) Odessa Regional Medical Center (Odessa, TX) Southwest General Hospital (San Antonio, TX) St. Joseph Medical Center (Houston, TX) Wadley Regional Medical Center (Texarkana, TX) Utah Davis Hospital and Medical Center (Layton, UT) Jordan Valley Medical Center (West Jordan, UT) Jordan Valley Medical Center West Valley Campus (West Valley City, UT) Mountain Point Medical Center (Lehi, UT) Salt Lake Regional Medical Center (Salt Lake City, UT) Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (“MPT”) has agreed to acquire the interests of substantially all of IASIS’s hospital real estate subject to long term leases and loans with Steward. Under terms of the merger agreement, cash proceeds paid by MPT and other financing sources will be used to retire IASIS’s senior secured term loans and unsecured notes. Remaining cash proceeds will be paid to IASIS equity holders, including its majority stockholder, TPG Capital.

Financial services firms need a regulated subsidiary in an EU country to offer their products across the bloc, and this could lead some to move jobs out of Britain if it loses access to the European single market. Thirteen major banks have given an indication of how they would bulk up their operations in Europe to secure market access. These plans could see more than 9,000 jobs move to the continent in the next two years. Following are some details and reports on the subject: STANDARD CHARTERED Standard Chartered <STAN.L> is in talks with regulators about making Frankfurt its European base to secure market access to the European Union when Britain leaves the bloc. HSBC Stuart Gulliver, CEO of HSBC <HSBA.L>, Europe’s biggest bank, said it would relocate staff responsible for generating around a fifth of its UK-based trading revenue, or around 1,000 people, to Paris. Chairman Douglas Flint has told lawmakers that banks without operations elsewhere in the EU will likely trigger migration plans immediately after EU divorce talks begin, estimating “tens of thousands” of jobs are linked to EU “passporting” rights. BARCLAYS Banks in Britain will start shifting some operations to continental Europe reasonably soon to avoid disrupting links with customers after Brexit, Barclays <BARC.L> Chief Executive Jes Staley said. He added that obtaining a licence to trade on the continent and changing financial contracts to another jurisdiction took a year to 18 months. The bank is preparing to make Dublin its EU headquarters after Brexit, according to a source familiar with the matter. Staley previously told BBC Radio that Barclays would keep the bulk of its activities in Britain after Brexit and any changes to how the bank operates would be small and manageable. UBS Swiss bank UBS <UBSG.S> would have to “move 1,500 people” from London to an EU destination in order to retain full passporting rights across the EU, according to UBS chairman Axel Weber. That would be more than a quarter of its current 5,500 staff in London. Separately, Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti has said UBS has a degree of flexibility if its UK outpost looks set to lose its ability to operate across the EU. The world’s biggest wealth manager has also set up a bank in Frankfurt to consolidate most of its European wealth management operations, after the Brexit vote dashed London’s chances of being the host city. CREDIT SUISSE Credit Suisse’s <CSGN.S> Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam said in September his bank was relatively well placed to deal with the impact of Brexit and that only around 15-20 percent of volumes in the investment bank would be impacted. LLOYDS BANKING GROUP Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L>, Britain’s largest mortgage lender and the only major British retail bank without a subsidiary in another EU country, is close to selecting Berlin as a European base to secure market access to the EU after Britain withdraws. GOLDMAN SACHS U.S. bank Goldman Sachs <GS.N> is considering moving up to 1,000 staff from London to Frankfurt because of concerns over Brexit, Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper reported in January, citing financial sources. Goldman Sachs will begin moving hundreds of people out of London before any Brexit deal is struck as part of its contingency plans, the Wall Street firm’s Europe CEO said in March. Three people familiar with the matter told Reuters in November that Goldman Sachs was considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt. MORGAN STANLEY U.S. bank Morgan Stanley <MS.N> has identified many of the roles that will need to be moved from Britain after Brexit, sources involved in the processes told Reuters. Morgan Stanley, which bases the bulk of its European staff in Britain, will have to move up to 1,000 jobs in sales and trading, risk management, legal and compliance, as well as slimming the back office in favour of locations overseas, one source told Reuters. Morgan Stanley may initially shift 300 staff from Britain following its exit from the EU, and is scouting for office space in Frankfurt and Dublin, Bloomberg News reported in February. CITIGROUP Citigroup <C.N>, which has also identified roles that will need to be moved out of the UK and has a large banking unit in Dublin, will need to move 100 posts in its sales and trading business, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Separately, Citigroup’s European chief said the U.S. bank would make a decision on its Brexit contingency plans in the first half of the year and choose from a number of potential EU countries to relocate some investment banking business. JPMORGAN JPMorgan Chase <JPM.N> has agreed to buy a Dublin building with room for 1,000 staff in the first sign of a financial services company expanding significantly in Ireland since the government began a major campaign to attract firms after Brexit. However, the bank, which currently employs around 500 people in Dublin, did not say how many jobs would be created or whether any positions would be moved from the United Kingdom. Daniel Pinto, head of investment banking at the Wall Street firm, had told Bloomberg on May 3 that the firm planned to move hundreds of London-based bankers to expanded offices in Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg. CEO Jamie Dimon had previously said the bank was not planning to move many jobs out of Britain in the next two years. Before the vote, Dimon said the bank would be forced to move 4,000 of its 16,000 staff currently based in Britain if the country loses access to the single market. BANK OF AMERICA CORP Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> said in August its businesses and results could be adversely affected and it may have to incur additional costs if Brexit limited the ability of its UK entities to conduct business in the EU. Dublin is Bank of America’s default option for a new base within the EU, but other centres are on the table and no decision has yet been made, an executive said in Germany on March 14. DEUTSCHE BANK Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> warned on April 26 up to 4,000 UK jobs could be moved to Frankfurt and other locations in the EU as a result of Brexit – the highest potential move of any bank. EUROCLEAR Settlement bank Euroclear is looking at the option of setting up a branch or subsidiary to provide a route between its UK and Irish markets following Brexit, the head of its UK and Irish operation said. DAIWA SAECURITIES GROUP Daiwa Securities Group Inc <8601.T>, Japan’s No. 2 brokerage firm, may decide as early as mid-June to move dozens of London-based staff to Frankfurt or another European city, ahead of Britain’s exit from the EU, Chief Executive Seiji Nakata said. The German city is Daiwa’s favoured destination, as London-based staff can easily be transferred to its investment banking branch in Frankfurt, Nakata said. Daiwa said it would keep staff in London even after Brexit, but declined to say how many. It currently employs around 450 people in the EU, mostly in the British capital. JULIUS BAER Britain’s planned departure from the European Union opens the door for a UK-Swiss deal covering financial services, said Boris Collardi, chief executive at Julius Baer, Switzerland’s third-biggest private bank.

The bipartisan legislation would provide clear and equal protections under federal law for all Americans in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury service, and federally-funded programs. Today, in a majority of U.S. states (31), LGBTQ people remain at risk of being fired, evicted or denied services because of who they are. 'No person's fundamental rights should be determined by which side of a state line they live on,' said HRC President Chad Griffin. 'The Equality Act will once and for all end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that leaves LGBTQ people at risk. Every American should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live their lives without fear of discrimination. And at its core, that's what the Equality Act is all about.' Discrimination is a real and persistent problem for far too many LGBTQ Americans. HRC polling has found that nearly two-thirds of self-identified LGBTQ Americans report experiencing discrimination - including people like Carter Brown, a transgender man from Texas who lost his job after he was outed by his colleagues. Currently, 50 percent of LGBTQ Americans like Mr. Brown live in states where they are at risk of being fired, denied housing, or refused service because of who they are. There is no federal law explicitly protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, and 31 states still lack fully-inclusive non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. Today's announcement included unprecedented support from the business community: 92 major corporations have now joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. While the overwhelming majority of America's leading businesses have already started addressing workplace fairness for LGBTQ employees, these major employers know how important the need is for a federal standard that treats all employees the same no matter which state they live in. The slate of companies endorsing the Equality Act have combined operations in all 50 states, headquarters spanning 23 states, and collectively generate $2.6 trillion in revenue. In total, these companies employ more than 5.8 million people across the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans support full federal equality for LGBTQ people. Polling released last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that support for a bill like the Equality Act topped 70 percent nationally, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. PRRI's groundbreaking survey included 42,000 interviews in 50 states and found majority support for the Equality Act in all 50 states. The Equality Act is co-sponsored by 240 members of Congress. It was first introduced in 2015 by Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) and by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). Major corporations in the HRC Business Coalition for the Equality Act include Abercrombie & Fitch Co.; Accenture; Adobe Systems Inc.; Advanced Micro Devices Inc.; Airbnb Inc.; Alcoa Inc.; Amazon.com Inc.; American Airlines; American Eagle Outfitters; American Express Global Business Travel; Apple Inc.; Arconic; Automatic Data Processing Inc.; Bank of America; Best Buy Co., Inc.; Biogen; Boehringer Ingelheim USA Corp.; Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.; Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.; Brown-Forman Corp.; CA Technologies Inc.; Caesars Entertainment Corp.; Capital One Financial Corp.; Cardinal Health Inc.; Cargill Inc.; Chevron Corp.; Choice Hotels International Inc.; Cisco Systems Inc.; The Coca-Cola Co.; Corning Inc.; Cox Enterprises; CVS Health Corp.; Darden Restaurants Inc.; Delhaize America Inc.; Diageo North America; The Dow Chemical Co.; Dropbox Inc.; E.
