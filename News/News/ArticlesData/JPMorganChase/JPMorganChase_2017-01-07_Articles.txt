If interest rates continue to climb, profits at the nation's biggest bank by assets should follow suit, lifting its share price higher. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 7, 2017 at 9:49AM Image source: The Motley Fool. Last year was a year to remember for bank stocks, many of which surged by double-digits after the presidential election in November convinced investors that profits in the industry could soon improve. But while 2017 offers a new slate of risks and rewards, it could turn out to be yet another very good year for the nation's biggest bank by assets, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). The December rate hike At the end of last year, the Federal Reserve raised the fed funds rate, the primary short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States, for only the second time since the financial crisis. "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year," the Fed wrote in its press release announcing the move. Although the central bank only increased rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point, the move nevertheless confirms that the economy is still headed in the right direction, continuing its slow but steady recovery from the 2008 crisis. It's also significant because banks make more money when interest rates are higher. US Target Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts. In JPMorgan Chase's case, its latest interest rate sensitivity analysis shows that a 100 basis point increase in short- and long-term rates would translate into $2.8 billion in additional net interest income in the 12 months following the rate hike. And if rates were to climb by 200 basis points, or two percentage points, then JPMorgan Chase would stand to earn an added $4.5 billion worth of net interest income. Strictly speaking, that additional income counts as revenue, not earnings. But because higher interest rates don't require a bank to spend more money to hire new employees or open new branches, most of that revenue falls directly to the bottom line. The net result is that higher interest rates will almost necessarily translate into fatter profits for JPMorgan Chase. More rate hikes on the horizon Of course, the 25 basis point increase in December was only a fraction of the 100 basis points that JPMorgan Chase needs to generate the full $2.8 billion in added annual net interest income alluded to in its interest rate sensitivity analysis. But there are reasons to be optimistic on this score. In the first place, long-term rates shot up faster than short-term rates in the final months of last year. Between the end of September and the beginning of 2017, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, the primary long-term interest rate benchmark in the United States, climbed from 1.6% to 2.5%. That equates to 90 basis points. 10 Year Treasury Rate data by YCharts. And there's reason to believe that short-term rates will follow suit in 2017, as the majority of the members of the Fed's monetary policy committee are targeting a fed funds rate of between 1.25% and 1.5% or higher by the end of this year. This calls for at least three rate hikes of 25 basis points in 2017, bringing the total increase in short-term rates to 100 basis points after factoring in the Fed's move in December. This doesn't necessarily mean that JPMorgan Chase's stock is a screaming bargain. After all, it did climb 31% last year. However, even though it's much more expensive now than it was six months ago, it's still not excessively overvalued, trading at a 30% premium to its book value compared to the two or more times book value that's generally associated with overvalued bank stocks.

The officials' remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the U.S. bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible", some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry's head of fiscal policy office, said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. "The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data," Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. The regulation will "hopefully" be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. "The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed," Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Indonesia's sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. JPMorgan's skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the "fire-wall" between the bank's business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but "there's still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors." BCA is Indonesia's biggest bank by market value and one of the country's primary dealers.

"I expect the drug stocks will be a mixed bag, but the banks should be in hog heaven," the "Mad Money" host said. Before diving into bank earnings on Friday, Cramer will have his eye on the drug stocks, kicking the week off with the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Usually conferences aren't powerful enough to move the tape, but the JPMorgan conference is the biggest and most important of its kind and could provide powerful insight to the drug stocks. Cramer will be focused specifically on the drug stocks that can break news. After shares of Constellation Brands plunged 7 percent on Thursday, Jim Cramer did his homework to see if it was time to reshuffle his beer stocks. Constellation Brands is the world's leading purveyor of premium wines and alcohol, and also imports popular Mexican beer brands like Corona, Modelo and Pacifico into the U.S. Cramer attributed the shares falling to beer sales that weren't strong enough for the bulls, but mainly, due to concerns over President-elect Donald Trump's agenda. "Investors are worried that the company could get hurt if the Trump administration imposes some kind of cross-border tariff on Mexican imports," Cramer said. After speaking with Constellation's CEO Rob Sands on Thursday, Cramer came to the conclusion that fears of Trump's agenda are overblown. It's not like Ford or General Motors moving an auto plant from Michigan to Mexico. If they made a Mexican beer in the U.S., it wouldn't really be a Mexican beer. Airline stocks suddenly seemed to be flying high recently thanks to the pro-business agenda expected of Trump and Warren Buffett's blessing. However, with 2017 in full swing, that sentiment on the group seems to have cooled rapidly. In the past two days, there were two bearish calls on airlines from Cowen and Morgan Stanley. "If you have been riding these stocks up, I don't blame anybody who wants to take their cue from this negative research and ring the register up here," Cramer said. Now that the airlines have had a huge run, he expects the stocks to become less attractive if they head higher. Meredith Davis | Reuters People look at AGCO equipment as they attend National Farm Machinery show in Louisville, Kentucky, February 12, 2016. The radical rally in the stock market ever since Election Day is powered by stocks like Agco Corporation, Cramer says. Unless you watch "Mad Money" on a consistent basis or own a farm, you may not even know Agco. It is an agriculture company that is a mixture of brands like Fendt, Massey-Ferguson and GSI. CEO Martin Richenhagen has been steering his company quietly to accumulate castoff businesses and spend money to revitalize them. Agco has also been quietly buying back its stock on a bet that the cycle of agriculture was ready to turn. "Martin's stock is going to go higher because he freakin' bought the heck out of it when it was much lower, and now there is no supply," Cramer said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer provided his opinion on various stocks from callers: Western Digital: "Western Digital is at $70 and I think it goes to $85. When we had management on they made me feel even better about the stock than had going in because I like flash memory. I like the Sandisk acquisition, I like them." Ferrellgas Partners: "There are forces going on in the propane business right now that trade day-to-day ... It is too hard. I would not sell it down here, but you have to understand that the cross-currents in that business are insane."

In general, financial stocks have made solid gains through the end of 2016, with a tremendous tailwind from the Trump rally. Considering a recent rate hike from the Federal Reserve, with potentially more to come, this sector could just be getting started. But for now we can see if this rally is fundamentally sound. 24/7 Wall St. has put together a preview of some of the major financial companies kicking off the new earnings reporting season. Markets have been pushed to record highs in the wake of the U.S. presidential election, and these major banks reporting can set the tone for earnings going forward. 24/7 Wall St. has taken a look at all the Dow stocks and made a bullish and bearish case for each. The financial stocks had an especially strong case for 2017. Here, we have included the consensus earnings estimates from Thomson Reuters and the stock price and trading history, as well as some additional color on each. Keep in mind that the earnings and revenue estimates may change ahead of the formal reports, and some companies may reschedule reporting dates as well. Bank of America The Thomson Reuters consensus estimates on Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) are calling for earnings per share (EPS) of $0.38 and $20.96 billion in revenue. The same period of last year reportedly had $0.27 in EPS and revenue of $19.56 billion. This bank seems to be out of the regulatory penalty box and is said to be among the best positioned of the larger banks to win off of higher interest rates ahead. It is valued at 0.95 times book value and at almost 14 times forward earnings expectations. Shares were changing hands at $22.68 on Friday’s close. The consensus analyst price target is $22.94, and the 52-week trading range is $10.99 to $23.39. JPMorgan For JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), the consensus forecast is $1.43 in EPS but $23.95 billion in revenue. In the same period of last year, the megabank posted EPS of had $1.32 and $23.75 billion in revenue. Currently, the company is valued at 1.38 times book value, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of roughly 13.4. JPMorgan is considered one of the best banks that can benefit from Trump taking office. Not to mention that CEO Jamie Dimon is yet again considered the best major banker in America, he also just recently took over the chairman position of the Business Roundtable. Shares closed trading at $86.12 on Friday. The consensus price target is just $84.62. The 52-week range is $52.50 to $87.76. Wells Fargo Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) has consensus estimates of $1.00 in EPS and revenue of $22.47 billion. The fourth quarter of last year reportedly EPS of had $1.03 and $21.59 billion in revenue. Wells Fargo is perhaps very welcoming of a Trump presidency, for a few reasons. First, the stock has recovered handily from its huge debacle earlier this fall, and loyal shareholders were rewarded. Second, the news flow has been absolutely transfixed on Trump winning the presidency, taking some of the heat off of Wells Fargo with former CEO Stumpf stepping down a distant memory. Also, it goes without saying but Wells Fargo will definitely benefit from the higher interest rates that are potentially on the horizon. Shares ended the week at $55.04, in a 52-week range of $43.55 to $58.02. The consensus price target is $56.17.

Banks report earnings: Welcome to earnings season. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (CBEAX) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are set to release their fourth quarter earnings on Friday. All three banks had a strong showing in the third quarter -- even Wells Fargo beat Wall Street's expectations, despite its phony account scandal. So expectations are high. The so-called Trump rally, which has sent stocks soaring since the election, has been largely carried by financial institutions. That's because investors expect the Republican to roll back regulations like Dodd-Frank, which would increase the bottom line of big banks. And tax cuts from President-elect Donald Trump and Congress, plus a possible rate hike from the Fed, won't hurt. A global trade war, on the other hand, would.

Trump press conference: The president elect says he'll hold a press conference -- his first since July -- on Wednesday. Previously, Trump has said that such a news conference would give him a chance to talk to the media about the future of his businesses. Critics fear that a multitude of conflicts could arise from Trump's sprawling business entanglements, hampering his judgment when he takes office. Trump has made efforts to distance himself from his businesses, but it's not clear how effective they'll be. He put his three eldest children in charge of the Trump Organization, but they've remained a key part of his transition team. Expect some questions about that. Related: Trump sets first news conference since election for Jan. 11 3. Rex Tillerson's confirmation: On Wednesday, the Senate will decide whether to confirm Rex Tillerson as the next secretary of state. Members of the senate will likely see the Tillerson's ties with Russia and his relationship with ExxonMobil (XOM) -- where he served as chief executive until December -- as potential conflicts of interest. Tillerson's confirmation could be good news for ExxonMobil and other oil giants. If the Trump administration lifts Russian sanctions, ExxonMobil will be able to move forward with deals worth billions of dollars. That would be a boon for the company, which has been struggling to cope with falling oil prices and is facing a lawsuit over climate change.

Monday marks ten years since Apple (AAPL, Tech30) first announced the iPhone. A decade later, there's a lot of pressure on Apple to deliver with their next device, which is slated to appear on the market in fall of this year. In 2016, Apple announced its first sales decline since 2001. The disappointing year hit CEO Tim Cook's wallet directly -- he took a 15% pay cut last year. And the latest iPhone released in September of last year, received a cool reception. Maybe some first iPhone nostalgia will do Apple good. If not, there's always the chance that another exploding Samsung (SSNLF) battery will help save the day.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 8, 2017 at 8:08AM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. There's bad news in the world of credit card reward points, as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) just announced that it's cutting the bonus points on its Chase Sapphire Reserve Card in half. An instant success The card was an instant success last year when JPMorgan Chase announced it, thanks to the card's generous rewards points. "I have never seen such interest in a credit card, and I've been doing this for 15 years," travel blogger Gary Leff told the Associated Press at the time. The main draw was the 100,000 points that cardholders get for spending at least $4,000 on the card in the first three months. That equates to approximately $1,500 worth of travel rewards. The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card provides a major recurring benefit as well -- that is, beyond the sign-up bonus. It comes with a $300 annual credit that can be used toward travel. There's the usual litany of rewards, too. Cardholders get three points for every dollar spent on travel and at restaurants, access to luxury airport lounges, and the ability to transfer points earned to leading airline and hotel loyalty programs. Even with its hefty $450 annual fee, it's easy to see why the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card may be the best travel reward card of all time. Too good to be true It now seems, in fact, as if it may have been too good to be true. Chase just announced that it's cutting the sign-up bonus in half. Now, instead of getting 100,000 points for signing up and spending $4,000 within the first three months, new cardholders will get 50,000 points. That's still a lot of points -- it's equivalent to $750 worth of travel rewards -- but it's a far cry from the original deal. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Chase is chalking this up to marketing, noting that decreasing the sign-up bonus was always part of its plan. "We wanted to get people's attention with the 100,000 point bonus and we were delighted with the response," a spokesperson for Chase told Yahoo! Finance. This may be true, though it's also worth noting that the popularity of the card caught even JPMorgan Chase by surprise. This could have factored into the equation as well. It ran out of the metal used to make the cards not long after introducing it. And on the bank's latest earnings call, its chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, noted that revenue in its credit card division would be down by $200 million as a result of the offer. It's not too late Fortunately, for anyone out there who still wants to get in on this, there's still time. You have until Jan. 11 to apply for the card on JPMorgan Chase's website here. Or if you're willing to visit one of its branches, you can apply for a card in person at a Chase location at any time until March 12. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

 The biggest healthcare investor conference starts this week — here are the 5 things we expect to get out of it Lydia Ramsey Jan. 9, 2017, 10:03 AM 4,332 facebook linkedin twitter email print Wikimedia Commons The second week of January is a busy time for drug companies.  Starting Monday, thousands of pharmaceutical industry executives, investors, bankers, and analysts will swarm into San Francisco for the JPMorgan healthcare conference. Now in its 35th year, the conference has ballooned from a small event with 150 attendees that was essentially the "birth of biotech," to an event attended by everyone from the biggest pharma company to the smallest biotech. It's a spot for these companies to meet with investors and each other, and can be the starting point for takeovers or other deals.  "If there's a place to be selling yourself, this is the place," said Jamie Streator, managing director of healthcare investment banking at Cowen and Co. It's also a great venue for deals to be announced — as has already happened with the $5.2 billion takeover of Ariad Pharmaceuticals. But it's not just M&A that people will be wondering about. From the political environment to the "next big thing" in treatments, here are some of the key themes we'll be asking about this week.  What cycle we're on: the year of gene therapies One of the biggest questions we have going into 2017 is what's going to be the buzziest technology or disease area for 2017. That answer might be something that's been heard before. Conference veterans told Business Insider that the biggest topics tend to come in big waves.  "Pharma companies are lemmings. When they see something that's cool, they all jump on it and say I gotta have it," Doug MacDougall, managing partner at MacDougall Biomedical Communications told Business Insider. That doesn't always pan out right away, though. Sometimes, the treatments don't work, and it takes a few more missteps before a company can figure out how to get it right. Or, alternatively, the new technology or treatment could be early days.  Last year, companies using the gene-editing technology CRISPR were the big deal from an emerging technology perspective. But even as fast as the development's going right now, we're still a few years from seeing how well it can work in humans. This year is gearing up to be a big one for cell and gene therapies — in which genes that cause diseases are replaced or turned off, 2017 could finally yield some good news. Development of these was stalled in 1999 following the death of an 18-year-old who was taking part in an experimental trial. CAR T-cell therapy, which is short for "chimeric antigen receptor" T-cell therapy, meanwhile, takes a person's own cells, takes them out of the body, reengineers them, then puts the cells back in the body where they can attack a particular cancer cell. Two companies have said they plan to submit their cell therapies to the FDA in 2017.  The inescapable conversation of drug pricing After the US presidential election, investors were relieved. Biotechnology stocks rose 13.3% by the end of the week following the election. Investors had been skittish about what a Hillary Clinton presidency would mean for regulation of drug development and pricing, and she often sent drugmakers' stocks falling with her comments on Twitter. Donald Trump, on the other hand, had been less clear about his thoughts on drug pricing. In December, Trump cleared that up in an interview with Time magazine, saying, "I’m going to bring down drug prices. I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices." The biotech index was down about 3% that day on the news, but has since bounced back. Google Finance With Trump calling out companies on Twitter, there is some concern that he might do the same to drugmakers. It's just a question of how companies will respond when that happens, and if any legislation will happen that take on drug price hikes.  It will also be interesting to see if more companies start to consider alternatives to routinely increasing prices, or if more will commit to capping price increases to less than 10%, as Novo Nordisk and Allergan have.  Where is all the M&A? 2016 wasn't exactly a blockbuster year for mergers and acquisitions — at least compared with years past. Bloomberg reports there was $91 billion worth of M&A that happened in 2016, down from $118 billion the year before.  But deals between drugmakers don't always entail the sale of entire companies. More often, especially as the appetite for big ticket purchases wane, companies partner up on the development or commercialization of a promising drug.  "What's happened in the evolution of the conference over the last 15, 20 years is it's really become more of a business development conference than just an investment conference," MacDougall said.  Tonix Pharmaceuticals CEO Seth Lederman, whose company is developing a drug for PTSD, said he is heading to San Francisco with the hope of finding a partner that will help them commercialize the drug, which is gearing up for a phase 3 trial, as opposed to acquiring the company outright. Of course, such a deal could lead to a sale later, he says. "I like the term, 'rent to buy,'" he said.   Basically, the ideal situation is that the commercial partner ends up becoming the company that acquires smaller biotech. In some cases, (take: Pharmacyclics' sale to AbbVie rather than its partner Johnson & Johnson), that's not how things play out, but Lederman said, that could be a good thing if the pharma partner is low-balling the smaller biotech.  The drug pipeline Drugmakers are in need of a jump start to 2017 after a somewhat disappointing 2016. In 2016, 22 new drugs got approved by the FDA, down from 45 the year before.  And big pharma's track record for developing new drugs is increasingly getting worse. According to a report released last month by Deloitte, research and develop returns for big pharmaceutical companies are declining, down in 2016 to 3.7% from 10.1% back in 2010. The answer, however, might not be to get even bigger through M&A (since, as Deloitte found, bigger companies had a negative relationship with returns on R&D investments). Finding the right partnerships with development-stage companies will be crucial to changing up pharma's track record. But we'll be interested in hearing how pharma plans to adapt from relying on blockbusters and routine price hikes to innovative, new treatments in potentially uncharted areas.  Going public? 2016 was a relatively quiet year for biotech IPOs, in part because the biotech sector was down 21.47% overall, compared to the 10.78% rise the S&P 500 index last year.  2017 is off to a hopeful start with an IPO filing from cancer drugmaker Jounce Therapeutics already in the bag, and  Silicon Valley Bank is predicting 28-32 biopharma IPO deals in 2017, calling the environment "healthy." In particular, SVB noted that medical device IPOs will double in 2017 (in 2016, there were just 3).   SEE ALSO: A startup that wants to create a simple blood test for every form of cancer is trying to raise at least $1 billion DON'T MISS: A new kind of cancer treatment works remarkably well for some patients but not others — and researchers want to know why NOW WATCH: A Harvard business professor explains a legal form of 'insider trading' in America Loading video...

TODAY file photo mail print View all comments Tweet By Bernard Aw - - Published: 7:00 PM, January 7, 2017 SINGAPORE — The global economy ended 2016 on a solid footing, showing signs of stronger growth towards the end of the year, though accompanied by surging prices. The JPMorgan Global PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index), compiled by Markit, indicated that the expansion in worldwide business conditions in the fourth quarter was the strongest since the third quarter of 2015. The latest data signal a welcome improvement from the lacklustre growth seen earlier last year. However, a side effect of greater growth momentum was intensifying inflationary pressures. Average cost burdens faced by businesses rose by the greatest extent in over five years during December. Especially large increases in input prices were observed in manufacturing, reflecting higher commodity and raw material prices, especially for oil and industrial metals. In many cases, the stronger US dollar was reportedly behind sharply faster imported inflation. At the same time, the latest Caixin PMI showed a sustained upturn in China’s business conditions during the final quarter in 2016, which helped to limit job cuts. However, the improvement has yet to be accompanied by stronger growth in private investment, suggesting that businesses remain cautious. Expectations of slowing support from fiscal and monetary policies, as well as uncertainties concerning global trade growth, are among the economic headwinds in China this year. We’ll look for confirmation in official data this week, which include US inflation and retail sales numbers, Euro-area industrial output, as well as China’s latest data on inflation, credit growth, and trade. This is important because affirmation of the view that global growth is gathering momentum alongside rising prices will be hawkish for global monetary policy, especially for the US central bank. But another area of concerns that emerged is the extent to which the PMI surveys point to only weak increases in prices charged by businesses, suggesting that profit margins are being squeezed. This situation was particularly pronounced in emerging markets where the companies are facing higher oil prices and a weaker local currency against the US dollar. Tighter margins adversely influence companies’ hiring plans. Employment levels across emerging markets continued to fall, as firms prioritised cost management over staff expansion. On the foreign exchange front, daily midpoint fixes for the yuan will be closely monitored, as it may impact dollar movements. Although expectations of a steeper US rate hike trajectory and fiscal stimulus have been key drivers for dollar strength, PBOC’s move on the yuan hinted at concerns over a resurgence of large capital outflows.

Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster US interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 per cent of Indonesia’s government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system, said Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry’s head of fiscal policy office. “The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data,” Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of November 25. The officials’ comments came after Indonesia cut business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the US bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to “underweight” from “overweight”. The Finance Ministry dropped JPMorgan’s services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The regulation will “hopefully” be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. “The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed,” Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah (RM6.8 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the US presidential election on November 8. JPMorgan’s skirmish with the Indonesian government highlights the conflict banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run of the mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the “fire-wall” between the bank’s business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but “there’s still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors.” BCA is Indonesia’s biggest bank by market value and one of the country’s primary dealers. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Job cuts, fewer flights?

Another test for the rally will be the start of fourth-quarter earning seasons, and first up are financials, the leaders of the Trump rally with a near 18 percent gain since Nov. 8. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC Financial and others report Friday. Earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to increase by 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter, but the S&P financial sector earnings are expected to have the biggest gains, with earnings up 15.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. The sector has bounced hard on the prospect of higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve, which would help bank profitability. The stocks also are rising on Trump's vow to end excess regulation. Besides banks, names like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are in that financial group and both are trading at near decade highs. Goldman is up 35 percent since the election, and has been leading the Dow. "I suspect earnings are going to be pretty darn good, but the problem is expectations are going up too," said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital. "Given the movement in some of these stock prices, you better hope they're outperforming expectations." President-elect Trump has been credited with being a major catalyst behind the market's rally since election day, though some analysts say the market and economy were already poised for improvement. "Right now the market has been floating on the illusion of optimism, and does that turn into a false sense of security?" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Redler said Trump sparked the rally when he spoke in the early hours of Nov. 9. That victory speech has been credited with turning collapsing stock futures into a two-month rally. Trump focused on the pro-growth programs, like infrastructure spending and corporate tax breaks, that Wall Street has latched on to. He did not dwell on tariffs or trade proposals that had made Wall Street nervous before the election and are still a concern for some strategists. "All eyes will be on [President Barack] Obama's farewell speech Tuesday and then President-elect Trump's first press conference on Wednesday," said Redler. "We'll be trying to figure out what his tone is like. It will be a kind of pre-game for the inauguration. Traders would like the tone to be like he had in his election speech when he was claiming victory, versus what we've seen in the last few sessions." In the past week, Trump has repeatedly doubted the intelligence community's findings on Russian interference with the election. The intelligence findings concluded that President Vladimir Putin ordered an "influence campaign" but it turned into a "clear preference" for Trump. After a briefing with U.S. intelligence officials Friday, Trump said other nations like Russia and China are consistently attempting cyber break-ins against U.S. institutions, and he would form a team to combat these attacks. He also said there was no impact on the outcome of the election. In some of his first dealings with Congress in the past week, he called Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York "head clown" in a tweet. He has also criticized car companies, including Toyota, this past week. He warned the Japanese company in a tweet that it will face hefty taxes at the border if it tries to import cars into the U.S. from a new plant in Mexico. "I'd be more worried about his tweets than his press conference," said Paulsen, adding the press briefing is "going to capture more attention. We've never had one since he's been elected president." Besides the news conference, there will be confirmation hearings for the Trump Cabinet, including former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Wall Street economists and strategists have been trying to handicap the Trump agenda, and put time frames around when his programs could start spurring more growth. Expectations vary on when there will be some impact. They also want to see a timeline on the tax overhaul, since companies will be more inclined to start spending and taking other action if they see a concrete plan. Because of the unknowns, some economists do not forecast much impact at all this year, yet the stock market has run higher on the prospect of positive change. "I would think there would be a lot of questions as to what his agenda is, what he looks to accomplish in his first 100 days. It could have some short-term impact, in terms of what he chooses precisely. I don't think this is going to have much lasting impact, but it could create some volatility," Paulsen said. Besides earnings, there are also a few key economic reports including retail sales, consumer sentiment and producer price inflation data, also all on Friday. Stocks hit some bumps in the first week of the new year but finished strong. The Dow came within 0.37 of a point of Dow 20,000 on Friday. It ended the session at 19,963 and a gain of 1 percent for the week. The S&P 500 was up 1.7 percent for the week at 2276, after hitting a new all-time high of 2,282 intraday. The Nasdaq gained a solid 2.5 percent to 5,521 as some big tech, like Amazon.com, played catch up. China could also be a big influence in the week ahead. Traders will continue to watch the volatility in the yuan, which had a swift run-up in the past week before pulling back. "The big thing is China's reserves. They're trying to thread a pretty small needle in trying to keep the exchange rate stable, trying to keep reserves at around $3 trillion as a confidence thing and to have flexibility in policy," said Robert Sinche, chief global strategist at Amherst Pierpont. Reserves data were to be reported over the weekend, but there is also trade data on Friday. Sinche said the market will be looking to see if exports are gaining any momentum. "The market thinks they're going to be losing some momentum in December," he said. "[But] there's definite signs things have improved across the Asian region." "I think the world's come to the realization that growth has picked up at the end of the year. Some of the data coming out of Europe is pretty robust," he said. "The question is going to be how much inflation is there going to be in the system. It looks like so far it's primarily an energy measurement phenomena. Except in the U.S., where I think there are some capacity pressures and pressures on wages." Inflation has become a bigger theme for markets and was very apparent in the December hourly wages growth of 0.4 percent, providing the biggest boost in year-over-year wage growth since 2009. Economists expect wages to continue to rise. They also expect to see a blip higher in inflation in the next several months because oil and gasoline prices are much higher than they were at the same time last year.

(Photo: JPMorgan Chase) Ever imagine that anyone would rush out to sign up for a credit card with a $450 annual fee? Well, some big spenders could be writing that one on their to-do lists in the next week. Chase had put an extraordinary incentive on a new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which was rolled out in August. You get 100,000 in bonus rewards if you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account. Chase said the rewards would add up to as much as $1,500 toward travel when you redeem through Chase Ultimate Rewards. But Chase noted on its website Tuesday that the 100,000 bonus points will come to an end soon, falling to 50,000 points instead. Did the Chase Sapphire Reserve stand out from a crowded card landscape? You betcha. The buzz was big and the card went viral before Chase did any other marketing. At one point, Chase ran out of the card’s metal stock and sent out temporary plastic cards until the handcrafted, embossed metal cards were available. In December, JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon told investors that the card has been doing great and now Chase would have to account for the cost. Dimon said then that the Sapphire Reserve card would reduce the bank’s profit by $200 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter. Is Chase reducing the bonus because it was too successful? Are we likely to see far smaller bonuses in the future? Not necessarily, according to some credit card experts. USA TODAY Financial resolutions for the New Year: 17 for '17 "The reduction in the Chase Sapphire Reserve introductory bonus was inevitable. The 100,000 point sign-up bonus was only a temporary offer," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. Chase said online that consumers need to apply by Jan. 11 online to get the 100,000 bonus. See www.chase.com/creditcards. After that, you can sign up at a bank branch to get the bonus through March 11. And after that, the offer will decrease to 50,000 bonus points, worth up to $750 for travel if you sign up through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal. The points do not expire as long as your account is open. If you're shopping for a credit card, always consider how you'd use the points, how much you typically spend and what kind of points you'd build over time. One resource: The Points Guy — at www.thepointsguy.com — lists some of the bonus rewards being offered, as well as tips on how best to use some travel-related cards. The Points Guy site is owned by Bankrate.com. Remember, if you don't pay the balance off each month, pay attention to the interest being charged on a credit card. The Chase Sapphire Reserve card states online that its rate will range from 16.24% to 23.24%, based on your credit worthiness. And remember, these rates would go up should the prime rate climb as expected. USA TODAY How to pay off your holiday debt in 30 days Are these Sapphire Reserve cards worthwhile?  Well, if you're trying to put a lid on spending right after the holidays, this card might be too great a temptation to spend even more early in 2017. And read the fine print. You would not earn that 100,000 in rewards points with a balance transfer or cash advance. And you'd pay another $75 a year in fees for each additional card for other users. Then again, this deal could work for some consumers who know for certain they'll spend $4,000 in the first three months. "The bonus more than outweighs the annual fee," said Bill Hardekopf, CEO of LowCards.com. "If you wanted to, you could then cancel the card before you are hit with the second year annual fee of $450." McBride noted that the card may still be worth keeping for many consumers. The $450 fee is partially offset by a $300 annual travel credit applied to your account for travel purchases on your card. The Chase Sapphire Reserve card pays three times the points on travel and dining purchases, compared with double the points on those categories on the Chase Sapphire Preferred, a card with a $95 annual fee. On other purchases, you'd earn one point per dollar on both Reserve and Preferred. Consumers often are tempted by rewards points when using credit cards -- especially if they pay the balance off each month.  (Photo: Susan Tompor) Chase notes that travel is defined relatively broadly for the triple-points rewards, including using the credit card to pay for tolls and taxis. Hardekopf said consumers often like to use bonus points and rewards on airline tickets or hotel rooms. But sometimes consumers are disappointed by a limited number of rooms or flights available under some rewards programs. Or they're only able to use those rewards for a certain hotel or airline. "What happens if the hotel down the street has a much better rate when you want to take your trip? Your rewards are not very rewarding at that time," he said. For that reason, some consumers prefer cash-back programs. And there are plenty of those too. Hardekopf points to the Citi Double Cash card, which pays 1% when you make the transaction and 1% when you pay Citi for the purchase. These rewards apply for all purchases, so you don't have to keep track of any specific categories. Another popular card: The Capital One Quicksilver card gives 1.5% back on all transactions, plus consumers receive a $100 bonus when they spend at least $500 during the first three months of being a cardholder. It's likely to be another good year to shop for rewards cards — even after the end of the 100,000-point deal at Chase. "The rewards program arms race will continue in 2017, with new cards and stepped-up introductory offers appearing throughout the year just as we've seen the past few years," McBride said.

The JPMorgan Global PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index), compiled by Markit, indicated that the expansion in worldwide business conditions in the fourth quarter was the strongest since the third quarter of 2015. The latest data signal a welcome improvement from the lacklustre growth seen earlier last year. However, a side effect of greater growth momentum was intensifying inflationary pressures. Average cost burdens faced by businesses rose by the greatest extent in over five years during December. Especially large increases in input prices were observed in manufacturing, reflecting higher commodity and raw material prices, especially for oil and industrial metals. In many cases, the stronger US dollar was reportedly behind sharply faster imported inflation. At the same time, the latest Caixin PMI showed a sustained upturn in China’s business conditions during the final quarter in 2016, which helped to limit job cuts. However, the improvement has yet to be accompanied by stronger growth in private investment, suggesting that businesses remain cautious. Expectations of slowing support from fiscal and monetary policies, as well as uncertainties concerning global trade growth, are among the economic headwinds in China this year. We’ll look for confirmation in official data this week, which include US inflation and retail sales numbers, Euro-area industrial output, as well as China’s latest data on inflation, credit growth, and trade. This is important because affirmation of the view that global growth is gathering momentum alongside rising prices will be hawkish for global monetary policy, especially for the US central bank. But another area of concerns that emerged is the extent to which the PMI surveys point to only weak increases in prices charged by businesses, suggesting that profit margins are being squeezed. This situation was particularly pronounced in emerging markets where the companies are facing higher oil prices and a weaker local currency against the US dollar. Tighter margins adversely influence companies’ hiring plans. Employment levels across emerging markets continued to fall, as firms prioritised cost management over staff expansion. On the foreign exchange front, daily midpoint fixes for the yuan will be closely monitored, as it may impact dollar movements. Although expectations of a steeper US rate hike trajectory and fiscal stimulus have been key drivers for dollar strength, PBOC’s move on the yuan hinted at concerns over a resurgence of large capital outflows. ― TODAY                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Job cuts, fewer flights?

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 7 January 2017 | MYT 8:45 PM Indonesia plans regulation to ensure bond dealers produce "factual" research JAKARTA: Indonesia is planning regulation to ensure primary bond dealers produce only "factual" research, senior government officials said, in a move that is likely to add to bankers' concerns about a growing backlash over negative investment commentary. The officials' remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the U.S. bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible", some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry's head of fiscal policy office, said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. "The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data," Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. The regulation will "hopefully" be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. "The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed," Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Indonesia's sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. JPMorgan's skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the "fire-wall" between the bank's business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but "there's still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors." BCA is Indonesia's biggest bank by market value and one of the country's primary dealers.

Stocks ended the week sharply higher as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  advanced 1% for the week but came up just short of touching the 20,000 mark; while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18% finished up 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.48%  rallied 2.6%, both closing at fresh records on Friday. Since banks provided earnings growth in the third quarter—8% earnings growth for the sector compared with 3.1% S&P 500, according to FactSet data—investors are eager to see on how banks plan to remain a driver of the economy as well as the stock market. “The market is going to be expecting leadership going into the first quarter,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, in an interview. “But if they get cautious about a higher dollar or a rise in yields, you have to watch out for that.” Top banks reporting on Friday include Dow component J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.53% along with Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +1.49%  and Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.39%   S&P 500 earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to grow by about 3% from the year-ago period, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. Probably the biggest boost will come from the financial sector, which is projected to see growth of 13.8% That, however, will be helped by comparisons with “unusually low” earnings from both Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.19%  and American International Group Inc. AIG, +0.15%  in the year-ago quarter, Butters said. Excluding those companies, earnings for the sector is expected to grow 4.4%, he said. Two key areas to look for in bank earnings are trading revenues and loan growth, Pavlik said. A promise of deregulation by president-elect Donald Trump, if fulfilled, could boost trading activity, while the prospect of a faster pace of rate increases by the Federal Reserve may generate higher loan demand as borrowers seek to lock in interest rates while they are still low. Another earnings highlight will be Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +0.67%  given the recent run-up in the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.63% which was led in part by airlines. While the retail sector is not reporting earnings for another few weeks, retailers will be in focus Friday as December retails sales figures are released. Last week, retail stocks took a hit after Kohl’s Corp. KSS, -1.26% and Macy’s Inc. M, -0.33%  reported a weak holiday season, pressuring shares of traditional retailers and department stores across the board.

President-elect Donald Trump's personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image.  (DAMON WINTER / The New York Times)   By Thomas Black Frederic TomescoBloomberg Sat., Jan. 7, 2017 Ever since the U.S. presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face. He brokers the sale of private jets, and already he’s seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5 per cent more than anticipated. “My phone is ringing off the hook” from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation in the Washington suburb of Manassas, Virginia. “Just the business climate feels like it’s getting better.” The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who will advocate for the industry, but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong an almost-decade-long sales slump. Article Continued Below “You’ll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet,” said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business. Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12 per cent since November 2015, the bank said. It’s far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump’s victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron gained 19 per cent, General Dynamics rose 12 per cent and Bombardier jumped 22 per cent. Aircraft sales amount to about 30 per cent of their revenue. “The Trump win looks positive for bizjet demand given the post-election stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama’s anti-bizjet rhetoric,” Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian planemaker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees “somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates.” “Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure — it’s all good for our business,” he said. “So I hear the tone now and I’m optimistic.” Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump’s theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron’s Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kansas. Bombardier also makes turboprop planes at its Downsview factory in Toronto. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Georgia. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer SA manufactures planes in Melbourne, Florida. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multi-city visits they otherwise couldn’t with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup, which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation. In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing “disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation.” But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it. “I’ve noticed that while there’s still a huge amount of inventory, people just don’t keep dropping the price every week,” he said. “You can really feel the floor in the market right now.” Read more about: Donald Trump, United States The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

In a stark contrast to the relative inertia of white-collar law enforcement in Europe, Washington most recently brought the hammer down on Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, which sold junk-filled, mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial meltdown. Deutsche Bank has agreed on a payout of $7.2 billion, while Credit Suisse settled for $5.3 billion to resolve American authorities’ allegations and avoid the lengthy headache of a trial. Instead of dragging financial firms to court, the US has taken them to the cashier. American giants have not been spared: JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America collectively have shelled out $40 billion to settle cases linked to toxic, crisis-era financial products. “There’s a kind of fundamentalism to US law,” said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel and the Washington-based Peterson Institute. “If you break the law, punishment comes down.” To be sure, British authorities have taken action over the Libor interest rate manipulation scandal but such retribution remains rare in the rest of Europe. “It isn’t so much a difference in the rules as in the manner in which they are applied. Things are much more severe in the United States,” Veron told AFP, adding that European countries “do not dare” punish their national flagship companies. The American legal framework nevertheless offers the United States the means to extend the long arm of the law well beyond its borders. In the most recent cases, the United States imposed $2.6 billion in criminal penalties on the Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht — most of which will be paid to Brazil — and a half billion on the Israeli generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical. Both the matters involved corruption occurring outside the United States. The United States pioneered the prosecution of such foreign bribery cases, adopting the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977 in the wake of the Watergate scandal, which allows US officials to hunt down corrupt payments abroad when the companies involved are traded on Wall Street or are otherwise exposed to US jurisdiction. In the decades since, member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have adopted similar laws but do not enforce them with the same vigor or frequency. Given the means and opportunity to apply its laws “extraterritorially” with such regularity, the United States has become a kind of worldwide anticorruption police force, and buttressed its geopolitical influence. “There’s a real nexus between economics and foreign affairs,” said Aaron Klein, head of the center on regulation and markets at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “The next war is more likely to be fought with bonds than with bombs.” In a different kind of case, Volkswagen’s sprawling emissions-cheating scandal also has shown the might of the US legal system and its ability to bring major companies to task. To compensate drivers and repair damage to the environment, the giant German automaker has agreed to pay out more than $15 billion so far, and doubtless will have to pay more before putting the scandal behind it. But the company still could face criminal charges. In Europe, authorities have also opened investigations into Volkswagen but by their own admission, the results will be much less spectacular. “In the European Union, the way to damages is more complicated than in the United States,” EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said in September. In the United States, authorities can be supported in their actions by so-called class-action lawsuits brought collectively by groups of private individuals who have been wronged, which can ratchet up pressure on companies. But this option does exist in Europe. European authorities meanwhile have not been completely dormant in dealing with major companies. They have opened numerous anti-trust investigations and intensified their pursuit of tax avoidance and evasion by multinational companies. Making perhaps its biggest splash till date, the European Commission at the end of August directed the iPhone maker Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($13.5 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, drawing the ire of a sizeable player: the United States.

The officials' remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the U.S. bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible", some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry's head of fiscal policy office, said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. "The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data," Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. The regulation will "hopefully" be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. "The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed," Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Indonesia's sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. JPMorgan's skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the "fire-wall" between the bank's business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but "there's still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors." BCA is Indonesia's biggest bank by market value and one of the country's primary dealers.

File Picture: REUTERS/ALY SONG Tokyo — Asian shares recovered to four-week highs on Friday as a surge in the dollar and its borrowing costs sparked by Donald Trump’s election eased, with the US 10-year yield slipping to one-month lows. The US dollar stayed near three-week lows against a basket of currencies though it bounced back a tad as the Chinese yuan gave up some of its massive gains made during the previous two days following Friday’s midpoint fixing by China’s central bank. "The market appears to be on risk-on mode. It could be because of stabilising US yields. It could be signs of stability in Europe, or a recovery in oil. Anything that has been battered by higher US rates is coming back," said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. MSCI’s gauge of the world’s stock markets hit its highest levels in a year and a half, having risen 1.8% since the start of year, helped by this week’s generally upbeat economic indicators in the US and China. In Asia, MSCI’s ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares index rose 0.25% to its highest in four weeks. In contrast, Japan’s Nikkei, one of the best performers since Republican Trump won the US presidential election, dropped 0.4% as the yen gained versus the dollar. Trump’s victory sparked a major realignment in markets. Expectations that his administration will bring tax cuts, higher spending and deregulation have boosted US bond yields and the dollar, to the detriment of many emerging economies that have benefited from cheap dollar funding and had attracted trillions of dollars from investors shunning low US yields. "What’s going on is a correction of the ‘Trump trade’ since the election. The markets have been trying to fully price in his policies just based on hopes," said Koichi Yoshikawa, executive director of finance at Standard Chartered Bank in Tokyo. "From now on, it’s not going to be a simple one-way bet," he said. Already under pressure from profit taking as the Trump rally wanes, the dollar extended losses on Thursday as China stepped up efforts to support the yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Trump’s January 20 inauguration. The cost of borrowing the yuan in Hong Kong, the main offshore yuan trading centre, sky-rocketed, making it too costly for speculators to sell the yuan against the dollar. The offshore yuan gained more than 2% in the last two sessions, the biggest two-day gain on record, to a two-month high of 6.7833 per dollar before it eased back about 0.5% in Asia on Friday to 6.8208. The dollar also slumped to a three-week low of ¥115,21, having shed 1.6% on Thursday, its biggest fall in five months. It bounced back 0.4% on Friday to ¥115.80. The euro also posted its biggest gain in seven months, of 1.1%, on Thursday and last fetched $1.0588. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to 101.30, falling more than 2% from its 14-year high of 103.82 set on Tuesday. Investors also rushed out of their selling positions in US bonds, one of the most convincing plays since the election, because Trump’s policies are seen as stoking inflation. The 10-year US Treasuries yield hit a one-month low of 2.344%, having fallen about 30 basis points from its two-year high of 2.641% touched on December 15. Investors also scaled back their expectations of the Fed’s rate hikes this year, with Federal Funds rate futures pricing in two rate hikes compared with two and a half at the peak in December. Markets largely shrugged off US economic data published on Thursday which was generally strong. The increase in private payrolls was on the weaker side of market expectations, however, raising some concerns about the upcoming jobs data due at 1.30pm GMT. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 Index dipped 0.1% as retailers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s slumped on weak holiday sales. Financials were also hit by a fall in US bond yields, but hi-tech shares, which have underperformed since Trump’s victory, partly on concerns about his rocky relationship with Silicon Valley, shone. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2% to hit a record high, led by gains in online retailer Amazon.com. Oil prices held firm, supported by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet oil cartel Opec’s agreement to reduce output. International benchmark Brent crude futures stood at $56.89 a barrel, flat on the day and up 3.1% on the week. Reuters Please login or register to comment.

Look to consolidate your debts 6:05 AM Monday Jan 9, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print World NEW YORK (AP) " So maybe you shouldn't have purchased that 55 inch TV for your toddler or given a diamond incrusted collar to your corgi for Christmas. Now you're saddled with thousands of dollars in credit card debt from the holidays, collecting interest at 18 percent or more. Never fear, there are a few ways to pay off that credit card debt in less costly ways. ZERO INTEREST, WITH A CATCH Many credit card companies offer zero-interest balance transfers to new and existing customers after the holidays. That way you can pay off the debt without incurring any interest, typically with a grace period of 12 to 18 months. But if the balance isn't paid off in that period, the remaining amount is subject to high credit card interest again. Watch out for balance transfer fees, however. A typical credit card issuer will charge roughly 3 percent to transfer a balance. There are some credit cards that do promotional zero-fee balance transfers like Slate by JPMorgan Chase. TAKE OUT A PERSONAL LOAN Several online lenders now offer lower interest debt consolidation loans to eligible borrowers, like SoFi, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, Lending Club and Prosper. Most online lenders can offer loans as low as 7 percent. But since they are unsecured loans, borrowing from these companies can have interest rates similar to or higher than credit cards. The loans come with the advantage of consolidating your payments into one place, with one steady payment, and a three to five-year plan to pay that debt off. HOME EQUITY With the housing market mostly recovered from the crisis, banks are more likely to offer home equity lines of credit than ever before. The interest rate on a home equity line of credit can be as low as 3 percent. However they are effectively a second mortgage on your house and should only be used for large, unexpected expenses. DON'T REPEAT YOUR MISTAKES If you do consolidate your debts, the most important thing is to not run up your credit cards again. Then you'll be saddled with both the debt consolidation loan and new balances on the cards.

One likened the president-elect’s campaign and behavior since the election to “creative destruction,” the cost of unorthodox thinking that spurs beneficial results. That’s one reason they are less bullish overall than they were a year ago, forecasting a 3.6 percent jump in the S&P 500. Our nine panelists were more united in outlook this year, with an 11 percentage-point difference between the highest and lowest forecast. Last year, there was a 29 percentage point difference in their forecasts. One area of agreement was how to invest in the early Trump years — in energy, infrastructure and banks. There has been a 35-year bull run in the bond market and an eight-year run in the equity market. How far can these markets run? David Joy: Well, I would say on the bond side there’s probably a pretty good chance that the bull market is over. We don’t expect bond yields to be rising dramatically from here, because we don’t see inflation as a big problem, but some inflationary pressure is building over time. On the stock side, I think it has a little more room to run here, especially if we get some policy initiatives next year that are favorable in terms of tax reform and some fiscal stimulus. I think stocks can again move higher in that environment. Roger Sit: I would agree with that, but on the stock market side, I think it will move higher for different reasons. The last eight years, the equity markets have really moved higher both in the U.S. as well as abroad, because of quantitative easing and extremely low interest rates. Going forward, we are going to shift from an environment where those have juiced the whole market up to an environment where it’s going to be stock picking, where fundamentals are going to matter, because fundamentals will allow for stock price appreciation and sustaining that price appreciation. Carol Schleif: Back to the fixed-income piece, the death of the bond [market] has been in process for many years, and a lot of us have been positioning and trying to call for it much sooner than it is. I would suspect by the time this prints, your readers will be seeing losses in their bond holdings for the first time in many of their experiences. Jim Paulsen: This is a very calendar-old recovery, being now in its eighth year. But I think it’s character-young. I really do. If I go through recession risk — economic policies have not yet turned negative anywhere in the world, and since 1970, when the Fed starts to tighten the funds rate, it’s, on average, four years until the next recession, so we haven’t even begun the process. Because we never generated confidence in this recovery, it’s been a recovery without confidence in the future. I think before it’s over, we’ll get that. Our experts best prediction for 2016 The S&P 500 index closed Friday, Dec. 30th at 2,238.83. The best prediction for 2016 was Abbot Downing’s Carol Schleif whose prediction of 2,235 was nearly spot on. To what degree will the market’s post-election rally encourage President Trump to focus on growth rather than take some of the steps he’s talked about that might limit it? Sit: As long as the administration does something that pushes you in the direction where you think — and I want to emphasize where we all think that it’s good for growth — then it’s going to continue the bull market, and it’s going to continue the bull market in more cyclical stock, even though they’re not necessarily cheap. But with that said, he’s going to get a grace period, six to 12 months from when he takes office, to show he’s moving in that direction. If it doesn’t move in that direction, then all bets are off. Biff Robillard: I have an interesting statistic. If stocks peaked in the first quarter of 2000 and you just calculate — it was 1,400 something on the S&P, and it’s 2,200 on the S&P today. Excluding dividends, the compounded growth rate is 2½ percent for 17 years. So that’s an amazing number, and it seems really low to me. So if you look at a secular peak in the stock market in 2000 — and we’ve gone through this tremendous sideways — I think that’s very relevant to what will happen next with stocks. Paulsen: I think that Trump is like the tail, and the dog in this fight is the fundamentals of the economy, and, quite frankly, a lot of these trends that we now associate with the Trump election were in place starting in the summer. But I would say that Trump exacerbated those trends with hope. I’ve been critical throughout this recovery about the leadership not treating confidence. To me this forevermore is going to be the destructive confidence recovery. I think it’s because the leaders have chronically told us that we’re this close to the second coming of the Great Depression every day, and our Federal Reserve, without saying a word, is screaming, ‘We’re very scared about the future, and you should be too,’ in their actions. And here’s this guy with this big cap that says let’s make things great again, and he’s screaming about how great we’re going to grow, 8, 9, 10 percent, whatever else, and I’m sure it’s all pie over the moon, but the initial impact of rising rates and inflation is positive. Sit: [Trump is] also smart enough to realize he doesn’t want to fail, and he knows if he starts doing stupid things on trade, stupid things on competitiveness, he is going to fail, and that is his probably biggest nightmare. So he has surrounded himself — if you look at the cabinet picks so far — with people who understand and have been successful, because he knows he can’t afford to fail. Craig Johnson: President Trump does not want to fail, but certainly there’s going to be more volatility. You go all the way back to the 1920s and you look at the annual trading range for stock, for the S&P 500, on average it’s been about 27 percent, from the open to the high to the drawdown, etc. I would suspect that you’re going to get an above-average year in terms of volatility, which I think will be very good for active managers. If we are at a market inflection point is this a time for investors to think more widely about how they should rebalance their portfolios? Mark Henneman: I think that the strategy for success over the long term is to pick your process and stick with it. Sit: Well, I would argue that you should always be attentive to your asset allocation at all times, not only by sectors but by passive vs. active. I think there’s a time you can be invested in passive instruments, and there’s a time you can be invested in active. Passive works very well when there’s very low volatility. Now, to what everybody is saying here, I think it’s consensus that volatility is going to probably pick up, because the question is, is how successful will President-elect Trump be? And so with that increased volatility, it tends to be a better environment for active vs. passive. Martha Pomerantz: The bottom line is, is [people] should have an asset allocation that works for their particular circumstances. And now we’re just talking about making tactical shifts at periodic points in time, but when you think about wholesale rebalance, I don’t think any of us would argue that you should take all of your bonds and you should put them into stocks right now. What should readers know about trade agreements going forward, especially in the new administration? Robillard: It’s clarified my thinking to get familiar with the term globalism in contrast to globalization. Globalism is sort of a political movement that we’ve been living for 20 or 30 or 40 years, which is sort of the E.U., when you think about it. Globalization I think of as purely an economic phenomenon. And so you have a candidate [and also] Brexit, which sounds like an anti-globalization campaign — but I think the markets and capitalists are hearing an anti-globalism message. So this weird thing is what looks like more protectionism may be a much more market-driven trading, sort of putting economic interests behind the social interests. You know, it may be surprisingly pro-trade. Paulsen: I come back to this idea — these trade issues and Trump issues are the tail, and then there’s the dog, and the dog is a bigger beast. And while maybe Trump restricts trade to the United States, the bigger dog issue is the fact that all trade is going up. So even if our trade gets restricted, we might still see more of it just because global trade is going up. I just noticed for the 13 top economies, the last six-month leading indicator is up in all 13. This is the first time we’ve ever had that happen in the entire recovery. Even if we have restrictions here in the United States, we might still see more trade. Joy: You know, one of the issues on the Trans-Pacific Partnership is that it appears to be stalled at maybe best, dead at maybe worst. But we have never signed it. This is not a trade agreement that’s in effect, so we’re not losing anything in that respect. And what Trump has been saying is we want smart trade. We all want better deals. So if you take him at face value, there’s been a lot of groundwork that’s been done that might be valuable, but let’s take a fresh look at it with a new set of eyes. And the new Commerce Secretary nominee [Wilbur Ross] has some experience, at least, with trade. So that might get revived down the road. It might surprise us all. Lisa Kopp: If you look back to the nature of trade agreements, something that people don’t actually realize is it’s not just about barriers to entry. Today’s trade agreements have less to do with actually taking away tariffs or barriers to entry and more about regulating the structure of patent agreements and sort of how you play — for example, child labor laws. So, yes, we may lose some great things, if it doesn’t go through — and, again, it looks like it’s not going to go through, given Trump’s bent — but it may actually have less impact on trade than people would assume. Are we going to see more or less business regulation going forward? Henneman: That’s the one part of the Trump trade I’d be willing to bet on, that regulation is going to decrease. The pendulum has swung too far, and this is the catalyst we need to get it swinging back the other way. Sit: I agree with that. And let’s take, for example, the banks. I mean, Dodd-Frank, it’s a one-size-fits-all. There’s no differentiation being made between JPMorgan, Bank of America, versus a smaller regional bank. They’re the same regulations. I think there’s overregulation that they need to re-examine and say, OK, what really makes the most sense for the situation versus one size fits all? Talk about some sectors where people can be excited about allocating their investments. Pomerantz: I think consumer stocks are going to do better. There are so many things that are going on here — repatriation, more money comes back, tax rates go down, more money in consumers’ pockets, people feel better about things. I think already you’re seeing some impact to that early on. Schleif: In the environment we’re in now, if you’re going to spend on infrastructure, you’re going to spend on technology as well. There were over 70 voter-led referendums that generated over $70 billion worth of municipal bond issuance that’s set to come in the next few years. [Look at the new 35W bridge.] It’s got a lot of technology in that bridge that got put back up. Also from a capitalization standpoint, one of the biggest beneficiaries of bringing individual and corporate tax rates down would be small and mid-cap stocks. You’ve seen them rally hugely. Johnson: From my perspective in terms of where to be positioned for 2017, we’re overweight, and have been since about August, in energy, we’re overweight in basic materials, and we’re also overweight in tech, because that should be a natural beneficiary. We’re underweight in the interest-sensitive areas, such as more of the bond proxy areas, utilities, consumer staples and our communication media group. Joy: I would agree on the energy front. Another area within industrials I would say is defense spending, probably going to be a big beneficiary of increased spending at the federal government level. Sit: You have to look at some companies that have a lot of overseas cash, because if they can repatriate that at even a 10 percent rate, that’s a lot of capital that they can use for further growth, share buybacks, whatever, and that should be helpful for their stock prices. On top of that, I think we’ve got to look for companies that have a higher corporate tax rate right now, because if there is a change in the corporate tax laws and you can bring down that tax rate, there is more money flowing to the bottom line for those companies as well. Kopp: We actually believe that there’s a broader opportunity next year than there may have been coming into 2016, and the reason why is you have some sectors that we thought were already attractive — like the consumer discretionary and health care and technology that were attractive both on some of their bottom up opportunities for innovation, but also some of the top down tailwinds like the aging consumer or e-commerce. But in addition to that, you have had a change in the environment with the reflation trade and with the lowering of tax rates, things that should help some of the cyclicals, like the industrials and the materials and the financials. So we actually see that there may be more groups, potentially, that could do well in the next year. Henneman: I think, to Roger’s point, that it’s going to be a stock pickers’ market, is right on, and making sector bets is not something you really need to do when you’re in that environment. We’ve got a long-term overweight in industrials, but we’re not adding new money there, but there’s individual names, and they can be just kind of anywhere, and we’re seeing Medtronic and Hormel just as really attractive right here. There’s really no theme to that. It’s just finding opportunities of great companies when they’re on sale. The S&P 500 closed 2016 at 2,239. What are your S&P 500 predictions for 2017? Henneman: I’m 2,250, just kind of the impacts of full valuation, rising dollar. We’ll see about that. I don’t know where it’s going, but I do know it’s high right now, and I’ve got those comps coming at me, which, frankly, I think is just fine. Sit: 2,300. I’m assuming we get about a 5 percent earnings growth. And like I said earlier several times, I think it’s going to be based on fundamentals. It’s going to be a stock pickers’ market. Pomeranz: I’m going to say 2,375. I think it will be a good year. I honestly think in the last two years we’ve sort of come back to even. Two years ago, the market was essentially flat. This year, we’re up 10 percent, so we’re up 5 percent over two years. I don’t think this is an egregious amount. I think taxes will come down. I think earnings will improve. I think consumer sentiment and investor sentiment will be favorable. I think it will turn out to be an average year for us next year. Paulsen: I’m going to go 2,325. I think it’s going to be a wild year that has echoes of 1987. I don’t think it will be near the magnitude, but I think some of the character will be similar. We get pretty excited about stuff, and for a while we trade up on higher inflation, higher rates, it’s all good, cyclical led, and then we have a little bit of an air pocket at some point in the year, and we end up not that much higher, 5 percent or something, from where we started. Robillard: I’m going to say unchanged, 2,190. I’m with Jim, much higher and then about the same for a while. It’s the first year of President-elect Trump’s deal. Johnson: Perhaps I’ll be the high-water person on the Street, but we’re looking for 2,424 for next year. We’re also looking for 3 to 3¼ on the 10-year bond yield. Joy: We’re at 2,350. We think earnings growth is going to be around 9 percent, and economic growth in the U.S. improved to about 2½ percent. I think the Fed raises only twice, and so multiples don’t come under real pressure, and that gets us to 2,350. Schleif: I’ll be the odd one out. I’m going to say 2,317. We do think that volatility will be increased, and wouldn’t be surprised to see sharp upticks and downticks. I do think inflation most likely will surprise on the upside. Overall, I think the sentiment has turned, and we are optimistic about business confidence and where the markets could end the year. Kopp: We were going to come in at 2,350, so now maybe I have to say 2,349. We’re assuming, basically, a similar multiple to today, but we are assuming some decent earnings growth, and so we’re thinking somewhere in the single mid-digits is going to happen, and it’s really based on the fact that we see some good bottom-up opportunities with companies. Top down still looks OK. GDP is coming in at decent, maybe slightly accelerating, and the overseas economies are doing all right.

So was I when I went back through the columns I had written this year about the consumer issues that confused or annoyed me most. What I found was a pleasant surprise: In several cases, things had actually gotten at least a little better in the months since I’d visited the topic. So let us return to airline baggage fees, the general unpleasantness of the rental car industry, banks that use scare tactics to try to keep you from using new apps, and price transparency in college shopping. Glimmers of optimism are appropriate in each case, but so is vigilance. Our need to call companies out when they’re not meeting our needs continues unabated. LUGGAGE FEE REFUNDS When you pay to check your bags and they don’t arrive until a day after you do, you ought to get your money back. Seems logical, and airlines don’t always disagree, as I wrote in April. But the process is deliberately tedious — and it can end with vouchers for future travel instead of refunds to your credit card. In a rare bit of bipartisan legislative action, Congress delivered in July the reauthorization act for the Federal Aviation Administration. It promises that by July 2017, all air carriers must “promptly” provide an “automated refund” of checked baggage fees if they fail “to deliver” a bag 12 hours after the arrival of a domestic flight or 15 hours after an international one. There will still need to be a round of Department of Transportation rule-making on the specifics, which worries me some. Kathy Allen, a spokeswoman for the trade group Airlines for America, didn’t want to say much beyond pointing me to a statement about the dangers of regulation. She added, via email, that she didn’t think “there’s any way to speculate at this point about the future administration.” So I took my skeptical questions — How “automated” is automated? Can a voucher count as a refund? How exactly are we to define “deliver”? — to Charles Leocha, the founder of the advocacy group Travelers United. Mr. Leocha believes that every airline will have to offer a refund to your credit card but may be able to extend a voucher as an option, too. So be ready to ask for your “automatic” refund and check a box for a true refund to your credit or debit card. Airlines prefer vouchers because of the “breakage” — the fancy industry term for people forgetting all about them. Normally when bags are many hours late, the airline hires a company to deliver them to you. So here’s a cynical question to ponder: Will the airlines start the clock for refund purposes when you land and then stop it when your bags merely arrive at the airport, long after you’ve given up and left? Or will they do the right thing and not stop the clock until the delivery company shows up with your bag, many hours after the bag may have arrived at the airport? Mr. Leocha would not rule out the possibility that the airlines might try to default to the first scenario, noting that there’s usually some kind of battle during the rule-making process. NEW BLOOD AT HERTZ This month, I channeled years of frustration and bile into a column about the rental-car industry. By my analysis, the leading companies seemed to have set a team of user-experience geeks loose with the goal of making car rentals so painful that every last one of us would flee to Lyft or Uber. A few days later, Hertz announced that its chief executive was retiring as of Jan. 3 and that his replacement, Kathryn V. Marinello, would come from outside the company. Even better: She has deep experience in the payments industry from her time at General Electric and First Data. Hertz has an obnoxious practice of charging customers for toll transponders, even on days when the vehicles don’t pass through tolls. This isn’t necessary. Competitors like Enterprise don’t charge on days when the gear is idle, while Silvercar doesn’t charge at all for the transponder. Will Ms. Marinello rid us of this scourge? A Hertz spokeswoman, Karen Drake, did not reply to my request to have a chat with the new boss. MY PAL JAMIE DIMON Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, used his annual shareholders letter in April to try to scare consumers who use some third-party apps and services that help manage and move money. In a May column with the headline “Jamie Dimon Wants to Protect You From Innovative Start-Ups,” I tried to take the measure of his security concerns, which seemed to have been directed at companies like Yodlee, Mint, Acorns and Penny. Later that month, when Recode’s Kara Swisher asked him about the headline, which she described as “not a very nice” one, he dismissed it with an unprintable phrase. Time will tell if he intends to erect barriers that will keep new companies from helping his customers improve their financial lives in ways the bank hasn’t thought of yet. I hope he doesn’t. Since then, there have been no big breaches that we know of at start-ups and services like these. Last month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a welcome, industrywide call for comments on third-party data access and possible additional safeguards. We’ll see if the bureau can issue recommendations before our elected officials begin their promised defanging of the agency. I do want to thank Mr. Dimon on behalf of credit-card reward junkies everywhere for giving us the Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card in 2016. By next month, I’ll have extracted over $2,100 in value in exchange for my $450 annual fee. At that point, we’ll put my card aside, my wife will get her own, and we’ll do the same thing all over again. All those perks for customers will reduce the bank’s profit by $200 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter, Mr. Dimon told investors this month, according to a Bloomberg report. But the investment could pay off handsomely if people stick with the card for a long time and carry balances that are multiples of the rewards they extract. COLLEGE COST TRANSPARENCY In 2016, schools like the California Institute of Technology, Harvard and Princeton continued to block College Abacus, a nifty tool for families to estimate the true cost of attendance at a college or university and to compare it with other institutions. The tool can’t compare costs if it can’t access the universities’ calculators, so the schools erect barricades that block it. As I wrote in a January column, the schools’ representatives either blew me off when I asked them why they were doing this or offered explanations that didn’t stand up to scrutiny. So let me explain what I think is actually going on here. Most colleges are already in a quiet price war, haggling on financial aid offers in April or throwing discounts at families earlier in the season and calling it merit aid or some other euphemistic term. Any tool like the one at College Abacus, which bluntly pits schools against one another, reinforces the idea that cost ought to be a big factor in any family’s decision making. Once you put down the pictures of leafy campuses and start in on the spreadsheet, however, you discover that there isn’t much data that can help you figure out whether the school with the $65,000 annual bill for tuition, room and board is better than the school that offers $45,000 (including a $20,000 discount). Or whether the $25,000 flagship state university would be just fine (or worse than two years of community college first). So a tip of the cap to unafraid administrators at Drew University, which unblocked College Abacus’s search software this year. Here’s hoping that more schools will do the same in 2017, a year in which I intend to ask plenty more questions about how and what to pay for college.

Ogg January 5, 2017 12:45 pm EST Print Email Tweet As the year gets off to a start, it is important to think about where the markets came from in 2016 and where they stand at the start of 2017 in order to make assumptions about how the markets will perform throughout the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed out 2016 up 13.4% at 19,762.60, outperforming the 2016 gains of 9.5% for the S&P 500 and 7.5% for the Nasdaq. 24/7 Wall St. evaluates each of the 30 Dow components at the start of each year to come up with a forecast for the year ahead. Our bull-bear case pointed toward 19,700 for 2016, and that was without ever mentioning or considering the names Trump and Clinton in the outlook at that time. There does seem to be a path to Dow 22,000 that could come late in 2017, but it could also easily not come until 2018. Using the Thomson Reuters consensus analyst price targets (mean) and taking total returns from dividends and past performance have to be given consideration. There are also internal business developments to consider on each company, and the technology sector is always in a state of change. For how the Dow can rise beyond 20,000, we have looked at three tech stocks having a singular role: IBM, Intel and Cisco. Cisco Systems Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) ended the quarter down almost 4%, but the annual gain of 15.13% took shares to a year-end close of $30.22. Cisco is the largest dividend yield in the Dow’s tech giants, and it was even in the top five yields in the 2017 Dogs of the Dow. Cisco’s consensus analyst price target from Thomson Reuters was $33.11 at the start of 2017. While this implied simple upside of 9.6%, the 3.4% dividend yield would make for an implied total return of 13.0% in 2017, if the analysts are correct. Unfortunately for Cisco’s relation to the Dow, the reality is that it is the smallest weighted component at just 1.03% of the whole index. That means that Cisco shares could double, and if the rest of the Dow stocks were flat it would hardly make a difference to the Dow. Still, on its own it has above-average implied upside expectations and Cisco’s dividend remains solid for tech investors. Valuations remain compelling for Cisco, and it is well-known that Cisco loves buying back stock. If the company is able to repatriate overseas cash, CEO Chuck Robbins even said directly that more stock would be purchased. Its earnings per share of $2.36 in 2016 is expected to rise to $2.49 in 2018 and $2.60 in 2019. That slow of earnings growth may be capping upside. Still, Cisco is valued at less than 13 times expected 2017 earnings expectations. Imagine if Cisco can deliver serious earnings upside after its years of restructuring efforts. Cisco has been changing its model in recent years. It remains more focused on sales and enterprise-wide sales opportunities where it can offer networking, data center and security from the top to the bottom. One issue holding back Cisco is that many of the core growth markets (emerging markets) have been growing far less than their potential. China also has been a huge effort, even if domestic companies in China would rather get sales locally than letting Cisco get them. In mid-December, JPMorgan’s tactical options team warned that Cisco was near a peak price and valuation with limited catalysts and unfavorable sector rotation. They recommend that shareholders buy protection (put options). The firm recently maintained only a $29 price target and emphasized a negative view. Also in December, Credit Suisse maintained its Underperform rating and a below-consensus target price of $25. UBS took the more bullish side of the coin in December, addressing secular challenges but going at other issues around earnings weakness. UBS kept its Buy rating alive, as well as its price target of $35. That target was based upon 14 times expected 2017 earnings, and the firm thinks Cisco has superior margins over rivals in tech. UBS even called Cisco inexpensive on a free-cash-flow basis by almost one-third. The firm sees Cisco ONE as the first step to the company generating more recurring revenue from its core networking franchise Cisco shares have a 52-week trading range of $22.46 to $31.95. The market cap is $153 billion, and the dividend yield is 3.4%. Intel Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) generated a return of almost 9% in 2016, with its year-end closing price being $36.27. Intel’s consensus price target of $39.89 suggests gains of almost 10%, and the 2.9% dividend yield would make for an implied gain of 12.9% on a total return basis in 2017, if analysts are accurate here. The semiconductor and processor giant has a problem of its weighting in the Dow that is similar to Cisco, in that it is ranked quite low. Its low share price gives Intel just a 1.25% weighting in the Dow, making it ranked 27th out of the 30 Dow stocks. Similar to Cisco, Intel could double and it would hardly move the Dow’s index level, if the other components somehow did not participate.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 9 January 2017 US market still a major factor in driving global sentiment by yap leng kuen WITH the Dow Jones recently decoupled from Asian markets, would any sudden tumble on the Dow have an impact on our markets? A current concern is that US President-elect Donald Trump’s potentially protectionist trade policies may surprise. There would likely be some impact but views range regarding the potential severity of it, with a reminder that against the euphoria, the US rally reflects an ongoing, improving US economy (even without the Trump effect). Moreover, investors had also been holding back during the US presidential election. “A sharp selldown on the US market may trigger some weakness but that should be mild, given the disparity of performance between the strong US market and the weakness of the Malaysian market. “We are cautious of global markets at current prices and would advise to buy on weakness. But we have a ‘buy’ call on Malaysia now,’’ said Chris Eng, head of research, Etiqa Insurance & Takaful. The impact may be set off by lower stock prices on the Malaysian market. “There will be some correlated impact but it will likely be muted as countries like Malaysia are trading at attractive equity levels,” said Hor Kwok Wai, chief operating officer, global markets, Hong Leong Bank. Caution is still in the winds. “Even with the recently decoupled trading patterns between US and Asian equity markets, the US market will continue to be a major factor in driving global investment sentiment. “If the US market takes a tumble, no other markets will likely be spared,’’ said Thomas Yong, CEO, Fortress Capital. Cautious Asian market sentiment has, to some degree, reflected this. “Our stock selection has been adjusted accordingly, to be focused on domestic-driven industries and value investments,’’ said Yong. Any drastic change in US policies will likely have an impact on Asia, including China. “Investors in the US stockmarket are hopeful that Trump’s reflationary policies will deliver higher economic growth, create more jobs, stimulate consumer spending and hence, boost future corporate earnings. “Any bad policies or missteps such as in domestic protectionist measures, changes to US foreign and domestic social policies that create uncertainty will likely lead to a markdown in investors’ expectations and a turnaround in sentiment. “As such, the US equity market will likely remain volatile with its consequential impact on Asian equities,’’ said Lee Heng Guie, executive director, Socio Economic Research Centre. Are markets reading too far ahead of the Trump effect? “There should be some reversal effect when the markets reassess the efficacy and pragmatism of his policies,’’ said an analyst, adding that market players were watching for Trump’s first 100 days. In fact, the Malaysian market outlook for the first half of this year looks quite promising. The three major catalysts include a firmer ringgit outlook, the recent Bank Negara rule requiring the conversion of 75% of export proceeds into ringgit and modest resumption of corporate earnings growth, said UOBKayhian in a report. Besides an improving outlook for Malaysia’s balance of payments and fiscal health, UOBKayhian does not foresee an exodus from the heavily owned Malaysian Government Securities (MGS), with foreign holdings equivalent to about 45% of foreign reserves. “In a bad case scenario, foreign holdings of MGS could fall back to the mid-2011 level of 40% which implies a manageable potential currency outflow of about RM28bil. “This, in turn, lowers Malaysia’s foreign reserves by 6% to a still healthy US$90bil which can finance 7.7 months of retained imports and 1.11 months of short-term external debt. “This is even before considering buffers like repatriation of export proceeds and Bank Negara’s ability to raise liquidity,’’ said the report. Investment themes for the year, according to UOBKayhian, include infrastructure and building materials plays; electronic and electrical trend riders like those in the outsourced semiconductor and test as well as electronics manufacturing services sub-sectors. Other themes are capital and high-dividend yielders as well as China-related investment and the rising demand for syariah-compliant stocks. The hammer may be falling on negative country reports in the midst of turmoil especially in emerging currencies like the rupiah. Indonesia’s government is considering curbs on negative research reports by foreign banks, building on its decision to punish JPMorgan Chase & Co for issuing a bearish call on the country’s equity market, said Bloomberg. The Indonesian Finance Ministry may ask top management at global banks which hold primary dealerships in their sovereign bonds to sign pledges to refrain from issuing research that could destabilise local financial markets, said Bloomberg, quoting Loto Srinaita Ginting, the Ministry’s director of government securities. Foreign investors sold a net US$2.8bil of Indonesian stocks and bonds in the last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Trump’s victory, driving the rupiah lower and forcing intervention to stabilise the currency. Columnist Yap Leng Kuen reckons when it comes to conflict of interest, decisions are harder to make.

The Saudi oil company was initially eyeing a 2017 IPO date, but CEO Amin Nasser recently told CNN 2018 was better. "The [oil] market has started to recover, we expect it to recover even more in 2017 and I think the time in 2018 will be almost right," explained Nasser in Oct. 2016. The Saudi Aramco IPO date is so important, because this will be the largest IPO in history. Aramco could have a $2 trillion market cap by the time it goes public. An IPO that size will transform the energy markets. Even though the IPO will be huge, there are major obstacles Aramco has to overcome before its IPO date. Before we examine those obstacles, here's just how huge the Saudi Aramco IPO will be… The Saudi Aramco IPO Will Be the Biggest Ever Saudi Aramco is expected to be valued at $2 trillion dollars when it goes public in 2018. If expectations are accurate, it will be the biggest IPO of all time. For comparison, Exxon Mobil Corp. (Nasdaq: XOM) is currently valued at $373.91 billion, making it the largest oil company in the United States. Aramco will be worth more than five times Exxon. In fact, Aramco will be worth more than the top "oil majors" of Exxon, Shell, BP, and Chevron combined. The reason Aramco is so massive is its unparalleled access to Saudi Arabia's oil. Since the government of Saudi Arabia currently owns the company, Aramco oil company hasn't had to compete with rivals for control of Saudi Arabia's lucrative oil fields. Saudi Arabia has one-fifth of the proven oil reserves in the world, second only to Venezuela. Through this arrangement, the Saudi Arabian oil company controls 267 billion barrels of proven oil reserves. That's more than seven times the size of proven oil reserves in all of the United States. Saudi oil could be worth even more as the OPEC agreement to cut oil production goes into effect. WTI crude oil prices hit a 10-year low of $36.41 a barrel in Jan. 2016. But, the WTI oil price has since risen 45% to $52.79 a barrel today (Jan. 3). The price spiked after OPEC agreed to cut production in November and began implementing it this week (Monday, Jan. 2).

Investors hoping to buy Saudi Aramco stock for the first time need to know a lot more about the company's decision to go public. And Aramco has three big challenges ahead of the Saudi Aramco IPO date… 3 Challenges Ahead of the Saudi Aramco IPO Date First, the massive size of Aramco means there is a lot of work to do before the IPO. And that means the actual IPO filing will be a major task. Saudi Arabia plans to sell a 5% stake in its overall business and not just the oil distribution wing. Aramco initially proposed selling its international business, which would only be a $100 billion deal. Listing the entire business adds difficulty to an already thorny process. "We need to do a lot of internal work to prepare for this listing. We are listing a part of the entire company, and not just downstream," says CEO Amin Nasser. "People have to appreciate the size of Aramco and its complexity." Because of the size and complexity of the IPO, the Saudis are soliciting the help of the top Wall St. financial institutions, namely JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM). The Wall Street Journal reports other big banks have also been working to be a part of the Aramco IPO. The fees on a deal this size could total more than $1 billion for banks advising the oil giant. "Every bank in the world is going to want to have a role in this," reports the Financial Times. And that doesn't include future business. The Kingdom has plans for major investments in the near future, and big banks will be a key part. But, the next two hurdles might be the most challenging for the company… Join the conversation.

File photo Miami Herald i By Nicholas Nehamas nnehamas@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Venezuela’s wealthy Benacerraf family has allowed a $10 million agreement to buy Miami’s Brickell Bank to expire, potentially snatching away a lifeline for the struggling financial institution. The agreement between the family, which owns Caracas-based 100% Banco, and Brickell Bank’s Portugal-based parent company expired at the end of the year, bank officials confirmed. “The agreement between the Benacerrafs and the shareholder in Portugal expired at the end of 2016 and the Benacerraf family chose not to renew that,” G. Frederick Reinhardt, Brickell Bank chairman and CEO, said in a statement. But Reinhardt said he still expects the sale to happen. The deal was widely expected to sail through with the blessing of federal regulators, and had already received a thumbs-up from state officials. If the sale fails, the small community bank — part of the rubble left over from the collapse of Portugal’s Espírito Santo group — would be in desperate need of another buyer. $10 million Agreed sale price of Brickell Bank In 2014, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ordered the Miami bank to find new owners as its parent company imploded amid allegations of fraud. Brickell Bank has also dealt with regulatory issues over its anti-money laundering policies. Despite the setback, Alcides Avila, a Miami lawyer representing the Benacerraf family, said the deal will go forward. He said the family’s application to buy the bank is still being considered by the FDIC. “The application has not been withdrawn,” Avila said. “It is still being processed. ... Unfortunately when you’re dealing with foreign buyers, from the perspective of regulators there’s a lot of information they require. They requested information. We provided it. They’re reviewing it.” Asked if the expiration of the agreement could put pressure on federal regulators to green-light the sale, Avila said: “It couldn’t hurt.” (Avila also worked on the $882.8 million sale of Miami-based City National Bank of Florida to a Chilean group, a deal that took more than two years to close.) In June 2015, members of the Benacerraf family, along with another wealthy investor, submitted applications to federal and state regulators to buy Brickell Bank. The new owners said they did not plan to liquidate, sell or merge the bank with another company. Family patriarch Salomón Henry Benacerraf, a former chairman of Visa International, would have become chairman, with Fortunato Benacerraf Saias and Sadia Cohen Zrihen appointed to the board. The Florida Office of Financial Regulation approved the application in May, according to state records. It said the new owners passed background checks, had clean records with Venezuelan regulators and did not intend to make significant changes to the bank’s management. The interests of the other stockholders and the depositors and creditors of the Bank ... will not be jeopardized by the proposed change in ownership. Florida Office of Financial Regulation “The interests of the other stockholders and the depositors and creditors of the Bank, and the interests of the public generally, will not be jeopardized by the proposed change in ownership,” a state official wrote in a May 18 order approving the sale. The Benacerraf clan has been involved in Venezuela’s banking industry since the 1940s, according to local media reports. Cohen is a Venezuelan-born investor who left for Spain after the election of Hugo Chávez. Most of the funds would have come from the Benacerrafs, who sold off some of their interests in Venezuelan financial institutions, according to the state order. A spokesman for the FDIC did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. Financial troubles Brickell Bank (known as Espírito Santo Bank until a rebranding in 2015) has shed assets and employees since the Portuguese government was forced to bail out its bankrupt parent company three years ago. As of the third quarter of 2016, Brickell Bank had 88 employees and $503.5 million in assets, compared to 127 employees and $751.3 million in assets in the summer of 2014, according to federal records. Over the same period, its deposits have shrunk from $646.2 million to $380.5 million. Through the first three quarters of 2016, the bank has lost $4.9 million, although that’s better than the $9.5 million loss recorded in the first three quarters of 2015. Private ratings firm Bauer Financial gives the bank two out of five stars, meaning it is considered “problematic.” It caters mainly to wealthy Latin American businesspeople living and working in South Florida. If you go back before the problems in Portugal started, the bank was making money and doing well. Ken Thomas, banking consultant “If you go back before the problems in Portugal started, the bank was making money and doing well,” said Ken Thomas, a local banking consultant. “They fulfill an important function in financing a lot of the [luxury] condos that are sold.” Thomas said that while alarm bells might be ringing down Brickell Avenue about the bank going under, he believes an improving economic climate for banks could attract other suitors besides the Benacerrafs. Since the election of Donald Trump, bank stocks have soared, with JPMorgan Chase and other large- and mid-sized banks hitting record highs. Trump has promised to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, which placed new regulations on the banking industry in 2010. Interest rates are also rising. Even scandal-plagued Wells Fargo has seen a bump in its share price. “For years, people were saying U.S. Century Bank would go under, but they survived and are growing again,” said Thomas, pointing to the resurgence of the Doral-based bank that long struggled with low capital levels. Brickell Bank has had other regulatory issues in the past. In February, it paid $1 million to settle charges that it violated federal anti-money laundering rules. The bank said it discovered the weaknesses in its compliance policies on its own and voluntarily disclosed them to regulators. Its sole branch is located in the Brickell office tower once known as the Espirito Santo Plaza but renamed Brickell Arch after a $142 million sale last year. The proceeds went to Espírito Santo’s creditors.
