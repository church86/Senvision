Print   Email   Font Resize JP Morgan Chase planning $220M operations facility in Broomfield 150,000-square-foot operations facility will go near Colo. 7, Sheridan Parkway By Jennifer Rios Staff Writer Posted:   10/14/2016 05:41:16 PM MDT JP Morgan Chase is eyeing the North Park development at Colo. 7 and Sheridan Parkway for a 150,000-square-foot operations center. JP Morgan Chase is planning a 150,000-square-foot, $220 million operations center in Broomfield, one of two in the Denver metro area. The other will be in Aurora. Broomfield City Council on Tuesday approved $6.4 million in personal property tax reimbursements for the project — an annual 50 percent rebate over a 20-year span. Construction on the data center is anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2017 and be complete by January 2019. The operation center, which would add 30 new full-time jobs, is proposed to be built on the 106-acre North Park development at Colo. 7 and Sheridan Parkway. The project is being developed by McWhinney, of Loveland and Denver. In addition to the $220 million facility, Chase will invest approximately $200 million in personal property investment, said Broomfield City and County Manager Charles Ozaki. The city and county and the Broomfield Urban Renewal Authority would expect to collect about $36.7 million in real and personal property tax and reimburse North Park about $10.2 million from that amount, which would go toward infrastructure. Future improvements would include adding two additional lanes to the now-two-lane Sheridan Parkway, adding landscaping and sidewalks and other improvements. In May, the city of Aurora approved similar incentives for the Chase operations facility there. While an exact location has not been determined, that project likely will be along the E-470 corridor. Advertisement "We're excited about the possibility of bringing these investments to Colorado," Maura Cordova, a spokeswoman at Chase's regional offices in Arizona, said in an email. "These plans mean jobs and the purchase of goods as we would build the JPMC Operation Sites from the ground up." She said the company intends to be up and running in about three years in Broomfield and "two to three" years in Aurora. The jobs at the data center will have average salaries of $75,000. The 150,000-square-foot building would sit between a business area and future single family homes, which could also be a plus, Ozaki said. "This type of development would be a low-impact transition from business park and single family homes," he said. Mayor Randy Aherns said the project is similar in significance for Broomfield as FlatIrons Mall was in 2000, and the recent announcement of Ikea. Only one council member, Mike Shelton, voted against the tax rebate and project. "I think it is a good deal, but I think its more of a good deal for the city than it might be fore the citizens," he said. Other development that could directly benefit residents, such as retail, could be built at that location in the future, he said. Also, he did not think $6.4 million in rebates for a relatively low number of employees was a good deal for the city. "I think the underlying principal is it's unfair to the existing business that paid 100 percent" taxes and didn't receive a rebate, Shelton said. Some members thanked him for his comments, but made it clear they backed the plan. Others cited the prestigious reputation of the bank, the fact it would not add students to already-crowded schools, and a low number of employees could help alleviate traffic in an already congested area. "We hear that traffic is a problem," Councilman Kevin Kreeger said, and with only 30 employees, I think it's about as low of a traffic impact as we can possibly see."

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: If Interest Rates Continue Rising, JPMorgan Chase's Profit Will, Too The megabank should see its net interest income climb by billions of dollars this year. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) May 17, 2017 at 8:48AM The most important variable when it comes to bank stocks right now is the federal funds rate, the primary short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States. If the Federal Reserve sticks with its plan to raise interest rates two more times this year, then banks will make a lot more money. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) offers a case in point. The nation's biggest bank by assets recently disclosed that it should earn an added $2.3 billion worth of net interest income (NII) over the 12 months following an instantaneous rise in short- and long-term rates by 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point. Jamie Dimon, the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. This doesn't mean JPMorgan Chase's profit will increase that much, because it won't -- at least not just because of higher interest rates. A bank's net interest income is instead a component of revenue, calculated by subtracting a bank's cost of funds from its interest income from earning assets. To convert it to net income, then, taxes need to be excluded. Either way, $2.3 billion is a lot of money. It's important to note as well that JPMorgan Chase's net interest income is already trending higher on a year-over-year basis. JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, addressed this on the bank's first-quarter conference call: With the addition of the March rate hike, we've updated our [net interest income] scenarios as follows. Rates flat from here, so the full year NII would be up around $4 billion. Based on the implied, NII would be up by around $4.5 billion. And of course, the Fed dots would imply the possibility of three rate hikes this year, which is not fully priced in. So expect second-quarter NII to be up sequentially, approximately $400 million, consistent with what we saw this quarter. The increase that JPMorgan Chase is already seeing traces back to the Fed's decision to raise the fed funds rate in December and March, for a total of 50 basis points. Moreover, as Lake pointed out, the Fed's dot plot shows that the central bank is inclined to raise rates two more times this year, though both would be captured by JPMorgan Chase's projection for a 100-basis-point increase going forward. US Target Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts. The net result is that investors who have an interest in bank stocks, and JPMorgan Chase in particular, would be smart to listen closely when the Fed speaks. There's no guarantee that the central bank will raise rates further this year, but it would be great news for shareholders of JPMorgan Chase if it did.

YES, THERE IS TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT -- It’s hushed right now, and almost all off the record -- but it’s there, and it’s Republicans who are beginning to grapple with the real -- but far off -- possibility that the president might’ve gone too far this time. That’s not to say President Donald Trump will be impeached, but the prospect is beginning to creep into Republicans’ minds, and it’s noteworthy that they are not ruling it out. There's a sense Mike Schmidt's story that Trump aked Jim Comey to drop an investigation into Mike Flynn is going to have drastic consequences for everyone in the White House. Story Continued Below OTHER LAWMAKERS -- especially the more cautious ones -- say there should be a special prosecutor appointed or commission impaneled. We were up in the Capitol last night, chatting with members of Congress about the political dynamics now, and it would be tough to overstate how angry, confused and fed up Republicans are with President Donald Trump. **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh MIKE SCHIMDT’S ringer in the NYT capped off a wild and dizzying day: Trump, according to a Comey memo, told then Director Comey, “I hope you can let this go … I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” (http://nyti.ms/2qQjayh). Comey, Schmidt writes, wrote memos on “every phone call and meeting he had with the president." -- POLITICO’s MATT NUSSBAUM, JOSH DAWSEY, ELANA SCHOR and SEUNG-MIN KIM on the memos, quoting a friend of Comey: “It’s very rich in detail and hopefully it will come out soon. There are other memos about his meetings too. He wrote down every word Trump said to him as soon as he could.” http://politi.co/2qrwTul BY THE WAY … -- Yes, this is the same Mike Schmidt who was instrumental in uncovering Hillary Clinton’s email practices, helped reveal that Fox News was paying piles of money to women who alleged harassment at the hands of Bill O’Reilly, reported that Trump asked Comey for loyalty, found secret documents about massacres in Iraq in a junkyard in Baghdad and broke open Major League Baseball’s steroid scandal years ago. (But ask him about Eisner Camp!) ALSO: Mike reported in his blockbuster yesterday that Trump suggested Comey jail reporters for publishing classified information. 90-second video of Schmidt discussing his scoop http://nyti.ms/2qvjTC7 WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE, on background, with no name attached: “While the President has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. The President has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey.” A BRESNAHAN TRUISM -- @adamgoldmanNYT: “In the cia, there is a sayin: if you didnt write it down it doesnt exist. in the fbi everything exists because everything is written down.” -- QUOTE OF THE WEEK: @timkmak: “McCain just said at a dinner honoring him that the Trump scandals have reached a ‘Watergate size and scale’ – wow” SCHMIDT’S MOST RECENT SCOOP is proving to be a major issue for Republicans on the Hill, and -- if it pans out as it seems like it will at this point -- nothing can be taken off the table, top Republicans tell us. But we are many months away from anything like this happening. -- THE INSIDE CONVO -- HOW THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL UNFOLD: HOUSE OVERSIGHT CHAIRMAN JASON CHAFFETZ has requested “all memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings referring or relating to any communication between Comey and the president.” His deadline: one week from today. (Chaffetz’s letter: http://bit.ly/2pVxJM9) If Chaffetz doesn’t get what he wants, he has said he will subpoena the documents. We’ve covered investigations on the Hill, and typically the committee does not get all it wants on the first round. They usually go back and forth a bit. SPEAKER PAUL RYAN is backing Chaffetz: Press secretary AshLee Strong: “We need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo.” Expect Ryan to reiterate this today at his 10 a.m. news avail in the RNC lobby. -- BY THE WAY … Chaffetz announced a few weeks ago that he wouldn’t run again, and in an interview with Jake said that he could resign in the “months to come.” He ditched Washington for Utah, saying he needed foot surgery, and people close to him assumed he’d never come back to D.C. Washingtonian’s Elaina Plott -- the pride of New Haven -- reported a few days ago that Chaffetz was headed to Fox News, which many of his friends believe to be true. Now he’s placed himself at the center of a major investigation -- exactly where he likes to be. We don’t think he’s going anywhere anytime soon. -- WITH FRIENDS LIKE THIS … OHIO GOV. JOHN KASICH during a CNN town hall last night with Dana Bash and Jake Tapper: “I saw that Speaker Ryan said some things tonight about getting to the bottom line. Frankly, I think he should be more aggressive. I think he should speak out more, and hopefully he will.” THE HEARINGS -- It seems likely at this point that Comey will have to testify in both the House and the Senate. Chaffetz was smart to get out the door first with his request. At this point, hearings will likely take place sometime in June. The House and Senate are in session basically all of June. JUST TO TAKE STOCK … TODAY’S WEST-WING REVIEW -- On Tuesday, the president’s national security adviser questioned whether the Western Wall was part of Israel (http://politi.co/2qr3rET), and essentially confirmed the Washington Post’s bombshell, that President Donald Trump shared classified information with Russian officials, but said it was part of regular intelligence sharing. (http://lat.ms/2pTeraJ). The NYT later broke that it was Israel’s intelligence that was leaked (http://nyti.ms/2pT1q0T). NYT’s Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush had a blockbuster about discord in the White House, the potential demotion of Sean Spicer and the sense on Pennsylvania Avenue that Trump isn’t much interested in some elements of the job (http://nyti.ms/2pVoZp9). ABC NEWS -- “Trump’s disclosure endangered spy placed inside ISIS by Israel, officials say,” by Brian Ross, James Gordon Meek and Randy Kreider. http://abcn.ws/2pTETkN BREAKING EARLY THIS MORNING IN JERUSALEM -- HA’ARETZ’S BARAK RAVID -- “Trump Called Netanyahu, but White House and Israel Kept Mum: Israeli official said call did not focus on intel leaked by Trump to Russia, which reportedly originated in Israel; call lasted 20 minutes and took place after Trump called Jordanian king”: “The call, which took place shortly after Trump called Jordan’s King Abdullah II, was not publicized by either the White House or by the Prime Minister’s Office. Netanyahu’s office confirmed the phone call took place. “[T]he call took place at around 5 P.M. Israel time, as Netanyahu was about to enter an event with his finance minister. The call lasted for about twenty minutes. The senior official noted that the call did not touch on reports according to which Trump leaked intelligence information to his meeting with the Russian foreign minister last week.” http://bit.ly/2pTjbx3 ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: JPMorgan Chase believes in the power of data to expand economic opportunity. That’s why it helped arm Detroit’s leaders with extensive data and expertise to help inform their work and improve efforts underway all across the city. See how they’re using this information to make targeted, effective decisions for Detroit: http://politi.co/2r9j94F ****** FED UP -- “Republicans may be reaching their breaking point with Trump,” by John Bresnahan and Rachael Bade: “For Republicans on Capitol Hill, Donald Trump may finally have gone too far. Tuesday’s report that Trump asked former FBI Director James Comey to end the criminal investigation into ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn was more than just another embarrassing revelation for a president used to a near-daily barrage of scandal and staff intrigue. Republicans are privately beginning to worry that they may one day have to sit in judgment of Trump, or that more damaging information from Comey could force the president to step down.” http://politi.co/2rpQitD -- “McMaster tests truth-telling reputation in Trump defense,” by Michael Crowley: “As a U.S. Army general, H.R. McMaster has faced down Iraqi tank divisions, al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban insurgents. But as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, McMaster is navigating the strange environment of Washington politics and media, putting his truth-telling reputation on the line to defend Trump against claims he disclosed sensitive information to Russian officials in the Oval Office.” http://politi.co/2qQDe3C INSIDE THE WEST WING -- “White House on edge: ‘We are kind of helpless’: Recent scandals have left White House staff feeling besieged,” by Josh Dawsey and Matt Nussbaum: “It was, in the words of one senior White House official, the worst day of Trump’s presidency. ... ‘Nobody knows where this really goes from here,’ the White House official said. ‘Everyone is walking around saying, ‘‘What is next?’’ In interviews, multiple White House officials indicated they feel under siege – unsure who in the intelligence community was leaking, how much damaging information was out there, when the next proverbial shoe would drop and what Trump might say. Staffers shuttled back and forth among West Wing offices debating what to say without divulging confidential material or getting anything wrong. A deflated and exhausted Sean Spicer, who continues to read reports that his job is in jeopardy but is working 12 hours every day in his office, huddled in his office with Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. There was a pervasive sense, another official said, that ‘we are kind of helpless.’ ... “But White House officials, one person said, are becoming increasingly leery of putting their names on statements in the immediate aftermath of stories – because Trump often contradicts them publicly or on Twitter. And staffers have grown tired and upset about stories of a staff shake-up. Two officials said they had no idea if their jobs were in jeopardy – but that Trump has given people private assurances they are safe. That includes Spicer, according to one ally of his—though this person also said the communications staff is given very little say in decisions and then is left to clean them up. Priebus is sitting in every meeting. [Steve] Bannon has been given ‘some authority’ to help clean this up ... Other senior officials believe Trump trusts them.” http://politi.co/2pJokMa THE WSJ ED. BOARD -- ENOUGH’S ENOUGH! -- “Loose Lips Sink Presidencies: The Russian intel story shows the price of Trump’s lost credibility”: “The state of the Trump Presidency has been perpetual turbulence, which seems to be how the principal likes it. The latest vortex is over Mr. Trump’s disclosure of sensitive intel to the Russians—and whatever the particulars of the incident, the danger is that Presidencies can withstand only so much turbulence before they come apart. … “Mr. Trump needs to appreciate how close he is to losing the Republicans he needs to pass the agenda that will determine if he is successful. Weeks of pointless melodrama and undisciplined comments have depleted public and Capitol Hill attention from health care and tax reform, and exhaustion is setting in. America holds elections every two years, and Mr. Trump’s policy allies in Congress will drift away if he looks like a liability. “Millions of Americans recognized Mr. Trump’s flaws but decided he was a risk worth taking. They assumed, or at least hoped, that he’d rise to the occasion and the demands of the job. If he cannot, he’ll betray their hopes as his Presidency sinks before his eyes.” http://on.wsj.com/2qqQACf SCHMIDT BREAKS NYT ONLINE TRAFFIC RECORD – per Morning Media’s Joe Pompeo: “Schmidt’s bombshell about the Comey memo broke the Times' record for most concurrent readers per second, according to a Times source who dished to Morning Media about the web traffic, just as The Washington Post’s Monday-night revelation about Trump slipping highly classified intel to the Russians broke the same record for the Post. (In both cases, it was more than 100,000 people reading a single story online simultaneously.)” http://politi.co/2qQs5j5 THE TRIP -- “Trump drawn into Saudi Game of Thrones,” by Ken Vogel and Theo Meyer: “President Donald Trump is boning up on policy and protocol ahead of an international trip that begins Friday in Saudi Arabia, but he’s already emerged as a peripheral and perhaps unwitting player in a power struggle between two Saudi princes seeking to succeed the aging King Salman. In March, Trump raised eyebrows among royal court watchers in Washington and Middle Eastern capitals by holding an Oval Office meeting and unexpected formal lunch with Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the chief rival to Crown Prince Mohammad bin Nayef for the crown. “This month, in his own move to position himself with Trump’s administration, the ministry run by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Nayef quietly signed a $5.4-million one year contract with SPG, a boutique Washington lobbying firm with ties to Trump’s team. “The hefty contract, filed with the Department of Justice and reviewed by POLITICO, calls for SPG to provide ‘public relations and media engagement as well as public affairs counsel’ to the Saudi Ministry of the Interior. While Saudi Arabia deploys an army of well-paid lobbyists and p.r. consultants in Washington, the SPG contract appears to represent the first time in recent years that the Interior Ministry has retained a lobbying firm. The two princes, known as MBS and MBN, respectively, have been quietly jockeying for position to succeed the 81-year-old king, who is widely believed to be in declining health.” http://politi.co/2qQq8DA THE HACK ATTACK -- “NSA officials worried about the day its potent hacking tool would get loose. Then it did,” by WaPo’s Ellen Nakashima and Craig Timberg: “When the National Security Agency began using a new hacking tool called EternalBlue, those entrusted with deploying it marveled at both its uncommon power and the widespread havoc it could wreak if it ever got loose. ... [F]or more than five years, the NSA kept using it — through a time period that has seen several serious security breaches — and now the officials’ worst fears have been realized. ... Current and former officials defended the agency’s handling of EternalBlue, saying that the NSA must use such volatile tools to fulfill its mission of gathering foreign intelligence. In the case of EternalBlue, the intelligence haul was ‘unreal,’ said one former employee. ‘It was like fishing with dynamite,’ said a second.” http://wapo.st/2qqMeLf THE BUZZ -- MOOD SOURING ON K STREET -- Lobbyists have signed up business in droves looking to make headway on major business priorities like tax reform, overhauling the health care system and getting rid of what many companies view as onerous Obama administration regulations. But those hoping the business boom would translate to activity on Capitol Hill are beginning to recalibrate their clients’ expectations. “Republicans are starting to get vocal and know the window [for getting anything done] is closing,” said one veteran lobbyist. Several K Streeters said uncertainty over what Trump will say, or do next, is increasingly causing frustration among health care companies and those in the energy industry. AND THOSE HOPING that Democrats would want to legislate when Republicans pivoted away from Trump are beginning to question whether there will be any good will left between the two parties. Right now, it doesn’t look good. WSJ headline: “White House Turmoil Puts the GOP Agenda at Risk” http://on.wsj.com/2pK66KG -- PAGING STEVEN MNUCHIN: “Wall Street gives up on a 2017 tax overhaul,” by Morning Money’s Ben White: “The main hope now in corporate America and on Wall Street is that the White House and Congress manage to bypass a scary fight over raising the nation’s debt limit this summer, keep the government open and avoid any major foreign policy crisis.” http://politi.co/2pT0UQB THE JUICE… -- NOT BAD FOR BOEHNER: Former Speaker John Boehner was put on the board of British American Tobacco last year. Soon after that, the company announced a merger with Reynolds American. If the merger goes through, Boehner stands to make $853,478, according to a recently filed SEC report. -- SPOTTED POWER LUNCHING: Rob Powelson, newly minted FERC nominee, was spotted at lunch yesterday at the Monocle on Capitol Hill, with Andy Black of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines.

TRUMP’S WEDNESDAY -- The President is going to New London, Connecticut, to speak at the commencement for the Coast Guard Academy. Playbook Reads PHOTO DU JOUR: President Donald Trump extends his hand for a handshake with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Oval Office on May 16. | Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images TICK TOCK -- “Inside the Oval Office with Trump and the Russians: Broad smiles and loose lips,” by WaPo’s Philip Rucker and Karen DeYoung: “On May 2, eight days before Lavrov showed up at the White House, Russian President Vladimir Putin was on the phone with Trump and made a request. Putin had ‘new ideas’ about stopping the civil war carnage in Syria, according to a senior U.S. official, and noted that his top diplomat, Lavrov, would soon be visiting the United States for a previously scheduled meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. ‘Will you see him?’ Putin asked Trump, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private talks. ‘Yes,’ Trump replied. Lavrov’s itinerary had him going nowhere near Washington -- 4,100 miles away in Fairbanks, Alaska, where he and Tillerson would be attending a meeting of the Arctic Council, the group of countries that have territory in the Arctic region. Putin glossed over that detail with Trump, however, and once he agreed to a face-to-face meeting with Lavrov, the Russian minister changed his plans to jet first to Washington.” http://wapo.st/2pVtccz VIDEO DU JOUR -- @blakehounshell: “This is INSANE. Erdogan’s goons rough up Kurdish protesters ON EMBASSY ROW, as D.C. cops valiantly try to stop them.” http://bit.ly/2pJpmIo STATE OF THE ART -- “Trump campaign alumni launch email fundraising start-up,” by WaPo’s Matea Gold: “Last fall, Matt Oczkowski and Parks Bennett were logging 12-hour days in a rented office in San Antonio that smelled of Chick-fil-A and Doritos, focused on one mission: to elect Donald Trump president. As they raced to crunch voter data and build up Trump’s small-donor base, an idea began to jell: Could they apply data science to make email fundraising more effective and transparent? The concept, which the two young GOP digital strategists had begun discussing earlier in the cycle while working for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s presidential bid, is the heart of a company they’re formally launching this week called Campaign Inbox.” http://wapo.st/2qQnDRA HAPPENING TODAY -- “Chelsea Manning Is Expected to Leave Prison, 28 Years Early,” by NYT’s Charlie Savage: “Chelsea Manning is expected to walk freely out of the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., on Wednesday ... Sentenced to an unprecedented 35-year prison term for disclosing archives of secret files to WikiLeaks, Ms. Manning spent about seven years in prison -- already double the second-longest sentence in any leak case. She is set to be freed 28 years early because President Barack Obama, in one of his final acts, commuted the bulk of her remaining sentence. ... Ms. Manning’s support network, which raised about $138,000 in online donations to help cover her initial living expenses in a GoFundMe.com campaign, has said she eventually intends to settle in Maryland, where she has family.” http://nyti.ms/2pJxw3q ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: In order to create more opportunities for Detroiters to secure well-paying jobs, JPMorgan Chase worked to boost the city’s workforce readiness, and today, there are clear signs of progress.

In a Playbook interview, the former secretary of state for three years under President Bill Clinton called Trump’s sharing of intelligence with the Russians “a very serious breach for anybody, especially the president” and said she “was very surprised” because the Russians “are not our allies.” Albright also said it was very odd that Trump was acting “like best buddies” with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Regarding Trump’s foreign policy, she said “some of the words have been fine” but the Trump White House is “still very much in the learning phase.” The former secretary of state gave Rex Tillerson, the man currently in the job, an “incomplete” grade and said he had been “very spare in his comments.” Albright, a chair of Albright Stonebridge Group and chairman of the National Democratic Institute, also said the current trend of nationalism in the U.S. is “very dangerous”; she’s very worried about the state of the world; and “pretty much everything” keeps her up at night. More excerpts from the interview STATE BUDGET PROPOSAL TROUBLING: “I’m very troubled by the skinny budget which I think does not show enough of an understanding of the role of diplomacy and assistance in terms of what’s in the toolbox. ... While I think there’s always a temptation to reorganize, having been through some of it myself at the State Department, it’s incredibly time-consuming and takes away time doing substantive work and kind of discombobulates the people, so I’ve been concerned about that and it’s been taking an awful lot of time. ... People at the State Department wonder what’s going to happen to them.” COMEY FIRING UNHELPFUL ABROAD: “I travel abroad a lot and obviously am asked by foreigners how to explain what is going on and the various policies. ... I think this hurts a lot because the thing that we say to other countries is the importance of the rule of law, the importance of the role of the parliament and very, very importantly the role of the press. ... I am very concerned. I do think it’s harmful in how people view the United States and how seriously they take what we say in terms of democracy.” NOT CLOSE TO TILLERSON: “I called to congratulate him when he was named but we have not been in contact. ... It was short. ... I don’t think it’s my job to reach out. I think if somebody wants to talk to me, they can call me. I’m very happy to talk.” WHAT KEEPS HER UP AT NIGHT: “I would have to say pretty much everything. I am very worried about the Middle East. ... I so believe in America’s responsibilities and the role that we can play internationally as leaders, and I think that what worries me is the confusion of where we’re going. ... It’s a tense time in the world. I think there are real questions about how institutions work. ... What it requires is an understanding of America’s role and I’m troubled by not understanding it myself at the moment.” MEDIAWATCH -- “Rupert Murdoch To Unveil Fox Newsroom Renovation Plans At Manhattan HQ On Wednesday,” by Deadline’s Lisa de Moraes: “Rupert Murdoch will rally the Fox News troops on Wednesday, unveiling plans to renovate its second-floor newsroom in Manhattan.

The JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO felt the need to address his willingness to support the president at the bank's annual shareholder meeting Tuesday.More JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted several critical issues confronting the United States during the bank's annual shareholder meeting Tuesday and urged the business community and the Trump administration to come together to find meaningful solutions to these problems. During Q&A with shareholders, Dimon was asked multiple questions related to his willingness to support President Trump . The CEO is on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum. In the answer to a question related to Trump's tighter immigration policy, Dimon took a moment to address the elephant in the room that kept coming up. "He is the President of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our airplane," Dimon said, "I would try to help any President of the United States because I'm a patriot." Dimon emphasized the areas he believes are in serious need of fixing, including education, infrastructure, and tax reform. "Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas and excessive regulation is reducing growth and business formation particularly for small businesses." Dimon also added that it doesn't mean he supports all of the policies that the administration comes up with. Dimon, who became JPMorgan Chase's chairman on Dec. 31, 2006 and has been CEO and president since Dec. 31, 2005 also reiterated his position on the need to roll back some of the regulation of the big banks. "We are not looking to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules, it is however appropriate to open up the rulebook in the light of day and rework the rules and regulations that don't work well or are unnecessary," Dimon said. "We believe that changes can and should be made to preserve the safety and soundness of the financial system". Dimon also highlighted JPMorgan Chase's "breakout year" despite operating in a period of "profound political and economic change" around the world. JPM has delivered record results in six of the last seven years, with 2016 being no exception, earning $24.7 billion in net income on revenue of $99.1 billion. The CEO was optimistic on the growth continuing with the "underlying growth of the U.S. and the global economy" providing the necessary fuel to drive the future growth of JPMorgan. The bank's shareholder meeting was held in Delaware, where JPM is the largest private employer in the state and is also home to the company's credit card business. Shareholders voted to reelect all twelve of the directors, with no director receiving less than 96% of the votes cast.

  News Analysis: Stocks sink as Trump worries trigger risk aversion                Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo   Source: Xinhua | 2017-05-18 07:48:33 | Editor: huaxia Photo shows the New York Stock Exchange on May 17, 2017. (Xinhua) By Xinhua Writers Wang Wen, Sun Oumeng NEW YORK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed sharply lower Wednesday with all three major indices recording their worst day so far this year due to the latest turmoil in Washington that triggered market concerns on whether the Trump administration could continue to push its economic reform agenda. "The market is responding to the probability that tax reform, infrastructure spending, healthcare reform and trade deals might not occur," Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer of Krane Funds Advisors, told Xinhua. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 372.82 points lower Wednesday, a steep fall driven mainly by share declines in Dow components Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase. Shares of Goldman Sachs dropped 5.27 percent to 213.72 U.S. dollars while J.P. Morgan Chase closed down 3.81 percent to 84.27 dollars. The broader S&P 500 dropped 43.64 points, or 1.82 percent, with financials tumbling more than three percent. The financial sector had been the best performer in what Wall Street called "Trump Rally," since President Donald Trump assumed office and promised large-scale deregulation and tax reform. The tech heavy Nasdaq declined 2.57 percent, or 158.63 points to 6,011.24. The index notched record close in two consecutive sessions on Monday and Tuesday. "The U.S. equity market rally has been driven by the pro-growth agenda proposed by the president and supported by the Republican majority in Congress," said Ahern, adding that the situation has changed. Analysts said the latest White House controversies have weighed on market sentiment and the market performance on Wednesday was a typical flight to safety as political turmoil triggered investor concerns. "Recent political distractions have the potential to derail the implementation of such policies that have helped support the rising U.S. stock market," Ahern said. The White House on Tuesday pushed back against a new wave of media allegations that Trump might have tried to obstruct justice by asking ex-FBI Director James Comey to end a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. "I hope you can let this go," Trump told Comey at the time, according to a New York Times report, quoting two people who read the memo Comey wrote shortly after meeting with Trump in the Oval Office one day after Flynn resigned over a Russia-related scandal in February. Investors have been shocked by the news and worried Trump's ability to deliver on business-friendly policies. The CBOE Volatility Index, widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, jumped 46.38 percent to 15.59. Just a week earlier, the index hit 9.77, lowest in more than two decades. Analysts noted that it was the first time that markets have hinted at risk-off behavior in response to increased political risk in Washington. Talking about market outlook, some warned investors of possible downward trend. "Some of the technicals have turned negative, such as an apparently imminent bearish crossover on a six-month snapshot of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence. Relative strength also indicates a market closer to an 'overbought' condition than it is to neutral," Stephen Guilfoyle, president of Sarge986 LLC, wrote in a note. "Despite strong corporate earnings, U.S. equity market valuations are high compared to emerging market and European equities. Investors are apt to use U.S. weakness as opportunity to rebalance to less expensive markets," said Ahern. Market demand for safe-haven currencies soared on Wednesday, with Japanese yen rising over 1.8 percent against the dollar during the session. The U.S dollar decreased against most major currencies. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, was down 0.61 percent at 97.506 in late trading. Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose sharply on Wednesday. The most active gold contract for June delivery jumped 22.3 dollars, or 1.80 percent, to settle at 1,258.7 dollars per ounce.

While James Kenny, JP Morgan's head of investor services, confirmed the US banking giant's plans to hire a "significant" number of people in Dublin in an interview with the Financial Times last weekend, he expressed his concerns in relation to the capacity of the city's infrastructure to cope. "The binding constraint in Ireland isn't really around the supply of qualified people; it's around infrastructure - the infrastructure in the city, the supply of housing...the capacity in the school system, the domestic transport infrastructure," he said. With much of the commentary in relation to the housing crisis referring to the alleged land hoarding being engaged in by developers and speculators, Nama's decision from 2014 onwards to dispose of vast swathes of development land in Dublin and other areas where the housing shortage is at its most acute has largely gone unremarked upon. In a presentation delivered to a housing forum convened by the then environment minister Alan Kelly in April of last year, Nama's head of public affairs, Martin Whelan, had sought to defend the agency against allegations that it was hoarding land in the areas where housing was needed most. In doing so, Mr Whelan revealed that Nama had sold land with the potential to deliver 20,500 new homes in Dublin, its commuter counties, and the country's other major cities since 2014. Asked at the time for a detailed breakdown of the sites' location, a spokesman for Nama said:"Approximately 9,000 of the potential new residential units are in Dublin, 7,000 are in the neighbouring counties of Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Louth, 3,000 are in Cork, and the remainder are in the other major urban centres, including Waterford, Limerick and Galway." The spokesman added that of the 20,500 sites sold, 1,100 were either being built or under construction by their new owners. 900 of the 1,100 units were located in Dublin while the remaining 200 were in Kildare. Asked last week for an update on the residential development sites Nama had sold in the year since Mr Whelan's presentation, the agency's spokesman said the figures would be included in Nama's annual report which is due to be published shortly. While Nama argues that one "major site" it had disposed of in south Dublin required infrastructural investment amounting to "tens of millions of euro" before its 3,000 homes could be delivered, the fact that the vast bulk of the development lands it has sold since 2014 have yet to have been built on saw its disposal strategy come in for criticism yesterday from developer Michael O'Flynn. He said: "Nama sold land to people who either overpaid for it or who are not interested in developing it for now. But that's their right as purchasers. People who buy land don't have to develop it. People can do what they like with land when they buy it. Unfortunately, Nama didn't sell land with a development clause, which is what a lot of land in public ownership should be sold with. Because they didn't do that, a lot of the land sold to investor funds isn't being developed." Mr O'Flynn, who first warned of the looming housing crisis in 2012, described the comments of JP Morgan's head of investor services, James Kenny, on the housing crisis as "highly relevant." He said: "We now have a situation where jobs and the potential for job creation is being affected by the lack of available supply of housing".

IANS Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Stocks sink as Trump worries trigger risk aversion US stocks closed sharply lower on Wednesday due to the market concerns on whether the Trump administration could continue to push its economic reform agenda. "The market is responding to the probability that tax reform, infrastructure spending, healthcare reform and trade deals might not occur," Xinhua quoted Brendan Ahern, Chief Investment Officer of Krane Funds Advisors, as saying. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 372.82 points lower, a steep fall driven mainly by share declines in Dow components Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase. Shares of Goldman Sachs dropped 5.27 per cent to $213.72 while J.P. Morgan Chase closed down 3.81 per cent to $84.27. The broader S&P 500 dropped 43.64 points, or 1.82 per cent, with financials tumbling more than three per cent. The financial sector had been the best performer in what Wall Street called "Trump Rally," since Trump assumed office and promised large-scale deregulation and tax reform. The tech heavy Nasdaq declined 2.57 per cent, or 158.63 points to 6,011.24. The index notched record close in two consecutive sessions on Monday and Tuesday. "The US equity market rally has been driven by the pro-growth agenda proposed by the president and supported by the Republican majority in Congress," said Ahern, adding that the situation has changed. Analysts said the latest White House controversies have weighed on market sentiment and the market performance on Wednesday was a typical flight to safety as political turmoil triggered investor concerns. "Recent political distractions have the potential to derail the implementation of such policies that have helped support the rising US stock market," Ahern said. The White House pushed back against a new wave of media allegations that Trump might have tried to obstruct justice by asking ex-FBI Director James Comey to end a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. "I hope you can let this go," Trump told Comey at the time, according to a New York Times report, quoting two people who read the memo Comey wrote shortly after meeting with Trump in the Oval Office one day after Flynn resigned over a Russia-related scandal in February. Investors have been shocked by the news and worried Trump's ability to deliver on business-friendly policies. The CBOE Volatility Index, widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, jumped 46.38 per cent to 15.59. Just a week earlier, the index hit 9.77, lowest in more than two decades.

The loan agreement is dated May 12 and involves JP Morgan Chase and Merrill Lynch. Cooperatieve Rabobank is the joint bookrunner for the loan and JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America along with Rabobank are the syndication agents, according to the 8K filed Wednesday (May 17) by Tyson Foods with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The borrowings under the new loan agreement will be unsecured debt by Tyson Foods with a three-year maturity. Interest charged on the debt ranges from prime rate by Morgan Stanley to the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and the rate based on offerings for U.S. dollar deposits in the London interbank market plus 1% annually by the other lenders. In each case there is an additional spread which is based on the credit ratings by Moody’s and S&P. The lenders will also get an annual fee of 0.15% of the daily average of the undrawn commitment, which is paid quarterly in arrears. Tyson agreed to several debt covenants in connection with the new line of credit. The covenant terms limit the ratio of Tyson’s debt to capitalization to a maximum of 0.60 to 1 and requires the ratio of Tyson’s consolidated EBITDA to interest to be at least 3.75 to 1. Another $250 million in credit was recently secured as Tyson also amended and restated an existing loan agreement with Morgan Stanley increasing the credit from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity date to May 12, 2022. This extended line of credit has similar debt covenants and interest charges as the $1.8 billion. Tyson Foods CFO Dennis Leatherby has repeatedly said the company will work to keep its investment grade credit rating despite being in acquisition mode. Moody’s recently affirmed Tyson’s credit ratings above investment grade following the $4.6 billion it is spending to acquire AdvancePierre. Moody’s said the proposed mostly debt-financed acquisition has positive and negative credit elements. The Baa2 rating on Tyson Food’s long term debt is deemed to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk, according to Moody’s. The short-term rating of Prime 2 demonstrates the debtor’s strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations. Moody’s also gave Tyson an outlook rating of “stable.” Moody’s said Tyson’s increase in financial leverage could result from the acquisition. There is also the potential for integration or operating disruptions at AdvancePierre that cause the financial leverage to remain high over the next year. Moody’s said the risks are balanced against significant merits of the transaction, including an estimated $200 million of cost synergies Tyson could achieve by 2020. Moody’s said Tyson has decided to curtail its stock buybacks until late 2019 to focus on deleveraging from this deal. The rating service said debt will be approximately 2.8 times gross earnings (EBITDA) compared to 1.8 times now. Moody’s said 2.5 times would be tolerable to maintain the Baa2 rating. Moody’s maintained that rating expecting cost synergies and assets sales of brands like Sara Lee to bring leverage levels down to 2.5 times by September. Tyson’s move to buy AdvancePierre has hit a legal obstacle. A proposed class action suit was filed May 12, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio seeking to block the deal. Lead plaintiff is shareholder Stephen Bushansky who filed on behalf of others similarly situated. The plaintiff claims not all shareholders will benefit equally in this deal. The suit notes the proposed acquisition by Tyson “is the result of a truncated single-bidder process designed to benefit AdvancePierre’s management and largest stockholder, the Oaktree Holders. Despite having garnered interest from more than 30 parties in an outreach AdvancePierre conducted in 2015 prior to its IPO, “the Board failed to conduct even a limited market check before agreeing to the proposed (Tyson) deal.” Comments comments Previous post Report: Decade-long slide in global productivity has come to a halt Next post Automated technology impacts trucking industry ROI, benefits driver retention Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Camel backs and last straws Robert Coon In defense of Goldilocks Todd Turner Deceptive Trade Practices Act changes will harm Arkansas consumers Megan Hargraves Changes to Deceptive Trade Practices Act will make Arkansas more business-friendly Micah Whitfield Reviewing the ‘bargain branding’ rules Latest Popular Former FBI Director Robert Mueller named as Special Counsel in Trump-Russia probe 7 hours ago Automated technology impacts trucking industry ROI, benefits driver retention 8 hours ago Tyson Foods secures more than $2 billion in new debt to help finance AdvancePierre deal 9 hours ago Report: Decade-long slide in global productivity has come to a halt 9 hours ago Fort Smith attorney announces intent to run for At-Large School Board post, incumbent Deanie Mehl will not seek re-election 9 hours ago Riff Raff: Camel backs and last straws 2,987 views Fired Fort Smith sanitation director indicates recycling went to landfill going back to 2014 2,244 views Fast 15 recognizes up-and-comers who’ve enjoyed success at a young age 1,912 views Fort Smith city boss refuses to provide reason for sanitation director’s termination 1,606 views The Rocket Shot nearly landed on ‘Shark Tank’; it’s now a Daisy product 1,474 views Talk Business & Politics is a news website that covers business, politics and culture in Arkansas.

Jamie Dimon came under fire from shareholders at the bank's annual meeting (Source: Getty) Courtney Goldsmith The boss of JP Morgan Chase defended his ties to President Trump today after shareholders criticised his role as economic advisor to the White House. Jamie Dimon said he would help "any president" in office during a question and answer session at the lender's annual meeting, according to Reuters. "I would try to help any president of the United States becaue I'm a patriot," said Dimon, who is one of a number of business executives on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum. "That does not mean we agree with all the policies that an administration comes up with." When one shareholder asked Dimon if he would step down from Trump's advisory forum, Dimon said no. Dimon, who has previously spoken out in favour of a big review of the red tape governing banking, also said changes should be made to Dodd-Frank and other rules to "preserve the safety and soundness of the financial system". When it came down to the bank's business, voting shareholders sided with management on all major resolutions like executive compensation and election of directors.

Not quite. Despite predictions that 2017 would see a surge of real estate companies going public, so far it’s been more talk than action May 01, 2017 By E.B. Solomont On the morning of February 10, landlord and investor David Bistricer rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange, where, surrounded by family and colleagues from his firm, Clipper Equity, he ushered in another day of feverish trading. Afterward, Bistricer celebrated over a catered kosher breakfast and toured the historic building. Meanwhile, on the trading floor, Clipper — the real estate firm founded in the 1950s by Bistricer’s father — had kicked off a new (and public) era. Two years after disclosing plans to go public, the company debuted on the exchange that chilly February morning under the ticker CLPR and at $13.50 a share. So far, Clipper’s calculus appears to have paid off: The company’s IPO generated $86 million — more than the $78 million Clipper had projected in regulatory filings. At the time, the move was in sync with predictions that 2017 would see a burst of IPO activity in the real estate sector. But those predictions were fueled, at least partly, by the fact that global IPO activity plummeted last year to its lowest levels since the financial crisis. That left many to believe the market was due for a bumper crop of IPOs because of pent-up investment demand. Related: Tech darlings are different In 2016, deal volume was down 36 percent to 112 IPOs, and the amount of capital raised sank 37 percent to $21.3 billion, according to research from accounting giant Ernst & Young. Despite the predictions that 2017 would represent a turnaround, activity has been lukewarm— at least so far. While there’s no shortage of rumors and plans for IPOs, there’s been more talk and less action this year. Real estate IPOs peaked in 2013, when 21 companies raised more than $6 billion in initial public offerings, according the Greenwich-based Renaissance Capital, which specializes in providing pre-IPO research and managing IPO investments. Among them were Empire State Realty Trust and the shopping-center mega-landlord Brixmor Property Group, which raised $929.5 million and $825 million, respectively. That came on the heels of the $1.08 billion public debut of Realogy Holdings — the parent company of the Corcoran Group, Citi Habitats and a slew of other residential firms — in 2012. Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance, said with interest rates so low, real estate investment trusts were attractive to investors because the companies could borrow money on the cheap. With such strong investor demand, going public was a smart way of “finding returns.” “As interest rates rise, it reduces the economics of a REIT for investors,” said Smith. And as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in 2015, the number of real estate companies going public has indeed fallen precipitously. Last year, just four REITs nationwide went public. So far this year, there’ve been three — Clipper, the small financial Connecticut-based firm Sachem Capital Corp. and Invitation Homes, a Blackstone-backed REIT. Those three REITs have raised a combined $1.6 billion — a modest gain from the $1.5 billion raised in all of 2016 and $1.1 billion raised in 2015. Rumors are undoubtedly swirling about real estate tech companies like home-sharing giant Airbnb and venture-backed residential brokerage Compass going public (see sidebar). Commercial brokerages, including Cushman & Wakefield, have also flirted with the idea. And Newmark Grubb Knight Frank has filed initial paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go public this year, as has KKR, which is looking to raise up to $100 million for a mortgage REIT focused on commercial debt. Meanwhile, Vornado Realty Trust is working through plans to spin off its Washington, D.C., holdings and merge that portfolio with landlord JBG Companies. The combined company, to be called JBG Smith Properties, would be valued at $8.4 billion, including debt. Still, sources say the pipeline and trajectory of REIT IPOs is uncertain. They note that some companies that were considering IPOs are now wrestling with timing — given the slightly higher interest rates and low valuations in the market. And an increasing number of public companies are even considering going private. For those weighing whether to go public, the decision is further complicated by the fact that a REIT index launched last year hasn’t resulted in the deluge of investment from general investors that analysts predicted. In addition, REIT values are trading around — or below —their book value. “In 2017, public real estate valuations have generally declined relative to other parts of the market,” said Edward Mui, an analyst at investment research and management firm Morningstar. “Right now, the REIT sector is in a wait-and-see mode,” Mui added. Fueling market share In the clubby brokerage world, access to capital goes hand in hand with size and market share. The commercial brokerage world in New York, and beyond, is now controlled by a handful of giant companies that have bought out firms over the past couple of years. Anthony Paolone, an analyst at JPMorgan, said creating these megafirms — which can more easily move into new markets and launch new business lines — helps “achieve that goal of being in the top of the pack.” And that, sources say, lays the groundwork for a successful IPO. Tony Malkin This year, Howard Lutnick’s BGC Partners — NGKF’s parent company — took the first steps to spin off the brokerage into its own public company. The move came about five years after BGC bought NGKF, a move that boosted its own stock price. While NGKF’s investment-sales performance in New York has been less than stellar — it racked up $522 million in deals in 2016, taking the No. 18 spot on The Real Deal’s latest ranking of firms — executives have touted the company’s overall jump in revenue and brand-name poaches in other cities since the acquisition. Meanwhile, Cushman & Wakefield has appeared to be heading toward a public offering since its $2 billion merger with Chicago-based brokerage DTZ, which is backed by the private equity firm TPG. In 2014, the firm paid $100 million to acquire Massey Knakal Realty Services, and last year it poached top dealmakers Doug Harmon and Adam Spies from Eastdil Secured. “In Cushman’s case, I would assume, because it’s private equity-backed, that ultimately they’ll need to do something,” said JPMorgan’s Paolone, explaining why Cushman may be facing pressure to hit the stock market bell. In January, Bloomberg reported that Cushman executives were talking to investment banks about going public, as early as 2017’s third quarter or as late as 2018. “The stars have to be aligned correctly when you do this,” John Cushman III, the company’s chairman of global transactions, told TRD last year. “The economy has to be right. The real estate world has to be right.” JMP Securities’ Mitch Germain — who agreed that a Cushman IPO is “on everyone’s radar” given its recent hiring and growth — said going public makes sense for some large companies because it gives them “dry powder to invest in the future growth of the company.” But there are those who question whether brokerages today can attract investor capital. “You can take anything public, but you may not be able to take it public for the price you think is fair,” said Brandon Dobell, an analyst at global investment bank and asset management firm William Blair. These days, shares of publicly traded CBRE and JLL are trading low. JLL stock closed at about $112 on April 24, down from about $178 in July 2015. CBRE’s stock, meanwhile, dropped to $34.7 from $38 during the same time. “With the potential slowdown in the real estate markets,” said Jahn Brodwin, a senior managing director at New York-based consulting firm FTI Real Estate Solutions, “who would want to buy into a brokerage business?” T is for trillion Despite buzz around the REIT index — a newly formed category of stocks that was expected to drive more general investors into real estate — its existence has done little to move the needle. “There was a view that this would create lots of flows into the REIT market, because generalist investors — not REIT-dedicated investors — would have to get more market weight in the real estate business,” Owen Thomas, CEO of Boston Properties, said at NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate’s annual REIT symposium in April. “Well, that has not happened.” Before the index launched on September 1, JPMorgan predicted investors could pump as much as $100 billion into the sector. Real estate companies looking to grow recognize that shareholders can juice their earnings. And those who have gone public recently seem to have no rejects. Clipper’s Bistricer determined that the trade-off of giving up its very private status — something many of New York’s old-school landlords and developers want to avoid — was worth it. “It’s permanent capital,” he told TRD this year in describing his decision. “You can invest long-term, and it gives you more flexibility.” That’s not true with private equity money, because lenders typically want to see returns within five to seven years, said Bistricer, whose public filings revealed that the company is planning to invest $31 million in its 3,500-plus-unit residential portfolio and aiming to generate an extra $7.1 million in rental income at 50 Murray Street and 53 Park Place in Tribeca after raising rents to an average of $80 per square foot from $68 per square foot. (Clipper’s stock closed slightly down at $11.07 a share on April 21.) Meanwhile, Empire State Realty Trust CEO Anthony Malkin initially took heat for selling shares at $13 — the low end of the expected range. But Malkin said the decision was a good one. “The market is perfect: It tells you what you’re going to get on the basis of what people are going to pay. You have to make a decision about whether you’re prepared to sell,” said Malkin. “People had a hard time figuring out the value we’d be able to create by redeveloping the properties and leasing them to better tenants at higher rents,” he added. But he pointed out that investors who bought during the REIT’s 2013 IPO have been rewarded with a roughly 78 percent return. (Shares closed above $21 in mid-April.) “I’m perfectly happy with the result we achieved for our investors. We gave people liquidity without the requirement that they liquidate,” Malkin said. But he noted that not all companies can pull it off. “If you’re too small, it’s not just the burden of reporting, it’s also the costs,” said Malkin. “You do need a certain size in order to attract institutional investors and funds.” When a company is a fit, however, institutional investors still seem to be lining up. Joanthan Gray Overall, the industry’s market cap — or total value — surpassed $1 trillion this past July, up from $440 billion a decade ago, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which represents REITs nationwide. And while the index might not be surpassing expectations, some are confident that the tide will turn soon. In recent months, strong fundamentals like high occupancy rates for REIT-owned properties have boosted share prices — which in March were up 8.6 percent year over year. And there are other positive signs in the REIT market. Calvin Schnure, NAREIT’s senior vice president for research and economic analysis, said secondary offerings — or new stock issuances from companies that are already public — are actually up. REITs raised $8.9 billion during the first quarter of the year, up from $6.6 billion a year ago. That, he said, could be a sign of things to come. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you saw more IPOs, just because the underlying property fundamentals remain favorable,” he said. Pull of privatization Not everyone is convinced, however, that the IPO pipeline is going to get fatter anytime soon. Jonathan Gray, the head of global real estate at private equity giant Blackstone, predicted a wave of privatizations. Blackstone — whose $1.54 billion Invitation Homes IPO in January is the year’s only blockbuster deal so far — is now looking to raise $5 billion from investors for a new private Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust. The private fund is part of Blackstone’s bet on less risky, income-producing assets — an area that it sees as having big potential. “The prospects for growth in that business are huge,” CEO Stephen Schwarzman said on an April earnings call, referring to less-risky investments. “We should be able to create a really very large-scale business.” At the NYU conference, Gray added: “My gut is there will be more privatizations.” Historically, privatization is more prevalent when REIT prices are depressed, said FTI’s Brodwin. In particular, companies with large capital needs tend to fall out of favor on the public market because REITs are required to pay dividends. Brodwin said “privatization becomes more prevalent” when investors have cash to spend and interest rates inch up. JPMorgan’s Paolone said REITs are currently trading within 5 percent of their “net asset value” — meaning their book value versus stock price. That relatively neutral position means that investors are not really being pushed hard in one direction over the other. Brodwin said the market is currently at a “stalemate” with a dearth of activity for both public and private offerings. “We’re kind of at the top of the roller coaster,” he said. “We’re teetering, and I’m not sure which way it could go. It could work itself into a bear or a bull.”  Short URL Print Popular Savanna buying Midtown South office building for $126M Walentas: Real estate industry should do more to pay for NYC infrastructure BCB sells W’burg rental to German investor for $23M Chinese buyer shells out $50M for Bob Diamond’s 15 CPW penthouse: sources Maddd Equities planning pair of DoBro apartment buildings More Stories WATCH: The founders of Slate dish on their favorite deals, the new 421a … & more More Videos Sites South Florida Los Angeles TRData LLNYC Other Links Directory Shop Subscribe to Magazine About Us Staff Directory Contact Us Privacy Policy Careers STAY CONNECTED Join over 200,000 real estate professionals who receive our daily newsletter All rights reserved © 2017 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc. 450 West 31st Street, New York, NY 10001 Phone: 212-260-1332 Sections News Residential Commercial Development Finance Tech Politics Architecture and Design Paydirt The Long View China Watch Magazine Current Issue The Closings Issue archives Special issue archive Subscribe to Magazine TRData Properties People Companies Deal Sheet Rankings Events Industry Calendar TRD Events TRD Info About us Advertising Careers

Larry Guenther, market executive for Nebraska middle market banking and specialized industries, JP Morgan Chase JPMorgan Chase will open office in Omaha By Cole Epley / World-Herald staff writer Cole Epley May 17, 2017 Updated 13 hrs ago (…) +1  Larry Guenther, market executive for Nebraska middle market banking and specialized industries, JP Morgan Chase THE ASSOCIATED PRESS JPMorgan Chase will open a location in Omaha to expand its reach to "middle-market" companies. The largest U.S. bank is planting a flag in Omaha, but JPMorgan Chase isn’t banking on growth here coming from checking accounts for rank-and-file depositors. Instead, the New York-based financial institution with $2.5 trillion in assets is looking to beef up its commercial lending portfolio here by putting more so-called “middle-market” companies in Chase-backed loans, lines of credit and other financial services. Middle-market companies make up a broad swath of industry and are defined as businesses with annual revenue between $25 million and $1 billion. Already, Chase has “a little over $1 billion” in loans, lines of credit and other financial products and services to commercial customers in Nebraska, said Larry Guenther, who is leading the bank’s effort here. It’s part of a strategy to break into each of the 50 largest cities in the U.S. where it doesn’t have a presence already, Guenther said. The new Omaha division is part of Chase’s Middle Market Banking and Specialized Industries business, which focuses on clients in 15 industries including insurance, agriculture and transportation. Chase has been expanding its corresponding middle market banking operation in Overland Park, Kansas, since establishing that office in 2013, said Maura Cordova, a bank spokeswoman. Guenther said it will be far more efficient and convenient to be able to work with clients from a local office as opposed to having to fly in from an office in an entirely different market. “What we’ve experienced by having people on the ground is that it really sends a message to business owners that there’s a long-term commitment that the bank will be here,” he said. Veteran commercial lender Guenther most recently led Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank’s commercial lending operation in Omaha. He has also worked for South Dakota’s Great Western Bank. Chase’s local operation is currently housed in Aksarben Village at 2111 S. 67th St., Suite 300, but the search is on for a permanent location that officials hope will be nailed down by the end of 2017. cole.epley@owh.com, 402-444-1534 +1  Larry Guenther, market executive for Nebraska middle market banking and specialized industries, JP Morgan Chase More information U.S. banks collect more and more money from overdraft fees, but not in Nebraska U.S. financial institutions brought in more money from overdraft fees in 2016 than any year since the financial crisis, according to recent data. But the largest Nebraska banks are bucking that trend — they collected less in overdraft fees last year than they did in 2015.

Photo: Shutterstock Published on Wednesday, 17 May, 2017 at 06:30 (sth) – Luxembourg's fund industry continues to grow apace, according to a recent study by Monterey Insight. The research company found that Luxembourg-domiciled funds boasted more than 3,977 billion US dollars (3,771 billion euros) in assets under management (AUM) in 2016, a 3% increase compared with the 3,857 billion dollars reported in 2015. State Street retained its top ranking as the largest administrator by total net assets, with $703.2 billion, followed by JP Morgan Bank ($548.8bn), BNY Mellon ($304.5bn) and BNP Paribas ($285.6bn). Among fund managers, the largest promoter or initiator of Luxembourg-domiciled schemes was JP Morgan ($294.6bn), followed by Deutsche Asset Management ($176.5bn) and BlackRock Financial Management ($145.5bn). As has been the case for much of the past decade, JP Morgan Bank had the largest proportion of assets under custody, at $761.7 billion, ahead of State Street ($704.7bn) and Brown Brothers Harriman ($331.2bn). This year, for the first time, Monterey Insight added a transfer-agent ranking, led by State Street, with a total of $555.8 billion in assets and 1,503 funds. RBC Investors Services Bank followed in second place with $489.5bn in assets, and JP Morgan in third, with $382.5bn. PwC building in Cloche d'Or Photo: Pierre Matgé PwC defends leading auditor position In the auditors category, PwC maintained its lead, auditing 5,878 sub-funds, ahead of KPMG (3,359) and Deloitte (2,629). For legal advisers, Arendt & Medernach was able to maintain first place by number of funds (3,788), just ahead of Elvinger, Hoss & Prussen (3,346). Looking at market share by total net assets, however, Elvinger, Hoss & Prussen was able to defend its top ranking, as has largely been the case for the last 10 years. As with the year previous, equity funds accounted for the lion's share (29%) of total fund assets in Luxembourg at $1,145.7 billion dollars, followed by bond funds, which increased in number to 3,018, and in assets to $1,140.8 billion, up from 2,940 and $1,077.4 billion. Cash products were also on the rise, growing by 8%, while alternative investments grew by 5%. Over the course of 2016, 1,591 funds were launched with total assets of $149 billion, representing an increase of 9% compared with the previous year. For these newly launched funds, the top sectors were traditional investments such as global bonds and global mixed equities bonds, with total assets of $86.6 billion, accounting for 58% of assets launched in 2016.

At the bank’s annual meeting in Wilmington, Delaware, several attendees demanded answers from Dimon about his role on a White House business council and JPMorgan’s involvement with financial deregulation efforts in Washington. “I would try to help any president of the United States, because I’m a patriot,” Dimon said. “That does not mean we agree with all the policies that an administration comes up with.” Asked whether he would step down from Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum, which includes over a dozen leaders of major corporations, Dimon said simply, “No.” Like annual shareholder meetings held by other big U.S. banks this year, JPMorgan’s was dominated by activists concerned about Trump’s positions on immigration, minorities, human rights and the environment. The actual business of the meeting was less controversial: voting shareholders sided with management on all major resolutions, including the election of directors and executive compensation. Activists’ proposals were rejected. In discussing Trump, Dimon repeated a metaphor he has used several times about the president being a pilot and the United States an airplane. He also defended JPMorgan’s track record with issues shareholders raised, including its support for “free and fair trade” with Mexico, and argued that efforts to reduce Wall Street regulations will help the economy.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Opinion Sebi hauling up Crisil and CARE in the Amtek case is good regulation of ratings agencies Sebi hauling up Crisil and CARE in the Amtek case is good regulation of ratings agencies While CARE failed to warn the market sufficiently ahead of time about Amtek’s position, and suspended its rating abruptly—before suspension, it had given Amtek a AA- rating. By: The Financial Express | Published: May 18, 2017 6:16 AM Between September 1 and 29, Crisil brought down its rating by eight notches before announcing withdrawal of ratings on October 15. (PTI) Given how badly CARE Ratings and Crisil failed to monitor the quality of Amtek Auto’s bonds and the quality of JP Morgan’s bond fund’s holdings, respectively—and brought on a redemption crisis in August 2015 when Amtek Auto was on the verge of defaulting on Rs 800 crore of bond repayments—market watchdog Sebi has rightly hauled them up. While CARE failed to warn the market sufficiently ahead of time about Amtek’s position, and suspended its rating abruptly—before suspension, it had given Amtek a AA- rating, which hid its inability to service financial obligations on time—Crisil didn’t give adequate consideration to information in the public domain about the Amtek bonds that the JP Morgan MF held. So, when it assessed the JP Morgan schemes investing in low-credit-rated paper, it gave the schemes the highest portfolio credit quality rating. Between September 1 and 29, Crisil brought down its rating by eight notches before announcing withdrawal of ratings on October 15. It was as if Amtek paper became junk overnight, and this would have seriously hurt buyers and investors in the JP Morgan fund. Similar laxity on the part of reviewers in the US helped precipitate the 2008 financial crisis. The role of the Big Three—Standard & Poor’s, Fitch and Moody’s—has come under legal scrutiny in both the US and Europe. Indeed, Moody’s , earlier this year agreed to pay $864 million as penalty for its shoddy rating of mortgage securities in the US, while S&P had to pay $1.375 billion after the US launched a $5-billion suit against it. Though the US government has moved to repeal the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation that gave more teeth to ratings’ regulation, faulty assessment of risk associated with debt securities needs to be taken seriously.

Standard Life already has an operation in Dublin and is unusual among British life insurers in having thousands of customers in the EU. Standard Life’s choice comes after high-profile insurers AIG and Lloyd’s of London picked Luxembourg and Brussels for their new bases. Standard Life shareholders will vote next month on the firm’s £11bn (€12.8bn) merger with rival Scottish fund firm Aberdeen Asset Management. Dublin, which got approval from Wall Street investment banking giant JPMorgan, could also secure the EU offices of Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, the Irish Examiner has reported. BNP Paribas may move up to 300 London staff due to Brexit, depending on how clients adapt, a source told Reuters. The UK’s vote to leave the EU has forced global banks to examine where to move, given they expect to lose the necessary ‘passporting’ licence to operate across the EU. BNP Paribas, which declined to comment on its plans, had 3,123 staff in its corporate and institutional bank in the UK at the end of 2016. Credit Agricole, France’s third-biggest listed bank, has said it could move about 100 of its 1,000 employees based in its London hub to France. And Deutsche Bank has said it may have to move up to 4,000 jobs out. In London, a growing number of unoccupied older properties caused the overall office vacancy rate to climb to 5.8% at the end of the first quarter from 3.9% a year earlier, according to data compiled by Deloitte. That was the biggest increase since 2009. n Reuters, Bloomberg and Irish Examiner READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS brexit © Irish Examiner Ltd.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: After Today, Bank of America Stock Could Soon Be a Buy Again If Bank of America’s stock continues to head down, investors might want to consider adding it to their portfolios. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) May 17, 2017 at 6:21PM It's my opinion that Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) stock could soon be a buy, if the events in Washington, D.C. continue to roil the markets. I'll spell out exactly how I intend to approach this, after laying out my thesis. My thesis In the immediate aftermath of the presidential election, shares of banks rocketed. And none more so than Bank of America. BAC data by YCharts. They rocketed because investors believed that a pro-business president would be good for the economy, which would boost loan demand and interest rates. This would position banks to sell more of their primary product, and do so at a higher price. On the campaign trail, moreover, the current president vowed to "dismantle" the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which had been passed to combat the conduct that led to the financial crisis. The regulations passed under Dodd-Frank have become incredibly burdensome to any objective observer. When a banker with pristine credentials such as Robert Wilmers at M&T Bank spends the lion's share of his widely read annual letter every year talking about the undue compliance burden facing banks, and is seconded by the likes of U.S. Bancorp's Richard Davis and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, the fact is that the regulatory environment has gotten too onerous. So there were good reasons that the market responded. But the market went too far. Valuations got too far out in front of fundamental performances. This is why I wrote in February that cash will be king in 2017, as it wouldn't be a surprise to see valuations correct sometime this year after the messy realities of governing sunk in. Some people will see this as market timing, the implication being that it's impossible to time the market. But one should never get dogmatic in their thinking. The reality is that stocks, measured by the leading stock market valuation measure today, Robert Shiller's CAPE ratio, have only been higher twice in history: In 1929 and 1999. One reason stocks are historically high is that interest rates are historically low -- Warren Buffett makes this point. And interest rates and stocks are inversely correlated. As rates go up, so too will the required rate of return on stocks in order to compete on a risk-adjusted basis with risk-free alternatives such as government bonds. But interest rates were priced into stocks before the election. What happened after the election, with bank stocks rallying 20% or more, was all about expectations around Donald Trump's ability to deliver on his promise to lower taxes, ease regulations, and boost economic growth. That wasn't a bad bet, given the Republican unity between the executive and legislative branches. Fast-forward to today, however, and the governing agenda has taken a back seat to the controversies swirling around the president. It seems increasingly unlikely, if not fanciful, to think that any type of meaningful tax reform can be accomplished at this point. Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell went on the record this week to say that tax reform must be revenue neutral, which effectively eliminates the simulative impact from the proposed reform and will temper any cuts to the corporate income-tax rate. The same goes for the other legislative priorities the administration had laid out. Things like repealing Obamacare, building a wall, investing $1 trillion in domestic infrastructure, and so on. The net result is that expectations are being recast. As that happens, it would make logical sense that stock valuations will follow. And as that happens, it's my opinion that there will be attractive investments to be made. Why Bank of America? One of those investments is Bank of America. The nation's second biggest bank by assets is no longer weighed down by legal actions and toxic assets tracing back to the financial crisis. As a result, while Bank of America has spent $200 billion over the past eight years on crisis-related costs, it's now free to grow revenue and earnings consistently. And growing earnings is exactly what it's doing. Last year was the second best year in Bank of America's history, in terms of the size of its bottom line. By the end of this year, moreover, Bank of America could be on track to meet its profitability targets on an annualized basis. On top of that, Bank of America has an abundance of excess capital on its balance sheet. I estimate that it could return as much as $23 billion to shareholders by way of buybacks, yet still be considered well capitalized and sail through the quantitative portion of the annual stress tests. And the bank's chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan, has repeatedly said that buying back a lot of stock is one of his top priorities. He did so most recently in his 2016 shareholder letter. Eventually, it will be freed up to do just that. And it'll probably be sooner rather than later. By next year, Bank of America could have a combined payout ratio of more than 100%, meaning that it pays out more in dividends and buybacks than it earns in net income. This would drive down the capital on its balance sheet, and thereby drive up its profitability. And because profitability and valuation are intimately intertwined, it would boost Bank of America's valuation, a move that would be catalyzed by the bank's falling share count. It would also increase the buying pressure on Bank of America's stock. This would come from both the bank's repurchase program, as well as from income investors that move back into its stock for the growing dividend. Consequently, the threshold I'm looking for is around $20 a share. If Bank of America's stock breaks below that, I'll start buying it. I'll do so in multiple stages, which will allow me to average around the bottom. That's my plan. I think it's a good one. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and US Bancorp.

A trader works on the floor at the closing bell of the Dow Jones at the New York Stock Exchange. PHOTO: AFP Published7 hours ago More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/46Fx Copy NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - For the first time, a Wall Street that's been giddy over Donald Trump is starting to ask some hard questions. From Day 1, markets have rallied, defying what many of the same Wall Street types said would be a disastrous election outcome. Since then, US stocks have hit record after record, driving up shares of Goldman Sachs to JPMorgan Chase to Apple, as investors quickly focused on what his pro-business, tax-cutting agenda would mean for corporate profits. But the steady drumbeat of bad news may finally be taking its toll. On Wednesday (May 17), US stocks tumbled, Treasuries soared and volatility came roaring back as a series of damaging revelations - from Trump's disclosure of classified information to Russian officials to reports that he pressed FBI director James Comey to drop a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn - prompted many on Wall Street to wonder whether the turbulence that has shattered the market's calm might be the start of something bigger. It's also left many to ask whether the market was blinded by its own optimism over Trump's business-friendly agenda. "Crazy times, huh?" said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. "I've talked to a few personal friends and a few customers who I know are supportive of Trump that are saying, boy, this isn't good." Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Of course, financial markets are often punctuated by bouts of alarm that have unsettled traders during normal times. And up to now, it's been easy to dismiss the president's missteps as the price of electing an outsider. But now, the biggest question is whether Trump's presidency is in trouble. For some of the world's largest banks, Trump's firing of Comey last week was a signal moment. At least two global firms have started mapping out how financial markets might react to an impeachment - a scenario they still saw as improbable, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who declined to speak publicly because such deliberations are politically sensitive. While their work is just beginning and it's too early to draw conclusions, the people said, it's a telling sign of just how serious things have become. "The political risk has been upped here - things sound more ominous and serious than a week ago," said Gary Pollack, the head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank's Private Wealth Management unit. Much of the problem is how pervasively investors had tuned out Trump in the months before the latest scandal broke. The CBOE Volatility Index's average level since December has been 25 per cent below that of 2016 - not exactly a turbulent year to begin with. Everything from Treasuries to currencies and stocks had been limping along without a care - before Wednesday. "Markets are very blasé about political risk until the very last moment," former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said at the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, known as SALT, in Las Vegas. "They go along until something happens that pulls the rug out from under their assumptions." The S&P 500 Index, which set another all-time high just two days ago, was routed in the worst selloff in eight months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 372-point slide was its steepest since the election. US The dollar fell a sixth day, while yields on 10-year Treasuries tumbled by the most since the day after the Brexit vote. Trump is facing the deepest crisis of his presidency after contents of a memo written by Comey surfaced Tuesday, alleging that the president asked him to drop an investigation of Flynn. That came after Trump disclosed highly classified intelligence to Russian officials in a meeting last week. "The market is running with politics," said Bret Barker, who oversees US fixed-income at TCW Group, which manages US$194 billion. "There's just not much out there to change fundamentals right now." A vacuum of catalysts faced anyone hoping the traditional saviors of markets would step up to calm things down. Earnings season is over, the next report on US employment is 16 days away, and the Fed doesn't meet again for a month. That's potentially bad news for a stock market whose 10 per cent rally since Election Day has pushed valuations to the highest levels since just after the dot-com bubble. The biggest beneficiaries of the Trump trade were bearing the brunt of the carnage on Wednesday. Exchange-traded funds tuned to stocks with the most sensitivity to market swings were having their worst day in two months. Bank shares in the S&P 500 plunged 3 per cent, bringing the slide from a March 1 record to 8.6 per cent. "That's one of the problems with rather a quiet market that even a small ripple could look pretty big," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. "Sometimes if it's too quiet, people think things can only get worse."   Related Stories:  42575506_-_16_05_2017_-_us-politics-trump.jpg Related Story Trump impeachment chatter ratchets up in halls of US Capitol trump3.jpg Related Story Impeachment - the 'I' word - and how it works 42598866_-_18_05_2017_-_us-donald-trump-delivers-commencement-address-at-u.s.-coast-guar.jpg Related Story Donald Trump urges quick conclusion of Russia probe after appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller Trump's strikes defiant tone on Comey revelations Related Story Congress seeks Comey testimony as Russia turmoil engulfs Trump Former FBI director Mueller named to investigate Trump-Russia ties Related Story Former FBI chief Robert Mueller named special counsel to investigate Trump-Russia ties 42455502_-_05_05_2017_-_usa_trump_health_care.jpg Related Story More US Republicans back independent probe of Trump-Russia ties Trump asked Comey to shut down Flynn probe: source Related Story Was Trump's request to drop FBI probe on adviser an obstruction of justice? comey.jpg Related Story Ex-FBI chief Comey so 'appalled' by Trump request to drop Russia probe that he wrote memo: CNN ST_20170514_NYT14_3139712.jpg Related Story Comey's firing: Strange and borderline ridiculous ST_20170513_VNNIXON_3137907.jpg Related Story Comparisons drawn with Nixon but impeachment 'unlikely' 42533104_-_12_05_2017_-_trump_comey_decision_3.jpg Related Story In private meeting, Trump demanded FBI director Comey's loyalty 'He was not doing a good job', says Trump of Comey Related Story Why did Donald Trump oust FBI chief James Comey?

The visit marks Obama's first formal public appearance since leaving office. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)    EXCLUSIVE: Obama Investigators Tried Plugging SEC Leaks Twice, Failed Ethan Barton 6:38 PM 05/17/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Federal investigators failed twice during President Barack Obama’s tenure to identify who leaked internal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) information to Reuters, according to documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group. The SEC’s Inspector General (IG) launched an investigation after Reuters published a story relying on an internal SEC document showing that 10 firms were under investigation for high-frequency trading, a report recently released through a Freedom of Information Act request shows. The probe began about four months after a previous IG investigation seeking to plug leaks concluded. “The investigation determined that nonpublic information was included in the July 17, 2014, Reuters article,” the report, which concluded a year later, said. Investigators were “unable to determine which specific individual(s) improperly disclosed information to Reuters based on the March 24, 2014 email.” The IG interviewed 21 SEC officials and reviewed agency telephone and email records, but was still unable to determine the leaker. “All employees advised they were not the source of the alleged leak and were unaware of who may have shared the nonpublic information,” the report said. Similarly, the IG concluded another investigation into SEC leakers in March 2014, according to Reuters. The news outlet reported nonpublic information from a closed-door SEC meeting that resulted in a settlement with JPMorgan Chase & Co. “A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission watchdog conducted an extensive, months-long investigation to find out who had leaked information that appeared in two Reuters stories published last autumn, but it was unable to identify the sources, according to a report of the probe seen by Reuters,” the news outlet reported July 31, 2014. The watchdog interviewed 53 SEC officials and reviewed email and phone records, according to Reuters. Reuters denied the IG’s request to interview reporters involved in the stories, the news outlet reported. Redactions make it difficult to determine if the IG requested an interview with Reuters for the 2014 report. “It’s the job of journalists to report vigorously on the workings of government, and to provide readers with news that some may prefer to keep secret,” Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen Adler said at the time. “It is in that spirit that Reuters covers the SEC and other agencies of the U.S. government, and we plan to continue to do so while protecting the confidentiality of our sources.” Obama actively sought to plug leaks during his two terms in the White House. The Department of Justice (DOJ), for example, subpoenaed emails and phone records of Associated Press editors and reporters in 2013. Obama’s DOJ – following in the Bush administration’s example – subpoenaed New York Times journalist James Risen to force him to reveal his sources, resulting in a seven-year legal battle, as another example. And Fox News reporter James Rosen was threatened with prosecution for accepting documents from a government source, also in 2013. President Donald Trump has similarly called for investigations into intelligence leaks to the media, and recently asked about reporters being imprisoned for publishing classified information, according to the New York Times. A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment for this story. Neither the SEC IG nor Reuters responded to TheDCNF’s requests for comment. Follow Ethan on Twitter. Send tips to [email protected] .

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Economy Companies Markets Finance Regulation Business Markets Nasdaq suffers worst-day decline since Brexit amid Trump concerns The Dow Jones shed more than 370 points for its steepest daily decline since September. By Nicole Rojas May 17, 2017 23:29 BST Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, 17 May 2017REUTERS/Brendan McDermid US stocks took a nosedive on Wednesday, plummeting to new lows as investors' concerns over President Donald Trump's Russia controversy rose. All three major markets dropped to their worst daily decline in months, with the Dow and S&P 500 hitting their worst drop since September and the Nasdaq suffering its biggest decline since June. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 372.82 points, or 1.8%, to 20,606.93 for its steepest decline since 9 September. According to MarketWatch, financials suffered the biggest loses, down more than 3%. Goldman Sachs Group Inc fell 5.3%, while JP Morgan Chase & Co dropped 3.8%. The S&P 500 index sank 43.64 points, or 1.8%, to settle at 2,357.03 for the worst drop since 9 September. Financials, which lead decliners, were dragged down by banks, with the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) falling 3.9%, CNBC reported. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite saw its worst-day decline since the day after the Brexit referendum. The index dropped 158.63 points, or 2.6%, to close at 6,011.24. "This is clearly Washington-driven," Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management, told CNBC. "It's a lot like 1998-99, when the market had to deal with the [Monica] Lewinsky scandal." The Trump administration has been besieged by several scandals in the last week, with reports emerging that Trump divulged sensitive classified information to Russian diplomats and also asked former FBI Director James Comey to stop a federal investigation into Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser. The latter was discovered in a memo written by Comey to allegedly create a paper trail of what he perceived to be inappropriate intervention attempts by the president. Late on Tuesday (16 May), House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz requested the FBI turn over any records it has on communications between Trump and Comey. The CBOE Volatility Index, which tracks implied volatility on the S&P 500 30 days in the future, rose 46% to 15.59, MarketWatch reported. The increase marks the biggest daily climb since after Brexit in June 2016. "Investors are more nervous today than they were yesterday so you are seeing a big bid in the bond market. So funds are reducing equities slightly today and moving into safety," Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities, said. According to CNBC, traditional safe havens rose with the benchmark 10-year yield falling to around 2.21%. Gold rose 1.8% to $1,258.70 an ounce and oil prices climbed 0.8% to settle at $49.07 a barrel. Meanwhile, the yen rose against the dollar to trade at 110.99. The ICE Dollar Index, which dropped to its lowest level since before the US presidential election earlier in the session, rebounded to trade at 97.51. In a note Monday (15 May), Andy Brenner, head of international fixed income securities at National Alliance Securities, said: "If special prosecutors are hired or there is more talk about obstruction of justice being an impeachable offense, one can kiss the tax plan, healthcare plan, and fiscal stimulus plan goodbye for 2017."

One the largest independent oil refiners in the U.S., a major advantage for TSO is the scale and diversification benefits offered by its portfolio of 7 refineries. We also like TSO's solid long-term competitive position on the supply constrained California market. We view its impending acquisition of fellow downstream operator WNR as positive, given the compelling strategic rationale of the transaction. However, we remain worried by the tepid outlook for refining margins and weaker performance in its marketing unit. As it is, the U.S. refiners are feeling the pinch of higher RFS costs to comply with new cleaner gasoline production rules. These factors form the basis of our cautious stance on TSO.” TSO has been the topic of several other research reports. JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded shares of Tesoro from a neutral rating to an overweight rating and set a $99.00 target price on the stock in a report on Thursday, February 2nd.

From Day 1, markets have rallied, defying what many of the same Wall Street types said would be a disastrous election outcome. Since then, U.S. stocks have hit record after record, driving up shares of Goldman Sachs to JPMorgan Chase to Apple, as investors quickly focused on what his pro-business, tax-cutting agenda would mean for corporate profits. But the steady drumbeat of bad news may finally be taking its toll. On Wednesday, stocks tumbled, Treasuries soared and volatility came roaring back as a series of damaging revelations -- from Trump’s disclosure of classified information to Russian officials to reports that he pressed FBI Director James Comey to drop a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn -- prompted many on Wall Street to wonder whether the turbulence that has shattered the market’s calm might be the start of something bigger. And that was before news broke that former FBI Director Robert Mueller was named special counsel to oversee the probe of Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election. It’s all also left many to ask whether the market was blinded by its own optimism over Trump’s business-friendly agenda. “Crazy times, huh?” said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. “I’ve talked to a few personal friends and a few customers who I know are supportive of Trump that are saying, boy, this isn’t good.” Of course, financial markets are often punctuated by bouts of alarm that have unsettled traders during normal times. And up to now, it’s been easy to dismiss the president’s missteps as the price of electing an outsider. But now, the biggest question is whether Trump’s presidency is in trouble. Trump tumult: SkyBridge Alternatives (SALT) Conference attendees Zell, Richards, Barger, Hentemann, Gayeski comment. Source: Bloomberg For some of the world’s largest banks, Trump’s firing of Comey last week was a signal moment. At least two global firms have started mapping out how financial markets might react to an impeachment -- a scenario they still saw as improbable, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who declined to speak publicly because such deliberations are politically sensitive. While their work is just beginning and it’s too early to draw conclusions, the people said, it’s a telling sign of just how serious things have become. “The political risk has been upped here -- things sound more ominous and serious than a week ago,” said Gary Pollack, the head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth Management unit. Much of the problem is how pervasively investors had tuned out Trump in the months before the latest scandal broke. The CBOE Volatility Index’s average level since December has been 25 percent below that of 2016 -- not exactly a turbulent year to begin with. Everything from Treasuries to currencies and stocks had been limping along without a care -- before Wednesday. “Markets are very blasé about political risk until the very last moment,” former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said at the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, known as SALT, in Las Vegas. “They go along until something happens that pulls the rug out from under their assumptions.” The S&P 500 Index, which set another all-time high just two days ago, was routed in the worst selloff in eight months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s 372-point slide was its steepest since the election. The dollar fell a sixth day, while yields on 10-year Treasuries tumbled by the most since the day after the Brexit vote. Trump is facing the deepest crisis of his presidency after contents of a memo written by Comey surfaced Tuesday, alleging that the president asked him to drop an investigation of Flynn. That came after Trump disclosed highly classified intelligence to Russian officials in a meeting last week. “The market is running with politics,” said Bret Barker, who oversees U.S. fixed-income at TCW Group Inc., which manages $194 billion. “There’s just not much out there to change fundamentals right now.” The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up A vacuum of catalysts faced anyone hoping the traditional saviors of markets would step up to calm things down. Earnings season is over, the next report on U.S. employment is 16 days away, and the Fed doesn’t meet again for a month. That’s potentially bad news for a stock market whose 10 percent rally since Election Day has pushed valuations to the highest levels since just after the dot-com bubble. The biggest beneficiaries of the Trump trade were bearing the brunt of the carnage on Wednesday. Exchange-traded funds tuned to stocks with the most sensitivity to market swings were having their worst day in two months. Bank shares in the S&P 500 plunged 3 percent, bringing the slide from a March 1 record to 8.6 percent. “That’s one of the problems with rather a quiet market that even a small ripple could look pretty big,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. “Sometimes if it’s too quiet, people think things can only get worse.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

May 17 2017 4:53 PM Jamie Dimon Steps in It The JPMorgan CEO defended advising Trump—just hours before the administration hit its lowest point yet. By Daniel Gross   JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon attends a policy forum with President Trump in the State Dining Room at the White House on Feb. 3. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Jamie Dimon picked one hell of a week to lean in to Donald Trump. On Tuesday, the day after the Washington Post revealed the president had shared highly classified information with Russian diplomats and a week after he fired James Comey, the veteran CEO of JPMorgan Chase told investors at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting that he wouldn’t step down from his perch on Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory council of powerful American executives. “He is the president of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our airplane,” Dimon said. “I would try to help any president of the United States, because I’m a patriot.” Dimon surely wishes he’d said something different. Only hours later came the news that according to a memo by Comey, Trump had asked the FBI director to end his agency’s inquiry into former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn—a revelation that has brought Trump’s presidency to its lowest, most tumultuous point yet. Advertisement One odd and compelling consequence of the Trump era has been the way it has affected, flummoxed, and exposed America’s corporate titans. A class of people who are accustomed to deference and are possessed of extraordinary self-confidence and agency hasn’t quite known how to react to the new regime. Ordinarily, CEOs can support GOP standard-bearers who promise to cut taxes and slash regulations without anyone blinking. But a polarizing, willfully un–PC politician like Trump poses a challenge for many modern CEOs. He’s a walking violation of a host of human-resources policies and stands in stark opposition to the corporate-style progressivism that permeates so many consumer-facing companies today. As a group, Fortune 500 companies today are socially liberal, especially on areas surrounding diversity, gay rights, and immigration; they are unabashedly in favor of free trade and globalization, express concern about climate change, and embrace renewable energy. Trump is none of these things. Get Slate in your inbox. And so we’ve seen a range of reactions. There’s a group of CEO types, mostly crusty older guys like Carl Icahn and T. Boone Pickens, who are unapologetic Trump fans—and in some instances his pals. Since they founded their companies and are far beyond caring what other people think, getting in bed with Trump politically isn’t an issue. As people in public life, CEOs often feel compelled to offer anodyne support for the new CEO of the country. But many others have had to walk a tightrope. Immediately after the election, many CEOs felt compelled to reaffirm their own—and their companies’—values in the face of Trumpism. As Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi noted, “My employees were all crying. The question that they are asking, especially those who are not white—‘Are we safe?’ Women are asking, ‘Are we safe?’ LGBT people are asking, ‘Are we safe?’—I never thought I would have to answer those questions.” She continued: “So, I think that the first thing that we have to do is to assure everyone living in the United States will be safe.” And Pepsi, however clumsily, has attempted to capitalize on the progressive pushback against Trump’s policies—even as Nooyi serves on Trump’s Strategic and Advisory Council. Advertisement As people in public life, CEOs often feel compelled to offer anodyne support for the new CEO of the country. And that’s typically not a big deal. But some CEOs have found that doing so can get them into hot water with their customers, key employees, and endorsers. In February, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank commented that “to have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset to this country.” To which NBA star Steph Curry, one of the company’s most important celebrity endorsers, responded, “I agree with that description [of Trump], if you remove the et” [from asset]. Under Armour’s stock fell. Then there is the class of CEOs whose business relies on the government for contracts, or who stand to be impacted by significant regulatory changes. These titans have had to swallow their pride and their personal political preferences for the sake of their businesses. They show up to meetings, but try not to say too much and give away their real feelings via body language. Who can forget the pained expressions on the faces of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Sergey Brin, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg when they were summoned to Trump Tower in the wake of the election? For Uber’s Travis Kalanick, who bowed to consumer pressure and quit Trump’s advisory council in February, walking a tightrope was impossible. Another group of CEOs—the big shots who run large manufacturers and defense contractors—have assumed a posture that is simultaneously defensive and uncharacteristically unctuous. Weary of being on the wrong end of a Trump tweetstorm about shipping jobs overseas or fearful of losing a potentially lucrative contract, they have made nice to Trump through gestures and words. See Lockheed Martin CEO Marilyn Hewson’s pledge to reduce costs on the F-35 or Ford CEO Mark Fields touting a previously planned factory investment in Michigan as a “vote of confidence” in Trump. But most of these moves came immediately after the election or the inauguration—when Trump was still (relatively) popular and before he had truly begun to wreak havoc on the nation’s governing norms. In the past several weeks, as Trump’s popularity has plummeted and the presidency has lurched from self-imposed crisis to self-imposed crisis, savvy CEOs have been keeping their distance. So it’s surprising that at the very moment Republican elected officials were beginning to inch away from Trump, Dimon voluntarily stepped his foot in the mess. After all, Dimon is a savvy banker with excellent self-preservation instincts—Duff McDonald’s biography of Dimon is justly titled Last Man Standing. Dimon managed to steer JPMorgan through the financial crisis and has held on to his post despite the fact that, under his reign, JPMorgan Chase has racked up tens of billions of dollars in fines and settlements.   What’s behind this? Dimon isn’t a secret Trumpkin. While he was relatively close to people in Obama’s orbit—Dimon ran Chicago-based Bank One and got to know key Obama lieutenants like Rahm Emanuel and Bill Daley —Dimon has generally been a nonpartisan figure. And he’s not angling for an appointment, although the prospect of him replacing Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen when her tenure expires in 2018 isn’t the craziest idea. To be sure, JPMorgan Chase, like all the other major banks, does have a significant regulatory agenda. And it would benefit from a less aggressive Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a revamping of the Dodd-Frank law, which penalizes the larger banks. But Trump and his crowd would be pushing this agenda regardless of whether Dimon was providing cover. The simplest explanation may be that the people who run giant global businesses tend not to spend much time on Twitter or reading Politico or watching MSNBC. They’re not political junkies. They don’t follow the daily ins and outs of Beltway doings unless it directly impacts their business. It’s quite possible that Dimon—along with many other CEOs—hasn’t grasped how the zeitgeist has turned against Trump and wasn’t following the unfolding details surrounding the Comey firing and the latest Russia intrigue. And if you’re only dipping into the stream occasionally, instead of being immersed in it, you might not grasp that an anodyne talking point that would have gone over quite easily in December, or January, or February would land like a ton of bricks in May.

(Provided by Butterfly Pavilion) After 25 years at it’s current Westminster location, the Butterfly Pavilion hopes to migrate to Broomfield. The pavilion and its affiliate, the Center for Invertebrate Research and Conservation (CIRC), want to relocate the facility to North Park, at Colo. 7 and Sheridan Parkway — a move council overwhelmingly supported at a Tuesday night study session. North Park also is where JP Morgan Chase intends to build a 150,000-square-foot, $220 million operations center. According to information submitted to Broomfield officials by the Butterfly Pavilion, CIRC intends to achieve “global change through innovative and integral programs that advance the knowledge and capacity of invertebrate research efforts while advancing invertebrate conservation work around the world.” Broomfield agreed to pay $75,000 to help pay for schematic plans and story-boards for a potential joint-use project that would benefit Broomfield, the pavilion and the Adams 12 Five Star School District, which would be part of a new Science and Technology Park at North Park. The pavilion would match that $75,000.

May 17, 2017, 3:09 pm EDT  |  By Josh Enomoto, InvestorPlace Contributor     View All   It’s hard to figure out exactly what’s going on with the broader economy. On one hand, the benchmark S&P 500 is up nearly 6% year-to-date, hitting another all-time high. On the other, bellwether stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) have barely moved since ringing in the new year — JPM is actually down 2% on the year after a rough Wednesday. But one sector that’s making waves literally and figuratively is boating stocks. Source: a.dombrowski via Flickr That news is a little hard to digest given the retail market volatility. Shares of luxury brand names like Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) or Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) have looked awful recently. And it’s common knowledge that boats are money pits. Nevertheless, the data is clear — the affluent are seeking the open waters, and boating stocks are looking to capitalize. According to the U.S. Federal Reserve, the industrial production index for boat building jumped 7.6% in the first quarter. This is the biggest such gain since 2014, when the index increased 8.7% in the first three months. The rise in sentiment brought the industry benchmark above its five-year trailing average. The rally among manufacturers also reversed a dangerously bearish trend. Since July of last year, the index skyrocketed nearly 19%. Boating stocks are also experiencing benefits in other areas of the supply chain. For example, employment trends in the sector appear to have stabilized following a decline throughout most of last year. The bearishness in boat dealership demand has also flat-lined in 2017. Whatever it is that President Trump is saying or doing, the affluent are responding positively. The 10 Best Stocks for a “Set It and Forget It” Summer Portfolio Admittedly, this highbrow market isn’t exactly an investment that rolls off most analysts’ tongues. But based on shifting sentiments, the vast oceans could represent the next big opportunity. Here are three boating stocks you haven’t thought about buying, but should!

Keywords: Wall Street, Dow Jones, DJIA, NYSE NEW YORK (CNNMoney) —  Stocks fell sharply Wednesday following reports of a memo from former FBI Director James Comey that says Trump asked him to stop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The Dow fell more than 325 points midday Wednesday — about a 1.5% decline. A key measure of market volatility also spiked. It’s a fairly big selloff but nowhere close to some of the bigger market drops that stocks experienced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. It also comes just two days after both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs. Corporate earnings have been strong. Consumers remain confident as well. The Dow is still up about 5% so far in 2017 while the S&P 500 is up 6%. And the Nasdaq has soared 12% — largely due to strong earnings from five tech giants in the index that just so happen to be the most valuable companies in America — Apple, Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Still, there are some indications of investor unease about the situation in Washington. Banks were among the biggest losers Wednesday. Shares of JPMorgan Chase fell 4%. Goldman Sachs was down 5%. And Morgan Stanley and Bank of America each nosedived more than 6%. Investors had been betting that Trump would cut back on regulations against Wall Street firms put into place by President Obama. Those hopes may now be fading. CNNMoney’s Fear and Greed Index, which looks at seven gauges of market sentiment, slipped to Neutral mode Wednesday. It had been showing signs of Greed previously. The VIX, a measure of market volatility that is one of the components of the Fear & Greed Index, spiked nearly 30% Wednesday. The “I word” that is in the market lexicon — inflation — is now being replaced by whispers of impeachment. “With a growing chorus of Democrats accusing Trump of obstructing justice and even calling for his impeachment, the Trump administration could come to an early season finale,” wrote Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst with currency broker FXTM. Gold prices have popped over the past week too. The yellow metal often does well when investors are nervous. It’s a classic flight to safety bet. The US dollar has also sank recently against the euro and other currencies. And virtual currency Bitcoin has soared. The market seems to be betting that, at a bare minimum, Trump’s economic plans — tax reform, undoing Obama-era regulations on banks and healthcare and stimulus though a big boost to infrastructure spending — are dead in the water for some time, “Trump’s agenda already had stalled; now there’s the likelihood that issues like tax reform will get crowded out by this political crisis,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief global strategist with Horizon Investments, in a report. Valliere thinks that talk of impeachment is still premature, but that “this a political earthquake, and the aftershocks will persist for the rest of Trump’s presidency.” Focus on that last part of the quote. “The rest of Trump’s presidency.” One reason that the markets may not be panicking about the latest crisis du jour in Washington is because they may be already anticipating the possibility that Trump will not serve a full term in the White House. And even if Trump were to quit, be impeached or be removed from office via the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, Vice President Mike Pence might be able to have a better chance of getting some of Trump’s proposals through Congress. “People are still looking ahead to the hopes of tax reform as opposed to whatever the new scandal of the moment on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave is,” said John Norris, managing director with Oakworth Capital Bank. “And even if there is impeachment, some would argue that you have a smoother political operator with Pence,” Norris added. Investors just have to sit and wait to see how the Trump soap opera unfolds. For now, the market still doesn’t see a need to freak out. “The question is whether these are US political rain showers like the ones drenching London’s commuters, or real storms with lasting damage. Only time will tell,” said Kit Juckes, global strategist at Societe Generale.

"Is it delayed or is it dead?"Bank stocks, which outperformed in the post-election rally, were the worst hit. The S&P 500 financial sector sank 2.5 percent, led by losses in Bank of America and JPMorgan. Goldman Sachs was the biggest drag among the 25 decliners on the Dow.Both the Dow and the S&P 500 fell below their 50-day moving average for first time since late April. The S&P began the session by opening 0.74 percent lower, the largest gap down since March 30, 2009, when the index suffered a 0.84 percent drop at the start of trading.At 12:07 p.m. ET (1607 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 260.91 points, or 1.24 percent, at 20,718.84, the S&P 500 was down 26.85 points, or 1.12 percent, at6 percent, at 2,373.82 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 99.13 points, or 1.61 percent, at 6,070.74.The dollar index sank on Wednesday, erasing all of the gains since Trump's election victory in November. The VIX, Wall Street's "fear gauge", shot up to 13.72, its highest level in nearly one month."We're largely through the earnings season, so political uncertainty is probably going to be the largest source of risk in the next three to six months." Bryan said.Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. Utilities and real estate sectors - preferred investment options in times of uncertainty due to their slow but predictable growth - were higher.Target was up 2.8 percent at $56.06 after the big-box retailer reported a smaller-than-expected drop in comparable sales.AbbVie slipped 2.4 percent to $65.25 after Coherus BioSciences received a favorable patent ruling against AbbVie's Humira drug. Coherus shares rose nearly 7 percent to $23.55.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,224 to 665. On the Nasdaq, 2,313 issues fell and 474 advanced.The S&P 500 index showed six new 52-week highs and 17 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 66 new lows.

Morgan slash more than 100 points from Dow as market sells off By Mark DeCambre Published: May 17, 2017 2:55 p.m. ET Share By MarkDeCambre A steep fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday was being driven primarily by share declines in Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase. The pair of financial firms' combined loss on the day was cutting more than 100 points from the blue-chip gauge. Financials were suffering the worst hit in Wednesday's broad-market downturn. The sector--on promises of deregualation and tax cuts--had been among the best performers following the surprise election of President Donald Trump back in November. Trump's recent woes, including reports that he allegedly asked the then-director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, to halt an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, was weighing on investor sentiment. Comey was fired last week amid an investigation Trump officials', including Flynn's, ties to Russia during the presidential campaign. The Dow was on track for its worst one-day decline since Sept. 9, while the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -2.57% also were on pace for their steepest daily slide since around September. Dow components, Goldman's stock was down 5.3%, contributing more than 80 points to the Dow's tumble, while J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s share JPM, -3.81% decline was cutting more than 20 points from the equity benchmark.

The first of those Weston expects will be ready for release in late 2018, with two to follow in 2019. Weston left his position as New Regency president and CEO to form the new venture, and he has named former Regency production president Pam Abdy to head his executive team. They will be staffing up in film, TV and digital. Related Shocker! Brad Weston Stepping Down As New Regency President & CEO Entertainment One is the company’s lead backer, and it will handle theatrical distribution in Canada, the UK, Australia/New Zealand, Benelux and Spain, as well as handle international distribution of TV content, which will be a major component of the new company. Makeready The company is named for the media term that signifies the process of getting ready to go to press. It took Weston less than 12 months to get to this place, with several twists and turns along the way. The venture has a production facility from JPMorgan Chase. That, and the eOne and Universal relationships that will allow Makeready to buy and develop what it wants and supply deficit financing for its projects. Weston said earlier stops in his career, especially production president at Paramount Pictures under recently deceased former chairman Brad Grey, and president/CEO of New Regency under Arnon Milchan, positioned him to construct a company that has been his dream and might be the envy of plenty of his peers because of the autonomy he has. Especially helpful were the years that Weston spent at Regency: tasked with restoring Milchan’s company as the filmmaker-driven maker of important pictures as it was when Regency made such films as JFK, Heat and L.A. Confidential, Weston oversaw a three-year run that included two Best Picture winners in 12 Years A Slave and Birdman, and very nearly winning a third with The Revenant. Other films there included Gone Girl, and The Big Short. There were a total of 34 Oscar nominations and 12 wins. Weston leaned in heavily on filmmaker relationships including David Fincher and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, something he hopes to do with the new venture that will be headquartered in Culver City. “Piecing together the company has been more challenging than I imagined, but the things I learned from Arnon prepared me for this and the successes really paid off in my conversations with Donna Langley in establishing Universal as our bedrock relationship along with eOne,” Weston said. “It clearly defined who we are and the kind of things we will make as a point of entry. The content creation game is changing dramatically, and we want to make a mark in the branded content space and the new ecosystem that exists in TV and film. The bandwidth is endless right now and the lines between film and TV are blurring. We are going to do what we’ve done before, working with great filmmakers and showrunners to make distinctive, bold TV and film that cuts through and stands out in the marketplace. Then we’ll decide where the content should go. We will be asking them to join a new venture, but Pam and I have done this a long time and we hope the people we’ve made films with before will take a chance with us now.” Weston also cited Grey as an important figure in taking an entrepreneurial leap here. “Brad was a transformative figure in my life and career, and my love and prayers are with Cassandra and the kids,” Weston said. “He impacted a lot of our lives in a great way and every one of his friends are devastated by his death.” Weston said Makeready has several movies in nascent stages. On the TV side, there are several projects including Saigon, a TV series from Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Davisson’s Appian Way and writer David James Kelly. Kelly worked with Appian on Robin Hood and Weston renews the Appian Way relationship from The Revenant. Abdy acquired the bestselling novel They Can’t Kill Us All, about the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement, which will be developed as a limited series. Makeready also has Arash Amel attached to write a series adaptation of the BOOM! graphic novel Old City Blues, with Chloe Grace Moretz exec producing. Before Regency, Abdy was president of Scott Stuber’s Bluegrass banner where she produced Identity Thief and Endless Love and before that she was exec veep at Paramount and produced Garden State. She and Weston have worked 13 years together. “Brad’s filmmaker-driven approach and proven track record for delivering both prestigious and commercial films make him a perfect fit for the studio, and we look forward to a long and successful relationship,” Universal’s Langley said in a statement. Said eOne CEO Darren Throop: “We are thrilled to support Brad on the launch of his new company. We have always been impressed by his incredible track record of delivering compelling content that is as commercially successful as it is award-worthy, and we are excited to be able to deliver that content to audiences around the world.” The merchant bank Evolution Media orchestrated the deal and Weston was repped by Latham & Watkins, eOne by Mayer Brown and in-house counsel.

Perhaps. Stocks fell sharply Wednesday following reports of a memo from former FBI Director James Comey that says Trump asked him to stop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The Dow fell more than 325 points midday Wednesday — about a 1.5% decline. A key measure of market volatility also spiked. It’s a fairly big selloff but nowhere close to some of the bigger market drops that stocks experienced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. It also comes just two days after both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs. Corporate earnings have been strong. Consumers remain confident as well. The Dow is still up about 5% so far in 2017 while the S&P 500 is up 6%. And the Nasdaq has soared 12% — largely due to strong earnings from five tech giants in the index that just so happen to be the most valuable companies in America — Apple, Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Still, there are some indications of investor unease about the situation in Washington. Banks were among the biggest losers Wednesday. Shares of JPMorgan Chase fell 4%. Goldman Sachs was down 5%. And Morgan Stanley and Bank of America each nosedived more than 6%. Investors had been betting that Trump would cut back on regulations against Wall Street firms put into place by President Obama. Those hopes may now be fading. CNNMoney’s Fear and Greed Index, which looks at seven gauges of market sentiment, slipped to Neutral mode Wednesday. It had been showing signs of Greed previously. The VIX, a measure of market volatility that is one of the components of the Fear & Greed Index, spiked nearly 30% Wednesday. The “I word” that is in the market lexicon — inflation — is now being replaced by whispers of impeachment. “With a growing chorus of Democrats accusing Trump of obstructing justice and even calling for his impeachment, the Trump administration could come to an early season finale,” wrote Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst with currency broker FXTM. Gold prices have popped over the past week too. The yellow metal often does well when investors are nervous. It’s a classic flight to safety bet. The US dollar has also sank recently against the euro and other currencies. And virtual currency Bitcoin has soared. The market seems to be betting that, at a bare minimum, Trump’s economic plans — tax reform, undoing Obama-era regulations on banks and healthcare and stimulus though a big boost to infrastructure spending — are dead in the water for some time, “Trump’s agenda already had stalled; now there’s the likelihood that issues like tax reform will get crowded out by this political crisis,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief global strategist with Horizon Investments, in a report. Valliere thinks that talk of impeachment is still premature, but that “this a political earthquake, and the aftershocks will persist for the rest of Trump’s presidency.” Focus on that last part of the quote. “The rest of Trump’s presidency.” One reason that the markets may not be panicking about the latest crisis du jour in Washington is because they may be already anticipating the possibility that Trump will not serve a full term in the White House. And even if Trump were to quit, be impeached or be removed from office via the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, Vice President Mike Pence might be able to have a better chance of getting some of Trump’s proposals through Congress. “People are still looking ahead to the hopes of tax reform as opposed to whatever the new scandal of the moment on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave is,” said John Norris, managing director with Oakworth Capital Bank. “And even if there is impeachment, some would argue that you have a smoother political operator with Pence,” Norris added. Investors just have to sit and wait to see how the Trump soap opera unfolds. For now, the market still doesn’t see a need to freak out. “The question is whether these are US political rain showers like the ones drenching London’s commuters, or real storms with lasting damage. Only time will tell,” said Kit Juckes, global strategist at Societe Generale. But if the chaos in Washington intensifies and puts the chances of any meaningful laws being passed that could help boost the economy in jeopardy — even if Pence were to soon become the 46th president — then Wall Street might finally begin to worry.

By SueChang Markets reporter SaraSjolin Markets reporter The Nasdaq on Wednesday saw its worst one-day decline since the day after U.K.’s vote to exit from the European Union rattled markets, as turmoil in Washington cast doubt on President Donald Trump’s pro-growth agenda that had helped to drive stocks to records. Tuesday’s selloff in the technology-laden benchmark, which has represented enthusiasm for assets perceived as risky, highlighted a broad market unraveling across much of the globe. The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.82%  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.78%  had their worst sessions since Sept. 9. Political uncertainty sent the S&P 500 index down 43.64 points, or 1.8%, to 2,357.03. Financials, which had been among the biggest beneficiaries of Trump’s market-friendly agenda, were the biggest losers, down more than 3%. The Dow sank 372.82 points, or 1.8%, to finish at 20,606.93. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -5.27%  tanked 5.3% and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -3.81% skidded 3.8%. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -2.57% which closed at a record for a second session in a row on Tuesday, coughed up 158.63 points, or 2.6%, to end at 6,011.24. Small-capitalization stocks also suffered withering losses, with the Russell 2000 index RUT, -2.78%  falling 2.8% to 1,355.89, marking its worst single-session drop since Sept. 9 and its lowest closing level since April 13. Wall Street witnessed a “typical” flight to safety spurred on by fear, said Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities. “On a fundamental level investors are constantly assessing the likelihood of tax reform and regulatory reform into the multiple they put on the market. Whenever more questions arise on timing of these policies, the market tends to sell off because we add risk,” he said. Also read: Bernanke: Always ‘puzzled’ by way markets ignore political risk until ‘last moment’ The CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +46.38% which measures implied volatility on the S&P 500 30 days in the future, spiked 46% to 15.59, its biggest daily climb since after Brexit, or Britain’s vote to exit from the EU, in June. “Investors are more nervous today than they were yesterday so you are seeing a big bid in the bond market. So funds are reducing equities slightly today and moving into safety,” Winer said. Uneasiness for global equities came after the New York Times reported that Trump in February asked then-director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, to stop his investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The report also prompted some House Republicans to call for a further investigation and for the FBI to hand over documents related to communications between the president and Comey, whom Trump fired earlier this month.

Baird & Co. Read: How to tell if the tide has finally turned on this Trump rally Perceived haven assets rose, with gold GCM7, -0.24%  settling 1.8% higher at $1,258.70 an ounce. Demand for U.S. government bonds pushed the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 2.22%, its lowest yield in about three weeks. “This isn’t about who is right or wrong; it is about a concern that a number of things could derail the future of economic growth that were not present a month ago. Whether it is oil prices, slowing inflationary growth, or a fear of ‘nothing done’ in Washington, investors are beginning to make some portfolio adjustments,” Kevin Giddis, head of fixed-income capital markets, said in a research note. Giddis expects investors to sell stocks and move to bonds for now although the shift isn’t likely to be significant unless there is further destabilizing news out of the nation’s capital. The Japanese yen USDJPY, +0.44% another asset investors typically turn to in times of stress, rose against the dollar, with the greenback buying ¥111.01, compared with ¥113.12 late Tuesday. The dollar also slumped against other major rivals. The ICE Dollar Index DXY, +0.33% which earlier fell to its lowest level since before the U.S. presidential election in November regained some ground to trade at 97.51. It hit an intraday low of 97.55. The probability of a Trump impeachment has gone up after the recent events, analysts noted, with bookmaker Paddy Power’s odds reflecting a 33% chance it could happen. An impeachment requires the backing of two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate. Read: Trump impeachment?

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz May 17, 2017: 5:49 PM ET Tipping point for Trump presidency? Is Wall Street finally getting ready to throw in the towel on President Trump? Perhaps. Stocks fell sharply Wednesday following reports of a memo from former FBI Director James Comey that says Trump asked him to stop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The Dow ended 373 points lower Wednesday -- about a 1.8% decline. It's the biggest drop since September. A key measure of market volatility also spiked. The common "I word" in the market lexicon -- inflation -- is now being replaced by whispers of impeachment. "With a growing chorus of Democrats accusing Trump of obstructing justice and even calling for his impeachment, the Trump administration could come to an early season finale," wrote Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst with currency broker FXTM. Gold prices have popped over the past week too. The yellow metal often does well when investors are nervous. It's a classic flight to safety bet. The US dollar has also sunk recently against the euro and other currencies. And virtual currency Bitcoin has soared. Related: The super wealthy aren't selling stocks because of Trump Investors had been betting that Trump would cut back on regulations against Wall Street firms put into place by President Obama. Those hopes may now be fading. CNNMoney's Fear and Greed Index, which looks at seven gauges of market sentiment, slipped to Neutral mode Wednesday. It had been showing signs of Greed previously. The VIX (VIX), a measure of market volatility that is one of the components of the Fear & Greed Index, spiked nearly 40% Wednesday. It's a fairly big selloff, but nowhere close to some of the bigger market drops that stocks experienced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. It also comes just two days after both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs. Corporate earnings have been strong. Consumers remain confident as well. The Dow is still up about 4% so far in 2017 while the S&P 500 is up 5%. And the Nasdaq has soared 12% -- largely due to strong earnings from five tech giants in the index that just so happen to be the most valuable companies in America -- Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30). Still, there are some indications of investor unease about the situation in Washington. Banks were among the biggest losers Wednesday. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) fell 4%. Goldman Sachs (GS) was down 5%. And Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) each nosedived close to 6%. Related: Dollar slumps as Trump's latest crisis spooks investors The market seems to be betting that, at a bare minimum, Trump's economic plans -- tax reform, undoing Obama-era regulations on banks and healthcare and stimulus though a big boost to infrastructure spending -- are dead in the water for some time, "Trump's agenda already had stalled; now there's the likelihood that issues like tax reform will get crowded out by this political crisis," wrote Greg Valliere, chief global strategist with Horizon Investments, in a report. Valliere thinks that talk of impeachment is still premature, but that "this a political earthquake, and the aftershocks will persist for the rest of Trump's presidency." Focus on that last part of the quote. "The rest of Trump's presidency." Conservative media in denial over Comey news? One reason that the markets may not be in full blown panic mode about the latest crisis du jour in Washington is because they may be already anticipating the possibility that Trump will not serve a full term in the White House. And even if Trump were to quit, be impeached or be removed from office via the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, Vice President Mike Pence might be able to have a better chance of getting some of Trump's proposals through Congress. "People are still looking ahead to the hopes of tax reform as opposed to whatever the new scandal of the moment on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave is," said John Norris, managing director with Oakworth Capital Bank. "And even if there is impeachment, some would argue that you have a smoother political operator with Pence," Norris added. Related: Wall Street Journal urges Trump to stop the 'pointless melodrama' Investors just have to sit and wait to see how the Trump soap opera unfolds. For now, the market still doesn't see a need to freak out. "The question is whether these are US political rain showers like the ones drenching London's commuters, or real storms with lasting damage. Only time will tell," said Kit Juckes, global strategist at Societe Generale. But if the chaos in Washington intensifies and puts the chances of any meaningful laws being passed that could help boost the economy in jeopardy -- even if Pence were to soon become the 46th president -- then Wall Street might finally begin to worry.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 17, 2017 1:39pm   Comments Share: Whether it was political scandal an overzealous fed, another European blowup or a North Korean missile, a real pullback was inevitable. US markets haven’t seen a real drop in over a year since those pesky Brits decided to vote out of the EU. Rather than jumping full burlap into the bear camp, take a moment to remember that even the healthiest of bull markets have corrections and more often than not those corrections offer opportunity for those who are prepared. Rather than a supply list for end of times, consider a shopping list to pick up stock bargains. The following are a few of my favorites. JP Morgan JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is one of the strongest financial stocks both technically and fundamentally. Valuation gurus will argue that one may find better intrinsic value from something like Citigroup trading around .8x book however I prefer to own a company who is growing top and bottom line. Hitting 2018 projections, JPM is estimated to grow EPS by 13 percent and the stock is currently trading around 11x 2018 estimates. In the event this political scandal doesn’t result in the fall of mankind, odds favor the banking system continuing to improve their revenue with an improving economy. Should this stock get hit from these levels back towards the low 80’s or even mid 70’s, it would be a great buying opportunity and one I would definitely take advantage of myself. In fact, as long as JPM remains above the mid-50’s, the nearly 20-year breakout remains in tact. Which of course brings me to the technical setup below. As you can see this stock is just now breaking out of a multi-decade…DECADE…lateral trend. Any pullback after this break is not only healthy but an opportunity. Goldman Sachs Much like JPM, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) is a financial institution seeing strong growth and not yet pricing in any major shift in the economy. Analysts estimate in 2018 GS will earn almost $21 per share. Up from 18.87 should they hit 2017 remaining estimates, this represents over 11 percent growth, while trading right around this 11x 2018 numbers. GS has already begun to pullback from a high of 255, down a quick $30.00 after a rare earnings miss last quarter. Should the shares get hit any further on general market weakness the stock is a buy for a return to new highs. From a technical perspective, much like JPM, we’re seeing a multi-year breakout that should not go quietly into the night. The stock has already used the trend line as a pivot in the last few weeks and any return to this level is a buy. Cisco Shifting gears from the financial world we move over to stodgy tech. While all eyes have been focused on the big FANG, Chambers and crew have been quietly advancing to decade highs while continuing to pay a 3.4 percent dividend while investors wait. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) has been investing heavily in new business so EPS growth will slow significantly in 2018. I like to take more of a Buffet approach here as the company has increased book value from 2010 by 68 percent (7.83 / sh – 13.17/ sh) while the company stock remains in the same place it has been since the tech bubble burst. This cash cow is quietly increasing in intrinsic value while investors chase speculative growth. Any dip here is a buy in a forgotten tech that should be trading much higher in the coming years. Tesla I would be remiss not to mention a pure technical/speculative play that also may offer a dip buying opportunity. There is no arguing fundamentals here as there are none. Anyone investing in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is 100 percent purely speculating that Elon has what it takes to turn this cool auto maker into a full-blown energy conglomerate. While many will shun this stock because it simply does not make a profit, I have been in this game long enough to know there is more to stock appreciation than bottom line earnings ie Amazon. From a technical perspective this stock has only recently broken out of a 4-year consolidation pattern. What’s interesting about this is it is only the 2nd consolidation phase the stock has seen since its IPO back in 2010. Technicians will relay that this is not yet a late stage base but rather a prudent point of entry for a continued move higher. In fact, the longer the base the higher in space as famed technician Louise Yamada likes to say, which means that this chart breaking from $300 may be projecting a triple from here. Yup, that’s a crisp $1,000 per share. On a pullback to $300 this stock is a buy in my opinion and traders can use a stop at $200 to protect from a complete blowup. In full disclosure I own all stocks mentioned above so there is no question I’m talking my book here but rather than predict doom and gloom my hope is to keep you open minded with a shopping list for opportunistic buys when others are running for the hills.

By: Reuters | Published: May 17, 2017 10:58 PM The news comes on the heels of a tumultuous week at the White House when Trump unexpectedly fired Comey and then disclosed classified information to Russia’s foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation. (Reuters) US stocks braced for their worst day in at least two months as reports of a memo by former FBI chief James Comey suggested that President Donald Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation, setting off alarm bells on Wall Street. Trump had asked Comey to end a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s ties with Russia, the reports said. The news comes on the heels of a tumultuous week at the White House when Trump unexpectedly fired Comey and then disclosed classified information to Russia’s foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation. The latest developments cast a shadow over Trump’s proposed business-friendly policies such as tax cuts and simpler bank regulations, which have underpinned a record-setting rally on Wall Street. “I think the biggest issue right now is what does this mean for the plan that we thought we were on,” said Jeremy Bryan portfolio manager at Gradient Investments in Arden Hills, Minnesota. “Is it delayed or is it dead?” Bank stocks, which outperformed in the post-election rally, were the worst hit. The S&P 500 financial sector sank 2.5 percent, led by losses in Bank of America and JPMorgan. Goldman Sachs was the biggest drag among the 25 decliners on the Dow. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 fell below their 50-day moving average for first time since late April. The S&P began the session by opening 0.74 percent lower, the largest gap down since March 30, 2009, when the index suffered a 0.84 percent drop at the start of trading. Watch this also: At 12:07 p.m. ET (1607 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 260.91 points, or 1.24 percent, at 20,718.84, the S&P 500 was down 26.85 points, or 1.12 percent, at6 percent, at 2,373.82 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 99.13 points, or 1.61 percent, at 6,070.74. The dollar index sank on Wednesday, erasing all of the gains since Trump’s election victory in November. The VIX, Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up to 13.72, its highest level in nearly one month. “We’re largely through the earnings season, so political uncertainty is probably going to be the largest source of risk in the next three to six months.” Bryan said. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. Utilities and real estate sectors – preferred investment options in times of uncertainty due to their slow but predictable growth – were higher. Target was up 2.8 percent at $56.06 after the big-box retailer reported a smaller-than-expected drop in comparable sales. AbbVie slipped 2.4 percent to $65.25 after Coherus BioSciences received a favorable patent ruling against AbbVie’s Humira drug. Coherus shares rose nearly 7 percent to $23.55.

The steep drop Wednesday was the market's worst since September and ended an unusually long period of calm. Banks, which soared in the months since the election, slumped. Bank of America lost 5.9 per cent. Bonds, utilities and gold rose as traders shunned riskier assets. The dollar fell. The Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 43 points, or 1.8 per cent, to 2,357. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 372 points, or 1.8 per cent, to 20,606. The Nasdaq fell 158 points, or 2.6 per cent, to 6,011, a day after its latest record high. Small-company stocks, which would stand to benefit greatly from Trumps' proposed tax cuts, fell more than the rest of the market. ___ 11:45 a.m. Banks are leading U.S. stock indexes sharply lower in midday trading as bond yields fall, which will mean lower interest rates on loans. Investors fretted Wednesday that the latest turmoil in Washington could hinder President Donald Trump's pro-business agenda. Bank of America sank 4.5 per cent and JPMorgan Chase fell 2.7 per cent. Target jumped 2 per cent after posting surprisingly strong earnings for the first quarter. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slumped 26 points, or 1.1 per cent, to 2,373. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 252 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 20,727. The Nasdaq composite fell 100 points, or 1.6 per cent, to 6,070. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market. Those companies would stand to benefit even more than large ones from corporate tax cuts Trump is proposing. ___ 9:35 a.m. Stocks are opening lower on Wall Street as banks and industrial companies fall. Banks were sliding along with bond yields early Wednesday. Bank of America sank 2.7 per cent and Wells Fargo lost 2 per cent. Falling bond yields mean lower interest rates on loans and tighter profits for banks. Among industrial companies, United Rentals fell 3 per cent. Target jumped 3.6 per cent after posting surprisingly strong earnings for the first quarter. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slumped 16 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 2,383.

The S&amp;P began the session by opening 0.74 percent lower, the largest gap down since March 30, 2009, when the index suffered a 0.84 percent drop at the start of trading. At 12:07 p.m. ET (1607 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 260.91 points, or 1.24 percent, at 20,718.84, the S&amp;P 500 was down 26.85 points, or 1.12 percent, at6 percent, at 2,373.82 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 99.13 points, or 1.61 percent, at 6,070.74. The dollar index sank on Wednesday, erasing all of the gains since Trump's election victory in November. The VIX, Wall Street's "fear gauge", shot up to 13.72, its highest level in nearly one month. "We're largely through the earnings season, so political uncertainty is probably going to be the largest source of risk in the next three to six months." Bryan said. Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were lower. Utilities and real estate sectors - preferred investment options in times of uncertainty due to their slow but predictable growth - were higher. Target was up 2.8 percent at $56.06 after the big-box retailer reported a smaller-than-expected drop in comparable sales. AbbVie slipped 2.4 percent to $65.25 after Coherus BioSciences received a favorable patent ruling against AbbVie's Humira drug. Coherus shares rose nearly 7 percent to $23.55. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,224 to 665. On the Nasdaq, 2,313 issues fell and 474 advanced. The S&amp;P 500 index showed six new 52-week highs and 17 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 66 new lows.

The new venture plans to release two films annually, beginning next year through Universal, which is committed to handling worldwide theatrical marketing and distribution for the company’s feature films, with eOne handling theatrical distribution across Canada, the U.K., Australia/New Zealand, Benelux, and Spain. EOne, the lead investor in Makeready, will also handle international distribution of all TV content. JPMorgan Chase will lead the production facility for the new enterprise. Weston most recently served for five years as president and chief executive officer of New Regency, which he departed a year ago. He oversaw “The Revenant,” “Birdman,” “Gone Girl,” “12 Years a Slave,” and “The Big Short.” Prior to joining New Regency, Weston served as president of production for Paramount Pictures, overseeing “Star Trek,” “Cloverfield,” “The Fighter,” “Shutter Island,” “G.I. Joe,” and “Rango.” “I am lucky to have Universal and eOne as partners,” Weston said. “I have always admired everything my longtime friend Donna Langley has done. We share similar business philosophies and sensibilities. Combining our easy relationship with their brilliant marketing, Universal is a comfortable and natural fit. In eOne, I’ve found an ambitious global likeminded partner who shares my passion for great content. I believe that the confidence that Darren Throop and the eOne team have shown in me and Makeready will prove to be the foundation for a long and successful future together.” Veteran executive Pam Abdy will head Makeready’s executive team. The company is headquartered in Culver City, Calif. Makeready is developing “Saigon,” a TV series from Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Davisson’s Appian Way and writer David James Kelly. Abdy landed the recent New York Times bestselling novel “They Can’t Kill Us All,” which chronicles the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement and is being developed as a limited series. The company is also working on a series based on the Boom! graphic comic “Old City Blues” with screenwriter Arash Amel attached, and a show about teens and 20-year-olds, with Chloë Grace Moretz executive producing. Evolution Media, a merchant bank focused on the media and sports industries, orchestrated the deal. Weston is represented by Latham & Watkins, and eOne is repped by Mayer Brown and in-house counsel.

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Smart Beta Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → May → Bank ETFs can Rebound After Big Disappointments Bank ETFs can Rebound After Big Disappointments May 17, 2017 at 11:53 am by Tom Lydon Nearly five months into the year, investors by now know that the financial services sectors and the related exchange traded funds, such as the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLF), are big disappointments. For example, XLF, the largest exchange traded fund dedicated to the financial services sector, is up just 2.5% year-to-date. That after the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates in March with expectations for more rate hikes later this year. With a steepening yield curve or wider spread between short- and long-term Treasuries, banks could experience improved net interest margins or improved profitability as the firms borrow short and lend long. Although the Fed unveiled its first rate hike of 2017 last month, the central bank’s dovish tone punished regional bank stocks and ETFs. There are some positive signs emerging for XLF and other bank-related ETFs. Investors would do well to check out the charts on some XLF’s big-name holdings. “Failed bearish patterns often become bullish signals. We can see similar patterns in JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and U.S. Bancorp (USB). However, there are some big banks with patterns that already look bullish. Citigroup (C), for example, sports a trading range with rising bottoms. This is called a pennant or ascending triangle, and it usually resolves in the direction of the trend that preceded it. In this case, that would be to the upside,” reports Michael Kahn for Barron’s. The financial sector valuations still look relatively cheap, compared to the broader market. The sector’s valuations are still about 25% below the average since the early 1990s. Higher interest rates would help widen the difference between what banks charge on loans and pay on deposits, which would boost earnings for the financial sector. Regional banks are among the stocks most positively correlated to rising interest rates because higher rates improve net interest margins. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSEArca: KRE), the largest regional bank ETF, has been stymied this year by the surprisingly dovish Fed. “Banks as a group seem to be close to attractive buying areas, but not quite there yet. We can rationalize that the current weakness is due to dysfunction in Washington threatening the reasons why the markets rallied after the election,” according to Barron’s.

Share this article CHICAGO, May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Morningstar, Inc. (NASDAQ: MORN), a leading provider of independent investment research, today reported estimated U.S. mutual fund and exchange-traded fund (ETF) asset flows for April 2017. In April, investors put $17.1 billion into U.S. equity passive funds, down from $31.1 billion in March 2017. On the active side, investors pulled $16.8 billion out of U.S. equity funds, compared with $18.6 billion in the previous month. Morningstar estimates net flow for mutual funds by computing the change in assets not explained by the performance of the fund and net flow for ETFs by computing the change in shares outstanding. Highlights from Morningstar's report about U.S. asset flows in April: International equity garnered the highest total flows among equity category groups at $21.1 billion. However, taxable-bond funds continued to be the overall leader with inflows of $26.0 billion. Total flows were at their lowest so far in 2017, at $43.0 billion. The positive flows came from predominantly international equity and taxable bond, even as the Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising interest rates. The three Morningstar Categories in April with the highest inflows were foreign large blend, large blend, and intermediate-term bond. The foreign-large blend category, which is concentrated mostly in Europe, garnered $10.6 billion of inflows on the passive side and $1.5 billion of inflows on the active side. The muni-national short category saw the largest outflows in April of $2.9 billion, all on the active side. Among top U.S. fund families, PIMCO had active inflows of $2.3 billion, surpassing Vanguard, which saw $879 million of active outflows. Vanguard was the top fund family on the passive side, with inflows of $26.0 billion, followed closely by BlackRock/iShares with $24.9 billion in inflows. PIMCO Income, which has a Morningstar Analyst Rating™ of Silver, received the highest inflows of active funds in April of $2.7 billion.

(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) U.S. President Donald Trump steps from Air Force One in Groton, Conn, on May 17. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) S&P, Dow set for worst day in months on Trump turmoil Add to ... Reuters Published Wednesday, May 17, 2017 11:20AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, May 17, 2017 6:51PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print The S&P 500 and the Dow were headed for their worst day in more than eight months as reports of a leaked memo by former FBI chief James Comey spooked investors, raising questions about whether President Donald Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to end a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s ties with Russia, according to the reports. The news comes on the heels of a tumultuous week at the White House when Mr. Trump unexpectedly fired Mr. Comey and then disclosed classified information to Russia’s foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation. Explainer: Trump’s shared secrets with Russia: The fallout, and what we know so far The latest developments cast a shadow over Mr. Trump’s proposed business-friendly policies such as tax cuts and simpler bank regulations, which have underpinned a record-setting rally on Wall Street. “I think the biggest issue right now is what does this mean for the plan that we thought we were on,” said Jeremy Bryan portfolio manager at Gradient Investments in Arden Hills, Minn. “Is it delayed or is it dead?” Bank stocks, which outperformed in the post-election rally, were the worst hit. The S&P 500 financial sector tumbled more than 2 percent, led by losses in Bank of America and JPMorgan. Goldman Sachs was the biggest drag on the Dow. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 fell below their 50-day moving average for first time since late April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 234.47 points, or 1.12 per cent, at 20,745.28, the S&P 500 was down 24.18 points, or 1.01 per cent, at 2,376.49 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 83.65 points, or 1.36 per cent, at 6,086.22. Canada’s main stock index also fell on Wednesday, tracking global market concerns that Mr. Trump’s pro-business economic agenda could be slowed by political scandals, with financial stocks leading declines. At 11:13 a.m. ET, the TSX was down 170.9 points, or 1.10 per cent, to 15,372.44. Seven of the index’s top 10 sectors fell more than 1 per cent. The materials sector, which include mining stocks, was the lone gainer, adding 0.6 percent partly on the back of higher gold prices. Editor's picks: Wednesday's analyst upgrades and downgrades;   Wednesday's small-cap stocks to watch; What investors can learn from a Navy SEAL, a cheap bank stock, and how ETFs are taking over the TSX   The dollar index sank on Wednesday, erasing all of the gains inspired by Trump’s pro-growth stance after his November election victory. The euro hit its highest level since Nov. 7, while prices of gold hit a one-month high. The VIX, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” shot up to 12.8 points and was on track for its biggest one-day percentage increase since August. “We’re largely through the earnings season, so political uncertainty is probably going to be the largest source of risk in the next three to six months.” Bryan said. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. Utilities and real estate sectors - preferred investment options in times of uncertainty due to their slow but predictable growth - were the only gainers. The most influential movers on the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index were dominated by financial firms, which make up roughly a third of the index’s weight. The group slid 1.4 percent. Royal Bank of Canada shed 1.4 per cent to $91.745, while Toronto Dominion Bank lost 1.1 per cent to $62.41. Insurer Manulife Financial Corp dropped 3.0 per cent to $23.01. Bullion hit a two-week high as the Trump scandals and weak U.S. economic data trimmed expectations the Federal Reserve would aggressively raise interest rates this year, pushing the U.S. dollar to its weakest level in six months. A weak greenback makes the precious metal cheaper for non-U.S. investors. The bulk of the top 30 stocks that advanced were gold mining companies, with Barrick Gold Corp leading the charge. Barrick rose 2.2 per cent to $23.53, while Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd was up 2.1 per cent at $68.17. Gold futures rose 1.8 percent to $1,256.9 an ounce. Oil and gas stocks retreated 1.0 per cent despite higher crude oil prices. Enbridge Inc fell 2.2 per cent to $52.68. Oil prices strengthened on Wednesday ahead of U.S. crude inventory data that could give investors a clue as to whether an OPEC-led output cut is making progress in reducing a persistent global supply overhang. Brent crude was up 50 cents at $52.15 per barrel. U.S. light crude rose 39 cents to $49.05. Both benchmark prices started the day in negative territory after industry data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) estimated that U.S. crude stocks had risen by 882,000 barrels in the week ending May 12 to 523 million barrels. That defied expectations of analysts who estimated a draw in the stockpiles of 2.4 million barrels, according to a Reuters survey. Data from the Energy Information Agency, seen as more complete, is due at 1430 GMT on Wednesday. Brent reached $52.63 a barrel and WTI rose as high as $49.66 on Monday after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed on the need to extend output curbs by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers. The supply cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) were initially agreed to run during the first half of 2017. Riyadh and Moscow say they should be extended until March. An extension is due to be discussed at an OPEC meeting on May 25. “The oil rally has paused and whether it can resume depends on today’s EIA inventory report,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. “Having seen an initial short-covering rally, we now need OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreeing on the nine-month extension for the market to begin build up new long positions,” Saxo’s Hansen said. OPEC nations such as Kuwait, Iraq, Oman and Venezuela have said they supported an extension to the supply cuts, signaling that the meeting next week will go smoothly. Some analysts have said a deeper cut could even be on the table.

Trump asked Comey to end a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's ties with Russia, according to the reports. The news comes on the heels of a tumultuous week at the White House when Trump unexpectedly fired Comey and then disclosed classified information to Russia's foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation. The latest developments cast a shadow over Trump's proposed business-friendly policies such as tax cuts and simpler bank regulations, which have underpinned a record-setting rally on Wall Street. "I think the biggest issue right now is what does this mean for the plan that we thought we were on," said Jeremy Bryan portfolio manager at Gradient Investments in Arden Hills, Minnesota. "Is it delayed or is it dead?" Bank stocks, which outperformed in the post-election rally, were the worst hit. The S&amp;P 500 financial sector tumbled more than 2 percent, led by losses in Bank of America and JPMorgan. Goldman Sachs was the biggest drag on the Dow. Both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 fell below their 50-day moving average for first time since late April. At 10:46 a.m. ET (1446 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 234.47 points, or 1.12 percent, at 20,745.28, the S&amp;P 500 was down 24.18 points, or 1.01 percent, at 2,376.49 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 83.65 points, or 1.36 percent, at 6,086.22. The dollar index sank on Wednesday, erasing all of the gains inspired by Trump's pro-growth stance after his November election victory. The euro hit its highest level since Nov. 7, while prices of gold hit a one-month high. The VIX, Wall Street's "fear gauge", shot up to 12.8 points and was on track for its biggest one-day percentage increase since August. "We're largely through the earnings season, so political uncertainty is probably going to be the largest source of risk in the next three to six months." Bryan said. Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were lower. Utilities and real estate sectors - preferred investment options in times of uncertainty due to their slow but predictable growth - were the only gainers. Target was up 2.8 percent at $56.06 after the big-box retailer reported a smaller-than-expected drop in comparable sales. AbbVie slipped 2.4 percent to $65.25 after Coherus BioSciences received a favorable patent ruling against AbbVie's Humira drug. Coherus shares rose nearly 7 percent to $23.55. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,211 to 624. On the Nasdaq, 2,249 issues fell and 433 advanced. The S&amp;P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and 17 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 18 new highs and 52 new lows.

Former FBI chief James Comey said in a memo that Trump had asked him to end a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's ties with Russia, the reports said. That was only the latest worry in a tumultuous week at the White House after Trump unexpectedly fired Comey and reportedly disclosed classified information to Russia's foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation.

Trump asked Comey to end a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s ties with Russia, according to the reports. The latest development could distract Trump from pursuing his proposed policies such as tax cuts and simpler bank regulations, which have underpinned a record-setting rally on Wall Street. The news comes on the heels of a tumultuous week at the White House when Trump unexpectedly fired Comey and then disclosed classified information to Russia’s foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation. Bank stocks, which have outperformed in the post-election rally, were the worst hit. The S&P 500 financial sector dropped 1.67 per cent, led by losses in Bank of America and JPMorgan. Goldman Sachs was the biggest drag on the Dow. The dollar index sank today, erasing all of the gains inspired by Trump’s business-friendly stance after his November election victory. The euro hit its highest level since Nov. 7, while prices of gold hit a one-month high. The VIX, Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up to 12.8 points and was on track for its biggest one-day per centage increase since August. “Equity investors are beginning to display concerns over the domestic political situation that is not likely to suddenly vanish,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial wrote. “The equity markets have ignored the noise out of Washington. However, we think the situation is likely to change as this crisis leads to an interruption of the pro-growth White House agenda, deflating the Hope Rally.” At 9:52am ET (1352 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 185.86 points, or 0.89 per cent, at 20,793.89, the S&P 500 was down 20.52 points, or 0.86 per cent, at 2,380.15 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 61.63 points, or 1 per cent, at 6,108.24. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. Traditionally defensive sectors utilities, consumer staples and real estate were higher. Target was up 4.8 per cent at US$57.10 after the big-box retailer reported a smaller-than-expected drop in comparable sales. AbbVie slipped 2.4 per cent to US$65.25 after Coherus BioSciences received a favorable patent ruling against AbbVie’s Humira drug. Coherus shares rose nearly 7 per cent to US$23.55. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,213 to 529. On the Nasdaq, 2,126 issues fell and 379 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and 14 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 15 new highs and 44 new lows. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Soap to chocolate: We consume 7.7kg of palm oil each year Malaysia eyes sale of Proton as Dr M’s auto power dream dies Ringgit best-performing currency in Asia ex-Japan so far in Q2 Japan’s economy posts longest expansion in a decade Oil prices dip as supplies remain ample despite production cuts AirAsia, Everbright JV to establish LCC in China (VIDEO) Malaysia eyes sale of Proton as Dr M’s auto power dream dies Ibrahim International Business District to boost Johor Baru's competitiveness Malindo Air to take Batik Air name Fitch unit predicts ECRL, upgraded Kuantan port to boost East Coast economy Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Oscars chief Boone Isaacs steps down from governors board Reuters Video: Copenhagen sex workers' ambulance service Volvo’s autonomous garbage truck is here Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Impeachment — the ‘I’ word — and how it works Celebrity black sheriff David Clarke joins Trump administration Ex-FBI chief Mueller to head Trump-Russia probe (VIDEO) Embattled Trump says treated ‘unfairly’ (VIDEO) Israeli intel experts alarmed by Trump leak but play down any damage (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 200 points, shattering the calm that gripped markets in the past month as the crisis threatened to derail the policy agenda that helped push equities to records as recently as Monday.  The US dollar dropped a sixth day, while Treasury 10-year yields tumbled to 2.25 per cent. Emerging-market equities halted a seven-day rally. Crude rose after U.S. inventory data. "If he's preoccupied defending himself and if it goes a lot further, then any hope of his legislative agenda coming to the fore is going to be reduced," John Stopford, the London-based head of fixed-income at Investec Asset Management, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. "Clearly at the margin it's a negative. At the moment there's a classic environment for yields to rally a bit further and for the dollar to sell off."

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 9/9 By Sinead Carew The S&P 500 and the Dow notched their biggest one-day fall since Sept. 9 as investor hopes for tax cuts and other pro-business policies faded after reports that U.S. President Donald Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation set off alarm bells on Wall Street. Former FBI chief James Comey said in a memo that Trump had asked him to end a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's ties with Russia, the reports said. That was only the latest worry in a tumultuous week at the White House after Trump unexpectedly fired Comey and reportedly disclosed classified information to Russia's foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation. The developments intensified doubts that Trump would be able to follow through on his promises for tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal stimulus. Those pledges had helped fuel a record-setting post-election rally on Wall Street. Selling accelerated late in the afternoon of one of the busiest trading days in months and the three major indexes ended near session lows. "We've seen the Trump agenda derailed and try to get back on track several times. It's registering with more investors that its going to be hard to get back on track with the latest allegations," Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. "Prior to the election investors expected Trump to represent uncertainty," he said. "The market is now recognizing that some of the fears they had back in October are coming to fruition." Both the Dow and S&P 500 fell below their 50-day moving average for first time since late April. The S&P began the session 0.74 percent lower, the largest gap down since March 30, 2009, when it opened trading with a 0.84 percent drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 372.82 points, or 1.78 percent, to 20,606.93, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 43.64 points, or 1.82 percent, to 2,357.03 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 158.63 points, or 2.57 percent, to 6,011.24. The VIX .VIX, Wall Street's "fear gauge", shot up to 15.34, its highest level since April 18. Nasdaq had its steepest one-day loss since June 24, after Britain voted to exit the European Union, as did S&P's financial .SPSY and technology .SPLRCT sectors. The financial sector closed down 3 percent while the technology sector fell 2.8 percent. The S&P bank sub-sector .SPXBK dropped 4 percent, led by a 5.9 percent decline in Bank of America (BAC.N) shares and a 3.8 percent loss for JPMorgan (JPM.N). “The bull market is not over by any means, but between the political stuff and the fact that the next earnings season is three months away, there’s going to be a lack of motivation,” said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities in New York. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors fell with the only gain from utilities .SPLRCU and real estate .SPLRCR, defensive sectors with predictable if slow growth and high dividends. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.92-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 5.64-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 19 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 28 new highs and 93 new lows.

Trump asked Comey to end a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's ties with Russia, according to the reports. The latest development could distract Trump from pursuing his proposed policies such as tax cuts and simpler bank regulations, which have underpinned a record-setting rally on Wall Street. The news comes on the heels of a tumultuous week at the White House when Trump unexpectedly fired Comey and then disclosed classified information to Russia's foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation. Bank stocks, which have outperformed in the post-election rally, were the worst hit. The S&amp;P 500 financial sector dropped 1.67 percent, led by losses in Bank of America and JPMorgan. Goldman Sachs was the biggest drag on the Dow. The dollar index sank on Wednesday, erasing all of the gains inspired by Trump's business-friendly stance after his November election victory. The euro hit its highest level since Nov. 7, while prices of gold hit a one-month high. The VIX, Wall Street's "fear gauge", shot up to 12.8 points and was on track for its biggest one-day percentage increase since August. "Equity investors are beginning to display concerns over the domestic political situation that is not likely to suddenly vanish," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial wrote. "The equity markets have ignored the noise out of Washington. However, we think the situation is likely to change as this crisis leads to an interruption of the pro-growth White House agenda, deflating the Hope Rally." At 9:52 a.m. ET (1352 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 185.86 points, or 0.89 percent, at 20,793.89, the S&amp;P 500 was down 20.52 points, or 0.86 percent, at 2,380.15 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 61.63 points, or 1 percent, at 6,108.24. Eight of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were lower. Traditionally defensive sectors utilities, consumer staples and real estate were higher. Target was up 4.8 percent at $57.10 after the big-box retailer reported a smaller-than-expected drop in comparable sales. AbbVie slipped 2.4 percent to $65.25 after Coherus BioSciences received a favorable patent ruling against AbbVie's Humira drug. Coherus shares rose nearly 7 percent to $23.55. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,213 to 529. On the Nasdaq, 2,126 issues fell and 379 advanced. The S&amp;P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and 14 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 15 new highs and 44 new lows.

(NYSE: JELD) recently filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its secondary offering. The firm intends to offer 14.0 million shares, with an overallotment option for an additional 2.1 million shares. At the most recent closing price $31.69, the entire offering is valued up to $510.21 million. Keep in mind this company only came public back in late January of this year, and it currently has a market cap of $3.33 billion. The underwriters for this offering are Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan. This is one of the world’s largest door and window manufacturers, and it holds the number one position by net revenues in the majority of the countries and markets that it serves. The company designs, produces and distributes an extensive range of interior and exterior doors; wood, vinyl and aluminum windows; and related products for use in the new construction and repair and remodeling of residential homes and, to a lesser extent, nonresidential buildings. Jeld-Wen attributes its market leadership to well-established brands, broad product offering, world-class manufacturing and distribution capabilities and long-standing customer relationships. The overall goal is to achieve best-in-industry financial performance through the rigorous execution of its strategies to reduce costs and improve quality through the implementation of operational excellence programs, to drive profitable organic growth, to pursue strategic acquisitions and to develop top talent. In the filing the company detailed its finances as follows: In the twelve-month period ended April 1, 2017, our net revenues were $3.7 billion, our net income was $372.0 million, and our Adjusted EBITDA was $413.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA has increased by $260.3 million, or 169.9%, and net income has increased by $440.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the twelve-month period ended April 1, 2017. The company will not receive any proceeds from the offering; instead the selling stockholders will receive all the proceeds. Shares of Jeld-Wen closed Tuesday at $31.69, with a consensus analyst price target of $35.18 and a post-IPO trading range of $24.95 to $34.40.

Henderson Land to release Kowloon flats starting from just 161 square feet 9 Sep 2016 Hong Kong & China Billionaire Lee Shau-kee expects Hong Kong home prices to fall further, urges buyers to take advantage of discounts 2 Jun 2016 Henderson Land Development, owned by one of Hong Kong’s wealthiest families, may have done a favour to every land owner in the Murray Road neighbourhood in downtown Central, when it paid a record price for the largest commercial plot to go on market in two decades. The record HK$23.28 billion (US$3 billion) price paid for the Murray Road land parcel, which topped professional valuers’ highest estimate by almost 6 per cent, would boost Cheung Kong Property Holdings’ net asset value per share by HK$5, according to an analysis by JPMorgan. Cheung Kong, owned by the city’s wealthiest businessman Li Ka-shing, owns Hutchison House, a 22-storey office tower across the Lambeth Walk from Murray Road. Besides Hutchison House, another building in the vicinity is the CCB Tower, developed by a consortium between China Construction Bank and Lai Sun Development. Henderson on Tuesday beat back eight rival developers, including a couple of Chinese real estate companies, to buy Murray Road. It plans to develop the site, where a five-storey public car park currently stands, into a “landmark” office tower by 2022, according to a statement by vice-chairman Martin Lee Ka-shing. Henderson said its total investment, inclusive of the land cost, may exceed HK$26 billion, or HK$55,914 per square foot. The projected investment would be closer to HK$30 billion, according to a projection by Bank of America Merril Lynch, assuming HK$7,000 per sq ft of construction cost. With a spot rent of HK$140 per sq ft per month, Henderson could get a net rental margin of 2 per cent BoA-ML said. “Investors’ reaction to Henderson’s win will be lukewarm,” the bank said. Investors agreed, sending Henderson’s shares falling by as much as 2.9 per cent, their biggest intraday decline in seven months, after the tender result was announced. The stock closed the day 1.5 per cent lower at HK$49.45. Cheung Kong’s shares rose 1.2 per cent to HK$57.45. Henderson will have to hope that Hong Kong’s property prices, which already make the city the world’s most expensive urban centre to live and work in, will continue rising. April office rents in Central have risen almost 1 per cent compared with March, and are expected to rise further after Murray Road’s record price, JLL said. “We expect Murray Road to be developed to suit the price tag within the premium end of the market where there is currently strong pent-up demand,” said Alex Barnes, head of markets at JLL. “The fact that it could be available to the wider occupier market is a positive for Central.” Based on that projection, a 10,000 sq ft (929 square meters) office would cost HK$1.4 million (US$180,000) per month to rent, or HK$70 million to own. Mainland Chinese companies, which already occupy an estimated 56 per cent of all new commercial office leases in April, are the most likely tenants that can afford these rents, and will continue to underpin leasing activity in Central, JLL said. “The sale of Murray Road shows the strong demand for Grade A offices in the Central and Admiralty areas,” said the Secretary of Development Eric Ma Siu-cheung. “Despite having a total sale of half a million square meters of gross floor area of commercial and industrial land, the market still has a strong demand for commercial sites.” SCMP Today: HK Edition Get updates direct to your inbox E-mail * By registering you agree to our T&Cs & Privacy Policy Thank youYou are on the list.

By: Reuters | Published: May 17, 2017 5:24 PM European shares fell on Wednesday amid a global pullback in stock markets as worries about political turmoil in the United States led investors to seek safety after a strong run sent regional benchmarks to record highs. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.3 percent, as major regional benchmarks tracked a global dip in stocks and the dollar as concerns over U.S. President Trump multiplied. Euro zone blue chips and the bloc’s broader index of stocks both dropped 0.6 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 on the other hand hovered close to its record high hit on Tuesday, outperforming European peers as gains among miners supported it. Despite their falls on Wednesday, European benchmarks remain near recent highs, having risen sharply as investors pile in to the region on the back of an economic recovery, robust company earnings and voters’ rejection of populist parties in elections. “Markets broke upwards with the disappearance of concerns around the French election. Quite a lot of fast money came in and markets are just pausing now to digest that,” said Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equities at JP Morgan Asset Management. Ubisoft Entertainment, the third-biggest global entertainment company, fell 6 percent after it cut its mid-term sales forecast, reporting results near the bottom end of its target range after the close on Tuesday. Raiffeisen Bank was a bright spot on a negative banking sector, up 3.5 percent after its first-quarter profit jumped more than expected as write-downs shrank. Lloyds Bank gained 1.9 percent after the British government sold its last remaining shares in the bank, marking the end of an era after one of the largest financial crisis bailouts. You may like to watch: But the Netherlands’ largest domestic lender ABN Amro fell 3.2 percent after its results, with traders citing a lower net interest margin and capital ratio, though the headline net income beat expectations at 615 million euros. Thyssenkrupp was the top European gainer, up 4 percent after Tata Steel agreed the terms of a deal to cut benefits for its British pension scheme, removing a major obstacle to the potential merger of its steel assets with the German steel maker. Thyssenkrupp’s labour boss said the pensions deal does not lessen workers’ opposition to a possible merger, however. Gold miner Fresnillo rose 2.8 percent as the price of the safe-haven asset rose to a two week high. Tullow Oil gained 2 percent after JP Morgan reiterated its ‘overweight’ rating on the stock, saying the oil company had improved its funding position, and valuation had returned to more compelling territory. Norwegian fertilizer maker Yara got a boost from broker Liberum raising it to ‘buy’ from ‘sell’, saying prices of urea, a key ingredient in fertilizers, are close to a trough with fewer capacity additions ahead. Trading in Oslo was closed for the day, however, and the market will reopen on Thursday. European earnings continued to paint a bright picture for the region’s equities, with earnings growth for the quarter seen at 19 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. No Comments.

How long can that last? Posted: Wednesday, May 17, 2017 6:36 AM EDT Updated: Wednesday, May 17, 2017 10:08 AM EDT The United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union. Results show the Leave campaign has won with more than 51% of the vote. Britain's stunning vote to leave the European Union is both historic and world-changing. But what does it really mean for folks living on the other side of the Atlantic? Potentially, everything -- the economy, national security, even the race for... This map shows the breakdown by region of the UK referendum. British Prime Minister David Cameron has announced his resignation after voters in the UK's referendum backed a "Brexit" from the EU. The UK is leaving the European Union after the Brexit vote. By Ivana Kottasová LONDON (CNNMoney) -- The trickle of jobs leaving Brexit Britain has yet to turn into a flood. Several big financial services firms have announced they will move about 9,000 jobs out of the country in order to safeguard their business once the U.K. leaves the European Union. That is not yet showing up in employment data. The jobless rate was just 4.6% in the three months to March 31, according to data published Wednesday. But experts say there could be a much larger exodus of jobs to come, and the scale will depend on the future ties between the U.K. and the EU, its biggest trade partner. Weaker economic growth will hurt employment too. "We retain the view that jobs growth will slow over the coming months and unemployment will start creeping up later on in 2017," said Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Markit. Prime Minister Theresa May wants a clean break from the EU. If she is reelected in June, she plans to take the U.K. out of Europe's unified market, which allows the free flow of goods and workers across borders. If May doesn't manage to negotiate a deal giving British firms full access to European customers, companies might have to shift operations to an EU member state. Tariffs and other barriers to trade may prompt others to shed jobs. Banks go first Banks are a good example of the problem. Under EU rules, they can operate freely across the bloc as long as they are based in one of the member states. Once the U.K. leaves the EU, British banks will likely lose these rights. Consulting firm EY monitors 222 U.K. financial services firms. More than a quarter of them have announced that they are moving some staff or part of their operations out of the country, EY said. Germany's Deutsche Bank is preparing to move up to 4,000 jobs from the U.K. Swiss bank UBS will probably have to move about 1,000 positions abroad. HSBC, Britain's biggest bank, is planning to move 1,000 workers to its Paris office. Hundreds of jobs at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are also likely to go, and Credit Suisse is currently considering alternative locations for some of its staff. A few banks, such as Barclays, say they should be able to cope without moving staff. Others may follow But the risk to jobs posed by Brexit goes way beyond banking, insurance and related services. If U.K. crashes out of the EU without a trade deal, its exporters will be hit by tariffs. They may have to relocate some of their production to Europe. Carmakers that support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Britain are particularly vulnerable. They rely heavily on parts imported from the EU to manufacture cars in the U.K., only to ship them back to the EU. In October, Japan's Nissan said it had been convinced to invest in its massive production facility in Sunderland after getting reassurances from the government about Brexit. That was before May announced her plans in detail. Since then, Nissan has refused to confirm that the factory -- and its 7,000 jobs -- are safe, saying it may have to adjust its business depending on how Brexit pans out. There are also many British companies at the other end of the supply chain, producing parts for companies within Europe. They are likely to be hit too. A survey this week by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed nearly half of European businesses expect to buy less from U.K. suppliers. Airbus faces just such a supply chain challenge. The company spends around $5 billion a year with suppliers in the U.K., supporting tens of thousands of skilled jobs. The company is lobbying the U.K. and governments in Europe to limit the introduction of new trade barriers. Several hundred British jobs will also go when two EU agencies currently based in London -- the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency -- relocate. European officials have made it clear the institutions must be based within an EU country -- and several member states are already lobbying to host them. Falling wages, slower growth While unemployment is currently very low, the country has been struggling with low wage growth since the global financial crisis. Wednesday's data showed wages fell in the three months to March, after taking inflation into account. They also fell in the three months to February. "The worry today is less about jobs and more about pay, with spending power shrinking once again as inflation has surged," said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte. Slower economic growth won't help the labor market, either. The Bank of England expects the U.K. economy to grow by 1.7% this year. Before the referendum last year, the bank expected 2.3% growth in 2017. Governor Mark Carney has warned Brits to expect a "squeeze" on living standards this year, because wage growth won't be sufficient to compensate for rising prices. Inflation spiked to a four-year high of 2.7% in April, according to data published Tuesday. Much of that is due to a 14% fall in the pound since the Brexit referendum last June, which has made imports more expensive.

The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.3 percent, as major regional benchmarks tracked a global dip in stocks and the dollar as concerns over U.S. President Trump multiplied. Euro zone blue chips and the bloc's broader index of stocks both dropped 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 on the other hand hovered close to its record high hit on Tuesday, outperforming European peers as gains among miners supported it. Despite their falls on Wednesday, European benchmarks remain near recent highs, having risen sharply as investors pile in to the region on the back of an economic recovery, robust company earnings and voters' rejection of populist parties in elections. "Markets broke upwards with the disappearance of concerns around the French election. Quite a lot of fast money came in and markets are just pausing now to digest that," said Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equities at JP Morgan Asset Management. Ubisoft Entertainment, the third-biggest global entertainment company, fell 6 percent after it cut its mid-term sales forecast, reporting results near the bottom end of its target range after the close on Tuesday. Raiffeisen Bank was a bright spot on a negative banking sector, up 3.5 percent after its first-quarter profit jumped more than expected as write-downs shrank. Lloyds Bank gained 1.9 percent after the British government sold its last remaining shares in the bank, marking the end of an era after one of the largest financial crisis bailouts. But the Netherlands' largest domestic lender ABN Amro fell 3.2 percent after its results, with traders citing a lower net interest margin and capital ratio, though the headline net income beat expectations at 615 million euros. Thyssenkrupp was the top European gainer, up 4 percent after Tata Steel agreed the terms of a deal to cut benefits for its British pension scheme, removing a major obstacle to the potential merger of its steel assets with the German steel maker. Thyssenkrupp's labour boss said the pensions deal does not lessen workers' opposition to a possible merger, however. Gold miner Fresnillo rose 2.8 percent as the price of the safe-haven asset rose to a two week high. Tullow Oil gained 2 percent after JP Morgan reiterated its 'overweight' rating on the stock, saying the oil company had improved its funding position, and valuation had returned to more compelling territory. Norwegian fertilizer maker Yara also got a boost from broker Liberum raising it to 'buy' from 'sell', saying prices of urea, a key ingredient in fertilizers, are close to a trough with fewer capacity additions ahead. European earnings continued to paint a bright picture for the region's equities, with earnings growth for the quarter seen at 19 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

I’d try to help any president of the US because I’m a patriot. That does not mean I agree with every policy he is trying to implement,” the chairman and chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase said at the bank’s annual meeting Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware. Dimon has compared the president to an airplane pilot in the past. “When you get on the airplane, you better be rooting for the success of the pilot,” Dimon said at a townhall event hosted by Yahoo Finance in April. During the question and answer portion of the annual meeting, a number of shareholders called on Dimon to publicly disavow Trump and his policies, particularly Trump’s immigration stance. Dimon listened to several speeches from shareholders before he responded. Dimon said that he agreed with Trump’s plans to reform the corporate tax system. “Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas and excessive regulation is reducing growth and business formation particularly for small businesses,” he said. The chief executive also commented on bank regulation, saying that some of the rules put in place after the financial crisis went too far and should be pulled back. “We are not looking to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules. It is, however, appropriate to open up the rulebook in the light of day and rework the rules and regulations that don’t work well or are unnecessary,” Dimon said.

Tata Steel Brokerage: Macquarie | Rating: Underperform | Target: Rs 370 The company’s EBITDA beat was driven by significant surprise in India and Europe margins, said Macquarie. The guidance of no capex expansion in this fiscal and UK pension talks being in final stages are key positives for the company, it said. Macquarie sees Q4FY17 as the peak of margins and earnings and any near term rally is a chance to exit. On margins, it does not feel that current levels are sustainable. The contraction in margin in India and Europe business are key catalysts for the stock, it added. Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 575 Morgan Stanley believes that earnings momentum, though currently strong, may moderate from current levels. The better than expected momentum in the FAMD (Ferro Alloys and Minerals Division) business in current quarter is a positive. Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 570 The brokerage observed that the firm witnessed strong margin expansion in both India and Europe in Q4. Margins are likely to recede from Q4, but expectations for FY18 still get a lift. If UK Pension negotiations go through, chances of a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp brighten, it feels. Overall, it remains positive on the firm given pension talks and improving industry environment. Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 690 The global brokerage has increased FY18-20 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 7-8 percent. It believes that any JV in Tata Europe should drive a re-rating and hence there is an upside to the target price. Meanwhile, downside risks include collapse in margins in India and Europe businesses. Brokerage: Emkay | Rating: Hold | Target: Rs 453 Emkay has revised volume and margins estimates for the domestic business. It believes that current performance will be tough to repeat given RM volatility and steel prices. Punjab National Bank Brokerage: Nomura | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 180 With recent re-rating, it believes asset quality improvement is factored into price. It feels that the focus will now shift to core PPOP/assets, which will likely remain under pressure. It prefers SBI among PSU banks. Nomura sees stress resolutions to be driven by taking fair haircuts rather than upgrades. Brokerage: Citi | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 170 An improvement in Q4 asset quality was accompanied by an increase in coverage ratio, it said. The bank is making progress in addressing these quality issues, the global financial services firm observed. Return to higher growth along with larger asset resolutions will be the key, it added. Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 160 High stress loans and low return on assets is driving the sell rating on the stock. A speedy recovery of NPLs and smooth management transition will be the key. It has lowered earnings estimates for FY18-19CL on lower margin and higher provisions Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Underperform | Target: Rs 118 The bank will require large dilutions, given CET-I is down to 7.9 percent, while stressed asset cover is at 30 percent. It cut EPS by 7-8 percent as it build in dilution in FY18. Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Underweight | Target: Rs 92 The brokerage observed that headline earnings missed estimates despite positive surprise on pension provision. It expected margin to improve in this quarter on lower regulatory drags. Brokerage: Kotak | Rating: Reduce | Target: Rs 165 Expense reversal and treasury gains drove earnings outperformance, the brokerage house highlighted. It said that the company had a strong liability franchise with over 46 percent CASA ratio, which was a key positive for the bank. Brokerage: Goldman Sachs | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 125 Goldman Sachs observed that asset quality risks persisted, and fresh slippages 150 percent higher than estimates. Higher provisions are likely to be driven by ageing of NPLs. Improvement in asset quality, faster credit growth are key risks for the stock. Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Hold | Target: Rs 160 It sees impairments, weak recovery as key downside risks to the stock. Meanwhile, lower NPLs, higher recoveries are key upside risks to the stock. Shree Cement Brokerage: Citi | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 20,500 The brokerage prefers ACC, Ambuja, UltraTech and Grasim in the cement space. It raised earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by 1-5 percent on higher prices/volumes offset by costs. Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Underperform | Target: Rs 18,000 The brokerage believes that it is still one of the best wealth creators in the sector due to strong execution.Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 18,000 Operating earnings were in line, while volume and realisation beat was offset by sharp cost increase. Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 20,550An improvement in prices in North should aid realisations and EBITDA in the ensuing quarters. It observed that higher costs lead to EBITD miss in Q4. tags #BSE #Market #Nifty #NSE #Sensex #Stocks Views Related news Business Plenty of opportunities in this $2 trillion India market; 10 stocks to buy on dips May 18, 2017 11:48 AM Business Buy Sun TV Network, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India: Ashwani Gujral May 18, 2017 10:55 AM Business Apollo Hospitals may test Rs 1330; bullish on Balkrishna Industries: Rajat Bose May 18, 2017 10:50 AM Business Buy Sintex Industries, Pidilite Industries; sell TVS Motor: Manoj Murlidharan May 18, 2017 10:46 AM Business Buy Canara Bank﻿, Union Bank of India﻿, Bank of India﻿ on dips: Ashwani Gujral May 18, 2017 10:41 AM Business Sell Cipla, buy Mangalore Refineries & Petrochemicals: Mitessh Thakkar May 18, 2017 10:35 AM Business Market exhibiting technical weakness but multibagger returns still possible from current levels May 18, 2017 10:00 AM Business Sell Kaveri Seed, Colgate, Cipla; buy M&M, DCB Bank: Sudarshan Sukhani May 18, 2017 09:34 AM Business Sell Capital First, Aurobindo Pharma, Biocon; buy Bharti Infratel, MRF: Mitessh Thakkar May 18, 2017 09:28 AM News Most Popular Top News Fund managers increased their holding in these 20 blue-chip companies in April Top 10 stocks which rose up to 100% during Nifty50 journey from 9000-9500 Take Notice!

IDA chief Martin Shanahan is obviously convinced of this strategy. Not wishing to lose key ground to competitor countries, he participated in a series of events in London to promote Ireland’s attractiveness as a venue for any UK-based institutions of a mind to jump ship in the event of a ‘no deal’. After weeks of speculation, Wall Street giant JPMorgan this week confirmed it was basing some of its London posts in Ireland, with plans to expand the workforce in the Dublin docklands by about 500 people after Brexit. And this paper reported that, in the coming weeks, Ireland hopes two more investment banks — Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch — will commit to basing jobs here. The Irish campaign is also likely to be a response to the European Commission’s plans to present legislative proposals, in June, affecting London’s future as a major financial centre. France and Germany have previously suggested Brexit will curb London’s dominance in euro-clearing; it handles three-quarters of all euro currency exchanges and euro derivatives trading. 8,000 jobs may migrate from the City of London, if it were to lose its clearing functions. The EU draft policy document proposes “more centralisation of supervision” of clearing businesses in the EU, if they provide “critical capital market functions”, which London obviously does. The problem for Ms May, and the British government, is that they want to get outside the EU’s regulatory reach, but retain the UK’s strong position in EU financial markets, the second-largest in the world. The EU plans further legislative proposals to ensure the financial stability of central counter-parties, also known as clearing houses, which manage risk, collect collateral, and guarantee trades in the event that one side defaults. That’s all very reasonable to those within the EU, but presents difficulties for Ms May, who wishes to reject freedom of movement in the bloc and all its institutions. This includes the European Court of Justice, which is one of her redline Brexit pledges. Financial institutions are opting for an alternative, which is to move their European headquarters from the UK to another jurisdiction inside the EU, from which to passport their financial services. Ireland will hope to lure more US financial institutions to Ireland, which is the only remaining English-speaking member state in the EU. Last month, Taoiseach Enda Kenny and the leaders of the Netherlands and Denmark called a mini Brexit summit, at which they urged EU states not to do anything that risks an agreement with Britain. But the latest tweaking of the Brexit guidelines indicates that other EU members have also moved the goalposts on free movement and will now insist that any EU citizen who has been living in the UK for five years must be granted permanent residency. This marks a significant shift from the original guidelines, which only stated that any future trade agreement should “not endanger financial stability in the union and encompass safeguards against unfair competitive advantages”. We can only hope that cooler heads will prevail, after the UK general election, when the actual Brexit negotiations start.

The investigation is examining whether market makers that buy notes from the government and state-owned companies in primary auctions colluded to suppress prices, the report said. Under scrutiny are local units of Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC), Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) (BBVA.MC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L), Barclays Plc (BARC.L), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), according to the person, Bloomberg said, noting that none of the banks have been accused of wrongdoing. COFECE, which announced the probe in April, declined to comment. HSBC, Santander, BBVA and Bank of America declined to comment.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to follow suit, forecasting a lower open for Britain's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's CAC. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei shed 1.4 percent, Australian shares lost 1.1 percent and South Korea's KOSPI declined 0.4 percent. Shanghai and Hong Kong's Hang Seng also fell. Equities in Asia took cues from Wall Street, where the Dow and S&P 500 both sank about 1.8 percent overnight following reports that Trump tried to influence a federal probe. The allegations have not only thrown doubt over the future of the pro-growth policies that Trump promised, but they have raised the possibility he could end up leaving the presidency. A small but growing number of Trump's fellow Republicans called on Wednesday for an independent probe of possible collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russia, and one even mentioned impeachment. The region's shares showed little reaction to news that former FBI chief Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, although the S&P mini futures were a shade higher while the dollar bounced modestly against the safe-haven yen. The greenback was up 0.4 percent at 111.200 yen after hitting a three-week low of 110.530. It was still down a significant 2 percent on the week. "The appointment appears to be an attempt at tackling the problem early. While it is a bit of good news, further investigations are needed and it still remains to be seen what those could reveal. As such, the markets are still faced with uncertainty," said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. In other political developments, trouble mounted for Brazilian President Michel Temer, who was recorded discussing payments to silence testimony by a potential witness in the country's biggest-ever graft probe. An exchange-traded fund of Brazilian equities was down more about 8 percent in Tokyo, where it is traded. In currencies, the euro extended its overnight surge to touch $1.1174, its highest since November before pulling back slightly to $1.1142. "There are two implications from the latest developments in Washington, first being the possibility of congressional procedures reaching an impasse and second is the potential of Trump being forced out," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. "But judging by how steeply the dollar has fallen, participants may have already priced in much of the negative news regarding Trump. The dollar could even benefit with the market thinking of post-Trump scenarios." The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was flat at 97.604, not far from a six-month trough of 99.333 reached the previous day. The U.S. currency was hurt as Treasury yields declined significantly with allegations against Trump lowering economic stimulus hopes. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.239 percent after going as low as 2.209 percent overnight, its lowest since April 21. With Treasury yields falling, the gap between U.S. and German government debt yields reached its narrowest in more than six months on Wednesday, as a tumultuous week in Washington contrasted with a sense of improved political stability in Europe. In commodities, oil prices dipped after settling at a two-week high overnight. An ongoing effort by OPEC to cut production has partially propped up oil but prices remain under pressure from still plentiful supplies. Brent crude slipped 0.3 percent to $52.05 a barrel. Gold hovered near a two-week high thanks to the weaker dollar and the risk aversion gripping the broader markets. Spot gold hit $1,263.02 an ounce, its highest since May 1.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Wall Street tumbles as reform hopes fade with Trump crisis Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet May 18, 2017:   The S&P 500 and the Dow notched their biggest one-day fall since September 9 as investors' hopes for tax cuts and other pro-business policies faded after reports that US President Donald Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation set off alarm bells on Wall Street. Former FBI chief James Comey said in a memo that Trump had asked him to end a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's ties with Russia, the reports said. That was only the latest worry in a tumultuous week at the White House after Trump unexpectedly fired Comey and reportedly disclosed classified information to Russia's foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation. The developments intensified doubts that Trump would be able to follow through on his promises for tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal stimulus. Those pledges had helped fuel a record-setting post-election rally on Wall Street. Selling accelerated late in the afternoon of one of the busiest trading days in months and the three major indexes ended near session lows. “We've seen the Trump agenda derailed and try to get back on track several times. It's registering with more investors that its going to be hard to get back on track with the latest allegations,” Michael ORourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “Prior to the election investors expected Trump to represent uncertainty,” he said. “The market is now recognizing that some of the fears they had back in October are coming to fruition.” Both the Dow and S&P 500 fell below their 50-day moving average for first time since late April. The S&P began the session 0.74 per cent lower, the largest gap down since March 30, 2009, when it opened trading with a 0.84 per cent drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 372.82 points, or 1.78 per cent, to 20,606.93, the S&P 500 lost 43.64 points, or 1.82 per cent, to 2,357.03 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 158.63 points, or 2.57 per cent, to 6,011.24. The VIX, Wall Street's “fear gauge", shot up to 15.34, its highest level since April 18. Nasdaq had its steepest one-day loss since June 24, after Britain voted to exit the European Union, as did S&P's financial and technology sectors. The financial sector closed down 3 per cent, while the technology sector fell 2.8 per cent. The S&P bank sub-sector dropped 4 percent, led by a 5.9 per cent decline in Bank of America shares and a 3.8 per cent loss for JPMorgan. The bull market is not over by any means, but between the political stuff and the fact that the next earnings season is three months away, theres going to be a lack of motivation, said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities in New York. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors fell with the only gain from utilities and real estate, defensive sectors with predictable if slow growth and high dividends. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.92-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 5.64-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 19 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 28 new highs and 93 new lows. About 8.37 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges in the busiest trading day since March 21, compared with the 6.9 billion-share average for the last 20 sessions.

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Asia falls as White House turmoil hits risk sentiment, dollar bruised By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Thursday and the dollar was stuck near six-month lows against a basket of currencies as uncertainty mounted over U.S. President Donald Trump's future following reports that he tried to interfere with a federal investigation. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.4 percent. Japan's Nikkei shed 1.5 percent, Australian shares lost 1.2 percent and South Korea's KOSPI declined 0.5 percent. Equities in Asia took cues from Wall Street, where the Dow and S&P 500 both sank about 1.8 percent overnight following reports that Trump tried to influence a federal probe. The allegations have not only thrown doubt over the future of the pro-growth policies that Trump promised, but they have raised the possibility he could end up leaving the presidency.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to follow suit, forecasting a lower open for Britain's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's CAC. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei shed 1.4 percent, Australian shares lost 1.1 percent and South Korea's KOSPI declined 0.4 percent. Shanghai and Hong Kong's Hang Seng also fell. Equities in Asia took cues from Wall Street, where the Dow and S&amp;P 500 both sank about 1.8 percent overnight following reports that Trump tried to influence a federal probe. The allegations have not only thrown doubt over the future of the pro-growth policies that Trump promised, but they have raised the possibility he could end up leaving the presidency. A small but growing number of Trump's fellow Republicans called on Wednesday for an independent probe of possible collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russia, and one even mentioned impeachment. The region's shares showed little reaction to news that former FBI chief Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, although the S&amp;P mini futures were a shade higher while the dollar bounced modestly against the safe-haven yen. The greenback was up 0.4 percent at 111.200 yen after hitting a three-week low of 110.530. It was still down a significant 2 percent on the week. "The appointment appears to be an attempt at tackling the problem early. While it is a bit of good news, further investigations are needed and it still remains to be seen what those could reveal. As such, the markets are still faced with uncertainty," said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. In other political developments, trouble mounted for Brazilian President Michel Temer, who was recorded discussing payments to silence testimony by a potential witness in the country's biggest-ever graft probe. An exchange-traded fund of Brazilian equities was down more about 8 percent in Tokyo, where it is traded. In currencies, the euro extended its overnight surge to touch $1.1174, its highest since November before pulling back slightly to $1.1142. "There are two implications from the latest developments in Washington, first being the possibility of congressional procedures reaching an impasse and second is the potential of Trump being forced out," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. "But judging by how steeply the dollar has fallen, participants may have already priced in much of the negative news regarding Trump. The dollar could even benefit with the market thinking of post-Trump scenarios." The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was flat at 97.604, not far from a six-month trough of 99.333 reached the previous day. The U.S. currency was hurt as Treasury yields declined significantly with allegations against Trump lowering economic stimulus hopes. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.239 percent after going as low as 2.209 percent overnight, its lowest since April 21. With Treasury yields falling, the gap between U.S. and German government debt yields reached its narrowest in more than six months on Wednesday, as a tumultuous week in Washington contrasted with a sense of improved political stability in Europe. In commodities, oil prices dipped after settling at a two-week high overnight. An ongoing effort by OPEC to cut production has partially propped up oil but prices remain under pressure from still plentiful supplies. Brent crude slipped 0.3 percent to $52.05 a barrel. Gold hovered near a two-week high thanks to the weaker dollar and the risk aversion gripping the broader markets. Spot gold hit $1,263.02 an ounce, its highest since May 1.

Photo / Bloomberg-Washington Post Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny laid out plans to step down, after steering the economy through one of the most turbulent periods in the nation's history. Kenny, 66, confirmed his plans to resign as leader of the ruling Fine Gael Party at midnight local time at a meeting of his party's MPs in Dublin. His announcement fires the starting gun in a leadership race between Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar and Housing Minister Simon Coveney, with the contest set to be concluded by June 2. Whoever wins the contest will inherit one of Europe's fastest-growing economies. Under Kenny, who took power in 2011, Ireland restored its economic sovereignty by exiting an international bailout and stabilising the financial system. The European Commission last week forecast that the Irish economy will expand by 4 per cent this year. Kenny, whose official title is Taoiseach, also continued Ireland's modernisation path, pushing through gay marriage against Catholic Church opposition. "History will judge Enda Kenny's reign favourably," said Philip O'Sullivan, an economist with Investec in Dublin. "While the execution was not always perfect, his Administration's willingness to take often unpopular decisions was a key ingredient in restoring the country's creditworthiness and turning the economy around." Lauded abroad by bankers and investors, Kenny is regarded less favourably at home, and support for his coalition collapsed in last year's election. That forced him into a so-called rainbow alliance to keep power, and he pledged to step aside before the next election, due within five years. Varadkar, the openly gay son of an Indian immigrant, has moved into the favourite's slot to become prime minister, Paddy Power Betfair odds show. "While the Fine Gael leadership election will generate no shortage of media coverage, we struggle to identify meaningful policy differences between the two front-runners," said O'Sullivan. "Irrespective of who wins, we think 'business as usual' will be the real result." Continued below. Related Content Sideswipe: May 5: Well it is Ask Me Anything... Bottle snatchers grab non-alcoholic wine from Whangarei liquor store Your Views: Readers' Letters The new leader will be chosen by early June, as talks on the UK's departure from the European Union near. While Ireland is considered to be the European economy most vulnerable to Brexit, the economy is in better shape to withstand such a shock than when Kenny took power from Brian Cowen in 2011. Unemployment has fallen to about 6 per cent from a peak of 15 per cent in January 2012, borrowing costs have dropped below the UK's and Ireland has remained a favoured destination for US companies seeking a foothold in Europe. JPMorgan Chase this month agreed to buy a new office building in Dublin, with room for more than 1000 workers, as it continues to plan for Brexit. Kenny also won plaudits for his moves on social issues. In 2015, Irish voters backed a proposal to allow gay marriage by almost a 2-to-1 margin, making the nation the first in the world to back wedlock for same-sex couples in a referendum. He also took on the Catholic hierarchy, saying in 2010 that the Vatican's handling of abuse scandals smacked of "elitism and narcissism," some of the sharpest language an Irish leader has ever used against the church. At times, though, Kenny's tenure has been marked by missteps. Last year, the PM apologised for describing opponents as "whingers," and drew fire after saying that the "vast majority of people don't understand economic jargon". Kenny's penchant for homespun wisdom can also grate. In 2015, he spoke of a "man who stopped me with two pints of beer in his hand" to complain about the introduction of water charges. "Two pints in one hand?" Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams asked.
