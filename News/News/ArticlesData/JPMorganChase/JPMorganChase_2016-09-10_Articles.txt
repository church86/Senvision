An incredibly lucrative sign-up bonus has made the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card a cult hit among credit card aficionados. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 11, 2016 at 9:29AM Want the new Chase Sapphire Reserve Card? You'll have to wait in line. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The new travel rewards credit card offered by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) -- the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card -- is so popular that demand for the cards far outstripped the bank's supply of them shortly after the bank started issuing them. "I have never seen such interest in a credit card, and I've been doing this for 15 years," travel blogger Gary Leff told the Associated Press. Chase Sapphire Reserve Card: a metallic card for the masses The Chase Sapphire Reserve isn't your typical travel rewards card, and the difference is apparent as soon as you hold one. As opposed to the usual credit card, which is made of plastic, Chase's new card is handcrafted out of a metallic alloy that "gives it a satisfying heft and an impressive thunk when you toss it onto the table to pick up the check," says the Associated Press. This is why JPMorgan Chase ran out of the card almost immediately after it was launched. Unlike plastic, which is available in limitless quantities, the metallic alloy used in the Chase Sapphire Reserve card was in much shorter supply. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. For the record, the card's popularity has nothing to do with aggressive marketing. Just the opposite is true, in fact, as Chase hasn't spent a dime publicizing it. It's instead a cult hit, which spread by word of mouth. The prestige that comes with a metallic card is one of the card's main appeals. That puts it in league with the likes of American Express' Black Card. The difference between the Chase Sapphire Reserve card and American Express' Black Card is that you don't have to be a millionaire or a celebrity to qualify for one. This has made it especially popular among millennials, a generation that's otherwise shunned the credit card industry. A hefty annual fee But the card doesn't come cheap. It has an annual fee of $450. That's eight times more than the $55 annual fee that I pay for my Costco Anywhere Visa, which offers a slate of generous rewards and doubles as my yearly fee to access the membership warehouse. Another reason JPMorgan Chase's latest credit card offering is so popular is because it comes with what must be the single most lucrative sign-up bonus of any card on the market now. So long as you spend $4,000 on your card in the first three months after opening the account, you get 100,000 points that can be redeemed for travel. That equates to approximately $1,500 worth of travel rewards. Beyond the sign-up bonus, moreover, the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card provides a major recurring benefit. It comes with a $300 annual credit that can be used toward travel. Assuming you redeem the credit, then, this effectively drops your annual fee to $150. The sign-up bonus alone has people clamoring to get a card. It's become such a hit among those who regularly apply for rewards cards in order to accrue bonus points, that Chase is purportedly disqualifying applicants who have opened five or more bank cards in the past 24 months. The net result is that, while the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card may be less selective than the American Express Black Card, it's not like just anyone can get one. But for those who do, and who travel a lot as well, it's easy to see why JPMorgan's Chase's latest credit card offering has been such a hit. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

And Wells Fargo first particularly Jamie Dimon spent away and we can stream and he's back but his work cut out. What he's been quite shockingly. Present in the office apparently. Yeah he's he's back I would say that means that the bank just missed earnings -- a couple of pennies ninety deal. Necessary but they had a few things going all absurdity and ended the big samples is cyber security. The twenty pro preach this cost us money rights and Italy has -- bridge at which.

If you read the -- for the summer third quarter results I mean on the results that are bit shy of what people expected but I think the interesting thing about it was a slight I mean.

Just two days before the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite dropped by about two percent each, Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan's Global Head of Derivatives and Quantitative Research, warned investors in a research note that stocks were on the verge of breaking out of a 'dead zone'—and volatility was about to surge. Now that stocks have seen the worst sell-off in months, the analyst's warning appears prescient. "We expect definitely an increase in volatility in September—more likely than not a sell-off as well," Marko Kolanovic told CNBC's "Fast Money" in an interview this week. "It would be triggered by high volatility, deleveraging from various systematic strategies and some of these options effects that are going in reverse." The CBOE Volatility Index is now at its highest level in more than two months. "If you look at the S&P price action over the past two months, it's been in an extremely tight range. Actually, it's one of the longest periods of the market really not moving at all," he said. However, that all changed on Friday, when the S&P saw its largest move since June. It came as the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its first triple point loss since July 5. Kolanovic, who early this year correctly told "Fast Money" viewers that both gold and crude oil would rebound, does not believe the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its September meeting. Yet, given the uncertainty surrounding that meeting as well as the presidential election, it has the capacity to drive volatility above seasonal levels and contribute to more downward pressure on stocks. By the end of the year, Kolanovic believes the market will move higher. "December tends to be the strongest month," noted Kolanvic. "Once the election is out of the way, it could provide some certainty and some boost to the market."

Photo: Reuters Mumbai: Hindustan Powerprojects Pvt. Ltd has initiated discussions with investors to sell around 300 megawatts (MW) of solar assets, three people aware of the development said. The money could be used for expansion and also to provide a partial exit to its private equity investor, Blackstone. The sale could fetch the Blackstone-backed power asset developer almost $300 million (around Rs.2,000 crore), said one of the three, requesting anonymity as the talks are private. The company is “talking to various financial and strategic investors. The portfolio of assets it is looking to sell has an enterprise value of almost $300 million, of which almost $100 million is equity and the rest, debt”, this person added. Hindustan Powerprojects has been exploring options to raise funds to create more power assets and also to provide an exit to Blackstone, said the second person on condition of anonymity. “While the company has been talking about an IPO (initial public offering), that is still some time away. At the same time, Blackstone, which invested about $300 million in Hindustan Powerprojects in August 2010 and holds more than 30% (in the company), has been contemplating an exit. So, it has been looking at these asset sales to raise funds,” he said, adding that the company has hired investment bank JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd to advise on the asset sale. Spokespersons of Hindustan Powerprojects, Blackstone and JPMorgan declined comment. Also Read: Govt plans $400 million fund for renewable energy firms The company, formerly known as Moser Baer Projects Pvt. Ltd, has 600MW of solar capacity. In April, it commissioned a 1,200MW thermal power plant at Anuppur in Madhya Pradesh. It plans to reach 2 gigawatts (GW) in total solar capacity by 2017 and has a target of reaching 7GW of total capacity by 2020 from coal, solar and hydroelectric power sources. According to its website, it is in advanced stages of commissioning more than 5GW by 2017 of combined power assets at an estimated investment of $5.15 billion. Besides India, the company has power generation assets in Germany, Italy, the US, the UK and Japan. In April, the company’s chairman, Ratul Puri, said that depending on the incremental capital requirement, Hindustan Powerprojects could look at an IPO some time in 2017. This year has seen significant merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the Indian renewable energy space. In June, Tata Power Co. Ltd acquired a large chunk of renewable assets from Welspun Enterprise Ltd at an enterprise value of $1.4 billion. According to a report in The Economic Times, Greenko Energy Holdings is set to buy SunEdison’s Indian assets, and will pay a small premium of less than $100 million in an all-cash deal. “As compared to about a year ago, the market today is witnessing a lot of churn of assets. There is M&A activity on both the wind and solar power side,” said Sanjay Sethi, managing director and chief executive at infrastructure advisory firm Nestor Consulting India. India has set itself the ambitious target of increasing its clean energy capacity more than fivefold to 175GW by 2022. Of this, around 100GW is to come from solar power. In the climate change talks held in Paris last December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that by 2030, 40% of the country’s installed power capacity would be based on non-fossil fuel. India needs $200 billion in investments to reach its goal of 100GW solar energy and 60GW wind energy by 2022. Overseas investors and global renewable energy firms are making a beeline for the country and several Indian conglomerates are looking at the sector more seriously.

“No warning can save people determined to grow suddenly rich” – Lord Overstone Home Articles Authors Email Groups Search About Us HOME / Articles / Michael Noonan / Gold And Silver Are Money. Everything Else Is Debt... Gold And Silver Are Money. Everything Else Is Debt. Globalist's Biggest Scam By: Michael Noonan | Sat, Sep 10, 2016 Share Print Email Last week, in "Fiat 'Dollar' Says Gold And Silver Will Struggle," we said the following: [See 4th paragraph] Money does not exist in this country. In fact, money does not exist anywhere in the world. What is money? So few people know, and many who profess to know do not. Money is a commodity with a recognized value. Gold and silver remain the last known standard of real money. Remember J P Morgan's famous words: "Gold is money. Everything else is credit." The globalists, through their creation of the Federal Reserve, have sold the biggest lie ever to the world and continue to get away with it. People everywhere believe the fiat-created Federal Reserve Note, falsely called the "dollar," is actually a monetary dollar. We have often stated how Federal Reserve Notes are evidences of debt issued by the Fed. We also always add that debt is not and can never be money, yet almost every American wrongly believes debt is money because they believe the Fed "dollar" is money. Only gold and silver are money! Gold and silver each are a commodity. They have universal recognition and acceptance. Their value is determined by the market by what people choose to accept as payment for goods and services offered. By contrast, the Fed "dollar" is not money. It is a currency. A currency represents the actual money. In today's world, there is no currency that represents actual money. Fiat is imaginary. It does not exist except in one's mind. Yet, around the world, everyone's imagination believes their local currency is money. Only gold and silver are money! If you go to a restaurant and use valet parking, you receive a stub to reclaim your car by the valet at the end of dinner. The ticket stub is not the car, it represents the car to be "redeemed" upon presentation. There is no currency in the world that represents money, and no currency can be redeemed for money. Always remember, Only gold and silver are money! This is a very simple truth, yet few accept it as truth. Almost everyone is too willing to believe that imaginary currencies are real money. For as long as most of the world is willing to accept this false premise, the globalists will always rule the masses much like sheep being led to financial slaughter. How do most people measure the value of gold and silver? By their imaginary currency. Always remember, every currency is imaginary because it is backed by nothing. Any currency's "value" is dictated determined by the source, the central bank issuing the imaginary money currency. When you understand the basic difference between money and currency, you will fully understand the globalist's massive "money" Ponzi scheme which is aided and abetted by every government guilty of perpetrating the fraud, and make no mistake, the fraud is on you. The only way to measure of the value of gold and silver is by the daily fluctuating number of fiats [of any country's issuance] required to buy either metal. The value of gold and silver do not go up and down. It is the number of fiats that increases or decreases that determines how gold and silver are "priced" on any given day. If people do not understand the basics, they will continue to believe that debt is money. The two are not and can never be interchangeable. In a Venn diagram, money and debt can never intersect for they have nothing in common. By contrast, because currencies are actual debt, not only do they intersect, [as we show in this simple diagram], they are concurrent overlaying circles, one and the same. If a currency is a promise to pay, what is the promise you receive? None, zip, nada. All you can get is more of the same in different denominations. Currencies are more akin to the car game, Old Maid, where one wants to avoid being the last holder of the queen card designated as the Old Maid. The American public will be in for the financial shock of their lives when they wake up one day and discover what they own are nothing more than Old Maids that have been devalued by 30%, 40%, maybe even 50%. The Old Maids will be the fiat Federal Reserve Note, falsely know as a "dollar," but they will have declined in value relative to gold and silver, aka real money. If it takes 1,300 fiat Federal Reserve Notes to purchase an ounce of gold, and one day, overnight, gold is revalued so that it takes 5,000 fiat Federal Reserve Notes to purchase the same one ounce of gold, it is not the ounce of gold that has changed. Instead, the number of fiats has been devalued, worth much less than the Federal Reserve once said they were worth which is why more and more will be required to buy the unchanged ounce of gold, and silver. If you own an ounce of gold, you can exchange to for 1,300 Federal Reserve fiat Notes by today's measure. When the fiat is devalued overnight, your ounce of gold will then be able to be exchanged to 5,000 fiat Notes. In other words, your wealth effect will have been preserved. This is why you want to buy and hold gold and silver. All governments have sold out their citizens to the globalist's fiat Ponzi scheme. Earlier, we posted an article, "Anything & Everything Goes – The Corrupt and Deranged Governance of America," because we like the George Orwell quote: "The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it." The globalists hate the truth, and they do everything possible to keep the truth suppressed. Knowing the difference between money and currency is a perfect example. Remember, the money currency you hold in any bank is even more "unreal" than the paper currency that you may still think is money, because anything digitalized is pure fiction. If you have a family, they are real. If you have a digitalized family, they do not exist, except in your mind, just like currency. If you want money and want to survive the massive economic failure that is destined to come, buy and hold gold and silver. The world has not been awash in debt more than it is now and that mushrooming debt cannot be sustained What's in your wallet? For the moment, we are in the calm of the proverbial eye of the largest hurricane ever, and it is the calm before the inescapable storm that will be more financially destructive than the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. If you fail to understand what money is vs what currency is, you remain at risk. The trend in gold has turned up, and it is at the beginning of the next phase. Timing has been difficult because it is impossible to apply reason to fiction, that which is unreasonable. The only rational way to respond to the globalist fiction being peddled around the world is to be prepared. The best way to be prepared, in terms of gold and silver, is to own it, for one day, the price will be off the charts, as it were. What stands out in the daily chart is what appears to be obscured and that is the last two separate massive sell days of thousands of gold contracts by the BIS, trying to punish those who choose to take their own path and not be a lemming to be led over the financial cliff that lies ahead. In the past, the massive manipulated sell days stood out on a chart. Now, it is more like trying to find Waldo. Truth and the price of gold will ultimately prevail. The two up slanting lines, one for volume, the other for price, demonstrate how the market advertises its intent. When the highest volume in a rally occurs at the high, it usually is a disguised show from sellers overtaking buyers, and a correction will follow. Silver is seemingly bidding its time more than gold, but it still is outperforming gold, and we expect that will continue. It will be interesting to see if the current bullish spacing will hold while silver seems to struggle out of its sideways bottoming process. Bullish spacing occurs when the last swing low is above the high of the last swing high, an indication that buyers are not waiting to see how the market will retest that last swing high. It is unusual to appear in what is considered a relatively weak market. So far, there has been no sign that the current near-term decline has ended.     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The market for an effective therapy that actually slows the progression of the disease would likely generate billions of dollars in annual sales.

(Photo: AP) The demand has been so overwhelming that the manufacturer ran out of raw material in just days. Enthusiasts extol its virtues all over the internet. Millennials are clamoring for it. It’s not a new video game, or some fancy food craze, or even Apple’s latest iPhone, but a credit card. Calling it plastic wouldn’t do it justice. It is a high-end, high-fee, high-reward card made of a metallic alloy that gives it a satisfying heft and an impressive thunk when you toss it onto the table to pick up the check. The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card has become the hottest card on the market just two weeks after being introduced, even though it came out during the slow, end-of-summer period, it carries a hefty $450 annual fee, and JPMorgan Chase spent nothing on advertising it. “I’m telling all my friends about it,” said Maddy Novich, 33, of New York, who applied for the card, as did her husband. Like so many crazes these days, this one has been fueled by social media, word of mouth and the internet. Frequent travelers and those who try to game travel-loyalty programs have been writing extensively about the card on blogs and forums. “I have never seen such interest in a credit card, and I’ve been doing this for 15 years,” said Gary Leff, who runs the travel and points blog View From the Wing. Chase has approved tens of thousands of applications for the card, said spokeswoman Lauren Francis. Most of the customers are millennials, who typically shun credit cards and are not usually a target for high-fee, ultra-premium plastic. The demand has been so high that Chase ran out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. Customers are being issued temporary plastic cards. Credit cards with high fees but generous rewards are aimed at well-to-do customers who spend and travel extensively. The market has long been dominated by American Express with its Platinum Card. So why’s the Chase card so hot? Chase offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus if the customer meets certain spending targets. Those points can be worth up to $1,500 in travel rewards. They can also be converted to hotel or airline points that could secure, oh, a dreamy hotel suite in the Maldives or a first-class ticket for, say, a honeymoon. The card also comes with a $300 annual credit toward travel. 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The prognosis comes even as India gets ready to release key inflation and factory output data on Monday and external sector data later this month and after a period when things seemed to be getting worse. That fits in with the theory that things had to get worse before starting to get better. Retail inflation, which crossed 6% in July, is likely to decelerate sharply, beginning with August numbers to be released this week, over the next few months on the back of a good monsoon and fall in food prices; similarly, factory output may rebound after bottoming out in July if one goes by the recent uptick in the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI); finally, India’s external sector may also see further improvement with the current account deficit turning surplus. Analysts expect this improvement in the macro numbers to provide room to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to further cut key policy rates later in the year, though they rule out one at the upcoming 4 October monetary policy review. Retail inflation recorded a 22-month high of 6.07% in July spurred by higher food prices. The index of industrial production has so far remained volatile with no sustained signs of recovery in the manufacturing sector. However, in August, the Nikkei/Markit Manufacturing PMI—an indicator of factory activity—rose to 52.6, from 51.8 in July. JPMorgan economists Sajjid Chinoy and Toshi Jain said in an advisory on 7 September that consumer price inflation (CPI) may decelerate to 5% in August, 4.5% in September and to an average of 4% in the three months ending December. “In recent weeks—even as the monsoon has underperformed exuberant initial expectations but remained in the normal range, pulse sowing has remained strong, and food prices have begun to decline—we have been flagging downside risks to our inflation trajectory with the implication that the space for more monetary easing may be opening up. With pulse and vegetable prices declining meaningfully over the last fortnight, we are sufficiently convinced that those downside risks have now been realized,” they said. So far, around 86% of the country has received normal to excess rainfall, according to the India Meteorological Department. Though some parts of the country have recorded deficit rainfall, no major crop loss has been reported. In fact, sowing of kharif (monsoon) crops this year has shown a rise compared to last year. Data with the agriculture ministry shows that 105.4 million hectares have been planted under different kharif crops so far, an increase of 4.16% from the area sown by this time last year. Sowing of pulses, a key pressure point in retail inflation, saw almost a 30% increase this year to 14.4 million hectares. Other crops such as rice, coarse cereals and oilseeds have also seen an increase in the sowing area, with sugarcane and cotton being the exceptions. Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist, and Dhiraj Nim, economics associate, at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt. Ltd wrote in a note dated 8 September that a good set of macroeconomic numbers is expected in the next few days. “August CPI inflation is likely to fall sharply after a four-month rise, solidifying our forecast for a 25bp repo rate cut in 4Q (the fourth quarter). The 2Q current account is likely to post a surplus after nine long years of deficit. The August trade balance is expected to narrow further as gold imports touch a five-month low. The industrial production index may be depressed, but the data is for July. The more updated PMI Index suggests that activity improved markedly in August,” they said. To be sure, in its monetary policy review last month, RBI warned about upward price pressures on inflation. While it acknowledged that a good monsoon after two consecutive drought years and better supply side management could see food inflation moderating, it flagged pressures on the non-food, non-fuel inflation outlook. “The prospects for inflation excluding food and fuel are more uncertain; if the current softness in crude prices proves to be transient and as the output gap continues to close, inflation excluding food and fuel may likely trend upwards and counterbalance the benefit of the expected easing of food inflation. In addition, the full implementation of the recommendations of the 7th central pay commission on allowances will affect the magnitude of the direct effect of house rents on the CPI,” it said. D.K. Joshi, chief economist at rating agency Crisil, ruled out a rate cut in the October monetary policy review: “Even though the monsoon data will be available with RBI by September end, rate cuts will not happen this October. RBI will do that by end of the year only.” remya nairPrerna Kapoor Topics: inflation forecastCPIIIPPMIindustrial output More from this Section Demonetisation: Congress justifies Ghulam Nabi Azad’s Uri attack comparison There is no merit in disclosing names of big loan defaulters, says SC Narendra Modi meets president as demonetisation chaos continues Note ban may ease food prices as retailers buy less India’s no first use policy on nukes ‘ambiguous’: Pakistan Editor's Picks Banks to exchange notes only for own customers Saturday, seniors exempted Demonetisation has achieved 50% of objective: Subramanian Swamy Modi’s demonetisation drive may damage Arvind Kejriwal the most Consequences of the demonetisation shock Reliance Jio seeing sharp decline in subscriber growth rate: analysts First Published: Sun, Sep 11 2016. 11 42 PM IST Read more from Livemint Demonetisation: Congress justifies Ghulam Nabi Azad’s Uri attack comparison There is no merit in disclosing names of big loan defaulters, says SC Ricoh says fraud at Indian unit pegged at Rs683 crore Editor's Picks Banks to exchange notes only for own customers Saturday, seniors exempted Demonetisation has achieved 50% of objective: Subramanian Swamy Modi’s demonetisation drive may damage Arvind Kejriwal the most Latest News Demonetisation: Congress justifies Ghulam Nabi Azad’s Uri attack comparison There is no merit in disclosing names of big loan defaulters, says SC Ricoh says fraud at Indian unit pegged at Rs683 crore Banks to exchange notes only for own customers Saturday, seniors exempted Narendra Modi meets president as demonetisation chaos continues Mint On Sunday The priceless legacy of P.L.

I made my October payment using Con Ed’s pay-by-phone service, as I have been doing for years. Everything went smoothly, and I received a confirmation number. Then, in November, I received a notice from Con Ed stating that it never received the funds from my bank, JPMorgan Chase. I checked my balance, and had more than enough funds to cover it. This also happened with November’s Con Ed bill. I called Con Ed and spoke to one of its customer representatives, who told me it was having trouble with Chase releasing funds payable to Con Ed due to a new payment system that it had installed during the summer, and that I should go to my bank and tell it to release funds to the account of Con Ed of NY. I went to my Chase branch located at 1901 86th St. in Brooklyn, and spent more than an hour with the branch manager. She made many calls to her tech people, who didn’t know of any problems or what to do with the account info that I had been given. She also made calls to Con Ed and seemed to get only the runaround. Con Ed did tell her my pay-by-phone privileges had been suspended for five months for nonpayment. On March 9, 2016, I mailed the current bill along with a check for $1,613, the total amount owed, at the Bath Beach post office. The next month, I received a new bill for $1,826, and again sent a check for the total amount, mailed at same post office. I would greatly appreciate any help you can give with this matter. C.K. Dear C.K.: I checked with Con Ed and didn’t get the runaround. And while I didn’t get a definitive answer, I’m sure your problem is now being fixed. A spokesman for Con Ed said “We are in touch with the customer and seeking to resolve the matter.” He added that “several payments the customer tried to make failed, prompting us to put a block on the account. Once we removed the block, the payments still did not go through.” The spokesman said that “based on what we have learned so far, we do not believe the problem is with Con Edison’s systems.” Of course, that’s what they all say. But hopefully it’s fixed by now. Addendum from C.K.: I want to take this opportunity to thank you for all your help in solving my payment problems with Con Edison. It’s your intervention that got ConEd to assign Ms. Rodriguez to be my personal troubleshooter. Thank you again. Trump’s behavior a ‘Cohn’ job Dear John: Donald Trump’s aggressiveness was learned from a very close business associate and friend. It is interesting to note that infamous Roy Cohn was Trump’s lawyer, mentor and friend for many years. Much of Trump’s arrogance, brazenness and insulting aggressiveness is right out of Cohn’s personal playbook. It was Cohn who brought Trump into NYC’s elite political circles and represented him in lucrative real estate deals. Once one knows the great influence Cohn had on Trump, it is not hard to recognize it in Trump’s actions. Those brazen actions could be his downfall but for what awaits Hillary in October in e-mails to be exposed and the movie “Clinton Cash.” M.M. Dear M.M.: Thanks for the background. It’s going to be interesting. Dear John: If the increasingly erratic Federal Reserve decides to shell out “helicopter” money, I don’t think it would cause much of a jump in inflation. That’s because if “free money” caused a big increase in consumer demand, all it would do is ramp up some of the thousands of Chinese factories now sitting idle. There’s so much slack in the world economy that it would take an enormous dump of free money to make a difference. E.K. Dear E.K.: OK, if you are correct, it would then increase the US trade deficit and allow China to accumulate trillions of dollars. The Chinese would then hold those dollars in the form of US Treasurys, making it ever a bigger creditor and giving China, which doesn’t particularly like us, more control over American policy. Or it could just cause inflation. Either way — and there are numerous bad outcomes — a money dump would not be good for the US, especially coming as it does after the QE policy that has created excess currency. Thanks for the exercise in hypotheticals.

September 11, 2016 1:03pm NYSE:EWJ ShareTweet Analysts following the Bank of Japan’s statements over the past few weeks have noticed a big change in how the central bank is positioning its role within the struggling economy. While surprise accommodation measures worked for the bank in the past, their effect has worn thin this year. In response, the bank’s Governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, is changing tactics. From Bloomberg: Delivering unexpected policy decisions might have added potency to easing early on in the Kuroda era, when the main tool was simple asset purchases, said Masaaki Kanno, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo. Stocks jumped and the yen slid when Kuroda unveiled his first, greater-than-anticipated, stimulus in April 2013 — and did so again when the board, against forecasts, doubled down in October 2014. Leaving markets without guidance did the BOJ no favors in December, however, when equities tumbled and the yen jumped after a complicated tweak to the stimulus program that at first appeared to be an acceleration in easing. Many analysts have pointed out that negative rates are hurting Japan’s private banks. What’s more, one of Prime Minister Abe’s most trusted economists recently expressed doubt that the Bank of Japan’s rate and stimulus measures were having any positive effect at all. Kuroda and Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso separately last week highlighted both costs and benefits of the BOJ’s policies, using similar language. They provided analysis on the negative-rate tool and why bond yields fell more than anticipated, along with a recognition of the danger of too-low long-term rates damaging confidence. “The BOJ communication strategy has totally changed in the past several weeks,” said Kanno, who used to work at the BOJ. “They don’t want to surprise the market anymore.” Whether the new policy will help boost economic growth is yet to be determined. The iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSE:EWJ) closed down $0.20 (-1.60%) to $12.33 per share on Friday. The largest U.S.-listed ETF focused on Japanese equities has risen a modest 1.73% year-to-date.

That’s the conclusion of BOJ watchers sifting through speeches and media appearances with Kuroda and other officials in recent weeks, which have offered far greater insight into the central bank’s thinking than previously in the governor’s term. Delivering unexpected policy decisions might have added potency to easing early on in the Kuroda era, when the main tool was simple asset purchases, said Masaaki Kanno, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo. Stocks jumped and the yen slid when Kuroda unveiled his first, greater-than-anticipated, stimulus in April 2013 -- and did so again when the board, against forecasts, doubled down in October 2014. Leaving markets without guidance did the BOJ no favors in December, however, when equities tumbled and the yen jumped after a complicated tweak to the stimulus program that at first appeared to be an acceleration in easing. Then in January, the shock adoption of a negative interest rate strategy that Kuroda had previously rejected fed a narrative that the BOJ was starting to run out of ideas. While central bank officials reject that they had ever sought to surprise markets, recent remarks indicate a major shift in their approach. Frank Acknowledgment Kuroda and Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso separately last week highlighted both costs and benefits of the BOJ’s policies, using similar language. They provided analysis on the negative-rate tool and why bond yields fell more than anticipated, along with a recognition of the danger of too-low long-term rates damaging confidence. "The BOJ communication strategy has totally changed in the past several weeks," said Kanno, who used to work at the BOJ. "They don’t want to surprise the market anymore." While only the result of the central bank’s comprehensive review of its programs and its policy decision on Sept. 21 will bear out the conclusion, Kanno’s observation about an abandonment of the surprise tactic is shared by others. Daiju Aoki at UBS Group AG made the point in a note after Kuroda’s Sept. 5 speech. Dialogue Open "Kuroda’s remarks were previously strong affirmations of existing policies and expressions of the principle that additional monetary easing would be carried out without hesitation if it was necessary," leaving little room for signaling or analysis, Takashi Miwa, chief Japan economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Tokyo, wrote earlier this month. Now, "the BOJ is changing its communication strategy to one more focused on dialog with the market." Neither Kuroda nor Nakaso betrayed the final conclusions of the review, or what next week’s policy decision will be. Yet the discussions of potential harm from excessively low yields on long-maturity bonds gave an indication that the central bank prefers to see significantly positive rates in that part of the yield curve.  Those remarks have spurred some to anticipate tweaks to the BOJ’s bond-buying program to ensure a desired yield curve. One central bank watcher sees a ’reverse Operation Twist’ coming; click here to read more. Yet market moves have already achieved a steeper yield curve, responding to the officials’ signals, with 20-year government bond yields back above 0.4 percent after dipping to around zero earlier this year. Kanno said there may be no policy signal on the yield curve, with the Financial Markets Department having scope to vary the bond purchases as needed through regular monthly announcements. Both Kuroda and Nakaso highlighted that the introduction of a negative rate on a portion of the reserves commercial banks park at the BOJ has not hurt their ability to lend, and noted that companies have taken advantage of cheaper rates and sold long-dated bonds. That indicates no suggestion of any move to abandon the current benchmark-rate tool, which if anything could be taken deeper into negative territory, analysts said. A cut in the minus 0.1 percent rate could help undermine the attraction of the yen, generating a more competitive exchange rate, while also steepening the yield curve -- a shift that may help banks. Long Haul Meantime, the recognition by policy makers that inflation expectations haven’t played the role in pushing up consumer prices originally anticipated suggests the BOJ is girding for sustaining stimulus for the longer haul. Kuroda in an interview with Sankei newspaper last month said the bank will discuss things like making the bond purchases target a range, which could offer greater flexibility. By giving both pros and cons to the current framework, investors have more to analyze and interpret -- and it still leaves the potential for some to be disappointed or surprised by the board on Sept. 21. Even so, the new approach is "very healthy," Kanno said. One caveat on the no-major-surprises conclusion, however: Kuroda in his Sept. 5 speech said "other new ideas should not be off the table."

Photograph: Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Suzanne McGee Sunday 11 September 2016 08.00 EDT Last modified on Sunday 11 September 2016 10.09 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close So you’ve just sold those Facebook shares that your high school buddy, Mark Zuckerberg, let you buy years before it went public, and you’ve made an after-tax profit of $4m. You’re feeling very, very rich. Until, that is, you talk to a private bank that specializes in managing money for rich people. That’s when you realize that you’re nothing more than a “single-digit millionaire”. You’re just not that special. In fact, the rate at which the ranks of millionaires is expanding is so great, you’re actually pretty boring. Last year alone, the US welcomed 300,000 new millionaires: that translates into a growth rate of 3%, outpacing the growth in the US gross domestic product. In fact, there are now so many millionaires out there that the private banking system simply can’t cope. JP Morgan Chase’s private bank has been raising the minimum amount of assets you need to become of its clients slowly and steadily for many years. Early this year, it announced that the minimum asset level to remain a private banking customer would double from $5m to $10m. When that takes effect early next year, about 10% of the bank’s customers could be shuffled off to a less deluxe service, Private Client Direct. While a private banker might work with only 20 or so people, those working with “single digit millionaires” might have 100 clients – meaning that every one of them gets much less of their adviser’s time and attention. Why a surging stock market isn't making ordinary investors happy Read more JP Morgan’s move was partly aimed at convincing clients to shift any assets they might be stubbornly holding at other banks, bringing them up above the $10m threshold. But it’s also a recognition that with the proliferation of millionaires, the private banks that you’ve heard about – the ones that will walk your dog, deliver gold bars with your monogram stamped into them and provide “wealth therapy” so your children don’t grow up entitled brats – can pick and choose the clients that they deal with. A sign of just how ruthless they have become is that JP Morgan’s new rule even applies to the corporate lawyers with whom its investment bankers work closely on big deals. Until now, access to private banking programs have been among the perks offered to lawyers at firms like Skadden Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; now, the word is that they too will be shut out from this special treatment (and the access to hedge fund investments and other products and events that only the super-elite can tap into). Imagine how the poor lawyer who does a deal for a Silicon Valley billionaire must feel: he’s negotiating with the very bankers who have thrown him out of their private club, on behalf of a client who is welcome to join it. If you don’t feel much empathy for that hypothetical lawyer, worth millions, just because he can’t qualify for super-special treatment from banks, I don’t blame you. The fact is that as banks scramble to emphasize with wealthier clients, it comes at the expense of serving the rest of their clientele. JP Morgan’s private clients might feel offended at being demoted. On the other hand, those of us who merely toil for our money and whose net worth hasn’t reached seven digits yet might be flattered to be invited to join Private Client Direct, a program serving the “mass affluent” that offers after-hours access, a phone number to reach a banker any time and a few special perks. (Yes, even if that also involves some heavy pressure to buy the bank’s proprietary investment products.) But even then, we’ll need $500,000 in investments or $250,000 in deposits to qualify, and minimums for other such programs at other banks aren’t very different. All of which brings me to an important point. Big banks are struggling to make money. That’s why Wells Fargo’s 5,300 rank-and-file employees were “encouraged”, or at least not discouraged, to set up phony accounts in the names of existing clients, earning the bank more in fees (phew) and helping those employees hit sales targets. The bank opened 1.5m of these ghost accounts – and has paid out $185m in penalties to various regulators, including a record $100m to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It’s also why the banks want to focus on their richest clients. Investing time and money in working with those of us who may only have a few thousand dollars to put to work is a waste of their resources – in their eyes. The problem is that as they keep conducting triage, and denying access to investment guidance to one group after another, more and more of us will end up without the ability to turn to the banks to help us manage our investments. Let’s face it, JP Morgan and other private banks can boost their investment minimums dramatically, but the incomes of most Americans are barely budging. We’re less and less likely to have the minimum level of assets that most investment counselors want to see before accepting us as a client. Robo-advisers – the new breed of automated investment platforms that use algorithms to invest your money, taking into account factors such as age, income and risk tolerance – offer sensible alternatives. But they work best for those people who are familiar with how financial markets work. Someone who isn’t comfortable with markets, doesn’t understand the concept of an index fund, isn’t completely sure about how an asset allocation will help them, or isn’t certain about the relationship between stocks and bonds may not want to simply hand over their money to a robo-adviser and then step away. Rise of the billionaire robots: how algorithms have redefined hedge funds Read more So, big banks are in love with the billionaires who generate the bulk of their profits. Even the single-digit millionaires these days are starting to realize that they just don’t count as much as they used to. But at least if those folks make an error or two along the way, they have financial padding to cushion their fall. The rest of us? Like everyone else, we’re increasingly underserved by the banks and the rest of the financial services industry, and our needs are growing. A third of all Americans lack any retirement savings in a 401(k) plan or other tax-deferred account. That isn’t the fault of the banks, but it’s something that the banks could help to fix by offering even basic financial education and counselling to those who don’t have balances with many, many digits. Then we’d at least feel we were getting value for the account fees we’re already paying. As it is, if I were a single-digit millionaire tossed out of the “paradise” of private banking, I’d walk away from that bank altogether. They don’t want me? Heck, I don’t want them either. There are plenty of independent financial advisers out there who – unlike the banks – aren’t intent on making more money flogging their own proprietary investment products. Instead, they vow to put their clients’ financial interests before their own, come what may. Try one of those instead. For the rest of us? Well, we can keep demanding better financial education, however and whenever possible. And that the banks at least try to employ a better-functioning moral barometer.

Dell Technologies serves 98 percent of the Fortune 500 and comprises several market leading businesses. The two largest, and most well-known, are the Dell client solutions business and the Dell EMC infrastructure solutions business – both of which are supported by Dell EMC Services. In addition, Dell Technologies contains Boomi, Pivotal, RSA, SecureWorks, Virtustream and VMware. This unique structure combines the focus and innovation of a startup with the global scale and service of a large enterprise. Dell Technologies’ scale will enable it to deliver more innovation and investment in R&D, sales and marketing, services and support and deliver more efficient and cost-effective solutions for customers. Furthermore, while the company will publically report its financial results, it is privately controlled, enabling it to better focus investments on its customer and partner ecosystem over the long term. According to the Chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, Michael Dell, "We are at the dawn of the next industrial revolution. Our world is becoming more intelligent and more connected by the minute, and ultimately will become intertwined with a vast Internet of Things, paving the way for our customers to do incredible things. This is why we created Dell Technologies. We have the products, services, talent and global scale to be a catalyst for change and guide customers, large and small, on their digital journey." Dell Technologies blends Dell’s go-to-market strength with small business and mid-market customers and EMC’s strength with large enterprises and stands as a market leader in many of the most important and high-growth areas of the $2 trillion information technology market, including positions as a “Leader” in 20 Gartner Magic Quadrants and a portfolio of more than 20,000 patents and applications. Also commenting on the historic merger, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon noted that financial services is one of the first-movers in embracing technology to better serve their customers. “As one of the world’s biggest users of Dell and EMC, we spend approximately $9 billion a year on technology, infrastructure, cloud computing, big data analytics and cybersecurity. I'm thrilled for Michael and the new company, and we are eager to see everything they create in the future,” he said. Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO, Salesforce, added, “Salesforce’s partnership with Dell and EMC has been instrumental in pushing innovation across the industry. Michael is an incredible visionary and one of the most important leaders in our industry. He has been an amazing partner contributing to our success. Now with Dell Technologies, he is once again reshaping the technology industry." When the transaction closed on September 7, 2016, EMC shareholders received $24.05 per share in cash in addition to tracking stock linked to a portion of EMC’s economic interest in the VMware business. Based on the estimated number of EMC shares outstanding at close, EMC shareholders received 0.11146 shares of new tracking stock (NYSE: DVMT) for each EMC share. The value of the tracking stock may vary from the market price of VMware given the different characteristics and rights of the two stocks.

(Ryan Remiorz/THE CANADIAN PRESS) Sears Canada swings to loss as sales tumble 15.6% Add to ... Reuters Published Wednesday, Sep. 07, 2016 7:28AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Sep. 07, 2016 11:03AM EDT Comments AA Department store operator Sears Canada Inc reported a quarterly loss, compared with a year-earlier profit, hurt by a 15.6 per cent fall in sales. The company said same-store sales fell 5.5 per cent as traffic for big-ticket items such as major appliances fell due to termination of a credit card agreement and lower-than-expected sales of new merchandise launched in spring. Bank of Nova Scotia said in October it would buy JPMorgan & Chase Co’s Canadian credit card portfolio associated with Sears Canada. Sears Canada, hit by increasing competition from U.S. retail giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, has been shutting down stores and cutting jobs. The company said it cut $128-million in costs for the first half of this year and said it was planning cost cuts at the higher end of its previously announced $127-million-$155-million forecast. Sears Canada posted a net loss of $91.6-million, or 90 cents per share, for the second quarter ended July 30, compared with a profit of $13.5-million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-earlier quarter included a gain of $67.2-million as a result of sale-and-leaseback transactions. Revenue fell to $648.5-million from $768.8-million.
