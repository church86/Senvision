The emergency deal, orchestrated by Mediobanca and JPMorgan, to save the 544-year-old bank, will incur about 250 million euros in underwriting fees for a proposed 5 billion euro capital hike, according to three sources involved in the deal. That comes on top of nearly 400 million euros the bank has paid in the past two years for other capital hikes. There is no certainty the proposed rescue plan will proceed, but if it is carried out successfully, investment banks working with Monte dei Paschi will have generated a payday of close to 1 billion euros over the past three years, though the bank’s market value currently stands at 747 million euros. “The scale of fees that potentially are there in the Italian banking market – from restructurings and consolidation – are substantial,” said Peter Hahn, professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking & Finance. Monte dei Paschi emerged as the worst performer in European stress tests on July 29 and Italy’s largest lender, UniCredit , was also among the banks which fared badly. Monte dei Paschi’s poor showing in the tests – which predicted its capital would be wiped out if there was a severe economic downturn – came despite it tapping investors for cash twice since 2014. Last year the bank paid 130 million euros to a pool of banks for a 3 billion euro cash call. In 2014 it spent more than any other company in Europe on investment banking fees, paying advisers nearly $304 million for its 5 billion capital hike, according to Thomson Reuters data. By contrast Deutsche Bank paid about 119 million euros ($133.18 million) in 2014 to underwriters for its 8 billion euro capital hike, according to the prospectus for its rights issue. A spokeswoman for Monte dei Paschi declined to comment for this story. If successful, the bank’s rescue plan will see even higher fees as it involves the creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to hoover up Monte dei Paschi’s bad loans. That part of the plan could net banks up to 300 million euros, sources said, pointing to the need for a 6 billion euro syndicated bridge loan to provide financing to the special purpose vehicle to begin buying up the debt. A bridge loan – which Monte dei Paschi said in its turnaround plan is a possibility – is seen by sources as inevitable since the timetable to split the Tuscan lender into a good and bad bank and simultaneously raise cash is too tight. Monte dei Paschi and its global coordinators JPMorgan and Mediobanca aim to carry out the cash call by the end of the year, most likely in November, the sources said. JPMorgan and Mediobanca declined to comment for this article. RISKY DEAL The large bill reflects the risk that the deal will not happen because investors are reluctant to sign up to the capital increase due to Monte dei Paschi’s history of failed turnaround plans, uncertain market conditions and fear of increased exposure to the euro zone’s third largest economy. “It is way more expensive than any other equity capital markets (ECM) deal in Europe because of the risk profile of the transaction,” said a London-based analyst who stressed the “country risk” adds to the operational complexity of the transaction. The bank has said it would plug capital shortfalls and restore its health by splitting into a good and bad bank. The plan envisages the sale of 9.2 billion euros in bad loans and a 5 billion-euro capital increase. But none of the dozens of banks contacted by the troubled lender in recent weeks to form an underwriting consortium have made firm commitments to guarantee its proposed 5 billion euro cap hike, sources said. Mediobanca Chief Executive Alberto Nagel said on Friday “this is a pre-underwriting agreement which by definition is not a hard underwriting and is not a commitment.” The lack of commitment means the plan can still fall apart. Any failure of the world’s oldest bank would damage the entire Italian banking system and could spark contagion across Europe so Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s government has pressured Italian and international investment banks to make the rescue work, sources said. A spokesman for the Italian government, however, told Reuters he was not aware of any pressure on banks. The government does not want to mount its own rescue because European rules say this would mean imposing losses on bondholders and depositors above 100,000 euros. The absence of financial support from the government also pushes up the size of the fees. Freeman consulting estimates the fees will be between 2.5 and 4 percent of the overall equity raised compared to 0.5 to 1 percent if the government were to intervene. Adding to the overall uncertainty in Italy is a referendum on constitutional reform that Renzi called for October. He has said he will stand down if he loses support – a gamble that could revive market turbulence in Italy just before the planned November cash call. FIGHTING FOR BUSINESS For large investment banks Monte dei Paschi is seen as a portal to other lucrative deals including the upcoming capital hike for UniCredit. “Industries that restructure and reconfigure create lots of fees and it’s important to be there,” said Hahn. Until June, UBS and Citigroup had acted as Monte dei Paschi’s main advisors. For the past two years they have tried to find the bank a merger partner without success. The Swiss bank, under its charismatic investment bank president Andrea Orcel, also acted as global coordinator for Monte dei Paschi’s previous capital hikes in 2014 and 2015. However JPMorgan, whose lending, trading and investing activities in Italy amounted to $6.8 billion in 2015, won government’s support for its rescue plan in July, along with Mediobanca, after its chief executive Jamie Dimon met Renzi in Rome, sources said. As a result, the U.S. bank – which has Italy’s former finance minister Vittorio Grilli as chairman of its corporate and investment bank in Europe, the Middle East and Africa – will be one of the top earners in Monte dei Paschi’s overhaul if the plan goes ahead, sources said. It has offered to arrange a 6 billion euro syndicated bridge loan to help Monte dei Paschi gain breathing space to engineer the securitization of its bad loans while seeking to raise cash. Banks which sign up to the loan will end up holding chunks of Monte dei Paschi’s debt if they fail to find investors – a risk that JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon says he is willing to take. “If we could pull something like that off, that would be great for Italy,” he said in a CNBC interview.

Now that prices have gone bust, the banks are reaping a bounty of fees underwriting stock sales for financially distressed energy producers, which in turn are using the proceeds to pay down their loans. And here's the kicker: Some of those oil companies are already taking out fresh loans -- often from the same banks -- to pay for new drilling projects. The episode highlights the role big banks have played as handmaidens in the oil and gas industry's latest boom-and-bust cycle, while demonstrating their ability to profit in downturns as well as upturns. For the energy markets, the recent flurry of fund-raising could delay a shakeout among crude producers, helping them to maintain output and raising the specter of prolonged prices below $45 a barrel. "Wall Street has an exceptional business model," said Brad Hintz, a former Morgan Stanley treasurer and bank analyst who's now an adjunct finance professor at New York University. "It collects fees from its corporate clients in both fat and lean times." The benefit to banks' bottom lines showed up this month, when JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup all beat analysts' estimates for second-quarter results. The surprise, according to executives, came at least partly because the lenders didn't need to sock away as much money as expected to cover energy-loan losses. While oil prices have rallied from as low as $26 in February, a big driver was the producers' newfound ability to raise money in capital markets, following a drought in investor demand earlier in the year, Citigroup CFO John Gerspach told analysts on a July 15 conference call. In some cases, the companies used stock-sale proceeds to pay down loans. In other cases, the added capital simply made it easier for banks to reclassify distressed borrowers as healthy. Southwestern Energy , a natural-gas producer that's lost $6.4 billion in the last six quarters, raised $1.25 billion in June through a stock sale managed by Credit Suisse , Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo , among others. Most of the firms were members of lender consortiums that previously had provided Southwestern with as much as $2.75 billion of loans and credit lines. The banks also helped underwrite share offerings for Diamondback Energy , Callon Petroleum , Pioneer Natural Resources , Parsley Energy and QEP Resources , regulatory filings show. In all, Wall Street firms have sold more than $24 billion of stock on behalf of oil and gas companies this year, Hintz estimates. Based on a typical commission of at least 3% for a follow-on stock offering, that works out to more than $720 million of fees. The surge in offerings was made possible partly by the recent rally in stock markets, which in turn was fueled by speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks will delay raising interest rates -- or in some cases cut them -- to maintain economic growth. Many investors are also betting that the worst is over for oil-company stocks. "Things are freeing up a little bit," Wells Fargo CFO John Shrewsberry told analysts on a July 15 conference call. "There's a lot more access to capital among energy companies today, of all forms," including junk-bond sales. U.S. stock offerings, which tumbled 41% in the second quarter versus a year earlier, were up an estimated 67% in July, Morgan Stanley estimated. Wall Street firms' role as both lenders and underwriters dates to the 1999 repeal of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which barred commercial banks from selling stocks and corporate bonds. One of the chief goals of the original law was to keep banks from "issuing stock to the unsuspecting public to raise money so they could repay their loans," said Rajesh Narayanan, chair of the finance department at Louisiana State University.© TheStreet How Wall Street Made Millions From Big Oil's Boom -- And Its Bust While there's no evidence that such conflicts of interest are occurring now, it's indisputable that banks are benefitting from their ability to offer just about any financial service a company might need, Narayanan said. (Both the Democratic and Republican parties have called for reinstating Glass-Steagall, as a way of shrinking the power of big banks and curbing their risk-taking.) "We've set up financial institutions that are essentially one-stop shopping for corporations," said Samuel Hayes, a professor emeritus of investment banking at Harvard Business School. "If they're not in a position to take on more debt, the banks are ready to sell them equity." In an e-mail, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jessica Ong said that the choice of underwriter is "always at the discretion of the customer," noting that the San Francisco-based bank has been serving the energy industry for decades. She declined to discuss specific companies. The other banks declined to comment, while Southwestern executives didn't respond to requests for comment. For an example of how Wall Street's business model works in practice, take the case of Spring, Texas-based Southwestern. Started 87 years ago as a gas utility, the company in recent decades has morphed itself into the third-largest natural-gas producer in the continental U.S., largely through its use of a drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Much of that drilling was financed with borrowings. Southwestern's long-term debt load swelled 47-fold in the decade through 2015. Milestones included a $2 billion credit line in 2013, $5 billion of acquisition financing in 2014 and at least $3.8 billion of bond sales along the way. Then last year, as oil and gas prices swooned, the company posted a $4.67 billion net loss. In February, Moody's Investors Service slashed Southwestern's credit rating to junk-grade, citing the company's high debt load. Southwestern warned in an annual report in February that further downgrades could lead to a liquidity squeeze, and that a prolonged period of low natural-gas prices might force the company to refinance debt, issue new shares or dispose of assets. Or all of the above. "We cannot assure that any such proposed offering, refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed or, if completed, that the terms will be favorable to us," the company said. Enter the bankers. On June 27, Southwestern announced that it had reached a debt-refinancing accord with lenders led by Bank of America and JPMorgan, including $2.7 billion of loans that won't come due until 2020. Two days later, the company launched a stock offering that ultimately placed about 99 million shares -- a 26% increase to its base. The purpose was to raise money to repay a portion of the bank loans and buy back $750 million of bonds, according to Southwestern regulatory filings. Then on a July 22 conference call, executives announced they would use about $500 million from the stock offering to reactivate drilling rigs on key properties, a move that should provide a significant bump to 2017 production, relative to prior expectations. Even with the dilution from the stock offering, Southwestern's investors have cheered its strengthened financial position: The shares have climbed 77% this year. (They're still off more than two-thirds from a 2014 high.) Bill Way, Southwestern's CEO since January, took advantage of the conference call to thank his investors -- and bankers. "We were in an early spot that was difficult, in a terrible commodity price environment, and they supported us as we navigated forward," he said, according to a company transcript.

Credit Greg Kahn for The New York Times How Think Tanks Amplify Corporate America’s Influence Think tanks are seen as independent, but their scholars often push donors’ agendas, amplifying a culture of corporate influence in Washington. By ERIC LIPTON and BROOKE WILLIAMSAUG. 7, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — As Lennar Corporation, one of the nation’s largest home builders, pushed ahead with an $8 billion plan to revitalize a barren swath of San Francisco, it found a trusted voice to vouch for its work: the Brookings Institution, the most prestigious think tank in the world. “This can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,” Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar’s different divisions. The think tank began to aggressively promote the project, San Francisco’s biggest redevelopment effort since its recovery from the 1906 earthquake, and later offered to help Lennar, a publicly traded company, “engage with national media to develop stories that highlight Lennar’s innovative approach.” And Brookings went further. It named Kofi Bonner, the Lennar executive in charge of the San Francisco development, as a senior fellow — an enviable credential he used to advance the company’s efforts.

Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Think tanks, which position themselves as “universities without students,” have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence between Brookings and other donors — like JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank; K.K.R., the global investment firm; Microsoft, the software giant; and Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate — show that financial support often came with assurances from Brookings that it would provide “donation benefits,” including setting up events featuring corporate executives with government officials, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. Video ‘This Is Thinly Disguised Lobbying’ Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, explains how some think tanks engage in “thinly disguised lobbying” to influence lawmakers. By A.J. CHAVAR and ERIC LIPTON on Publish Date August 7, 2016. . Watch in Times Video » embed “This is about giant corporations who figured out that by spending, hey, a few tens of millions of dollars, if they can influence outcomes here in Washington, they can make billions of dollars,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, a frequent critic of undisclosed Wall Street donations to think tanks. Washington has seen a proliferation of think tanks, particularly small institutions with narrow interests tied to specific industries. At the same time, the brand names of the field have experienced explosive growth. Brookings’s annual budget has doubled in the last decade, to $100 million. The American Enterprise Institute is spending at least $80 million on a new headquarters in Washington, not far from where the Center for Strategic and International Studies built a $100 million office tower. The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media. “Wouldn’t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the post-World War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, ‘Here is $1 million; spend it how you wish,’” Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview. Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development. “We do not compromise our integrity,” said Martin S. Indyk, Brookings’s executive vice president. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the “appearance of a conflict of interest.” And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions. At think tanks like Brookings, the majority of reports and events, with titles like “Five Evils: Multidimensional Poverty and Race in America” or “India at the Global High Table,” have no obvious link to corporate donors. Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions. When think tank scholars testify before Congress or speak at other public events, the public is often not aware of the financial relationships between these scholars and for-profit companies. The New England Center for Investigative Reporting and The New York Times looked at some of these conflicts. Video by The Eye, from NECIR The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution’s history. Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services. “People think of think tanks as do-gooders, uncompromised and not bought like others in the political class,” said Bill Goodfellow, the executive director of the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank. “But it’s absurd to suggest that donors don’t have influence. The danger is we in the think tank world are being corrupted in the same way as the political world. And all of us should be worried about it.” A group of Democratic state attorneys general is investigating whether Exxon Mobil worked with certain think tanks in past decades to cover up its understanding of fossil fuels’ impact on climate change, in part by financing reports questioning the science, a suggestion the company rejects. OPEN Document Document: Brookings Institution and Its Corporate Donors Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars’ independent conclusions. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We strongly believe in our model of seeking solutions to some of our country’s most difficult problems,” John J. Hamre, the chief executive at C.S.I.S., said in a written reply to questions. “We gather stakeholders, vet ideas, find areas of agreement and highlight areas of disagreement.” Yet researchers at think tanks are seeing corporate influence firsthand. Rachel Stohl, a senior associate at the Stimson Center in Washington, said she had been quizzed by potential donors as she tried to raise money for research on the military’s use of armed drones. “‘Are you going to say drones are bad?’” she recalled one potential financial backer asking. “‘We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad.’” Donations and Rewards The confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer. The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings’s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions. Photo The Brookings Institution, which operates on a $100 million annual budget, twice what it was a decade ago. Credit Greg Kahn for The New York Times The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs — both critical parts of its business — and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries. In 2004, Brookings established its Metropolitan Policy Program, devised to stimulate economic growth in cities. As the country was emerging from recession, Brookings bolstered its ties to corporate donors in 2010 by naming Marek Gootman, a lobbyist from Patton Boggs, as its first director of strategic partnerships. He was assigned to work with “a national network of elected, business and civic leaders engaged in city and metropolitan area policy development and implementation.” From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Donations to the program exploded, from $4.3 million in 2005 to $12.5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings’s overall program spending that year. K.K.R., after starting special funds around 2010 to invest in real estate and other infrastructure projects, donated $450,000 to Brookings, some of it as the institution agreed to set up meetings for a top K.K.R. executive with community leaders in Philadelphia and Detroit, where the company was considering real estate projects. Brookings separately produced a report, published on K.K.R.’s website, promoting one of the company’s infrastructure projects in New Jersey, after the company executive suggested such a piece. In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a co-chairman of K.K.R., one memo marked as confidential noted: “K.K.R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on 3/27/2014 for $150K to Metro; Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund.” The tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between “unrestricted” donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and project-based funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in.

Formerly a lobbyist at Patton Boggs, Mr. Gootman was appointed in 2010 as Brookings’s first director of strategic partnerships. Credit Erin Hull for The New York Times Lennar joined Brookings’s Metropolitan Leadership Council, established for the program’s top donors, in July 2010. That month, the company won approval to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco, turning the area into a more than 700-acre mix of housing, education and commercial development. Brookings would later name the project one of the three most “transformative investments in the United States.” The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard. Lennar joined with Brookings as protests were escalating in 2010. One complaint, filed by area residents with the Environmental Protection Agency, said the San Francisco Health Department was “conspiring with Lennar Corporation to conceal the health threats of asbestos-laden dust.” The company was busy at the time looking for investors to help it complete the project, known as the San Francisco Shipyard. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of self-interest — and said the alliance was not related to the protests. “There was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to ‘buy’ from Brookings,” Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project. “San Francisco’s Shipyard project is both physically and economically transformative for the Bay Area and globally significant,” Mr. Katz, the Brookings vice president, said in a news release issued by San Francisco’s mayor in 2011 as Lennar’s hunt for major investors intensified. “This project promises to set a new paradigm for successfully conceiving, financing and delivering transformative infrastructure projects in the United States.” Follow-up memos were more explicit: Brookings, as it sought an additional $50,000 from Lennar in 2014, said it was prepared to “use our convening power, research expertise, network connections and knowledge of innovative practices to help further drive the ultimate impact and success” of Lennar’s project and to “provide public validation of San Francisco’s efforts through national and local media coverage.” The think tank soon delivered. Photo In a July 2014 document, Brookings sought more money from Lennar while offering to help with its San Francisco project. Mr. Katz made appearances alongside Mr. Bonner, the Lennar executive, to promote the project to government officials and business leaders in California. In 2014, around the time the think tank sought an additional round of money from Lennar, Brookings invited its new nonresident senior fellow, Mr. Bonner, who has a master’s degree in architecture and is a former government planner for several California cities, to appear at an event at its headquarters. “I am working in San Francisco in a fabulous property,” Mr. Bonner said at the event, referring to Lennar’s Shipyard project. In March, at a conference of real estate developers and investors in Cannes, France, Lennar sponsored a session in which Brookings researchers helped the company highlight the Shipyard. “Kofi is what I would describe as the quintessential city builder,” Julie Wagner, a Brookings nonresident senior fellow, said as she introduced Mr. Bonner at an event where projects with no connection to donors were also featured. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At least some of the $400,000 Lennar has donated to Brookings since 2010 has come from its SunStreet Energy division, which sells rooftop solar systems, at the same time that Brookings’s metropolitan program has published research on the rooftop solar industry. Mr. Indyk said the collaboration simply reflected shared goals of revitalizing cities. Brookings scholars promoted other real estate projects, he said, involving local governments, universities or even developers that were not donors — including one in Detroit backed by Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, and one in Seattle backed by Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft. But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had “created the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title.” His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed. Photo Martin S. Indyk, the Brookings Institution’s executive vice president, said the think tank’s collaboration with Lennar to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco reflected a shared goal to revitalize cities. “We do not compromise our integrity,” he said. Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times Hitachi has been another large donor to the metropolitan program, giving a total of $1.8 million to Brookings over the last decade, according to Brookings documents. The think tank reviewed the company’s corporate marketing and sales strategy targeting the United States, an internal memo shows. Brookings also organized public events that featured top Obama administration officials and allowed Hitachi executives to promote their products. “Metro has held nine meetings and several conference calls in the past six months with executives from Hitachi’s water, transportation and data business lines and are collaborating more fully on defining what it means to be a ‘Smart City,’” a confidential Brookings memo said. Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company’s position. “Helping a corporation’s for-profit agenda is not in any way our agenda,” Ms. Churches, the managing director, said. Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was “inelegant,” although not improper. When asked if the documents read like a fee-for-service agreement, she said, “It could be misconstrued.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that “today, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents.” ‘Growing the Economy’ When JPMorgan offered a major donation to the metropolitan program in 2011, Brookings created the Global Cities Initiative, complete with a new logo that called it a “joint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase.” The project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times In contract documents, Brookings emphasized that it would control the conclusions of its reports and said it would “not directly or indirectly communicate with any party” to help get JPMorgan business. Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda. “This was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,” said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. “We believe it’s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved.” At the same time, hundreds of pages of memos — status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money — make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities. “Bottom line: Growing metro economies is good for the nation and for JPMC; also, many U.S. cities are JPMC clients — motivation to support them and their clients,” said one Brookings document dated July 2011, as officials from the think tank met with top bank executives to discuss a planned donation that eventually totaled $15 million. The Global Cities Initiative, another document written by a Brookings senior fellow explained, “must mean a marriage between JPMC corporate interests” and “Brookings continued thought leadership.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story JPMorgan, in a document dated a month before the agreement was signed, said the pending donation to Brookings “deepens/extends relationships with important client base among business and civic leaders both in the U.S. and abroad.” And Brookings was ready to do its part. “Our events, which in part target these audiences,” said an internal 2014 Brookings memo, referring to the Global Cities Initiative and federal and state leaders, “have yielded 100+ media hits, with 97% of them referencing GCI and 90% referencing JPMorgan; by the end of this year, we will have held events in 13 domestic markets and 9 international markets.” At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank. Photo One of hundreds of documents detailing confidential discussions between Brookings and JPMorgan in 2011 as the parties were negotiating a $10 million gift for the Global Cities Initiative. “No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,” said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank’s executives. “We need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.” It remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank’s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal. “If the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it’s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,” Mr. Scher said in a statement. Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank’s work benefits the public good, not a company’s bottom line. But two lawyers who specialize in nonprofit law — Miranda Perry Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, and Clifford Perlman, a partner at a New York-based firm — said Brookings’s agreements raised questions. “Tax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,” Ms. Fleischer said. “And the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Indyk said that opinion was “totally unfounded,” noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems. “Brookings’s conclusion that all of these activities it engaged in with these donors primarily benefited the public rather than the donors is consistent with the applicable federal tax standards,” Douglas Varley, one of the lawyers for Brookings, said in a statement. Close Partnerships Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas. FedEx teamed up with the Atlantic Council — a think tank that focuses on international relations, with annual revenue that has surged to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade — to build support for a free-trade agreement the company hoped would increase business. OPEN Document Document: Atlantic Council and Corporate Donors Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool. “The impact and reach of the report would be maximized by a rollout event” including a “public report launch with member(s) of Congress from one of the relevant committees,” said a two-page summary drafted by the Atlantic Council months before the study was completed. FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to “emphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses.” When the report came out in late 2014, its conclusions mirrored arguments FedEx had been aggressively pushing on Capitol Hill, including recommending a reduction in trans-Atlantic tariffs and allowing more duty-free shipments. An executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “This is very exciting,” Mr. Subramaniam said at the event, referring to the potential for more trade. “The upside opportunity is quite large.” Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research. Photo A 2013 Atlantic Council brochure detailed the benefits of membership in the think tank’s corporate program. “There is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,” Mr. Kempe said. ‘We Do Not Lobby’ General Atomics, the California-based manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition. “When the budgets are going down in the U.S., you would like to be able to export more,” Frank Pace, the president of the company’s aircraft systems group, told a Reuters reporter in late 2013 at an air show in Dubai. At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports. While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics’s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small — in the tens of thousands of dollars. C.S.I.S. set up confidential meetings at its headquarters with company representatives, inviting top officials from the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the State Department and the office of the defense secretary, according to emails and other documents obtained by The Times through open records requests. OPEN Document Document: C.S.I.S. and the Military Drone Maker “Our series will be unique in convening a much broader group of stakeholders than is typical,” Samuel J. Brannen, the think tank’s lead scholar, wrote in an email to Aaron W. Jost, one of the State Department officials in charge of regulating drone exports. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear. “Political obstacles to export,” read the agenda of one closed-door “working group” meeting organized by Mr. Brannen that included Tom Rice, a lobbyist in General Atomics’s Washington office, on the invitation lists, the emails show. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C.S.I.S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry’s priorities. “I came out strongly in support of export,” Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls. But the effort did not stop there. Mr. Brannen initiated meetings with Defense Department officials and congressional staff to push for the recommendations, which also included setting up a new Pentagon office to give more focus to acquisition and deployment of drones. The center also stressed the need to ease export limits at a conference it hosted at its headquarters featuring top officials from the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps. Mr. Brannen, who has since left C.S.I.S., declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying. “C.S.I.S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,” Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. “We do not lobby.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story One thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics. Photo A Predator drone manufactured by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. General Atomics helped fund a study that led the United States to ease restrictions on sales of drones to governments overseas. Credit Sandy Huffaker for The New York Times In February 2015, almost one year after the C.S.I.S. report was issued, the State Department announced a clarification of its rules, easing final approval that month for General Atomics’s long-planned sale of unarmed Predator drones to the United Arab Emirates, the first such sale to a non-NATO nation. The think tank report was just one of many voices pushing for the change. A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, “at the end of the day, this is a considered U.S. government policy.” Huntington Ingalls Industries had an equally clear objective: to create an elaborate public relations and lobbying campaign to convince Congress that the nation needed to confront an emerging threat from China by building more nuclear-powered aircraft carriers — at a cost of about $11 billion each. The clear beneficiary? Huntington, the lone builder of the ships. As part of a broader communications effort, Huntington helped finance a think tank report that enhanced the company’s argument for more funding. Bryan McGrath, a former naval officer who had commanded a guided-missile destroyer, approached Huntington Ingalls and offered to write a study on a fee-for-service basis as a private industry expert. The company turned down his offer. Later, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested. “A think tank has more prestige,” Mr. McGrath said. Huntington Ingalls paid $100,000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research. Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion. “The Hudson Center makes no secret about being very pro-sea power,” he said. “If a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story In exchange for Huntington Ingalls’s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said. OPEN Document Document: The Aircraft Carrier Industry’s Lobbying and Think Tank Plan “We have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,” Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company’s suggestions. The report was released in October at the Rayburn House Office Building. Mr. McGrath received an introduction from one of the industry’s most important boosters, Representative J. Randy Forbes, Republican of Virginia, the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee that oversees the Navy. The report did not mention that Huntington Ingalls had helped pay for it. Asked about the failure to disclose the contribution, John P. Walters, Hudson’s chief operating officer, called it a mistake. The report was subsequently revised — months after it was released and the congressional event held — to disclose the donation. A second industry-funded report, prepared by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, came out a month later with a similar urgent call for more money to build more ships and to base more ships abroad, although it did not mention that it had been funded by the Navy League of the United States, a nonprofit group whose large corporate donors include Huntington Ingalls. “This report is yet another important tool for Navy Leaguers to use in the field when educating local leaders and lawmakers,” Skip Witunski, the Navy League president, wrote to the group’s members late last year. The strategy — lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other — was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and op-ed pieces. Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of industry-funded work might be threatening the integrity of the process. “I see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,” Mr. McGrath said, “and I got to scratch my head and say, ‘That guy must be on the payroll.’” Brooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

The emergency deal, orchestrated by Mediobanca and JPMorgan, to save the 544-year-old bank, will incur about 250 million euros ($278.43 million) in underwriting fees for a proposed 5 billion euro capital hike, according to three sources involved in the deal. That comes on top of nearly 400 million euros the bank has paid in the past two years for other capital hikes. There is no certainty the proposed rescue plan will proceed, but if it is carried out successfully, investment banks working with Monte dei Paschi will have generated a payday of close to 1 billion euros over the past three years, though the bank's market value currently stands at 747 million euros. "The scale of fees that potentially are there in the Italian banking market – from restructurings and consolidation – are substantial," said Peter Hahn, professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking & Finance. Monte dei Paschi emerged as the worst performer in European stress tests on July 29 and Italy's largest lender, UniCredit , was also among the banks which fared badly. Monte dei Paschi's poor showing in the tests - which predicted its capital would be wiped out if there was a severe economic downturn - came despite it tapping investors for cash twice since 2014. Last year the bank paid 130 million euros to a pool of banks for a 3 billion euro cash call. In 2014 it spent more than any other company in Europe on investment banking fees, paying advisers nearly $304 million for its 5 billion capital hike, according to Thomson Reuters data. By contrast Deutsche Bank paid about 119 million euros ($133.18 million) in 2014 to underwriters for its 8 billion euro capital hike, according to the prospectus for its rights issue. A spokeswoman for Monte dei Paschi declined to comment for this story. If successful, the bank's rescue plan will see even higher fees as it involves the creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to hoover up Monte dei Paschi's bad loans. That part of the plan could net banks up to 300 million euros, sources said, pointing to the need for a 6 billion euro syndicated bridge loan to provide financing to the special purpose vehicle to begin buying up the debt. A bridge loan - which Monte dei Paschi said in its turnaround plan is a possibility - is seen by sources as inevitable since the timetable to split the Tuscan lender into a good and bad bank and simultaneously raise cash is too tight. Monte dei Paschi and its global coordinators JPMorgan and Mediobanca aim to carry out the cash call by the end of the year, most likely in November, the sources said. JPMorgan and Mediobanca declined to comment for this article. RISKY DEAL The large bill reflects the risk that the deal will not happen because investors are reluctant to sign up to the capital increase due to Monte dei Paschi's history of failed turnaround plans, uncertain market conditions and fear of increased exposure to the euro zone's third largest economy. "It is way more expensive than any other equity capital markets (ECM) deal in Europe because of the risk profile of the transaction," said a London-based analyst who stressed the "country risk" adds to the operational complexity of the transaction. The bank has said it would plug capital shortfalls and restore its health by splitting into a good and bad bank. The plan envisages the sale of 9.2 billion euros in bad loans and a 5 billion-euro capital increase. But none of the dozens of banks contacted by the troubled lender in recent weeks to form an underwriting consortium have made firm commitments to guarantee its proposed 5 billion euro cap hike, sources said. Mediobanca Chief Executive Alberto Nagel said on Friday "this is a pre-underwriting agreement which by definition is not a hard underwriting and is not a commitment." The lack of commitment means the plan can still fall apart. Any failure of the world's oldest bank would damage the entire Italian banking system and could spark contagion across Europe so Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government has pressured Italian and international investment banks to make the rescue work, sources said. A spokesman for the Italian government, however, told Reuters he was not aware of any pressure on banks. The government does not want to mount its own rescue because European rules say this would mean imposing losses on bondholders and depositors above 100,000 euros. The absence of financial support from the government also pushes up the size of the fees. Freeman consulting estimates the fees will be between 2.5 and 4 percent of the overall equity raised compared to 0.5 to 1 percent if the government were to intervene. Adding to the overall uncertainty in Italy is a referendum on constitutional reform that Renzi called for October. He has said he will stand down if he loses support - a gamble that could revive market turbulence in Italy just before the planned November cash call. FIGHTING FOR BUSINESS For large investment banks Monte dei Paschi is seen as a portal to other lucrative deals including the upcoming capital hike for UniCredit. "Industries that restructure and reconfigure create lots of fees and it's important to be there," said Hahn. Until June, UBS and Citigroup had acted as Monte dei Paschi's main advisors. For the past two years they have tried to find the bank a merger partner without success. The Swiss bank, under its charismatic investment bank president Andrea Orcel, also acted as global coordinator for Monte dei Paschi's previous capital hikes in 2014 and 2015. However JPMorgan, whose lending, trading and investing activities in Italy amounted to $6.8 billion in 2015, won government's support for its rescue plan in July, along with Mediobanca, after its chief executive Jamie Dimon met Renzi in Rome, sources said. As a result, the U.S. bank - which has Italy's former finance minister Vittorio Grilli as chairman of its corporate and investment bank in Europe, the Middle East and Africa - will be one of the top earners in Monte dei Paschi's overhaul if the plan goes ahead, sources said. It has offered to arrange a 6 billion euro syndicated bridge loan to help Monte dei Paschi gain breathing space to engineer the securitization of its bad loans while seeking to raise cash. Banks which sign up to the loan will end up holding chunks of Monte dei Paschi's debt if they fail to find investors - a risk that JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon says he is willing to take.     "If we could pull something like that off, that would be great for Italy," he said in a CNBC interview.    (Additional reporting by Silvia Aloisi and Giselda Vagnoni; Editing by Anna Willard) Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next JPMorgan has made an important hire from Goldman Sachs, and it hints at the future of trading Business Insider 'Russians, Americans and Turks' trying to destroy Europe: top MEP AFP Zidane praises Real's fighting spirit in Europe Reuters Germany amused by French candidate Fillon's Cold War map AFP Generali to exit weaker markets, cut costs Reuters ‘Are y’all ready to die?’ Chattanooga bus driver reportedly asked children before crash Yahoo News Who is Betsy DeVos?

The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar’s different divisions. The think tank began to aggressively promote the project, San Francisco’s biggest redevelopment effort since its recovery from the 1906 earthquake, and later offered to help Lennar “engage with national media to develop stories that highlight Lennar’s innovative approach.” And Brookings went further. It named Kofi Bonner, the Lennar executive in charge of the San Francisco development, as a senior fellow in 2014 — an enviable credential he used to advance the company’s efforts. Think tanks, which position themselves as “universities without students,” have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status. Thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence between Brookings and other donors — like JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank; KKR, the global investment firm; Microsoft, the software giant; and Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate — show that financial support often came with assurances from Brookings that it would provide “donation benefits,” including setting up events featuring corporate executives with government officials, according to documents obtained by the New York Times and the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. “This is about giant corporations who figured out that by spending, hey, a few tens of millions of dollars, if they can influence outcomes here in Washington, they can make billions of dollars,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a frequent critic of undisclosed Wall Street donations to think tanks. Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development. “We do not compromise our integrity,” said Martin Indyk, Brookings’s executive vice president. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact.” But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the “appearance of a conflict of interest.” Bonner declined to be interviewed, and his post at Brookings, which was unpaid, was not renewed. At think tanks like Brookings, the majority of reports and events, with titles like “Five Evils: Multidimensional Poverty and Race in America” or “India at the Global High Table,” have no obvious link to corporate donors. Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions. The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution’s history. Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services. “People think of think tanks as do-gooders, uncompromised and not bought like others in the political class,” said Bill Goodfellow, the executive director of the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank. “But it’s absurd to suggest that donors don’t have influence. The danger is we in the think tank world are being corrupted in the same way as the political world. And all of us should be worried about it.” Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars’ independent conclusions. Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank’s work benefits the public good, not a company’s bottom line.

 Tech dealmakers are partying like it's 2000 Portia Crowe and Andy Kiersz Aug. 3, 2016, 10:52 PM 9,964 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters Good news for tech bankers. Revenue from tech mergers and acquisitions, or M&A, has hit its highest level since the height of the dot-com bubble. Global tech M&A revenue has reached $1.9 billion this year, according to Dealogic. The only year when it was higher over the same period was 2000, when it hit $2.2 billion. This year's total is up from $1.7 billion in the same period in 2015 and $1.4 billion in 2014. The biggest beneficiary is JPMorgan, which leads league tables in tech M&A with 20.2% of wallet share. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are in second and third place. Strategic tech M&A in particular is up this year, coming in at $1.1 billion. Financial sponsor-related tech M&A also increased to $349 million from $339 million in the same period last year. Some of the big deals driving this year's revenue are Dell's deal for EMC and SoftBank's for Arm Holdings. Mergers and acquisitions have made up 42% of global tech-banking revenue this year, up from 41% last year, according to Dealogic. While other areas of tech banking, including debt capital markets and syndicated lending, saw revenue increase this year, equity capital markets revenue dropped 44% to $751 million.

DBS Bank last Friday revealed it would increase provisioning for loan losses to half of its $700 million exposure to Swiber. Reuters Print Provisions made for likely losses from loans to oil and gas sector may not be enough Ratings agency Moody's said the three local banks may not have made enough provisions against potential losses from their loans to the hard-pressed oil and gas sector. The warning comes as offshore services company Swiber Holdings defaulted on a coupon payment due on Tuesday, after filing to be placed under judicial management late last week. DBS Bank last Friday also revealed it would increase provisioning for loan losses to half of its $700 million exposure to Swiber. Moody's said in a report yesterday that these developments are "credit negative", noting that DBS's 50 per cent provisioning level in this case far exceeds the 20 per cent in losses that the three banks currently see on their oil and gas loans. "This situation indicates that the current provisioning they make on their oil and gas exposures could prove inadequate, and that the current low credit costs on their oil and gas exposures will rise faster than we had anticipated," it noted. Singapore's three biggest lenders - DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank (UOB) - are the main financing sources for offshore services companies here. Moody's said DBS' substantial upward revision in its provision for its Swiber exposure shows that the deterioration in the oil and gas industry could have a much stronger impact on bank bottom lines. Under a severe stress scenario, DBS would be the worst hit among the three banks, said the report. It noted that close to 60 per cent of DBS' pre-provision income for the second half of this year could be eroded by loan loss provisions while adding a full percentage point to its non-performing loan (NPL) ratio. OCBC and UOB would see losses of 40 to 50 per cent. Moody's added that it could not rule out "the risk of a broader default of a loss severity akin to Swiber", given that it sees the company as representative of the weak financial state that is prevalent across the oil and gas industry. Separately, analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co have also questioned DBS' ability to handle non-performing loans. "The core tenet of DBS' investment thesis is the bank's ability to tide over ongoing NPL cycle better than peers due to shifts in underwriting practices since 2009," said analysts in a report on Wednesday. "The abrupt downgrade of $700 million exposure to Swiber challenges that confidence." The JPMorgan analysts cut their rating on DBS from neutral to overweight and recommended investors sell the bank's stock ahead of its second-quarter earnings release next Monday. Asked by The Straits Times for comment on the report, OCBC said that its group chief executive Samuel Tsien had said at the bank's results briefing last week that the 30 to 40 per cent of the specific provisioning it has taken over the last three quarters are for loans to the oil and gas support services sector. OCBC's NPL ratio for oil and gas loans rose from 7.1 per cent at the end of March to 7.5 per cent. But Mr Tsien added that the group takes a "stringent view in our modelling". "Once it is a substandard asset, we will then assess how much specific provisioning is required by discounting the future comfortable cash flow that the company has, the future value of the collateral, if there's collateral, take a haircut on the collateral, and then decide whether it is still able to cover the loan outstanding. If it does not, that difference is then put into specific provisioning." The unfolding Swiber saga Feb 29, 2016: Swiber announces full-year net loss of US$27.4 million (S$37 million) for 2015, its first loss since listing. July 8: Swiber says completion of its US$710 million offshore field development project in West Africa will be delayed owing to "weakness in the oil and gas sector". It adds that it faces US$4.76 million in outstanding demand letters and is seeking legal advice. July 11: Swiber says London-based private equity firm AMTC did not subscribe to US$200 million preference shares in its wholly owned unit Swiber Investment. July 25: Swiber says it faces $15.2 million in outstanding demand letters, up from US$4.76 million announced previously. 12.58pm, July 27: Swiber halts trading of shares. No reason is given. Last traded price is 10.9 cents. 1.04am, July 28: Swiber announces it filed a winding-up application on July 27. More letters of demand have been received; total is now US$25.9 million as of July 26. 1.33am, July 28: It announces that vice-chairman Francis Wong, director and chief financial officer Leonard Tay, and executive director Nitish Gupta have resigned. 8.36am, July 28: Provisional liquidators ask for trading of shares to be suspended. July 29: It announces suspension of trading of all its outstanding bonds; letters of demand have now swelled to US$50.5 million. Says it has applied to discharge its provisional liquidators and filed to be placed under judicial management instead, after a major financial creditor indicated that they are supportive of judicial management instead of liquidation. Aug 1: Provisional liquidators announce Swiber is unable to pay its coupon payment due Aug 2. Aug 3: Put into interim judicial management; winding-up application withdrawn. tsjwoo@sph.com.sg This article was first published on Aug 5, 2016.

The US Department of Labor report showed that nonfarm payrolls rose by 255,000 last month, far outpacing expectations for a gain of 180,000. While the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.9 percent, it held below the 5 percent mark associated with full employment. The S&P 500 ended at 2,182.87, its eighth closing high of the year, powered by a 1.9 percent gain in financials, which would be primed for a profit boost should the US Federal Reserve raise interest rates. JPMorgan Chase shares gained 2.7 percent to US$66.30 and the financial index closed at its highest level of the year. “This is a flat out strong report; there don’t appear to be any holes whatsoever,” said Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. “But we need to temper enthusiasm, with two straight positive payroll reports everyone is going to shift to the other side of the boat — first the boat was sinking and now everyone is going to think the boat is going to take off,” he said. Employment numbers were weak in April and May, and a surprisingly strong reading in June left investors unsure of the state of the economy. The June employment number was revised to 292,000 from 287,000. The Fed may still wait for GDP growth to improve and inflation to move closer to its 2 percent target before pulling the trigger on an interest rate hike. The probability of a hike doubled to 18 percent for next month after the jobs report and rose to about 46 percent for December, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.04 percent to 18,543.53; the S&P 500 gained 0.86 percent to 2,182.87; and the NASDAQ Composite added 1.06 percent to 5,221.12. The NASDAQ surpassed a record set in July last year. For the week, the Dow rose 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent and the NASDAQ advanced 1.1 percent. Bristol-Myers plunged 16 percent after its lung cancer drug failed in a late-stage study, while Merck, which makes a rival drug, rose 10.4 percent. Bristol-Myers was the biggest drag on the S&P 500, while Merck gave the benchmark index its biggest boost. Kraft Heinz, the company behind Oscar Mayer bologna, Jell-O pudding and Velveeta cheese, also traded higher after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. Its stock rose 3.8 percent. Security software maker FireEye tumbled 12.1 percent after it reported weak sales, cut its forecasts and announced job cuts. Rival software firm Symantec disclosed a larger profit and better sales than expected in its fiscal first quarter, and its full-year profit forecast was stronger than expected. Its stock climbed 4.1 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.64-to-1 ratio; on NASDAQ, a 2.57-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 6.77 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, compared with the 6.58 billion daily average over the past 20 sessions. Additional reporting by AP This story has been viewed 1770 times.

During the period, earnings by Bank SinoPac (永豐銀行), its largest subsidiary, dropped 27.45 percent to NT$4.53 billion. SinoPac Securities Co (永豐金證券) saw net income during the same period surge 32.84 percent to NT$898 million, as the TAIEX began rallying in June to regain a foothold above the 9,000-point benchmark. ACCOMMODATION Airbnb seeks funding Home-sharing company Airbnb Inc is raising US$850 million, according to a disclosure filed with the US state of Delaware. The equity round values the San Francisco-based company at US$30 billion, people told Bloomberg in June. The filing did not disclose who is making the investment. Airbnb has raised about US$3.2 billion in equity since July last year, according to private stock market company Equidate. BANKING JPMorgan denies deal report JPMorgan Chase on Friday denied that it ever intended to buy troubled Italian rival BMPS, as people close to the reported deal had reported. “This is not accurate and was never under consideration,” a JPMorgan spokesperson told reporters. Sources on Wednesday had indicated that Jamie Dimon, chief executive of the largest US bank by assets, and Daniel Pinto, the London-based head of JPMorgan’s investment and finance department, were behind the plan to bail out the Banca Monte Paschi di Siena unveiled last week. BIOTECHNOLOGY AbbVie files arthritis suit Biotechnology drugmaker AbbVie Inc filed a lawsuit seeking to block Amgen Inc from selling a copy of arthritis medicine Humira, its top seller. Amgen’s proposed copy would infringe at least 10 patents, AbbVie said as it reserved the right to assert as many as 51 other patents. It was seeking a court order to prevent Amgen from selling a copy of the biotech drug. AbbVie is trying to protect a rheumatoid arthritis injection whose sales surged 17 percent in the second quarter to US$4.15 billion. OIL Firm sues over US taxes A Norwegian oil company is suing West Virginia’s Marshall County after it says it was denied a refund of almost US$350,000 after overpaying for property taxes. The Intelligencer reported that Statoil filed a lawsuit in circuit court against Marshall County assessor Chris Kessler and West Virginia State tax commissioner Mark Matkovich. The company said the overpayments were the result of a clerical error. Kessler said that although a clerical error might have been initially responsible for the overpayment, the company’s failure to double-check in a timely manner amounts to negligence. ENERGY Duke seeks bids for assets Duke Energy Corp has invited Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc and French utility Engie SA to submit binding bids for its Latin American power assets, people with knowledge of the matter said. State-owned electricity generator China Three Gorges Corp (中國長江三峽集團) was also chosen to proceed to the next round, the people said. This story has been viewed 1950 times. Comments will be moderated.
