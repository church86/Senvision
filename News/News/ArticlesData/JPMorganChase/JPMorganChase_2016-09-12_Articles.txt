Photo: AFP Pacific Investment Management Co’s (PIMCO) Total Return Fund, the world’s biggest actively run debt fund, is trimming its bet on bonds. Total Return cut the duration of its holdings to 5.27 years as of Aug. 31 from 5.44 years at the end of July, based on data on the company Web site. It was the lowest level since May. It also reduced its holdings of US government bonds and related securities last month. US 10-year yields rose on Monday to the highest level since June on speculation the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates before the end of the year. “It’s time for the central bank to move,” JPMorgan Chase & Co chief executive Jamie Dimon said. DoubleLine Capital LP chief investment officer Jeffrey Gundlach said investors should prepare for rising interest rates. The US planned to auction US$12 billion of 30-year bonds yesterday. “Let’s just raise rates,” Dimon said on Monday at the Economic Club of Washington. “The Fed has to maintain credibility. I think it’s time to raise rates. Normality is a good thing, not a bad thing. The return to normal is a good thing.” The 10-year yield fell one basis point to 1.65 percent at 6:47am yesterday in London, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.5 percent security due in August 2026 rose US$0.63 per US$1,000 face value. The Fed cut its benchmark to almost zero about eight years ago, raising the target only once since then to a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent in December last year. In the two decades prior to the December 2008 reduction, the rate averaged about 3.5 percent. Total Return Fund trimmed its holdings of US government and related debt to about 43 percent of assets from about 46 percent, based on the Web site data. PIMCO is “continuing to reduce” its Treasury holdings, said Scott Mather, one of the three managers of the Total Return Fund, which has US$85.8 billion in assets and is based in Newport Beach, California. The firm sees value in inflation-linked debt and mortgage bonds, he said on Bloomberg Television on Aug. 29. The fund’s stake in government securities can include Treasuries and related investments such as inflation-protected bonds, futures contracts and agency debt, PIMCO said. Gundlach said in a Web cast last week fixed-income investors should reduce the duration of their positions and move money into cash. Duration is a measure of a bond’s sensitivity to changes in yield and a smaller figure indicates a more bearish position. “This is a big, big moment,” Gundlach said. “Interest rates have bottomed. They may not rise in the near term as I’ve talked about for years, but I think it’s the beginning of something and you’re supposed to be defensive.” Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Monday said there is no rush to raise rates. Federal Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart repeated on Monday his call for a “serious discussion” about raising interest rates this month. His counterpart in Boston, Eric Rosengren, argued last week there was a reasonable case for gradual tightening. Futures contracts indicate a 22 percent chance the central bank would raise rates when it meets next week and a 57 percent probability of a move by December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Those odds make rising yields increasingly attractive, said Roger Bridges, the chief global strategist for interest rates and currencies at Nikko Asset Management Co’s Australian unit in Sydney, which has about US$16 billion in assets. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1570 times.

 Millennials aren't spending money like their parents did Matt Turner Sep. 14, 2016, 12:31 AM 35,434 facebook linkedin twitter email print A millennial at the Burning Man festival. Aly Weisman/Business Insider Millennials are spending their money differently from their parents and grandparents. Gordon Smith, chief executive for consumer and community banking at JPMorgan, gave a presentation on Monday at the Barclays Financial Services Conference discussing the spending patterns of millennials. JPMorgan is especially focused on this group, and we've written before about the bank spending big to land younger customers. The chart below shows what millennials and non-millennials purchased using Chase debit and credit cards in 2015. To clear up any confusion, JPMorgan defined millennials as those born between 1981 and 1997, while non-millennials are those born before 1981. You'll see that millennials spend a lot more on "experiences" — things like travel, entertainment, and dining. JPMorgan The spending patterns of the millennial generation are important, as they'll be shaping consumer demand for years to come. The compound annual growth rate in retail spending from this group is forecast to be 15% from 2014 to 2020, versus a 4% increase for those ages 35 and up.

By supporting new business growth, the grant gives a financial boost to the Great Places 2020 plan for the River West neighborhood near IUPUI and the 16 Tech innovation district. BOI provides free, one-on-one coaching to entrepreneurs and business owners, and administers the nation's largest Chamber-affiliated microloan program; these modest loans up to $50,000 provide critical capital for small businesses that may not meet traditional lending standards. BOI is a U.S. Small Business Administration microloan partner that also receives funding from the City of Indianapolis and corporate partners like JPMorgan Chase. "The JPMorgan Chase Foundation has supported our microlending and coaching programs from the start," said Carrie Henderson, President of BOI and Sr. Director of Entrepreneur Services for the Indy Chamber. "You can see the entrepreneurial spirit of River West in its Great Places 2020 plan - with the continued commitment of JPMorgan Chase to Indy's business community and its neighborhoods, we'll be able to make a real impact on up-and-coming small businesses in an up-and-coming area." The Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) leads Great Places 2020 along with partners like the Indy Chamber, United Way of Central Indiana, Keep Indianapolis Beautiful, the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership and City of Indianapolis. 'Great Places' neighborhoods create long-range strategic plans for economic development, infrastructure, housing, and quality of life initiatives that contribute to redevelopment and growth. "JPMorgan Chase is a proud supporter of Great Places 2020 - we believe that great neighborhoods make a great city," said Al Smith, chairman of JPMorgan Chase Indiana. "By bringing much-needed expertise and access to capital to the planned Source River West center through BOI, this grant will be a down payment on a thriving business community in and around River West." In 2015, the Indy Chamber's Entrepreneur Services team provided nearly 5,000 hours of free business coaching, and another 5,500 combined hours of classes and workshops aimed at small business issues. BOI made roughly $280,000 in microloans last year; its efforts led to 85 new business start-ups. The JPMorgan Chase Foundation grant will allow a BOI business coach to staff the Source River West center, working one-on-one with business owners, administering the microloan program and facilitating a regular schedule of small business and entrepreneurship classes and other outreach programs. IUPUI is the institutional partner behind the center's development. Serving as fiscal agent to support the launch of Source River West Great Place Entrepreneurship Center, IUPUI provides staffing, planning expertise, and educational services for the center. "The Source River West Entrepreneurship Center is more than just a location on West Michigan Street," said Phil Votaw, Executive Director of the Westside Community Development Corporation, the lead agency in the River West Great Places 2020 application. "It will help many businesses get started that will potentially locate in the River West/ Near West area." Indy Chamber CEO Michael Huber explained that expanded business coaching, microlending and other small business and entrepreneurship programs is part of a comprehensive regional growth strategy, adding that under-served neighborhoods like River West also have unique opportunities in today's economy. "Across the country, most new business and job creation is happening in major cities, where people can live and work in walkable neighborhoods," Huber said. "We support the 16 Tech innovation district east of the White River, and convenient mass transit that also connects River West to IUPUI, downtown and the rest of the city. "This area could quickly become another frontier for high-tech jobs and new development, with plenty of potential for homegrown entrepreneurship. Thanks to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation, we can play a bigger role in helping this 'Great Place' live up to its potential." LISC recently announced funding for an additional two neighborhoods to join Great Places 2020; visit GreatPlaces2020.org for details and to explore River West and the other Great Places plans.

By Suzanne McGee Biography September 28, 2009 BETWEEN THE ROCKY MARKETS, THE SHAKY BANKS and Bernie Madoff, the relationship between wealth managers and their clients didn't stand a chance. Rightly or not, investors first grew suspicious of their advisors and bankers, then contemptuous. Says one ultra-high-net-worth investor, who oversees billions of dollars in family investments: "I'm better off assuming that all these people are only out for themselves." MORE PENTA ARTICLES That kind of deep distrust is starting to dramatically reshape the world of wealth management, where banks, brokerage houses and other investment outfits compete to serve millionaires and billionaires. More than one out of four high net-worth investors yanked money from their wealth mangers in 2008, according to a survey by consulting firm Capgemini and Merrill Lynch. And some bankers believe that as many as four out of five are now thinking about firing their managers and picking new ones. "The amount of money in motion is probably several orders of magnitude higher than this industry has ever seen before," says Bruce Holley, a senior partner who heads the Boston Consulting Group's U.S. wealth-management practice. "Clients are aware that it's more critical for them to get good advice in such turbulent times, but at the same time, they are more nervous and wary than ever before." For bankers and advisors, he adds, "there's tremendous potential to either win or lose relationships." That's evident in Barron's annual ranking of America's top wealth-management outfits. None of the top five players, and only one of the top 10, holds the same position as last year, the result of both money on the move and crisis-driven mergers. Another factor: We've tightened our definition of wealth management. We think the term now denotes services for accounts of $5 million and up, verus $1 million-plus in the past, as firms increasingly cater to the very richest.

But the reshuffling extends deep into the ranks. Some of the biggest winners were smaller old-line private banking outfits, which benefited as last fall's financial crisis rocked some of the giants to their core. Bessemer Trust, formed more than 100 years ago to manage the money of the Phipps family, partners of Andrew Carnegie, shot up to No. 13 in the ranking from No. 20 last year. Northern Trust ntrs 0.34355828220858897% Northern Trust Corp.

Fiduciary Trust, started during the Great Depression to serve the anxious rich, leaped to No. 30 from 37. "We have just had the two best years in the 16 years I've been working here" in terms of attracting new assets under management, says Henry Johnson, president and co-CEO of Fiduciary Trust. Johnson attributes some of the growth in clients to the firm's conservative investment approach, which produced returns that looked relatively appealing, compared with the losses on major market indexes. "But," he says, "there's also a big element of a flight to quality happening out there, as clients seek out someone that they feel can help them rebuild their trust in the system." Even Fiduciary's name can be a plus, since a growing number of potential clients understand the meaning of the word "fiduciary" -- an investment professional with a legal obligation to put the client's interest ahead of his own. THE SURGE OF MISTRUST DIRECTED at private bankers and other advisors is logical, argues Maurice Schweitzer, an associate professor at the Wharton School. "Suddenly, clients recognize new ways that things could go wrong that had never occurred to them before, and if there isn't an extraordinary degree of transparency and communication, it's inevitable that the level of trust in their advisor will decline," says Schweitzer, who has studied issues of trust in a variety of industries. "They're going to be asking for extra reassurance in many areas, and that is going to be expensive for private banks to deliver, but it's completely reasonable. The Madoff debacle showed people that they might not be able to trust the printed statements they got from their advisor." Tony Guernsey, the New York-based head of National Wealth Management at Wilmington Trust, No. 21, has been on the receiving end of just that kind of client anxiety in recent months: "I've had clients walk in and say, look, I got a statement from Bernie Madoff that said I owned such and such, but it turns out that I didn't own anything -- so prove to me you're not Madoff." Suddenly, Guernsey says, investors are hungering for information about the arcane workings of third-party firms used for clearing transactions and holding securities in custody. Customers of Madoff certainly would have been a lot better off if he hadn't been handling such back-office tasks through a unit of his own firm, which helped mask his Ponzi scheme. Each time Guernsey is asked, he walks the client through their Wilmington statement in chronological order, spelling out the complete process of where each asset came from and where it now resides. "I reassure them, 'See, you can tell that none of this is in our name, it's all held in your name at an independent custodian.'" Of course, suspicions and blame can go too far. It's unrealistic to expect your manager to have posted gains last year when the huge majority of pros were down. But if the manager greatly trailed the market, that's another story. If a wealth manager has been hard to reach on the phone during stressful times, that's a clear red flag -- and most firms now realize that more than ever. "If the client has to call you, then you don't get points for that," says Dean Junkans, the chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Private Bank. For more tips on how to decide whether to dump or keep your wealth manager, see the box on this page. In many cases, distrust is sparked by a simple misunderstanding or miscommunication. "People have different, unstated, beliefs about what represents a betrayal of trust, and what are referred to as 'psychological contracts,'" says Schweitzer. "In that case, it's the perception of the client that matters -- that is the reality." For instance, a banker might reassure clients that their portfolios are protected from sudden shocks. In the banker's eyes, relative outperformance would meet that criterion, but the clients might interpret the reassurance as a promise they wouldn't lose money. Earlier this month, Peter Skoglund, co-head of Credit Suisse Private Banking USA, No. 11 in the rankings, met with a client who had experienced just this kind of miscommunication with his previous private bankers. "The advisor had invested his assets in some private-equity and hedge funds and now he's 'gated' and he can't withdraw his funds," Skoglund says, referring to lockup arrangements under which it can take up to 18 months for an investor to retrieve assets after requesting their return from a fund manager. The fault could lie with the client for not asking the right questions, but in Skoglund's eyes, at least, it's always up to the banker to be sure that any potential questions are addressed. "The winners are going to be those who can be most transparent with their clients, and who solve the issue of communication," he says. NOT SURPRISINGLY, MANY BANKERS and advisors are ramping up the nature and frequency of communication with the wealthy families whose assets they manage. "When the markets are strong and going up all the time, that communication is less valued by the client," says Peter Charrington, CEO of Citi Private Bank in North America, No. 23. But now, with transparency the buzzword, "people want to be more actively aware of how we are generating returns for them," Charrington says. Communication of course isn't just about returns. Says John Taft, head of RBC Wealth Management for the U.S.: "Our industry, for a long time, focused on a whole bunch of fancy complicated products that weren't properly tested, instead of emphasizing our role as responsible stewards of our clients' wealth," he says. Now, he argues, the trend is in the other direction. "Private banking has to move back to the basic, fundamental issues, communication with our clients chief among them." Barron's magazine introduces its Penta supplement which targets people with $5 million in assets. Some topics covered are: wealthy investors are questioning their advisors and you are the top private bankers. To that end, Fiduciary Trust's Johnson insists that his private bankers travel -- despite a firm-wide cost-cutting blitz -- to meet with their clients face to face on a regular basis. He also urges them not to try to cram too many meetings into one day in the name of efficiency. "We would rather do two or three good meetings a day, than five meetings a day," he says. "The process of rebuilding or reinforcing trust takes time." Clients are now asking some questions that private bankers have never dealt with before. "They are being frank and freely asking what would happen if the bank collapses -- how does the FDIC insurance guarantee work, for instance," says Robert Reilly, the Philadelphia-based head of the wealth-management division at PNC Bank, No. 22. Answering such questions has been winning business from people who use PNC for other services, such as corporate banking, as well as from customers of National City Bank, a Cleveland institution that PNC acquired after it was hobbled by mortgage losses. Customers "want to know what it means that we are regulated by the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency," Reilly says. The goal, he adds, is to "proactively address any concerns before mistrust becomes a fixed part of our clients' attitude to the financial system." It's all highlighting the changing requirements for success. "A good wealth manager is a quasi-psychologist, able to understand a client's hopes and fears," says Boston Consultant Group's Holley. "A lot of wealth managers organize their meetings with clients around process and returns, but if you don't increase the emotional component, you're just checking a box by having that meeting." And here's the biggest change: "There is going to be more healthy skepticism on the client's part about the kind of promises a bank makes," says Johnson of Fiduciary Trust. "The industry will have to adjust to that." When promises are both believed and kept, life will start looking up for clients and bankers alike.

"Let's just raise rates," Dimon said before an audience at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, adding that another rate increase of 25 basis points would be "a drop in the bucket." The U.S. central bank has held rates steady after raising them for the first time in a decade from near zero last December. Its next policy meeting is Sept 20-21. It has repeatedly held off in part due to fears on the U.S. and global economic growth outlook and tepid inflation. "The rate itself gets much more pyshological attention than the actual economic effect of raising rates," Dimon said, when asked if he thought the U.S. central bank should raise rates next week or wait until December. "I'd go sooner rather than later." (Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Jon Marino | @JonMarino Monday, 12 Sep 2016 | 12:51 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters <p>JPM&#039;S Dimon: Let&#039;s just raise rates</p> <p>JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon shares his take on interest rates at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. CNBC&#039;s Wilfred Frost reports the details. </p> JPM'S Dimon: Let's just raise rates    Monday, 12 Sep 2016 | 12:43 PM ET | 00:50 Get on with it! That's how JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon feels when it comes to the much-anticipated interest rate hike the market has been worrying about from the Federal Reserve. Tim Boyle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jamie Dimon "Let's just raise rates," Dimon said, speaking in an interview with Carlyle Group CEO David Rubenstein on Monday at the Economic Club of Washington. "Twenty-five basis points is a drop in the bucket." He went on to say he would rather see the Fed raise sooner rather than later, and said that at a positive point in the U.S. economy, "you don't want to be behind the 8-ball" when it comes to a rate hike. The Federal Reserve, after one interest rate hike in late 2015, has been weighing whether to raise rates again in 2016, although global economic factors have complicated the decision-making process. Because an interest rate hike translates into banks being able to charge a higher percentage to borrowers, a move by the Federal Open Market Committee to increase rates would be a boost for Wall Street banks' stocks. Dimon also cautioned that the Brexit vote could cause the Eurozone to "unravel," which he said could bring catastrophic consequences along with it. The two Wall Street titans also talked about the job market — that is to say, their own. Rubenstein admitted on stage, while interviewing Dimon that he tried to hire the JPMorgan Chase CEO "unsuccessfully, every time." Rubenstein wasn't the only one who sought Dimon's services. After his firing from Citigroup in 1999, Dimon weighed work with Home Depot, among other companies. Without being too specific, Dimon said that after his career at JPMorgan Chase ends, he would "maybe do something to help the government out, somewhere," but made it clear that this decision is years away. But when Rubenstein pressed Dimon for how he would respond if the next president of the United States offered him the role of leading the Treasury Department, the bank CEO turned the tables. "I'd say, ask David Rubenstein," Dimon said, drawing a laugh from the audience.

One of the concerns on Wall Street has been how companies will maintain their dividends at these lower levels, and while some already trimmed their payouts to shareholders, others have stood firm with no changes. A new JPMorgan research report raises price targets on three top integrated companies the firm has rated Overweight, while remaining cautious as a whole on the sector. JPMorgan also acknowledges the importance for the top companies to maintain dividend coverage and balance sheet strength, even if it comes at the expense of production growth. Here are the three integrated oil companies rated Overweight at JPMorgan Chevron This stock is very solid story for investors looking to stay long the energy sector, and it is a preferred U.S. company to own now. Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) is an integrated oil and gas company with worldwide operations in exploration and production, refining and marketing, transportation and petrochemicals. It sports a sizable dividend and has a solid place in the sector when it comes to natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Some on Wall Street estimate the company will have a compound annual growth rate of over 5% for the next five years. The company’s Permian Basin assets are a goldmine, and that the Australian LNG business will transition from a yearly $8 billion capital consumption drag to a $2 billion to $3 billion contributor. Combined with the much lower overall capital spending for the 2016 to 2018 period, the company is poised to not only hang around, but end the sector slump in a much better position. The analysts note the Permian acreage is profitable at $40 a barrel. The JPMorgan team notes that the company is the best in class when it comes to dividend yield, but they feel the need to see free-cash-flow infection reasonably soon is important. They also feel that the dividend being among the highest in the sector gives investors a degree of downside protection. Chevron investors are paid an outstanding 4.23% dividend. The JPMorgan price target was lifted to $117 from $113. The Wall Street consensus target is posted at $110.75. The shares closed Friday at $101.27 apiece. ConocoPhillips This company may offer investors solid upside potential, with little threat of an additional dividend cut after the one earlier this year. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids (NGLs) worldwide. Conoco’s portfolio includes resource-rich North American tight oil and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; various international developments; and an inventory of conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Many Wall Street analysts feel the company can accelerate growth from a reloaded portfolio depth in the Bakken and Eagle Ford, and with visibility on future growth from a sizable position in the Permian. The company remains the one of the best values as short sellers circled after the dividend cut and many growth and income managers sold shares. JPMorgan notes that the company has underperformed this year versus its peer group and is offering investors solid value at current trading levels. Conoco investors are paid a 2.37 % dividend. The JPMorgan price target on the company was raised to $51 from $44, while the consensus price target is $52. Conoco closed Friday at $42.25. Canadian Natural Resources This top Canadian play is JPMorgan’s top pick, based on a free-cash-flow yield basis. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (NYSE: CNQ) acquires, explores for, develops, produces, markets and sells crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. The company offers light and medium crude oil, primary heavy crude oil, Pelican Lake heavy crude oil, bitumen and synthetic crude oil (SCO). Its midstream assets include three crude oil pipeline systems and a 50% working interest in an 84-megawatt cogeneration plant at Primrose. As of December 31, 2015, the company’s gross proved crude oil, bitumen, SCO and NGLs reserves totaled 4,695 million barrels; gross proved plus probable crude oil, bitumen, SCO and NGLs reserves totaled 7,623 million barrels; proved natural gas reserves totaled 6,106 billion cubic feet; and gross proved plus probable natural gas reserves totaled 8,508 billion cubic feet. It operates primarily in Western Canada; the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea; and Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon and South Africa in Offshore Africa. JPMorgan feels that the company’s metrics remain among the best in its research universe, and it notes that the improving balance sheet and a big stock buyback program are factors that can drive share prices higher. Investors are paid a 2.3% dividend. JPMorgan raised its price target to $51 from $47, and the consensus target is much lower at $35.81. The stock closed Friday at $30.63. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Needless to say, investors are rattled, and the selling we saw last week may continue. Any major dip in these three top stocks should be viewed as a golden opportunity for investors with a longer term view to buy shares.

Tracy Alloway tracyalloway September 12, 2016 — 3:32 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Monetary Policy Feeding the U.S. Corporate Bond Rush Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp When Japanese, European, and U.K. government bonds sneeze, U.S. Treasuries catch a cold? Investors have been eschewing some longer-dated government debt as they fret over the willingness — and ability — of central banks to continue to fan economic growth through unconventional monetary policy such as bond purchase programs. The skepticism helped send yields on Japanese government bonds and German bunds spiking last week, and on Friday the sell-off reached the U.S. Treasury market, where the benchmark 10-year note posted its worst two-day performance since July as yields jumped 14 basis points. The rout has sparked a flurry of analyst commentary as the higher U.S. yields haven't been accompanied by changing expectations of Federal Reserve policy. Instead, analysts at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. suggest the sell-off in U.S. government debt is taking place as higher yields in Japan and Europe make Treasury bonds less attractive by comparison. "From a medium-term perspective, we are beginning to think the risks around rate levels have begun to shift, for a number of reasons," JPMorgan analysts led by Jay Barry wrote in a note published late on Friday. "First, developed market central banks have disappointed again, highlighted by [last] week's lack of action from the European Central Bank. Second, as a corollary, Treasuries no longer appear as attractive to foreign investors compared to home currency bonds as they did earlier this year." The so-called yield pickup that foreign investors can expect to earn by selling government bonds in their local currencies to buy 10-year U.S. Treasuries has fallen dramatically thanks to the recent increase in yields and stubbornly negative cross-currency basis swaps that help traders hedge such deals. For instance, writes JPMorgan, Japanese and European investors could as recently as March have expected to pick-up 80 bps and 50 bps, respectively, by selling their home bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries with a short-term currency hedge. Source: JPMorgan "But this yield pickup has largely disappeared, as JGB and bund yields have risen, while cross-currency bases have remained quite negative," the analysts note. "This yield pickup was one large support for the Treasury rally in the first half of 2016, as the Bank of Japan and ECB eased aggressively, while the Fed remained on hold. Going forward, this should be less supportive of foreign demand than it was in [the first half], and recent data already suggest Japanese investment in foreign bonds had started to slow in August." Combined with some crowded positioning — JPMorgan's client survey shows 16 percent net longs, the highest level since June 27, or immediately after the Brexit vote — and a deluge of new supply expected this week when the U.S. Treasury is due to auction $44 billion worth of three- and 10-year notes in an unprecedented Monday sale.  All in all, suggests JPMorgan, the tailwinds for U.S. Treasuries appear to be turning more feeble — if not downright sickly.

In a research note to clients, Crisafulli says: The SPX is giving back the entire Mon rally due to ongoing yield anxiety ahead of the 9/21 BOJ meeting. The market never had a Fed problem but it does face a BOJ one and unfortunately clarity on Japanese monetary policy won’t come for another week (the comprehensive assessment is 9/21, the same day as the FOMC decision). … Other than this issue there isn’t much else to talk about and that is another headwind (the death of news is helping yield-driven fears to propagate uncontested). In addition to the focus on yields and multiples, the contours of the US presidential race shifted materially over the weekend and polls due out over the balance of this week and next will prob. reflect that (i.e. polls will prob. tighten further and Clinton’s +3 RCP average may wind up disappearing).” As for the bond market purge: Nothing really “happened” to spark the yield rise but the same old worries are playing a role, namely anxiety ahead of the BOJ meeting 9/21. Portugal’s 10yr yields are up ~9bp and in focus ahead of the DBRS 10/21 decision (a d/g from DBRS would render Portuguese bonds ineligible for the ECB APP). In the US Treasury yields are higher across the curve and the curve is steepening (2, 5, 10, and 30yr yields are up 1, 3, 4, and 3.7bp, respectively). So while most investors are focused on next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, Crisafulli says the markets are experiencing anxiety instead from the Bank of Japan. That central bank is reportedly reconsidering its entire policy stance as evidence mounts that Abenomics may not actually be working, and that negative interest rates may be a mistake. Unlike on Monday this week, stocks are not recovering from an early drop. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) fell $3.82 (-1.77%) to $212.58 per share in Tuesday afternoon trading, hitting fresh session lows and erasing all of Monday’s bounce after Friday’s big sell-off.

(Photo: Paul Sakuma/AP) (Bloomberg) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the Federal Reserve should increase interest rates — sooner, rather than later. “Let’s just raise rates,” Dimon said Monday during a wide-ranging discussion at the Economic Club of Washington. “The Fed has to maintain credibility. I think it’s time to raise rates. Normality is a good thing, not a bad thing. The return to normal is a good thing.” Fed policy makers will gather in Washington Sept. 20-21, and recent comments from voting members have sent mixed signals about whether they’ll lift rates or wait at least until the December meeting. Speaking Monday in Chicago, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said “the case to tighten policy pre-emptively is less compelling” in an environment where declining unemployment has been slow to spur faster inflation. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, a voting member this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, argued Friday there was a reasonable case for gradual tightening. Related: MetLife says volatility challenges IPO path for retail unit Dimon, CEO and chairman of the biggest U.S. bank, isn’t a disinterested party. Banks typically make more money when interest rates rise as the gap widens between how much they charge borrowers and pay depositors. The shares of banks have climbed this year on days when speculation rises that the Fed is closer to increasing rates. “I’d go sooner rather than later, but I’ll leave the exact timing up to them,” Dimon said. White House In a conversation that touched on topics from regulation to U.S. immigration policy to the highlights of his more than three decades in finance, Dimon lambasted the lack of educational opportunities for inner-city residents as a “disgrace.” When asked if he would ever enter politics, Dimon, 60, said he would “love to be president” but the path is too difficult. It’s likely some of the regulations enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act will be improved in coming years, Dimon said, adding that he isn’t in favor of throwing it out entirely. When asked about cyber-security pressures, the CEO said JPMorgan was a like a “mini police state” in tracking employee behavior, and that he fires staffers every week for violating policies. JPMorgan spends $600 million annually on cyber security, a figure that could rise to $1 billion in a few years, he said. Dimon, who was treated for throat cancer in 2014, said he’s in good health and will probably be CEO for another five years. Related: How do you define bond liquidity?

JPMorgan Chase has surpassed Wells Fargo as the biggest U.S. bank by market capitalization. Wells Fargo had been the largest by market cap since 2013, based on closing values. Shares of Wells Fargo fell more 3 percent on Tuesday, while JPMorgan Chase closed 0.79 percent lower. That gave JPMorgan Chase a market cap of nearly $240.3 billion versus almost $236.9 billion for Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo shares have been under pressure in the past few days after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and two other regulators fined the bank $185 million. The bank must also pay another $5 million to customers for creating more than 2 million fake accounts for products like credit and debit cards to meet aggressive sales targets. On Tuesday, the bank said beginning next year it would eliminate all product sales goals in retail banking. With Tuesday's declines, Wells Fargo saw its worst daily performance since June 24 and its first three-day losing streak since Aug. 3. —CNBC's Gina Francolla and Reuters contributed to this report.

From left: Niko Papastefanou, Kristy Cloetingh, A.J. Scordio and Kevin Barbaro Port Washington native develops TV show By the age of 24, A.J. Scordio had it all. A graduate of Bucknell University, he had a highly coveted Wall Street job at JPMorgan Chase and was having the time of his life in New York City weekend after weekend with friends. But despite the luxurious assets at his fingertips, ultimately, they held him back from chasing his dream. Nowadays things have changed for the Port Washington native, who is in the midst of achieving the dream of becoming a filmmaker after quitting his office job to take a leap of faith. “I just felt very stuck there, and I was very unhappy,” said Scordio, when asked about his decision to leave a great paying job. “I began taking more acting and writing classes while working there and then after saving up enough money, I made the decision to switch careers and I quit.” Now the owner of his own production company, Scordio Productions, he hopes to become one of the competitive industry’s brightest up-and-comers. “I’ve always wanted to do something in film, even in high school,” said Scordio, who attended Paul D. Schreiber Senior High School. “I was a jock and was very into business so I wanted to take the practical route, but the passion was always deep down and that’s why I was always a part of the high school plays.” Meet the cast of Long Island Lights. From left: Kristy Cloetingh, Niko Papastefanou, A.J. Scordio, Martin Yurkovic and Kevin Barbaro Having directed music videos for world renowned DJs Steve Aoki and Felix Jaehn as well as producing numerous commercials for locations of the fitness empire CrossFit, Scordio has now turned his sights to something bigger. Within the film industry, “bigger” usually means Hollywood, but for Scordio, “bigger” means Long Island. With help from cowriters Mary Martin and Alex Aguirre, Scordio and his team have created Long Island Lights, described as “a new comedic TV show about a group of misfits at an amateur production company on Long Island who learn life lessons as they stumble towards their idea of Hollywood success.” Paralleling numerous life moments Scordio has gone through, the series revolves around brothers James and Marco Agnelli, portrayed by Scordio himself and Niko Papastefanou, half-siblings Rick and Vicky Sellers, played by Kevin Barbaro and Kristy Cloetingh, and finally Donny Martin, portrayed by Martin Yurkovic. Scordio said that it was important that the series is based in the area in which he grew up, which made him want to bring Hollywood to Long Island. With the show based on the Island, the crew has filmed numerous scenes in Port Washington, Huntington, Baiting Hollow and Riverhead, as well as Brooklyn and Times Square. Kevin Barbaro (driver) and A.J. Scordio (passenger) get ready to film a scene while driving. The show premiered its pilot episode June 12 in front of a packed theater of more than 250 people. At the end of the episode, the cast and crew were met with praises from the crowd as well as great reviews and loud ovations. Scordio and his team are scheduled to meet with Hulu representatives in September, an opportunity he is excited about. “I know it’s going to happen. I’ve put so much into this show and surrounded myself with people that want the same dream,” said Scordio. He plans to do his best in selling himself and the show to those that have the power to bring Long Island Lights to the next level. When asked if he had any advice for people who want to chase their dreams much like he did, he said that the most important thing is being able to support yourself and having the support of those that matter, like parents. “My parents, Patricia Dalmazio and Anthony Scordio, are entrepreneurs, so although they have no idea about the entertainment industry, they have always been supportive of me pursuing my dream,” Scordio said.

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that the New York court on Monday reversed a judge’s decision to throw out the lawsuit and ordered him to consider the case. Jennifer Sharkey sued in 2010 claiming she was fired as a vice president in J.P. Morgan’s Private Wealth Management Group for investigating allegations that a long-term client might be involved in fraud or money-laundering. According to Sharkey, she was fired one week after making a formal recommendation that the bank end its relationship with the Israeli client after spending months warning about possible illegal activity. The person wasn’t named in the lawsuit and is referred to in court papers as "Client A."

A benchmark for near-term borrowing, the three-month U.S. dollar London interbank offered rate, has risen above 0.75 percentage point. That’s a key threshold for junk-rated companies with about $230 billion of loans outstanding according to data compiled by Bloomberg -- with Libor above that level, the borrowers will have to pay more interest over time. The increase so far could amount to about an extra $230 million of total interest expense annually for the companies. Companies that took out floating-rate loans knew they would have to pay more to borrow once rates started rising, but they haven’t experienced real increases for years. Even when the Federal Reserve started hiking rates in December, many companies did not have to pay higher rates on their loans until Libor breached key levels, because of the way their floating rates are calculated. Rising interest payments would only add to pain for U.S. borrowers that are already suffering from falling profits and higher default rates. And Libor could rise further-- JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists recently forecast it could reach 0.95 percentage point by the end of this month. There will be some companies “for which it might become an issue," said Neha Khoda, a high-yield credit strategist at Bank of America Corp. With Libor having risen above key levels like 0.75 percentage point, many issuers have to think about how they will pay the extra interest, she said. Three-month Libor now stands at 0.85 percentage point, and has been rising as new money market fund rules curb investor demand for companies’ short-term debt.  Interest rates on loans in the leveraged loan market are calculated by starting with a benchmark borrowing rate like three-month Libor and adding a margin known as a "spread." About $230 billion of the loans in the market have a minimum benchmark level, or "floor," equal to 0.75 percentage point, meaning that even if Libor has fallen below that level, the borrower must pay the minimum plus the spread. Most of the debt in the $900 billion leveraged loan market has Libor floors, which are often set around 1 percent.  ‘Rational Decision’ Floors grew popular when interest rates started plunging after the crisis, and are meant to cushion lenders against falling rates. Many companies have a combination of fixed- and floating-rate obligations, and the variable-rate debt can be hedged to reduce exposure to interest rates. Libor is rising in anticipation of  new rules for money market funds that go into effect in October. Under the regulations, investors in funds that buy short-term corporate obligations can suffer losses when the value of the assets falls. Funds that only invest in short-term government debt are not subject to the new rules, which has made government-only money market funds much more popular in recent months. As investors have had less demand for funds that invest in short-term corporate debt obligations, issuers have had to boost yields, lifting benchmark rates. Libor’s rise is also a function of changes to the way the rate is calculated after years of scandals revealed flaws in the method for setting the levels, according to Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Brean Capital LLC. “There’s been a huge focus on the regulatory changes but the way Libor has been calculated has been changing and that has a lot to do with the rise too,” he said Tuesday by phone. “This is why we think Libor is going to continue to be elevated relative to other rates and why we think investors should boost exposure to floating rate notes.” Some borrowers may look to change the benchmark rates on their loans to switch to lower baselines, such as one-month Libor, said Craig Russ, a portfolio manager at Eaton Vance Corp. that invests in loans. Advanced Disposal Services Inc., the Ponte Vedra, Florida-based waste manager, did so earlier this year, according to e-mailed comments from the company. The company had a $1.69 billion loan with a floor on three-month Libor of 0.75 percentage point. In the second quarter, it switched to one-month Libor, which is currently 0.53 percentage point. Advanced Disposal has posted at least five years of annual net losses according to Bloomberg data. It has filed for an initial public offering whose proceeds would help pay down debt. Whether the one-month Libor rises like the three-month and six-month rates did remains an “open question”, according to JPMorgan Chase analysts led by Alex Roever. But it still may make sense for many companies to try switching to one-month Libor to increase their chances of their benchmark staying below their floor, Eaton Vance’s Russ said.  "It’s a rational economic decision to lower your costs,” Russ said. “If you’re the CFO of a company, you’ll probably want to prevent yourself going above the Libor floor.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

 JAMIE DIMON: 'I would love to be president of the United States' Bob Bryan Sep. 12, 2016, 1:18 PM 24,842 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon wants to live in the White House, but he doesn't think it will happen. In a Monday conversation at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Dimon was asked by David Rubenstein, the head of the Economic Club, whether he would run for political office. "I would love to be president of the United States, but it's too hard and too late," Dimon replied. Dimon said that while the campaign of the real-estate mogul turned Republican nominee Donald Trump appeared to make it possible for a "businessman who had never held office before" to be successful in a run for the presidency, the expectation of voters for a presidential candidate to have served in office before taking over the White House would prevent him from winning. Dimon said "you have to join a party" and "be a senator and governor" first to qualify in voters' minds, which he does not plan to do. He also cited Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, as an example of a businessman who opted not to run for president. Dimon nevertheless seemed exasperated with the state of economic policymaking in Washington, saying the US didn't need more "Democratic and Republican bulls---." At the same time, Dimon reiterated his view that the US remained the world's strongest economy. "America has the best hand ever dealt of any country on this planet today ever," Dimon said. He said that the US had geographical, economic, and military advantages over every other country and that Americans "don't fully appreciate" that fact. Dimon also expressed his opinion on the state of economic policy. On the monetary side, he said he thought the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates. On the fiscal side, he believes there should be government stimulus, a decrease in the corporate tax rates, and easing of regulations. Dimon has frequently commented on macroeconomic events and policy, and the JPMorgan CEO's name has long been floated as a possible candidate for Treasury secretary. Monday was the first time he had explicitly stated his desire to hold the highest office in the US.

"Let's just raise rates," Dimon said Monday during a wide-ranging discussion at the Economic Club of Washington. "The Fed has to maintain credibility. I think it's time to raise rates. Normality is a good thing, not a bad thing. The return to normal is a good thing." Fed policymakers will gather in Washington Sept. 20-21, and recent comments from voting members have sent mixed signals about whether they'll lift rates or wait at least until the December meeting. Speaking Monday in Chicago, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said "the case to tighten policy pre-emptively is less compelling" in an environment where declining unemployment has been slow to spur faster inflation. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, a voting member this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, argued Friday there was a reasonable case for gradual tightening. Dimon, CEO and chairman of the biggest U.S. bank, isn't a disinterested party. Banks typically make more money when interest rates rise as the gap widens between how much they charge borrowers and pay depositors. The shares of banks have climbed this year on days when speculation rises that the Fed is closer to increasing rates. "I'd go sooner rather than later, but I'll leave the exact timing up to them," Dimon said. In a conversation that touched on topics from regulation to U.S. immigration policy to the highlights of his more than three decades in finance, Dimon lambasted the lack of educational opportunities for inner-city residents as a "disgrace." When asked if he would ever enter politics, Dimon, 60, said he would "love to be president" but the path is too difficult. It's likely some of the regulations enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act will be improved in coming years, Dimon said, adding that he isn't in favor of throwing it out entirely. When asked about cyber-security pressures, the CEO said JPMorgan was a like a "mini-police state" in tracking employee behavior, and that he fires staffers every week for violating policies. JPMorgan spends $600 million annually on cyber security, a figure that could rise to $1 billion in a few years, he said. Dimon, who was treated for throat cancer in 2014, said he's in good health and will probably be CEO for another five years.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows NHL: Coyotes F Brad Richardson carted off ice on stretcher Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

(Photo: Getty Images for Fortune) Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, told a gathering of financiers in Washington, D.C. Monday that timing is right for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as the U.S. economy is humming along and called for more infrastructure investment to stir growth. “Twenty-five basis points is a drop in the bucket,” Dimon said in an on-stage interview at a luncheon hosted by the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. “Let’s just raise rates. You don’t want to be behind the eight-ball. I’d go sooner rather than later.” Investors are generally more bullish on banks when interest rates are higher as their earnings benefit from interest income derived from customers paying more for loans. Fed policymakers will meet on Sept. 20-21 to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time this year amid a tepidly growing economy. In its "beige book" released last week, the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy expanded modestly in July and August due to heightened manufacturing activity and strong job growth. But it also said the economy has expanded at a sluggish pace for three straight quarters. Dimon, whose company is the nation’s largest bank by assets, expressed optimism when asked by the interviewer, David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-CEO of private equity firm The Carlyle Group, about the state of the U.S. economy. "There's no immediate potholes,” Dimon said, pointing to rising employment, higher wages and a robust housing market. USA TODAY The last word on a Federal Reserve rate hike may mean standing pat But the executive also expressed concern about the quality of inner-city schools, the rising student loan debt and wage inequality. "We need more infrastructure investment," he said, arguing that spending to improve schools, bridges and roads shouldn't be a partisan issue. "Growth will fix wage inequality." When asked if he ever wanted to run for president, Dimon, 60, didn't hesitate. "I'd love to be president of the United States," he replied. "But it's just too hard and too late." Dimon, who in the past has described himself as a Democrat, said he is asked often about the impact of regulations but dismissed the argument that they impede corporate growth. "It's my job to deal with regulations," he said. "The interest of your country should come before the interest of your company or industry." USA TODAY AOL's Armstrong plans to take Internet He also largely defended the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, crediting it for restoring banks' capital holdings and consumer confidence following the financial crisis of 2008. The banking system "is in unbelievable shape, he said. "The system is recovered. And Dodd-Frank is partially responsible." Signed into law by President Obama in 2010, Dodd-Frank created federal agencies to monitor system risk, heightened reporting requirements and requires banks to hold a minimum amount of capital and undergo stress tests for liquidity. "I'm not in favor of throwing (Dodd-Frank) out and starting from the ground up," he said, countering critics who have called for its repeal. 51 CONNECTTWEET 34 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2cjrdZz

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jonathan Stempel September 12 A federal appeals court on Monday revived a former JPMorgan Chase private banker’s whistleblower lawsuit accusing the bank of firing her in retaliation for warning that an Israeli client might be committing fraud. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York found enough evidence to suggest that former JPMorgan employee Jennifer Sharkey had a “reasonable belief” that the client was engaged in fraud and money laundering involving Colombia. Sharkey said she was fired as a vice president and wealth manager in August 2009, a week after formally urging the bank to heed “red flags” and sever its ties with the client, who generated about $600,000 in annual billings. The client was not identified in court papers. Sharkey was fired eight months after the multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme of longtime JPMorgan client Bernard Madoff was exposed. U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan dismissed Sharkey’s lawsuit last October. Sweet said JPMorgan could have fired Sharkey based on her performance, or for having purportedly lied about communications involving another client. Sharkey disputed having lied. But the appeals court said the “close temporal proximity” between Sharkey’s warning and her firing justified letting the case continue. It also said her qualifications as a whistleblower was an issue of fact to be resolved at trial. JPMorgan agreed in January 2014 to pay $2.6 billion to settle litigation over Madoff, and in a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. government acknowledged responsibility for failing to stop him. — Reuters business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

(Photo: Getty Images for Fortune) Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, told a gathering of financiers in Washington, D.C. Monday that timing is right for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as the U.S. economy is humming along and called for more infrastructure investment to stir growth. “Twenty-five basis points is a drop in the bucket,” Dimon said in an on-stage interview at a luncheon hosted by the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. “Let’s just raise rates. You don’t want to be behind the eight-ball. I’d go sooner rather than later.” Investors are generally more bullish on banks when interest rates are higher as their earnings benefit from interest income derived from customers paying more for loans. Fed policymakers will meet on Sept. 20-21 to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time this year amid a tepidly growing economy. In its "beige book" released last week, the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy expanded modestly in July and August due to heightened manufacturing activity and strong job growth. But it also said the economy has expanded at a sluggish pace for three straight quarters. Dimon, whose company is the nation’s largest bank by assets, expressed optimism when asked by the interviewer, David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-CEO of private equity firm The Carlyle Group, about the state of the U.S. economy. "There's no immediate potholes,” Dimon said, pointing to rising employment, higher wages and a robust housing market. USA TODAY The last word on a Federal Reserve rate hike may mean standing pat But the executive also expressed concern about the quality of inner-city schools, the rising student loan debt and wage inequality. "We need more infrastructure investment," he said, arguing that spending to improve schools, bridges and roads shouldn't be a partisan issue. "Growth will fix wage inequality." When asked if he ever wanted to run for president, Dimon, 60, didn't hesitate. "I'd love to be president of the United States," he replied. "But it's just too hard and too late." Dimon, who in the past has described himself as a Democrat, said he is asked often about the impact of regulations but dismissed the argument that they impede corporate growth. "It's my job to deal with regulations," he said. "The interest of your country should come before the interest of your company or industry." USA TODAY AOL's Armstrong plans to take Internet He also largely defended the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, crediting it for restoring banks' capital holdings and consumer confidence following the financial crisis of 2008. The banking system "is in unbelievable shape, he said. "The system is recovered. And Dodd-Frank is partially responsible." Signed into law by President Obama in 2010, Dodd-Frank created federal agencies to monitor system risk, heightened reporting requirements and requires banks to hold a minimum amount of capital and undergo stress tests for liquidity. "I'm not in favor of throwing (Dodd-Frank) out and starting from the ground up," he said, countering critics who have called for its repeal. 51 CONNECTTWEET 34 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2cjrdZz

Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay are being used for less than 1 percent of payments at retailers, Gordon Smith said, citing industry data at an investor conference. Ultimately, the convenience of paying with phones will bring a surge of use from consumers, but it is impossible to know when that inflexion point will be reached, said Smith. Chase last year announced its own application called Chase Pay to hold account credentials for use at checkout counters.

Not so fast, says one board member. (Bloomberg) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the Federal Reserve should increase interest rates—sooner, rather than later. “Let's just raise rates,” Dimon said Monday during a wide-ranging discussion at the Economic Club of Washington. “The Fed has to maintain credibility. I think it's time to raise rates. Normality is a good thing, not a bad thing. The return to normal is a good thing.” On the same day, the Associated Press reported, Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard indicated Monday that she's in no hurry to raise interest rates again. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 200 points after her speech, ending the day with a 240-point gain. Other markets followed suit. Photo by Reuters Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard in 2015. In a speech in Chicago, Brainard said that the risk that higher rates will damage a fragile economy exceeds the risk that higher rates will ignite inflation. Economic weakness "counsels prudence," she said. Fed policy makers will gather in Washington Sept. 20-21, and recent comments from the committee's voters have sent mixed signals about whether they'll lift rates or stay on hold until at least the December meeting. Brainard said Monday that “the case to tighten policy preemptively is less compelling” in an environment where declining unemployment has been slow to spur faster inflation. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, a voting member this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, argued Friday there was a reasonable case for gradual tightening. “I'd go sooner rather than later, but I'll leave the exact timing up to them,” Dimon said.

 JAMIE DIMON: 'I would love to be president of the United States' Bob Bryan Sep. 12, 2016, 1:18 PM 24,842 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon wants to live in the White House, but he doesn't think it will happen. In a Monday conversation at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Dimon was asked by David Rubenstein, the head of the Economic Club, whether he would run for political office. "I would love to be president of the United States, but it's too hard and too late," Dimon replied. Dimon said that while the campaign of the real-estate mogul turned Republican nominee Donald Trump appeared to make it possible for a "businessman who had never held office before" to be successful in a run for the presidency, the expectation of voters for a presidential candidate to have served in office before taking over the White House would prevent him from winning. Dimon said "you have to join a party" and "be a senator and governor" first to qualify in voters' minds, which he does not plan to do. He also cited Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, as an example of a businessman who opted not to run for president. Dimon nevertheless seemed exasperated with the state of economic policymaking in Washington, saying the US didn't need more "Democratic and Republican bulls---." At the same time, Dimon reiterated his view that the US remained the world's strongest economy. "America has the best hand ever dealt of any country on this planet today ever," Dimon said. He said that the US had geographical, economic, and military advantages over every other country and that Americans "don't fully appreciate" that fact. Dimon also expressed his opinion on the state of economic policy. On the monetary side, he said he thought the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates. On the fiscal side, he believes there should be government stimulus, a decrease in the corporate tax rates, and easing of regulations. Dimon has frequently commented on macroeconomic events and policy, and the JPMorgan CEO's name has long been floated as a possible candidate for Treasury secretary. Monday was the first time he had explicitly stated his desire to hold the highest office in the US.

"Let's just raise rates," Dimon said before an audience at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, adding that another rate increase of 25 basis points would be "a drop in the bucket." The U.S. central bank has held rates steady after raising them for the first time in a decade from near zero last December. Its next policy meeting is Sept 20-21. It has repeatedly held off in part due to fears on the U.S. and global economic growth outlook and tepid inflation. "The rate itself gets much more psychological attention than the actual economic effect of raising rates," Dimon said, when asked if he thought the U.S. central bank should raise rates next week or wait until December. "I'd go sooner rather than later."

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 12, 2016 12:44pm   Comments Share: Related Tesla Shareholders Approve $2.6 Billion SolarCity Merger Benzinga's Top Downgrades Tesla's Risky SolarCity Acquisition Wins Shareholder Approval (Investor's Business Daily) Paul Coster, an alternative energy analyst with JPMorgan, still expects the SolarCity Corp (NASDAQ: SCTY) merger with Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) to proceed as planned but if the deal falls through, SolarCity will face higher discount rates for future capital raises and a "compromising" growth prospect. In a report published Monday, Coster felt it prudent to revise his 2017 estimates for SolarCity. Specifically, the analyst is assuming SolarCity's discount rate increases by 100 basis points without an acquisition; this would weigh on its NPV/w and growth. Related Link: Gordon Johnson Warns Of 'Burgeoning Risk' To SolarCity/Tesla Deal Closure Coster lowered his fiscal 2017 MW additions to 996, which is up 6 percent year-over-year but doesn't compare favorably to his prior estimate of 1,152. The analyst's year-end 2017 pretax unlevered NPV remaining for the PowreCo was also reduced to $6.2 billion from $6.8 billion. Coster cautioned that it's "reasonable to assume" MW installations could slow even further as the company's discount rate increases, which would drag down SolarCity's stock price even further as a standalone entity. Coster also lowered his price target on SolarCity's stock (Neutral rated) as a standalone company to $21 from a previous $25, although a fundamental analysis yields an even lower valuation of $19 per share. Bottom line, Coster suggested investors remain on the sidelines in the event that the SolarCity-Tesla deal falls through and the discount rate for SolarCity's new MW rises above expectations.

The New York court on Monday reversed a judge’s decision to throw out the lawsuit and ordered him to consider the case. Jennifer Sharkey sued in 2010 claiming she was fired as a vice president in J.P. Morgan’s Private Wealth Management Group for investigating allegations that a long-term client might be involved in fraud or money-laundering. According to Sharkey, she was fired one week after making a formal recommendation that the bank end its relationship with the Israeli client after spending months warning about possible illegal activity. The person wasn’t named in the lawsuit and is referred to in court papers as "Client A." Client A was a 20-year customer of JPMorgan Chase, with income from the gem and diamond business, real estate, telecommunications, medical technology and pre-paid calling cards, according to court papers. Sharkey told superiors the client’s businesses, multiple bank accounts and failure to provide information necessary to satisfy the bank’s "Know Your Customer" requirements raised questions that should result in terminating his relationship with the bank. Sharkey sued the bank and three supervisors in 2010, claiming they violated whistle-blower protections in the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Monday’s ruling is the second time the New York appeals court has overturned rulings by U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet throwing out the case. "We are very pleased with the Second Circuit’s decision and we look forward to a trial before the district court," said Lawrence Pearson, Sharkey’s lawyer. The bank claims Sharkey was fired for lying to a superior about communicating with a different client and for poor performance, which Sharkey disputes. "We continue to believe this case is without merit and look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the court," JPMorgan Chase spokesman Darin Oduyoye said. JPMorgan Chase has previously agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties and settlements to resolve claims it failed to adequately oversee accounts that Bernard Madoff used in his Ponzi scheme. The case is Sharkey v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 15-3400, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:30 AM, September 14, 2016 Updated: 7:15 AM, September 14, 2016 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON - Wells Fargo & Co scrapped its product sales goals for retail bankers on Tuesday and may take further disciplinary action against its employees in the wake of a fake account scandal that has already led to $190 million in fines and the firing of 5,300 employees. Wells Fargo has been hit hard by allegations its staff opened more than 2 million bank accounts and credit cards for customers without their consent in a bid to meet internal sales goals. Politicians are calling for an investigation, and Wells Fargo and regulators are expected to testify in the Senate next week. One of the United States' largest and most respected financial institutions, Wells Fargo built itself into the most valuable U.S. bank after the financial crisis partly because it did not rely on risky trades or complex derivatives to turn a profit. But the company's shares have lost around 7 percent of their value since last week, when U.S. regulators unveiled the fines against the bank , and it has ceded its position as the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization to rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. Wells Fargo - which was long the envy of the banking industry for its ability to sell multiple products to the same customer - agreed to pay $185 million in fines and $5 million to customers last week after reaching a settlement with three regulators over the alleged sales abuses. The phantom accounts meant that some customers were charged for insufficient funds, according to the regulators. During a CNBC appearance on Tuesday evening, Chief Executive John Stumpf apologized and said management takes responsibility for the problems identified in the settlement. Although the bank has eliminated sales goals for retail staff, Stumpf said "cross-selling" products from various businesses to customers is still important to growing its business. "We still love-cross selling," he said, later adding, "Cross-sell is shorthand for deep, long-term relationships. We love that." Even after firing more than 2 percent of its staff for improper selling, Wells Fargo is still examining its practices, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said earlier in the day. The bank will "take a big wide fresh look at who knew what and when and what else might have been done," he said speaking at an industry conference. Shrewsberry said the review would impact people "at all levels of the organization." Carrie Tolstedt, the head of the bank's retail operations where the abuses are alleged to have occurred, stepped down in July. The controversy has led to calls for the bank to claw back bonuses paid to her. Tolstedt received a pay raise in March, after getting more than $9 million in cash and stock last year. She left with more than 2.5 million in Wells Fargo shares, currently worth around $120 million. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said Tolstedt had "made a decision to retire at the end of this year." Tolstedt could not be reached for comment. Stumpf said clawback decisions are determined by the board of directors, and that product sales goals are not a component of compensation for any senior executives. POLITICAL HEAT The bank's practices have also drawn scrutiny from Washington, with staff members for the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the banking industry, set to meet with representatives of the bank. Stumpf, Cordray and Tom Curry, from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, will testify before the committee next week. Torrie Matous, spokeswoman for the committee's chairman, Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, said staff had "been arranging briefings and collecting information from both Wells Fargo and the regulators" to prepare for a Sept. 20 hearing. Five Democrats on the committee, including Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have pressed for an investigation. The top Democrat on the banking committee, Ohio’s Senator Sherrod Brown, wants the panel to probe deeper than a single hearing, "so we can get answers on how this massive fraud happened, what’s being done to make customers whole, and how to put safeguards in place to protect against its recurrence."

There are the unboxing videos posted on YouTube: People exulting in receiving the precious new metallic rectangle, lovingly unwrapping it. There are message boards and blogs dedicated to obsessing over it, with more than 6,000 comments on a Reddit discussion. It is so popular that JPMorgan Chase, which issues the card, ran out of the engraved card’s fancy metal stock in only 10 days, and had to send out a temporary plastic placeholder. But the Chase Sapphire Reserve card has done more than generate product hysteria. It has also intensified the race among large credit card issuers, which are introducing increasingly lavish rewards programs to capture affluent consumers who spend large sums on travel and recreation, but no longer want to be bound to one particular hotel or airline’s affinity program. The price for these premium cards can seem outlandish: $450 a year. But for a growing number of customers, the math makes sense. Cards that were once more about elite service and social status are now emphasizing their bottom-line value proposition — even when it comes with a hefty annual fee. “American Express used to have a stranglehold on the high-end market, but folks like Chase and Citi are coming hard after their crown,” said Matt Schulz, an analyst for CreditCards.com, a comparison site. Perhaps as a sign of the strengthened economy, the major issuers say demand for their premium cards is rising. The number of Citi Prestige cardholders increased sixfold in the last 18 months, according to a company spokeswoman, and American Express says its Platinum card membership is “large, growing and loyal.” Customers seem more willing to consider shifting from free cards to ones with fees and better perks. “Around the recession, we saw promotional innovation in the cash-back space,” said Andrew Davidson, a senior vice president of Mintel. “Now, I think we might start seeing more innovation around points and miles in the premium space.” The new Chase card has shaken things up, he said. “American Express and Citi will be forced to re-evaluate their cards’ value proposition.” Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Wells Fargo (WFC) stock dropped nearly 4% on Tuesday after the bank announced plans to abandon its sales targets where customers were sold multiple bank products. Employees have said that these unrealistic targets led to a pressure cooker environment that prompted them to create millions of fake accounts. On Thursday, Wells Fargo was fined $185 million and admitted to firing 5,300 employees related to the phony accounts. Overall, Wells Fargo's share price is only down 6% since the scandal broke. However, that's still enough to allow rival JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to surpass Wells Fargo in market value for the first time since early 2013, according to data from FactSet. Related: 5,300 Wells Fargo employees fired over 2 million phony accounts Wells Fargo's market cap dropped to $235 billion on Tuesday. That's about $4 billion less than JPMorgan's price tag. Wells Fargo has been embroiled in turmoil since federal regulators last week said the bank created more than two million phony bank and credit card accounts. The allegations have tarnished Wells Fargo's reputation and threatened a key money-maker for the company: the ability to sell customers multiple accounts, also known as "cross-selling."

Employees have told CNNMoney they were under incredible pressure to meet these targets -- or risk losing their jobs. Now Wells Fargo is also facing political repercussions. A spokesperson for U.S. Senator Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Senate banking committee, confirmed that the powerful committee plans to hold a hearing on the Wells Fargo scandal on September 20 and will invite Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf to attend. The decision to hold a hearing comes after Elizabeth Warren and four other Democratic U.S. Senators on Monday called for "immediate" hearings to "fully investigate the matter." While Wells Fargo was America's most valuable commercial bank for years, it still trailed JPMorgan in terms of who controlled more assets. Wells Fargo held nearly $1.7 trillion in assets as of the end of March, compared with more than $2 trillion at industry-leading JPMorgan, according to the Federal Reserve.

Grogan | CNBC Paul Singer Comments from major investors at the Delivering Alpha conference added fuel to an already sour mood in markets and concerns that the world's central banks just can't get it right. "With the rates that currently exist in global bond markets, the term safe haven applied to G-7 bonds is just plain wrong. These are not safe havens. There is a tremendous amount of risk in owning 10-, 20-, 30-year bonds at these rates," said Elliott Management President Paul Singer. "So sell long-term bonds is my outright recommendation of an asset class," he said. "And the reason I called it the biggest bubble in the world is because the bond market is $60 trillion, roughly. And it's at prices and yields never before seen and containing a tremendous never-before-seen asymmetry between potential further reward and risk." Investors also discussed the world's central banks and the fact that many view them as hitting a wall in terms of their ability to stimulate the global economy. The Federal Reserve has been slowly moving toward a rate hike, as it tries to swim against the tide of negative yields and massive easing programs by other central banks. "Did Singer help push it? Yeah. He said the exact same thing in August. The difference is even though (Fed Governor Lael) Brainard got all the press this weekend ... the difference is (ECB President Mario) Draghi on Thursday said we have to re-evaluate what we're doing. You had Singer. You had Jamie Dimon yesterday," said Andrew Brenner, global head of emerging markets, fixed income at National Alliance. JPMorgan CEO Dimon on Monday said it's time for the Fed to raise rates. The CNBC/Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference also coincided with a 30-year auction that traders described as weak. Rates moved higher after the auction, with the 30-year yield rising to 2.478 percent. The 10-year yield also rose, reaching 1.75 percent, the highest level since early June. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Draghi on Thursday surprised markets when he did not discuss the prospect of taking the further easing steps markets were expecting. "Look at what the Fed is doing and global central banks. I think they're beginning to rethink the efficacy of these ultra-low interest rates," said Bill Miller, chief investment officer of LMM. He told the conference that higher rates would not be an impediment to capital expenditures. "They are an impediment to the system. So I think just the rethinking of that policy is something that's likely to lead the curve to shift up." His recommendation was to short the U.S. 10-year note. Stocks sold off sharply Tuesday, with the Dow down more than 200 points in afternoon trading, reversing a large gain from the previous day. Shares rallied Monday after Brainard said the Fed should be patient about hiking interest rates, implying that the U.S. central bank would not raise rates when it meets next week. Equities sold off sharply on Friday after some hawkish Fed comments and after the ECB did not press further easing. Singer also discussed the popular risk parity trade, where investors bet that stocks and bonds will both go up together in a low rate environment. The unwind of that trade has been worrying the markets. "Today, we're just seeing a continuation of the post-Draghi bludgeoning," said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. "My take on it is it's post Draghi redux. There's anxiety that the day will come when QE ends. That's why you had such a correlation between stocks and bonds. The reaction would be very different if it really was Fed anxiety." Justin Lederer, rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the Treasury market also hit some key technical levels that added to the pressure. "There's a lot going on today. You started the day with just a continuation of (European government bonds) going down. Now we have the bond and equity trade. You couple everything together and I wouldn't put one thing behind today," he said. Lederer said the 30-year auction, which fared poorly, was also a factor. "To see this type of move, it's definitely something supply related going on," he said. "Then you have a lot of people talking about the Fed, talking about rates. ... We're at a crossroads here." Strategists say the markets had been too complacent, and the recent volatility around global rates is not unexpected. "(Bridgewater's Ray) Dalio came out earlier today and said the Fed shouldn't be raising rates," said Lederer. "What is the BOJ going to come out and do at their meeting next week?" Dalio appeared at the conference Tuesday morning. Separately, Nikkei reported during the afternoon that the Bank of Japan plans to take interest rates further into negative territory ahead of its meeting next week. The yen instantly weakened against the dollar, and the yield on the Japanese 10-year moved further into negative territory.

In the never-ending battle to be the biggest U.S. bank, the advantage now goes to JPMorgan Chase over Wells Fargo. On Tuesday, the New York colossus with a $240 billion market value passed the San Francisco giant, whose market value slipped to $235 billion. Back in 2012, Wells leaped ahead after JPMorgan struggled with massive losses after the infamous "London whale" trade. But now Wells has plenty of its own problems after federal regulators found that thousands of employees created sham accounts to meet internal sales targets. The back-and-forth between JPMorgan and Wells shows just how fleeting it is to be king of the banking hill. Indeed, in this era of too-big-to-fail banks, no institution seems eager to talk about just how very large it is and what sort of systemic risk it might pose to the financial system. At the moment, JPMorgan has a mind-blowing $2.5 trillion in assets and Wells has a nearly-as-mind-boggling $1.9 trillion. The folks who run JPMorgan and Wells are also well aware that not so long ago the largest bank by market value was Citigroup, a bank that over the past decade has inflicted plenty of pain on itself and U.S. taxpayers. Citi's market value today is about half that of JPMorgan or Wells.

Jon Marino | @JonMarino Tuesday, 13 Sep 2016 | 3:29 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Wall Street is hitting the brakes on car loans. The CEO of JPMorgan Chase's consumer and community banking segment, Gordon Smith, said this week at an industry conference in New York that his company is backing away from the longest types of auto loans, because they could face greater stress in an economic downturn. "We decided to do a lot less lending" in the 84-month term loan category, he said Monday at the Barclays 2016 Global Financial Services Conference. "Should we see a downturn in the economy ... that will be an area that is more stressed," he added. At Wells Fargo, which also appeared at the event, the bank added $150 million to reserves in the second quarter, "primarily driven by loan growth in the commercial, auto and credit card portfolios." However, during its presentation Tuesday, much of its Q&A session was dedicated not to auto lending, but to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau action against the bank after thousands of staffers pushed consumers into accounts for which they did not sign up. Alex Coopel | Herald Sun | Getty Images Some highlights from the JPMorgan Chase presentation suggested that, for now, auto lending could continue at a robust pace. The bank noted in its presentation that auto loan delinquencies are not on the rise. This isn't the first time this year a leader at JPMorgan has sounded the alarm on growing debt for car purchases. In June, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said "someone is going to get hurt" on auto loans, which are hitting all-time highs. Earlier this year, the total amount of auto loans for consumers hit the $1 trillion mark for the first time. Others have taken note of the wide range of credit in the auto loan space. Speaking Tuesday at the Barclays event, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank told attendees that the amount of capital "has backed off" recently, and that he has witnessed competitors taking on excessive risk with borrowers. He added that, after making fewer auto loans in the fourth quarter of 2015, the bank has done more lending to car buyers this year.
