By Daniel Shane Biography April 29, 2017 It’s a favorite topic in Hong Kong’s traditional cha chaan teng , or tea shops: How much higher can property prices go? Housing in the Asian finance hub is already the world’s most unaffordable, having surged nearly 200% since the financial crisis in late 2008.

The Atlanta Fed said it also adjusted its final GDPNow model forecast from last week's 0.5 percent based on a decline in the contribution from inventory investment. Most economists on Wall Street have higher forecasts, but JPMorgan Chase cut its first-quarter growth forecast to 0.3 percent Thursday after trimming it to 0.4 percent Wednesday, and Macroeconomic Advisers sliced its tracking forecast to 0.3 percent. The official first-quarter GDP reading will be out Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists mostly expect second-quarter growth to pick up, and many blame first-quarter weakness on a soft patch and weather. Macroeconomic Advisers raised their forecast for the second quarter to 3.7 percent, based on the anticipated impact of inventories investment. "The forecast of first-quarter real consumer spending growth fell from 0.3 percent to 0.1 percent after yesterday's annual retail trade revision by the U.S. Census Bureau. The forecast of the contribution of inventory investment to first-quarter growth declined from -0.76 percentage points to -1.11 percentage points after this morning's advance reports on durable manufacturing and wholesale and retail inventories from the Census Bureau," the Atlanta Fed said. However, the forecast of real equipment investment growth rose to 6.6 percent from 5.5 percent, after the durable manufacturing report Thursday, and the inclusion of data on the sales of light trucks to businesses. Durable goods orders for March rose 0.7 percent, below the 1.2 percent forecast by economists. The JPMorgan economists cut their view from 0.6 percent on Wednesday, after reviewing the same annual revisions to retail sales data, which reflected a softer trend of consumer spending. CNBC/Moody's Analytics Rapid Update, based on a survey of economists, showed average growth forecasts for the first quarter at 0.9 percent Thursday. Economists also saw growth tracking at an average 0.8 percent, based on actual data releases so far. A Census Bureau report Wednesday reduced retail sales growth to 3.7 percent, from 4 percent. But the control retail sales, used to calculate GDP, fell from 4.1 percent to 3 percent, JPMorgan said. That figure excludes food services, auto dealers, gasoline stations and building materials outlets. "We now think that real consumption increased only 0.6 percent saar in 1Q [previously: 0.9 percent]," they wrote. In March, retail sales slipped by a surprise 0.2 percent, the second straight monthly decline.

Women in Banking Tackling income volatility; New CMO at Citi Why there's a gold rush for bank tech in Europe Bank-fee-killing service rolled out by fintech firm search goes here JPMorgan defection underscores tough blockchain choices By Penny Crosman Published April 28 2017, 1:58pm EDT More in Blockchain Distributed ledger technology Bank technology JPMorgan Chase R3 Print Email Reprints Share Share on The news that JPMorgan Chase left the R3 blockchain consortium speaks to the challenges ahead for any group that aims to get thousands of financial institutions to agree on a shared set of technologies and principles. “This just shows the experimental stage blockchain and distributed ledger technology is at right now,” observed Chris Skinner, chairman of the Financial Services Club, a networking group for senior executives in Europe. “There may well be multiple distributed ledger systems in financial services over the next decade. Then we will be working on interoperability and standards between ledgers. It reminds me of the old discussions of standards. ‘Sure, we got standards. Which one do you want?’” The original blockchain was created to track the movement of bitcoin, a digital currency, without the need to trust a centralized third party. The basic concept – a set of shared data that multiple connected parties agree on as valid – has been enthusiastically embraced by the financial services industry. Many bankers and technologists say it will help them handle things like securities trades, payments and contracts in a faster, simpler, more efficient and cheaper way than they do today. But agreement as to exactly what that distributed ledger should look like does not yet exist. Need to know A diagram of Quorum, the smart contract platform JPMorgan is building. According to the white paper, the design aims to "prevent all except those party to the transaction from seeing sensitive data." Github Several models have attracted adherents: the IBM-led Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project, which is building a blockchain built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric, has 122 members, including Wells Fargo, BBVA, JPMorgan Chase, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and American Express. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which is building a blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, has more than 30 financial services and technology members including JPMorgan Chase and Intel. R3, which is creating a “blockchain-inspired” distributed ledger called Corda, has 84 members, including Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street, and UBS. JPMorgan’s departure from R3 follows on the heels of defections last year by Goldman Sachs, Banco Santander, Morgan Stanley and National Australian Bank. The banks’ reasons for leaving varied. While still a member of the Hyperledger and Ethereum consortia, JPMorgan is also going it alone with a distributed ledger it’s building in-house called Quorum. Quorum is based on the Go Ethereum client, a software program that supports the Ethereum network. In a white paper, the bank outlines how its blockchain will handle data and contract privacy and consensus mechanisms (the process by which different computers agree on the order and legitimacy of transactions on the network). The bank’s decision to use Ethereum was at odds with R3’s decision not to use that system. “Ethereum was a platform we looked at and decided was not fit for purpose,” said Charley Cooper, managing director of R3. Objections among the membership included issues around privacy controls, scalability, immutability of transactions, and consensus mechanisms for validating transactions, Cooper said. R3 originally hoped to use an existing blockchain model like Ethereum, he explained. “When we first launched the company, we were in an ‘adapt or build’ mentality,” Cooper said. “Our thinking was, it would be easier if there was solution fit for purpose, if something out there was close we could adapt it to our needs, but meanwhile we’re going to build something in parallel, a platform fit for purpose for financial services. Ethereum was not deemed by R3’s experts and our members to be appropriate for the financial services industry.” By press time, JPMorgan had not responded to a request for an interview. Other banks have left R3 because they balked at the money it wanted them to pay to help fund the development of Corda, industry sources said. Last May, the group reportedly sought to raise $200 million from members (it later was said to cut the target to $150 million). “That was not the direction expected when these firms were already paying substantial amounts just to be a member of the consortia,” Skinner said. (Dues are in the six figures, according to market sources and published reports.) “It was this, in my view, that caused some of the founders to question where R3 were going.” Yet R3 is still in a strong position, he noted, with many banks still involved in Corda.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: JPMorgan Chase's Customer Satisfaction Scores Aren't What You'd Expect Despite people’s general enmity toward big banks, the nation’s largest bank by assets scores high when it comes to customer satisfaction. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Apr 30, 2017 at 9:29AM The nation's biggest banks have gotten a bad name over the past decade, given their role in the financial crisis combined with the recent sales scandal at Wells Fargo. But there's one big bank that's bucking the trend: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). This week, J.D. Power released its 2017 U.S. retail banking satisfaction survey. The results show that JPMorgan Chase earned a higher customer satisfaction score than the average bank in all 11 of the geographic regions broken out by the survey. State/Region JPMorgan Chase Average Score California 819 812 Florida 834 829 Mid-Atlantic 821 816 Midwest 825 810 New England 819 800 North Central 823 821 Northwest 814 804 South Central 837 831 Southeast 822 820 Southwest 827 817 Texas 832 831 Data source: J.D. Power's 2017 U.S. Retail Banking Satisfaction Survey. Its best performance was in the South Central region, covering Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The nation's largest bank by assets scored 837 out of 1,000 in the region compared with the average score among other banks of 831. State/Region JPMorgan Chase's 2017 Score JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Score California 819 792 Florida 834 824 Mid-Atlantic 821 795 Midwest 825 797 New England 819 762 North Central 823 812 Northwest 814 776 South Central 837 809 Southeast 822 804 Southwest 827 798 Texas 832 806 Data source: J.D. Power. JPMorgan Chase also saw its score improve from the previous year. Its average score among the regions in 2016 was 798. This year it improved to 825, equating to a 3.4% gain. By contrast, the average bank's score last year was 793, while the average this year was 817, translating into a 3% gain. Consequently, JPMorgan Chase is outperforming a majority of its peers not only on a static basis when it comes to its customer satisfaction score this year, but also on a dynamic basis, as it improved at a faster pace compared with last year. JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. "[C]ustomer satisfaction is at the center of everything we do," wrote Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon in his latest letter to shareholders. "Each business has gained market share -- which is possible only when you are improving customer satisfaction and your products and services relative to the competition." One can point to a lot of reasons JPMorgan Chase is the most dominant force in banking today, but to Dimon's point, customer satisfaction certainly seems to be one of them.

Israel Conley, 20, was arrested Aug. 19 on more than a dozen charges of fraud and larceny. The Boca Raton man had been working at the branch at 240 East Palmetto Park Road for about two months when he allegedly started withdrawing thousands of dollars from customer accounts in July, the report said. His victims were mostly elderly customers, ranging from 57-years-old to 99-years-old, police said. On August 16, the branch manager alerted a corporate investigator about some suspicious transactions she came across during an audit. Conley had processed $36,800 in withdrawls, but the customer withdrawl slips were written in the same handwriting, according to the report. It turns out he forged customer signatures to withdraw large lumps of money from at least six accounts, including a hair extension business, according to the report. He then deposited the stolen cash into his own account at the bank. On Aug. 17, Conley reportedly admitted to a corporate investigator that he had embezzled at least $31,500. He later told police that he took the money to pay his personal bills, the report states. He told them he chose his victims randomly. The branch manager and a JP Morgan Chase spokeswoman declined Wednesday to comment on the case. The victims' accounts have been reimbursed, the report states. Conley was released from the Palm Beach County jail Saturday on a $20,000 bond, jail records show. He has no previous criminal history in Florida, according to state records.

It was also just announced that Barack Obama, following in the well-heeled footsteps of Bill and Hillary Clinton, will be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for giving a speech on behalf of a Wall Street firm. Anyone who thinks these two facts aren’t connected isn’t paying attention. Obama’s payday reflects a longstanding pattern of behavior from Democratic leaders: Talk like liberals, govern from the center, and make a lot of money once you’re out of office. Their policies better than Trump’s and the GOP’s, but that adds even more bite to that poll’s other major finding: Democrats are viewed as even more out of touch with everyday concerns than Trump, a twitter-happy billionaire president who weekends at his palatial estate. Democrats need a better message, to be sure. But they also need messengers who will walk the walk after they have talked the talk. No Surprise Barack Obama’s $400,000 speaking fee, from investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, shouldn’t surprise anyone. Obama courted Wall Street leaders like Jamie Dimon, CEO of scandal-plagued serial lawbreaker JP Morgan Chase, until it became politically unfeasible to do so during his re-election campaign. (Dimon was once described as Obama’s “favorite banker.”) In 2009, after Wall Street’s criminality shattered the economy and ruined millions of American lives, Obama famously told Wall Street’s top CEOs, “My administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks.” In the years that followed, Obama’s Justice Department failed to prosecute a single bank executive for that criminality. Even when regulators identified the individuals responsible for criminal behavior, as they did with GE Capital, the Justice Department failed to follow up. For his part, Obama appointed the CEO of GE Capital’s parent corporation to a prestigious economic position. Obama chose Wall Street-friendly figures Eric Holder and Tim Geithner to lead the Justice and Treasury departments, respectively. He then followed Bill Clinton’s lead by overseeing a revolving door between his administration and Wall Street’s biggest banks (most notably Citigroup, the banking behemoth forged in a merger pushed by top appointees in the Clinton Administration). As the nation has learned under Donald Trump, a president’s pronouncements can have a powerful effect on legal actions. When Obama pre-emptively declared that Wall Street executives had not broken the law – an opinion not shared by experts like William K. Black, Jr. – that very possibly had a chilling effect on prosecutors in the field. It certainly sent a signal to lower-level appointees in his own Justice Department. The Victims It may be overly cynical to see these large fees as payment for services rendered, but Obama’s record on these matters – like Bill Clinton’s before him – certainly didn’t help that perception. At best, these speeches reflect the insular worldview of privileged insiders who neither understand nor fully empathize with the victims of lawbreaking bankers. Dozens of those victims reached out to me in 2010, when I first began writing on the subject, and their emails were heartbreaking. (Their plight was well-documented in David Dayen’s book, Chain of Title.) Millions of Americans have either been defrauded by an American bank or know someone who has been. They have seen the Democratic Party’s three most prominent leaders – two ex-presidents, along with a former First Lady, senator, two-time presidential candidate and former Secretary of State – earn millions by hobnobbing with the same bankers who ruined their lives, their friends’ lives, or their communities. The Sponsor Now, Barack Obama is joining their ranks. Cantor Fitzgerald suffered unspeakable tragedy on 9/11. But it has also been fined for a number of violations of the law. One fine was levied for selling unregistered shares and failing to check for money laundering. Another was aiding and abetting fraud. Another, record-setting fine was imposed on a Cantor subsidiary for illegal betting in Las Vegas. Then there’s the speech’s setting, which is typically described as Cantor’s “annual healthcare conference.” It is a healthcare investment conference, where wealthy investors and for-profit healthcare corporations mingle in pursuit of mutually advantageous deals. The press release for the first conference explains: “The full-day conference will provide institutional investors with access to over 70 public and private healthcare companies, and an opportunity to explore investment opportunities and learn about current major healthcare topics.” At a time when the Affordable Care Act is fighting for its life, Obama will be speaking to a group of business people, including pharmaceutical corporations, who have gathered to make money from our nation’s beleaguered healthcare economy. For-profit healthcare isn’t the solution to our health crisis: it’s a principal cause. The Loyalists And yet, many Democratic loyalists refuse to see a connection between behavior like this and the Democratic Party’s low polling numbers and electoral failures at all levels. A typical exchange: The New Republic’s Brian Beutler responded to criticism of Obama’s speaking fee and a recent publicity campaign for Chelsea Clinton by tweeting, “Chelsea shouldn’t run, Obama shouldn’t buckrake, the obsession with them as the Trumps set up a bribery fund is giving me campaign PTSD.” That is consistent with the often-expressed opinion that Democrats shouldn’t “re-litigate” the 2016 Democratic primary race. Nobody wants to induce needless trauma. And yet, however painful it may be for some to consider, the Democrats have a problem: fully two-thirds of the American people feel that they don’t understand their problems. Many Democrats remain fiercely loyal to Obama and the Clintons, and they can be surprisingly protective of their leaders. They need to understand that these high-dollar Wall Street paydays undermine confidence in their party. They alienate “persuadables” and make it less likely that the Democratic base will show up to vote in sufficient numbers. (So does the appearance that elected office is a familial privilege, but that is a topic for another day.) It is not “obsession” that leads people to criticize this behavior, pace Beutler, but a desire to stop Trump’s GOP and the recognized need for better policy. Like it or not, the behavior of top Democrats reflects on the party, and their coziness with the wealthy limits their ability to propose truly transformative economic ideas. The Alternative What’s to be done? The solution is already visible to all those who care to see: Run candidates who have no interest in flattering the ultra-wealthy or becoming wealthy themselves. Bernie Sanders is the most conspicuous example – there is a reason why he’s the most popular politician in the country today – but there are others. Two members of Congress, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, are activists who take a movement-oriented approach to elected office. (Here’s a video interview on that subject with Rep. Jayapal.) The citizen-candidates who came forward during the recent Rise Up conference (shown here with Sen. Bernie Sanders), together with those recruited by Our Revolution and other grassroots groups, represent a new wave of politician/activists.

He ran for president campaigning on a promise to renogotiate trade agreements like NAFTA. As President he supported policies that contradicted those views and met with the approval of those who are paying him now. The $400K is a message to the Democratic party's established order and current office holders. The message is: "Prevent the revolutionaries from taking over the party and you'll be taken care of". But I think they're going to fail in that. Their tactics are adding fuel to the revolution. Successful democrats in the future will be those who invite the enmity of the oligarchs. I'm sure that Bernie Sanders would be glad to deliver a speech to Wall Street firms at no charge. But I don't think they'll like what he would say to them.

The most accurate description of Obama by far was Cornel West's scathing statement that our pal Barry was nothing more than a “Rockefeller Republican in blackface”. Although Obama talks a good game, and appealed to many because he looked like a black man who might "get it" and want to help those other than himself and the wealthy, he was/is nothing more than a dark skinned shill for the ultra-rich white class. The myth that Obama was raised as a poor black child is belied by the fact that from 5th grade until his high school graduation he attended school at Punahou in Hawaii - one of the most exclusive schools in the country, and the place where many US military officers and other elites in Hawaii send their kids for education. So it should be no surprise that he is cashing in so big and so quickly. If he cared about the optics of this at all, now that there's been a public outcry he would announce that he is going to donate his entire speaking fee to the families of Cantor Fitzgerald employees who were lost in the 9/11 attack.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday May 1, 2017 Opinion Larger / SmallerNight Mode We're slaves to new products, but no closer to happiness RICHARD GRUNER 14 Sep 2012, 7:08 p.m. Economic wheels must turn but how far to go until we feel the burn? We're slaves to new products, but no closer to happiness Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit OPINION You would like the new iPhone 5. That's not even a question. You would. Why wouldn't you? It is new, probably faster, and definitely shinier than your old phone. When the new model is released in Australia on September 21, vast numbers of people are expected to line up outside Apple stores. Some might even sleep out on the pavement the night before. Breakfast TV programs will dispatch journalists to breathlessly report the phenomenon. But at what cost? Perhaps it is time for us to question our perpetual product cravings, and accept that "old", "used", and even "broken" are not dirty words. Only 75 years ago we consumed half as much as we do today, and we were no less happy because of it. What (or who) is it that makes us crave new products and queue up outside the store hours, and even days, before their launch?  Our past experiences of new products - in-your-face advertising, clever marketing techniques, word-of-mouth ploys, and so on - certainly play a role in our behaviour. But that may be just part of the picture. A glimpse at the bigger picture reveals that our product cravings are as essential to our economy's stability as jobs, exports and interest rates. Global financial services company JPMorgan Chase recently estimated that the release of the iPhone 5 could add up to one-half of a percentage point to the gross domestic product growth rate of the struggling United States economy. And that's just one product! Today's consumer culture has been manufactured and composed in response to the very real need for ever higher levels of consumption of millions of products. We now even have the concept of ''planned obsolescence'', where companies intentionally design products with a limited shelf life. This forces customers to buy the same (or similar) product again in the future. (You might consider it the technological equivalent of shampoo companies urging users to ''rinse and repeat''.) Some question the ethics of intentionally designing a product to be obsolete within just a few years - and long for the time when things were built to last - but the economic benefits are undeniable. It's all part of what drives ''infinite growth''. And it's why a lot of companies spend as much on advertising as they do on actually creating new products. Companies have created this perceived ''need'' in their customers. And, conveniently, they are right there to meet these needs through constant innovation. Businesses cannot continue to offer the same unchanged product for very long if they wish to make a profit and continue to grow. Does that mean that our hunger for product innovations is bad? On one hand, it is the lifeblood of companies, our economy and society at large. The world as we know it might just collapse if we stopped designing, making, buying and selling snazzy new products. (At least, so we're told.) On the other hand, what's at stake here might be nothing less than our happiness - a deep happiness that goes well beyond the short-lived thrill of bringing home a new phone, car or computer. For most of us, our sense of prosperity does not depend on owning the latest gadgets. Neither does it depend on other success measures we tend to apply to our lives, such as outperforming a competitor, or having the smartest and fastest kid at school. As contemporary Swiss-born philosopher Alain de Botton tells us, "wealth does not involve having many things". It is more about having what we long for. Wealth is relative to desire. It is not absolute. Every time we seek something we cannot afford, we grow poorer, regardless of how much money we have. And every time we stop our hunt for the new and feel satisfied with what we have, we can be counted as rich. In other words, we are rich in proportion to the things we can do without. Political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau knew this in the late 1700s - before cars, computers and credit cards - when he said: "Our souls rarely articulate what they must have in order to be satisfied, or when they do mumble something, their commands are likely to be misfounded or contradictory." Perhaps it is time for us to distinguish between what we want, what companies tell us we need, and what we really need. And that's something that no shiny new product, not even one carrying a fruity logo, can do for you. Dr Richard L. Gruner is a marketing research fellow at the University of Melbourne's faculty of business and economics.

(File photo: Bill Klotz) Regional banks waiting on Trump era promise By: Bloomberg News April 27, 2017 1:10 pm 0 For regional banks across the U.S., the “Trump bump” hasn’t yet translated into business. Bank stocks have climbed since Donald Trump was elected president as investors bet his pro-growth agenda and rising interest rates would help lenders generate huge profits. But this month, executives at some of the country’s largest regional banks said customers, especially corporations and small businesses, are instead waiting for details on the new administration’s proposals and results before seeking financing for expansion. Total loans at the 15 largest U.S. regional banks declined by about $10 billion to $1.73 trillion in the first quarter, compared with the previous three-month period, the first such drop in four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. All but two of those banks missed analysts’ estimates for total loans, as a slump in commercial and industrial lending sapped growth. “The optimism and the willingness is there, but it has not yet translated into actions or behaviors,” Beth Mooney, chief executive officer of KeyCorp, said of the Cleveland-based bank’s small and middle-market business clients. “We did not see ‘flip the switch’ sort of behavior that led to loan demand or making different capital decisions or investment decisions.” Their view from Main Street contrasts with Wall Street, where global investment banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley announced jumps in earnings from fixed-income trading units that help big investors speculate on bonds, currencies and commodities. The irony is that some types of businesses broadly criticized during the presidential campaign are now profiting most. The last of the 15 largest regional banks reported quarterly results Wednesday. Some said other developments also weighed on lending. They cited instances of clients turning directly to investors for financing, tapping into their optimism for growth under Trump. And many traditional retailers are struggling in the internet era. Within commercial lending, big corporations have been reticent to take out new loans, instead tapping capital markets for their needs, said Terry Dolan, chief financial officer at Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, the nation’s largest regional bank. “We saw a number of our bigger customers go to the bond markets and issue debt and take out credit, so that was a factor” weighing on loan growth in the first quarter, said Citizens Financial Group Inc. CEO  Bruce Van Saun, whose firm is based in Providence, Rhode Island. “The nice corollary to that is that our capital-markets fees are exploding.” Manufacturers in the rust belt are drawing unprecedented inquiries from buyers overseas, said Stephen Steinour, CEO of Huntington Bancshares Inc., Ohio’s third-largest lender. Still, he said, “there’s an expectation that there’s going to be policy changes and those policy changes might have ramifications, so there’s a little bit of a wait and see going on here.” Many regional lenders began to break out their exposure to retailers and the underlying real estate that supports it after investors and analysts voiced concerns about credit quality. The pace of store closings this year is already ahead of 2008, the most recent peak, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse Group AG. “Retail is an industry that’s going through a secular change” as more people shop online, said Darren King, M&T Bank Corp.’s CFO. “How far it will go, and how fast it will go, and what the knock-on effects are remain to be seen.” Share this: Print Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Google 1:10 pm Thu, April 27, 2017 Finance & Commerce Bloomberg News Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Read This Before Applying for a Cash-Back Credit Card Here are the three most important things you should know before applying for a cash-back rewards credit card. Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Apr 30, 2017 at 12:00PM Cash-back rewards cards can be a powerful tool for your wallet. Used correctly, the best cards reward cardholders with the equivalent of a 2% discount on every purchase. Some cards offer beefier cash-back bonuses in special categories like gas and restaurants, where spending can earn at a rate of 5% or more. Over time, rewards can really add up. But there are three things you should know before you apply for a cash-back credit card. 1. If you carry a balance, it isn't worth it Rewards simply don't matter if you carry a balance. High rewards and high APRs go hand in hand. Of the numerous cards we've reviewed at Fool.com, the lowest APR is currently 13.74%. That card doesn't have a rewards program.  In fact, the cards we consider the best cash-back cards of 2017 have a midpoint APR ranging from 17% to 21%. At that interest rate, as little as 45 days of interest completely eliminates any cash-back benefits. We assume that people who are in the market for a good cash-back card will pay the balance in full every month, otherwise the math just doesn't work. Picking a credit card isn't a choice to be made in a vacuum. Transferring a $5,000 credit card balance at an 18% APR to a balance-transfer card with 15 months of 0% interest can save a cardholder $620 in interest over the period. To receive the same $620 in benefits on a 2% cash-back card, one would need to charge $31,000 in purchases. To put it simply, people with credit card debt would be better served looking for lower APRs than cash-back rewards. 2. Mind the minimum redemption The best rewards are those that can be redeemed quickly and easily. Depending on the program, some cardholders may be forced to wait months before making their first redemption. Below, I've compiled Fool.com's top choices in cash-back rewards cards, and compared them on the basis of minimum redemptions and required spending to meet the payout threshold. Note the vast disparities in spending required to meet the redemption minimum. Credit Card Rewards Program Minimum Redemption Ordinary Spending Required to Redeem BankAmericard Cash Rewards 3% on gas, 2% on groceries and wholesale clubs, 1% on all else* $25.00 $2,500 Barclaycard CashForward World Mastercard Unlimited 1.5% cash back (5% bonus on redemption) $50.00 $3,334 Chase Freedom Unlimited Unlimited 1.5% cash back No minimum No minimum Citi Double Cash Card Unlimited 2% cash back (1% for purchases, plus 1% when balances are paid off) $25.00 $1,250 Discover it Card 1% cash back, 5% in rotating categories No minimum No minimum Data source: Card companies. *The BankAmericard Cash Rewards card's rewards can be enhanced by up to 75%, depending on the cardholder's banking status. The importance of a minimum redemption amount depends on how much you spend each month. For those who spend more than $3,334 per month, all of these cards would allow for a monthly redemption. Those who use credit sparingly may have to swipe for months before reaching the minimum redemption amount.  Higher minimum redemptions increase the odds that rewards are left stranded as a cardholder abandons one card to make use of another. All else equal, we prefer cards with a lower minimum redemption threshold. A few cents here and a dollar there can really add up. Image source: Getty Images. 3. The big money is in the new cardholder bonus While getting 1% to 2% cash back on every purchase can add up quickly, the big value is in one-time bonuses that card companies use to entice new customers. Think of the new cardholder bonus period as a period of supercharged rewards. A card that offers $150 in cash back for spending $500 in the first 90 days (Chase Freedom Unlimited) effectively earns at a 30% clip on the first $500 of spending. Add the regular 1.5% rewards rate on top, and the cash-back rewards rate grows to 31.5% on the first $500 of purchases. Credit Card New Cardholder Bonus Minimum Spending Requirement BankAmericard Cash Rewards $100 $500 on purchases in the first 90 days of account opening Barclaycard CashForward World Mastercard $200 $1,000 on purchases in the first 90 days of account opening Chase Freedom Unlimited $150 $500 on purchases in the first three months of account opening Citi Double Cash Card No bonus N/A Discover it Card Unlimited (rewards earned in the first 12 billing cycles are doubled) No minimum or maximum Data source: Card companies. Use this information to your advantage to consider the break-even period. For example, the Citi Double Cash Card pays at an effective rate of 2%, while Chase Freedom Unlimited earns at a 1.5% rate. While 2% cash back may appear to be better than 1.5% cash back at first glance, this isn't always the case. Due to the new cardholder bonus, the rewards earned by Citi Double Cash eclipse the Chase Freedom Unlimited only after $30,000 in spending. The math for the breakeven is as follows: $150 bonus / (2% - 1.5%) = $30,000 Reaching $30,000 in credit card spending may take just a few months for high earners and spenders. For others, it make take several years. It's usually uneconomical to pay by credit card for most major expenses (mortgage servicers, insurers, and utility companies often charge a convenience fee for card payments), so it's unrealistic for most people to assume that every single dollar spent can be put on a cash-back credit card. A family with $35,000 in annual expenses may only have $10,000 in potential credit card spending each year, for example, as big recurring expenses are paid by check or ACH, while others, including medical bills, are paid with tax-advantaged accounts like health savings accounts. Seeking perfection can be overwhelming. Realistically, one might need as many as 10 cards to ensure that every dime of their spending earns at the highest possible rate. Rather than obsess about getting an extra 0.25% cash back on every dollar spent, it's best to try to thread the needle to get the most cash-back rewards with one or two cards, but certainly no more than a few. No one needs five pounds of plastic cluttering up their wallet. Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Mastercard.

Devidutta TripathySudarshan Varadhan Solar power generation capacity in India has more than tripled in less than three years to over 12 GW. Mumbai/New Delhi: Some of the world’s biggest pension funds, seeking long-term returns on green investments, are scouting for deals in India’s solar power sector, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is targeting $100 billion in investment in the next five years. Power demand in Asia’s third-largest economy is set to surge as the economy grows and more people move into the cities. India estimates peak electricity demand will more than quadruple in the next two decades to 690 gigawatt (GW), which would require rapid growth in generation and transmission capacity. That potential, helped by cheaper solar material costs and government efforts to curb pollution, is drawing global investors, including Canada’s top pension fund managers—Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), and Ontario Teacher’s Pension Plan (OTPP). Investors’ focus is primarily on solar power generation, funding large-scale solar parks. CDPQ, which has C$270.7 billion ($199 billion) in net assets, says it plans to invest in India’s solar sector with Azure Power, a New York-listed firm with about 1 GW of solar capacity under various stages of development. “We plan to do more with them. Our approach is really to pick the right partner and then build a platform that can be sustained over several years,” said Anita George, CDPQ’s South Asia head, adding she wouldn’t rule out investing in other solar ventures in future. Other international investors have already entered India’s renewable energy sector, such as Dutch fund manager APG, Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management, the private equity arms of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, and European utilities EDF, Engie and Enel. APG Asset Management, which last year agreed to jointly invest $132 million with India’s Piramal Enterprises into solar power, is looking for more deals. “We expect to be able to announce another investment in the Indian renewable energy sector in the coming months,” said Hans-Martin Aerts, APG’s infrastructure head for Asia Pacific. Alok Verma, an executive director at Kotak Investment Banking, which has advised companies on renewable deals, said he expects at least 5 GW of solar power to be added from next year, most of it supported by overseas funds. Aiming high Solar power generation capacity in India has more than tripled in less than three years to over 12 GW, helped by lower module prices and borrowing costs, and a government drive - but that is still only around 4% of total power capacity of about 315 GW. China, the world’s biggest solar producer, more than doubled its capacity last year, to 77.42 GW. Suyi Kim, Asia Pacific head at CPPIB, Canada’s largest pension manager, said solar appears more attractive in India than wind power. “In India, my impression is that solar seems to be more attractive. But it’s case by case,” she said. India typically logs more than 300 days of sunshine a year. Kim declined to comment on any specific investment plans, but two people with knowledge of developments said CPPIB was scouting for deals. Funding and M&A in India’s solar sector amounted to around $1.6 billion in January-March, says research firm Mercom. While deal sizes have been relatively small, some companies such as Japan’s SoftBank, along with partners, have pledged to invest $20 billion in Indian solar power generation projects. SoftBank said the timeline for investments would depend on state and central governments. “We remain committed to building a GW-scale portfolio of solar projects in India,” said Raman Nanda, CEO of SB Energy, a joint venture of SoftBank, Foxconn Technology Group and Bharti Enterprises. “We will do this through strategic partnerships.” Not all sunshine None of this comes without risk, of course. Investors could face payment delays from India’s heavily-indebted power distribution firms, and some experts note that the bidding for projects in government auctions is too aggressive, with per unit prices slumping more than 70% since 2010. “Getting returns on investments ... and getting paid by distribution companies are the major risks being assessed by foreign investors,” said Sumant Sinha, CEO at ReNew Power, a renewable energy firm backed by Goldman. Intermittency - power is only produced under bright sunlight - is another issue, as there are additional costs for using inverters or diesel generators to use solar power at night. “Based on current market conditions and policies, I see a path to 65-70 GW (solar capacity) by 2022, but not more,” said Mercom CEO Raj Prabhu. That’s still some way short of the government pledge for 100 GW by 2022. “To reach 100 GW by 2022, distribution company finances need to improve drastically, power demand has to increase quickly, and transmission infrastructure needs to keep up,” Prabhu said.

The family of Philip Abrahams, who died of cardiac arrest in 2012, accused the bank of turning a blind eye as aide Trudy Weste Williams forged his signature to give herself power of attorney and control over his funds. His niece, Christine Adams, sued JPMorgan Chase last year. A judge said there wasn’t enough evidence of wrongdoing by Chase and let the bank off the hook.

The Russell 1000 Growth index, which tracks such shares, is up 10.9 per cent so far this year, outpacing the US benchmark S&P 500 stock index’s 6.6 per cent rise and the 2.8 per cent advance of the Russell 1000 Value index. And it’s not just a US phenomenon. Growth stocks — whose profits are expected to grow at a faster pace than the broader market — are also outperforming their value counterparts in Asia and Europe. Still, the appeal of riskier stocks perceived as better positioned to ride an accelerating global earnings tailwind, as opposed to those with a greater cushion of safety, is nowhere as far ahead as it is on Wall Street. In the United States, an improving outlook for corporate earnings should help keep growth names in vogue, according to John Praveen, Chief Investment Strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. The average estimate of analysts for earnings per share growth this year of S&P 500 companies has risen to 11.3 per cent from 10.9 per cent at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters data, a trend that should continue to blunt concerns about lofty growth valuations. “When you have an earnings recovery, growth stocks will outperform. When you don’t have good earnings, that’s when people are looking for value,” said Praveen. Hopes for pro-business US policy changes under the administration of President Donald Trump will likely also keep expectations for economic growth elevated, helping to maintain the case for growth stocks. “The value stocks have done okay but growth has done so much better in the anticipation we’ll see a pickup in economic growth,” said Paul Nolte, Portfolio Manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “Companies that are going to be more levered to economic growth tend to be growth stocks.” “Right now I don’t see a long term condition for value stocks to outperform growth,” said Nolte. To be sure, some strategists are less convinced that growth stock outperformance will continue indefinitely. While value stocks, which are cheaper relative to their earnings potential, have tended to do better in slower growth environments historically, JP Morgan Asset Management’s global market strategist David Lebovitz says that trend has been changing. “It’s not going to be smooth sailing for one or the other. We think there’ll be times people are more optimistic about the economy and in those cases, value can rally. Then you’ll see periods where people are less optimistic about the economy, as we’ve seen over the course of the first quarter,” he said. If economic trends look better in the second quarter, value stocks will do better, Lebovitz said. In Asia, the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan growth index, is up 18.5 per cent so far this year, compared with a 12.6 per cent gain for the comparable MSCI value index. Investment in India, traditionally a growth-driven market, has adjusted in recent years as value stocks have narrowed the gap with growth, which still lead, said Jayesh Shroff, co-founder of investment advisory Cask Capital in Mumbai. “That is because people were paying a premium for growth and somehow the growth did not materialize. That’s why value came back and growth has taken a slight back seat,” said Shroff. Still, he said as soon as growth returns, he expects investors to switch their focus back from value. In China, between 2009 and the 2015 stock market crash, small-cap growth stocks were the market’s darlings, but “a new rotation into value blue-chip investments started in 2016,” according to Zhou Liang, fund manager at Shanghai Minority Asset Management Co. “In 2017, money will flow into blue-chips, as small-caps weaken and lose their lustre,” said Zhou. In Europe, the best outlook for corporate profits in seven years has ignited investor appetite for growth stocks, which are now up twice as much as their value counterparts so far this year, a reversal of the trend seen last year. As a result the MSCI International Europe growth Index  has jumped 8.9 per cent this year so far, compared with a 4.5 per cent gain for the MSCI International Europe Value index. With such a big gap between US growth and value stocks, some investors are eying overseas investments. “The entire US market is very expensive. Value investors definitely don’t like to chase expensive valuations,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “I wouldn’t expect to see a rotation until you saw a correction where both stock types are lower.” — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← EU sets Britain tough divorce terms, slams budget veto Bank Sohar’s net profit increases over 43 pc → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Oman, Korea to further strengthen strong ties Pension Fund building opens in Salalah Cooperation in education discussed PACP warns against price hike during Ramadhan Read More ...

Strong global growth is making up for the lack of activity domestically. S&P 500 companies which generate more than half their revenue overseas are posting first quarter earnings growth of 19.9 percent, on average, double that of companies that conduct a majority of their business domestically, according to FactSet. Evelyn Cheng | @chengevelyn 5 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Bernardo De Niz | Bloomberg | Getty Images Machinery made by Caterpillar Inc. operates at a demonstration in Tianjin, China. So far this earnings season, the less a U.S. company is exposed to America, the better its results. S&P 500 companies which generate more than half their revenue overseas are posting first quarter earnings growth of 19.9 percent, on average, double that of companies that conduct a majority of their business domestically, according to FactSet. About 60 percent of the S&P 500 has reported results. That helps explain the gap between the strong quarterly results and sluggish economic data like Friday's report showing U.S. GDP increased at just 0.7 percent in the first quarter, its slowest pace in three years. In fact, CNBC analysis found that the difference between earnings per share growth and gross domestic product expansion in the first quarter is the widest since the third period of 2011. "We're seeing some pickup in growth that's outside the U.S. that's being reflected in these earnings numbers," said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout, pointing out that "the U.S. data is domestic focused." About 46 percent of S&P 500 sales overall come from foreign markets. The U.S. is still the world's largest economy, but its growth has stagnated while that of the rest of the world has been picking up. In April, the International Monetary Fund raised its annual growth forecasts for China and the euro area by 0.1 percent from its report in January. The estimate for the U.S. economy was unchanged. The IMF raised estimates for Japan and the U.K. by 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, for an estimated overall 0.1 percent uptick in global growth this year. This time last year, the IMF had cut its global growth outlook by 0.2 percent. show chapters Earnings vs. the economy    Friday, 28 Apr 2017 | 2:02 PM ET | 04:24 Key reasons for last year's sluggishness was a plunge in oil prices and other commodities prices, that added to the struggles of China as it attempts to transition its economy away from manufacturing exports to developing its services industry. As a result, major U.S. firms dependent on China and commodities markets have surprised in the first quarter of this year. For example, Caterpillar crushed earnings estimates and posted its first year-over-year sales increase in more than two years. The Dow component's Asia Pacific sales rose 12 percent "primarily due to an increase in construction equipment sales in China resulting from increased infrastructure and residential investment," according to a release. In the first quarter of last year, Caterpillar's Asia Pacific sales dropped 23 percent. U.S. banks have also posted strong first-quarter earnings, helped by rising interest rates, improving global growth and increased trading revenues. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley reported large earnings beats that contributed substantially to the S&P 500's earnings growth in the first quarter, according to FactSet's Butters. Overall S&P 500 earnings per share growth is on track for an increase of more than 12 percent for the first quarter, the greatest since the third quarter of 2011. Other factors helping earnings and overseas economic growth are softness in the U.S. dollar and stabilizing oil prices. The greenback has traded mostly lower this year after sharp gains in 2014 and 2015 that cut into overseas profits. Meanwhile, oil recovered from a low below $30 a barrel hit last February to trade in a range near $50 a barrel. U.S. crude is up about 7 percent over the last 12 months. To be sure, there's another reason why earnings look so good: A year ago, they were pretty bad. Last year's poor results for S&P 500 companies overall, including four straight quarters of earnings decline, set a low bar for companies to overcome. Matching improved growth in coming months may be more difficult. But they continue to grow at a healthy pace with help from the globe. "We have been more focused on improving global growth than on the 'Trump trade,'" hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, who's doubled the market's return over the last two decades, told clients in a Thursday letter obtained by CNBC. "Although S&P earnings were flat over the past three years," the Third Point manager said, "we are expecting earnings growth to drive gains and cyclical names to get a tailwind from U.S. policy shifts this year." — CNBC's Scott Wapner and John Melloy contributed to this report.

The Russell 1000 Growth index, which tracks such shares, is up 10.9 percent so far this year, outpacing the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index's 6.6 percent rise and the 2.8 percent advance of the Russell 1000 Value index. And it's not just a U.S. phenomenon. Growth stocks - whose profits are expected to grow at a faster pace than the broader market - are also outperforming their value counterparts in Asia and Europe. Still, the appeal of riskier stocks perceived as better positioned to ride an accelerating global earnings tailwind, as opposed to those with a greater cushion of safety, is nowhere as far ahead as it is on Wall Street. In the United States, an improving outlook for corporate earnings should help keep growth names in vogue, according to John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. The average estimate of analysts for earnings per share growth this year of S&P 500 companies has risen to 11.3 percent from 10.9 percent at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters data, a trend that should continue to blunt concerns about lofty growth valuations. "When you have an earnings recovery, growth stocks will outperform. When you don't have good earnings, that's when people are looking for value," said Praveen. Hopes for pro-business U.S. policy changes under the administration of President Donald Trump will likely also keep expectations for economic growth elevated, helping to maintain the case for growth stocks. "The value stocks have done okay but growth has done so much better in the anticipation we'll see a pickup in economic growth," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. "Companies that are going to be more levered to economic growth tend to be growth stocks." "Right now I don't see a long term condition for value stocks to outperform growth," said Nolte. To be sure, some strategists are less convinced that growth stock outperformance will continue indefinitely. While value stocks, which are cheaper relative to their earnings potential, have tended to do better in slower growth environments historically, JP Morgan Asset Management's global market strategist David Lebovitz says that trend has been changing. "It’s not going to be smooth sailing for one or the other. We think there'll be times people are more optimistic about the economy and in those cases, value can rally. Then you'll see periods where people are less optimistic about the economy, as we've seen over the course of the first quarter," he said. If economic trends look better in the second quarter, value stocks will do better, Lebovitz said. In Asia, the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan growth index , is up 18.5 percent so far this year, compared with a 12.6 percent gain for the comparable MSCI value index . Investment in India, traditionally a growth-driven market, has adjusted in recent years as value stocks have narrowed the gap with growth, which still lead, said Jayesh Shroff, co-founder of investment advisory Cask Capital in Mumbai. "That is because people were paying a premium for growth and somehow the growth did not materialize. That's why value came back and growth has taken a slight back seat," said Shroff. Still, he said as soon as growth returns, he expects investors to switch their focus back from value. In China, between 2009 and the 2015 stock market crash, small-cap growth stocks were the market’s darlings, but "a new rotation into value blue-chip investments started in 2016,” according to Zhou Liang, fund manager at Shanghai Minority Asset Management Co. “In 2017, money will flow into blue-chips, as small-caps weaken and lose their luster,” said Zhou. In Europe, the best outlook for corporate profits in seven years has ignited investor appetite for growth stocks, which are now up twice as much as their value counterparts so far this year, a reversal of the trend seen last year. As a result the MSCI International Europe growth Index has jumped 8.9 percent this year so far, compared with a 4.5 percent gain for the MSCI International Europe Value index. With such a big gap between U.S. growth and value stocks, some investors are eying overseas investments. "The entire U.S. market is very expensive. Value investors definitely don't like to chase expensive valuations," said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. "I wouldn't expect to see a rotation until you saw a correction where both stock types are lower."

Home Latest Pakistan World Entertainment Sci-Tech Sports Business Videos TV Shows GEO URDU Watch Live Geo Asool HOME LATEST PAKISTAN WORLD Entertainment Sci-Tech Sports BUSINESS VIDEOS TV SHOWS SCHEDULE GEO URDU Watch Live Hot Topics Panama Leaks Dawn leaks Mardan lynching Kulbhushan Jadhav Champions Trophy Print Story X Print Story Home / business / Hot earnings to keep fire under growth-stock rally Hot earnings to keep fire under growth-stock rally | By  RREUTERS | April 30, 2017 Business 0 0 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, April 20, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid NEW YORK: Don't look for the outperformance of growth stocks to fade anytime soon, as long as corporate earnings continue to improve and hopes remain for stronger economic growth. The Russell 1000 Growth index, which tracks such shares, is up 10.9 percent so far this year, outpacing the US benchmark S&P 500 stock index's 6.6 percent rise and the 2.8 percent advance of the Russell 1000 Value index. And it's not just a US phenomenon. Growth stocks – whose profits are expected to grow at a faster pace than the broader market – are also outperforming their value counterparts in Asia and Europe. Still, the appeal of riskier stocks perceived as better positioned to ride an accelerating global earnings tailwind, as opposed to those with a greater cushion of safety, is nowhere as far ahead as it is on Wall Street. In the United States, an improving outlook for corporate earnings should help keep growth names in vogue, according to John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. The average estimate of analysts for earnings per share growth this year of S&P 500 companies has risen to 11.3 percent from 10.9 percent at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters data, a trend that should continue to blunt concerns about lofty growth valuations. "When you have an earnings recovery, growth stocks will outperform. When you don't have good earnings, that's when people are looking for value," said Praveen. Hopes for pro-business US policy changes under the administration of President Donald Trump will likely also keep expectations for economic growth elevated, helping to maintain the case for growth stocks. "The value stocks have done okay but growth has done so much better in the anticipation we'll see a pickup in economic growth," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. "Companies that are going to be more levered to economic growth tend to be growth stocks." "Right now I don't see a long-term condition for value stocks to outperform growth," said Nolte. To be sure, some strategists are less convinced that growth stock outperformance will continue indefinitely. While value stocks, which are cheaper relative to their earnings potential, have tended to do better in slower growth environments historically, JP Morgan Asset Management's global market strategist David Lebovitz says that trend has been changing. "It’s not going to be smooth sailing for one or the other. We think there'll be times people are more optimistic about the economy and in those cases, value can rally. Then you'll see periods where people are less optimistic about the economy, as we've seen over the course of the first quarter," he said. If economic trends look better in the second quarter, value stocks will do better, Lebovitz said. In Asia, the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan growth index, is up 18.5 percent so far this year, compared with a 12.6 percent gain for the comparable MSCI value index. Investment in India, traditionally a growth-driven market, has adjusted in recent years as value stocks have narrowed the gap with growth, which still leads, said Jayesh Shroff, co-founder of investment advisory Cask Capital in Mumbai. "That is because people were paying a premium for growth and somehow the growth did not materialise. That's why value came back and growth has taken a slight back seat," said Shroff. Still, he said as soon as growth returns, he expects investors to switch their focus back from value. In China, between 2009 and the 2015 stock market crash, small-cap growth stocks were the market’s darlings, but "a new rotation into value blue-chip investments started in 2016”, according to Zhou Liang, a fund manager at Shanghai Minority Asset Management Co. “In 2017, money will flow into blue-chips, as small-caps weaken and lose their lustre,” said Zhou. In Europe, the best outlook for corporate profits in seven years has ignited investor appetite for growth stocks, which are now up twice as much as their value counterparts so far this year, a reversal of the trend seen last year. As a result, the MSCI International Europe growth Index has jumped 8.9 percent this year so far, compared with a 4.5 percent gain for the MSCI International Europe Value index. With such a big gap between US growth and value stocks, some investors are eying overseas investments. "The entire US market is very expensive. Value investors definitely don't like to chase expensive valuations," said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. "I wouldn't expect to see a rotation until you saw a correction where both stock types are lower." 0 0 Hot earnings to keep fire under growth-stock rally was posted in business of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on April 30, 2017 and was last updated on April 30, 2017.
