Recent Posts: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Hit $1,000 by Labor Day Don’t Pay a Premium for Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) Stock Don’t Buy What Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Selling View All Posts Despite a set of scandals that would have sunk a smaller bank, Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) still sells at a premium to other big bank stocks. The bank’s price-book ratio, which is its market capitalization matched to the value of its tangible book assets, is still 1.58. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) boasts a 1.37 P/B ratio. Source: Shutterstock That’s a smaller gap than the two banks had before Wells was found to be selling services customers didn’t order, but it’s still a gap. If Wells Fargo had cleaned house thoroughly after the scandal, and could show measurable progress on the sales front, of course, WFC stock might not be overpriced. But the hits keep coming. Its regulatory rating has been taken down, which the bank admits in an SEC filing is going to have real consequences, far more than the fines imposed to date on the false accounts and discrimination findings. Oh, and it agreed to pay $110 million to account holders over the phony accounts business. Punished Enough? The price-book ratio is not the only way to measure a bank’s value. On a price-earnings basis, you can argue WFC stock is now undervalued. Its P/E of 13.95 compares to a 14.26 for JP Morgan and a fat 15.68 for Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), the two big banks with which it is most often compared. Citigroup (NYSE:C), which still sells for a P/B ratio of 0.79 and a P/E of 12.54, continues to be punished by investors for the 2008 crisis and resulting bailout. You can also argue that all big bank stocks are still undervalued. With the average Standards & Poor company selling at 18 times earnings, price-earnings ratios in the low-teens are dirt cheap. And higher interest rates should improve the outlook for anyone who is trying to sell money for more than they pay for it. Since the false account scandal broke in mid-September, WFC stock is up 21%. That is less than JPMorgan, up 33%, and a lot less than Bank of America, which is up nearly 50%, but it’s still a substantial gain, a roughly $50 billion addition to the bank’s market cap. Trump has been a catalyst for bank stocks since the November election, and the Federal Reserve rate hike announced on March 15, which is expected to be followed by at least two more rate hikes later this year, is also good news. But is there a reason to believe Wells’ performance is going to improve soon, and that its book assets are going to outperform those of its peers? Why the Premium for WFC Stock? Among other things, the latest regulatory finding will make it harder for Wells Fargo to open new branches and make acquisitions, at least until the “Needs to Improve” is taken down. The bank’s own press release says that moves once rated “outstanding” are now only considered “satisfactory.” The “whisper number” for the bank’s March earnings, which will come out April 13, is for net income of 97 cents per share, on revenue of $22.19 billion. This is almost identical to the bank’s performance in the December quarter, which in turn was down from previous quarters. Yes, higher interest rates should be good for banks. But the rate hikes will hit the housing market hardest, because charging more for money means there is less money to buy the house, and Wells Fargo is the country’s largest mortgage lender, with twice the volume of its nearest competitor.

Taiwanese manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry could be a big winner in Apple's supply chain in the next round of iPhones expected to be launched later this year, according to investment bank JPMorgan. The newest iPhone model reportedly will boast a series of upgraded specifications including OLED display and a larger screen size that experts say could create a "super-cycle " for Apple. OLED refers to organic light-emitting diodes that experts say offers brighter displays and better power efficiency over the standard LCD — liquid crystal display — screens. In a Tuesday note, JPMorgan's Asia tech analyst and head of Taiwan equity research, Gokul Hariharan, said the bank expected Hon Hai, a top assembler of iPhone handsets, to be the sole supplier for the new 5.85-inch OLED model, while retaining a smaller share in the 5.5-inch display handsets. This, along with better average selling price, should help Hon Hai's market share in iPhone assembly to stabilize in the upcoming model cycle, according to the bank. "This is our assumption as of now that (Hon Hai) will handle all of the (newest) iPhone assembly. Historically, they have handled the most advanced product in most iPhone cycles," Hariharan told CNBC on Wednesday. show chapters JPMorgan: Apple 'underappreciated' by Wall Street    Monday, 27 Mar 2017 | 12:21 PM ET | 04:45 Earlier in the week, JPMorgan's Apple analyst, Rod Hall, said the bank was more optimistic than the rest of Wall Street when it comes to the next iPhone. Hariharan said in the note that Hon Hai should also see some margin improvement in 2017 thanks to better revenue scale and a higher degree of automation. Meanwhile, the bank doesn't expect Hon Hai to bankroll any potential investments on its own, but rather with partners. JPMorgan is currently overweight on the company and increased the price target for the stock to 107 new Taiwan dollars ($3.54) from 100 new Taiwan dollars. Among the other major assemblers of iPhones, JPMorgan remained overweight on Pegatron, stating there will likely be more room for volume growth in the next two iPhone cycles thanks to the company's increasing market share in the smaller iPhone models. The market share within iPhones is expected to peak at 33 to 35 percent for Pegatron. "We anticipate Pegatron having 100 percent (share) in the iPhone 7S 4.7-inch in the upcoming cycle and keeping a majority market share in the smaller size OLED model in the next model cycle," Hariharan wrote in the note. For Wistron, market expectations of strong profitability improvement in the smartphone business were too aggressive, according to the note. "In addition, Wistron's share wins in iPhone appear to be coming mainly for the iPhone 7S 5.5" LCD model, which could be significantly cannibalized by the OLED iPhone." show chapters Bernstein analyst: iPhone 8 cycle will be significant, upward revisions likely    Tuesday, 21 Mar 2017 | 12:23 PM ET | 04:46 Hariharan told CNBC that, among Apple's component suppliers, JPMorgan likes the following names: LG Innotek (supplies camera modules), Samsung SDI (OLED display panels), Alps Electric (optical image stabilizers for the dual cameras) and Catcher (metal casing). These companies, particularly Samsung SDI, are expected to benefit from the upcoming model cycle due to the anticipated upgrades in the iPhone specs. "The OLED screen is done by Samsung exclusively," said Hariharan, adding he expected earnings to expand as Apple rolled out more OLED iPhone models in the future. In February, Korean media reported Samsung Display received a display order from Apple for about 160 million OLED panels, making them the largest supplier to the iPhone maker. "We are anticipating a meaningful shift towards OLED ... in a 2 to 3 year horizon, realistically, every new iPhone model should be OLED-based," Hariharan added. Disclosure: Apple is an investment banking client of JPMorgan. JPMorgan owns a position of $1 million or more in debt securities of Apple. JPMorgan also makes a market in shares of Apple, and provides liquidity services for Apple securities.

News of JP Morgan's potential post-Brexit move will be welcomed, coming as it does in the wake of the decision by two major insurance companies, Lloyd's of London and AIG, to choose Brussels and Luxembourg instead of Dublin for their respective European Union bases. While a source familiar with the matter insisted that a decision on Capital Dock was "still up in the air", JP Morgan's intentions in relation to the scheme's offices are currently the subject of intense speculation within Dublin's commercial real estate sector. The Irish Independent understands that JP Morgan has been engaged in a search for space capable of accomodating employees from both its existing offices at George's Dock in the IFSC and up to 500 personnel currently working within its London operations. In terms of timing, it remains unclear when the bank's current Dublin employees would relocate to new offices, given the fact that JP Morgan remains committed to a 25-year lease from December 1996 on its George's Dock premises. Capital Dock's office space is set to be delivered by Kennedy Wilson in the final quarter of this year, with 190 apartments on its adjoining 4.8 acre site ready for occupation from 2018, making both offerings timely propositions for JP Morgan and other financial services firms seeking to relocate from London in the wake of Brexit. Kennedy Wilson's intention to offer office tenants at Capital Dock priority access to the scheme's 190 apartments is widely acknowledged within property circles as providing it with an advantage over its competitors aiming to attract London-based banks to Dublin. The US-headquartered real estate giant has been aggressive in its pursuit of post-Brexit business, with members of its senior management confirming to analysts from Deutsche Bank as far back as last October that they had already held "preliminary talks" with a number of banks in London in relation to the relocation of some of their operations to Dublin. Asked by the Irish Independent for comment at the time, Kennedy Wilson Europe's chief operating officer Peter Collins said: "As a company with a long-term commitment to Ireland, we are of course interested in exploring the unfolding scenarios offered by Brexit and the potential for further investment in Ireland, and Dublin in particular." A request to Kennedy Wilson's spokesman for comment yesterday on JP Morgan's potential move to Capital Dock had not been met with a response by the time of going to press. JLL, the agents responsible for lettings at Capital Dock declined to comment on the matter, as did a spokeswoman for JP Morgan.

The S&P 500 financial index slipped 0.48 percent, weighed down by Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan. The sector had risen more than 1 percent a day earlier.

With an August target date set for a highly anticipated U.S. tax reform bill and the quarter nearing an end, analysts expect the market to trade in a tight range.

With an August target date set for a highly anticipated U.S. tax reform bill and the quarter nearing an end, analysts expect the market to trade in a tight range. "We're going to be fairly range-bound as we get to the earnings season or until there is some significant development on tax reforms," said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. The reaction of U.S. markets to Britain formally initiating a process to separate from the European Union was muted. At 12:35 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones industrial average was down 53.02 points, or 0.26 percent, at 20,648.48, the S&P 500 was up 0.74 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,359.31 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 15.03 points, or 0.26 percent, at 5,890.17. Amazon.com hit an all-time high of $870.88 and gave the biggest boost to the Nasdaq. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, jumped 23 percent to $110.25 after its cystic fibrosis treatment succeeded in a late-stage trial. UnitedHealth, which rose for the first time in nine days on Tuesday, was off 1.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,787 to 1,079. On the Nasdaq, 1,618 issues rose and 1,136 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 11 52-week highs and one low, while the Nasdaq recorded 66 highs and 21 lows.

Britain invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on Wednesday, which started the two-year process of the country's divorce from the EU. The move did not trigger a rush for banks to reveal their plans, but some updated staff on what was happening. "This is a complex process and we will not rush into any decisions," two of JP Morgan's most senior executives told staff in a memo seen by IFR. "We have spent the last several months reviewing the many variables in this process - client needs, employee considerations, regulatory requirements, operational risks, our inventory of licences, political issues in the region and dozens of other factors," said the memo from Daniel Pinto, head of JP Morgan's corporate and investment bank, and Mary Erdoes, head of asset and wealth management. JP Morgan warned before the Brexit vote it could move 4,000 of its 16,000 staff, potentially affecting staff in London and Bournemouth in the south of the country. "While our objective in the short term is to limit the number of staff moves, there will inevitably be some staff who will be asked to consider relocation," the US bank said in Wednesday's memo. The memo said it had options across the EU in terms of where to move operations and legal entity structure even if Britain loses its ability to passport financial services into the EU. It will use its existing legal entity structure in the short term so it can immediately do business when Brexit occurs, and said it will continue to make adjustments as the two-year negotiation period proceeds. Goldman Sachs, another US bank with major European headquarters in London, told staff there would be a "considerable period of time" before the terms of Brexit become clear. "Only when these negotiations are complete will we be able to make long-term decisions with respect to our footprint," Goldman's European CEO Richard Gnodde told staff ahead of Article 50 being triggered. Gnodde said the bank had been working to prepare for the range of outcomes and will need to take actions in the coming months to keep its options open. "We have a tightly defined team implementing these contingency plans which will involve upgrading various European locations, including acquiring additional real estate, securing access to market infrastructure and applying for additional licences to conduct business," Gnodde said. Gnodde said last week the first phase of those contingency plans was likely to involve "hundreds of people" rather than many more than that. HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, told staff up to 1,000 London-based jobs that support activity in continental Europe may need to move, repeating previous guidance. It has said most of those will move to Paris, and will still leave the bank with 45,000 staff in the UK. It said it wanted "to ensure our colleagues working outside their home countries have certainty of residency as soon as possible" in the message to staff on Wednesday, seen by IFR. It added: "We are confident that HSBC's strong position and subsidiary model in Europe will enable us to easily flex to serve our clients' interests." About two-thirds of major financial firms with operations in Britain are yet to make any public statement about their plans for Brexit, however, according to a study. Consulting and advisory firm EY said 153 out of the biggest 222 firms with operations in Britain had not said anything about the impact Brexit could have on their domicile, operations or staff location. EY said 53 of the 222 firms are actively moving some staff or part of their operations out of the UK, or are reviewing their domicile as a result of Brexit.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 29, 2017 11:08am   Comments Share: Related MS Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For March 29, 2017 The Market In 5 Minutes Dow's JPMorgan Retakes Key Support; Tesla In Focus: Investing Action Plan (Investor's Business Daily) In less than two weeks, big bank investors will get their first glimpse into the type of impact that the Federal Reserve’s 0.25 percent December interest rate hike had on bank bottom lines. Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O’Connor has upgraded Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) to Buy ahead of Q1 earnings season, but believes investors still need to be selective when choosing bank stocks. After exploding out of the gate following Donald Trump’s election victory in November, bank stocks have cooled in recent weeks. Investors were anticipating the dawn of a new banking boom in a potential era of rising interest rates, financial deregulation and corporate tax cuts. However, President Trump’s missteps on his proposed healthcare bill now have investors concerned he may have difficulty implementing his other campaign promises as well. “Recent weakness likely reflects lack of progress in Washington (in particular the postponement of healthcare reform) and more modest expectations around the administration’s ability to pass the rest of their agenda,” O’Connor explains. Related Link: When Market Expectations Trump Reality: Regional Banks In the past month, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLF) is now down 3.7 percent. Given the current climate, Deutsche Bank prefers market-sensitive banks to regional banks. O’Connor points out that large regional banks are currently trading at a 20 percent premium to historical levels. Among market sensitive banks, the firm’s top stock picks include Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM). Deutsche Bank named Buy-rated Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) as its top large regional bank stock pick. Bank earnings season kicks off on April 13, when Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE: PNC) are expected to report Q1 earnings.

(AAPL), Facebook Inc (FB) and Ford Motor Company (F) How to Trade BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Ahead of Q4 Earnings View All Posts U.S. stock futures are mixed this morning after Wall Street digests a strong rally driven by better-than-expected economic data on Tuesday. This morning, investors are keeping an eye on Fed speeches, as well as Brexit, with the U.K. invoking Article 50 and officially starting the country’s withdrawal from the EU. Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.10%, while S&P 500 futures dipped 0.05% and Nasdaq-100 futures have risen 0.02%. On the options front, volume normalized a bit on Tuesday, with roughly 14.3 million calls and 12.1 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.60 and the 10-day moving average ticked lower once again to 0.65. Driving Tuesday’s options volume, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw additional call option volume following a JPMorgan price-target hike. Elsewhere, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) also drew higher call volume after announcing new features to compete with Snap Inc (NASDAQ:SNAP) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) announced it was building a new $200 million new advanced data center. Apple Inc. (AAPL) The much anticipated 10th anniversary edition of Apple’s iPhone is slated for release this fall, and analysts at JPMorgan believe the device has plenty of pent up demand waiting in the wings. In a note to clients yesterday, JPMorgan reiterated its “overweight” rating and lifted its price target from $142 to $165. The brokerage firm also lifted its earnings projections to $11.74 per share for 2018 and its unit forecast from 245 million to 260 million units for the same period. While bullish activity was dampened by the recent market correction, AAPL options traders piled into calls yesterday. Total volume rose to nearly 1.5 million contracts, with calls accounting for 60% of the day’s take. However, recent call activity appears to be more of the short-term profit-taking variety, as the April put/call open interest ratio has risen from Monday’s perch at 0.90 to today’s reading of 0.95, as puts are added at a faster rate than calls. This shift in sentiment isn’t much to worry about right now, with AAPL holding firmly above $140, but a breach of support here could create cause for concern and prompt a spike in AAPL put options. Facebook Inc (FB) Facebook rolled out more features in its quest to remain competitive with social media upstart Snap yesterday. The company announced what it called “More ways to to share with the Facebook camera,” including filters, a “Stories” feature that had already rolled out on Instagram, and direct photo sharing — all popular features currently on SnapChat. Options traders appeared to back the new features, with calls accounting for 65% of the more than 383,000 contracts traded on FB stock yesterday. What’s more, the April put/call open interest ratio continued its recent decline, arriving at 0.44 this morning. In other words, FB options traders continue to add calls at a faster rate than puts on the stock, as expectations for a continued uptrend remain strong. Currently, peak April OI lies at the in-the-money $140 strike, but the overhead $145 and $150 are quickly gaining in popularity.

But as they seek to maintain their position in the marketplace, banks are turning to what is perhaps their most valuable asset: data. As The New York Times detailed last week, major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are demanding new terms from tech companies that want to be able to pull data for their banking customers. Many fintechs rely on their users providing access to the data from their bank accounts, and use third-party intermediaries like Envestnet Yodlee and Intuit to access that data. Those third-parties have direct relationships with some banks and use scraping technologies to access data from others when users provide the credentials to their accounts. To date, there have been few rules and standards as to how the data pulled is used and big banks want to change that. According to Jason Kratovil, a VP at bank lobbying organization Financial Services Roundtable, "When you think about millions of customers handing over their bank-account credentials to third parties, who currently have no real oversight or examination of their security controls, you start to understand why our members get pretty nervous." But many fintech execs believe the concerns over security are an excuse to thwart companies banks see as a threat. Personal Capital CEO William Harris told The New York Times, "It’s pretty clear the real intent of the banks is to limit this data because it puts their business model at risk." Personal Capital, which was founded in 2009, is an upstart wealth manager. It offers free analytics tools that it says more than 1.3m users take advantage of to track their personal finances. If those users were unable to give Personal Capital access to their bank accounts, it wouldn't be able to pull in the data it needs to provide such tools. Banks get aggressive According to The New York Times, big banks are getting increasingly aggressive in their dealings with the third-party platforms that many companies use to access bank account data. In January, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo struck a deal with Intuit "that will give Intuit more streamlined access to data from the banks, in exchange for new rules about how Intuit uses the data." Wells Fargo also demanded compensation "to help the bank cover the additional infrastructure costs involved in providing real-time access to data." Envestnet Yodlee, which competes with Intuit, has reportedly not yet come to an agreement with the banks and The New York Times says that the company is trying to push back on the banks' demands. As Steve Boms, Envestnet Yodlee's VP of government affairs sees it, "with data limitations, you are hindering the ability of millions of consumers to save more and optimize their finances."  But it's not clear just how much push back is possible. Several banks have warned Envestnet Yodlee that if it doesn't agree to their terms, it could lose access to some of the data it is currently able to retrieve from them.  Ambiguous regulation and an uncertain regulatory environment Unfortunately, the negotiations are high stakes in large part because it's not clear what banks are required to do or what consumers are entitled to. As The New York Times notes, in Europe regulators have basically decided that consumers, not banks, own the data from their accounts. In the US, Section 1033 of Dodd-Frank states that covered financial institutions, including banks, "shall make available to a consumer, upon request, information in the control or possession of the covered person concerning the consumer financial product or service that the consumer obtained from such covered person, including information relating to any transaction, series of transactions, or to the account including costs, charges and usage data. The information shall be made available in an electronic form usable by consumers." But the "electronic form usable by consumers" is ambiguous, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that Dodd-Frank created, despite its push for greater openness on the part of banks, hasn't issued a mandate regarding this. What's more, new US president Donald Trump has directed his Treasury secretary to review Dodd–Frank, and spoke of repealing it during his campaign. Is the more aggressive negotiating stance that big banks are taking a result of the perceived favor they have with the new administration? If it is, fintechs should expect big banks to get even more aggressive if and when Dodd-Frank is dismantled and/or repealed.

The adjudication proceedings pertained to JP Morgan Mutual Fund launching a scheme, back in 2014, after expiry of the right to launch deadline. Besides, JP Morgan Mutual Fund, the proceedings were initiated by the regulator against trustee -- JP Morgan Mutual Fund India Pvt Ltd -- and JP Morgan Asset Management India Pvt Ltd. According to three separate but similarly-worded settlement orders, each of the three entities have paid Rs 91.8 lakh to the regulator. Besides, they had proposed "voluntary debarment" from issuing of new schemes for a period of one year. The total settlement amount is little over Rs 2.75 crore. These entities paid the settlement amounts in February and three settlement orders were passed by Sebi's Adjudicating Officer Suresh B Menon.

Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Foreigners own a mere 3 percent of China’s local currency bonds, but adding notes from the nation to global indexes including those from Bloomberg Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. would bring cash into the country from yield-hungry investors from New York to Tokyo. Morgan Stanley said earlier this month that the inclusion of Chinese government bonds in major bond indexes could trigger $250 billion to $300 billion of inflows into China onshore notes. The moves are also spurring other global asset managers to hire. Click here for a story on UBS Asset forecasting China’s bond market to come of age Citigroup Index LLC said this month that Chinese onshore sovereign bonds are set to join some of its gauges but omitted them from its key World Government Bond Index, while Bloomberg Barclays Indexes, owned by Bloomberg, overhauled its China fixed-income gauges and started a Global Aggregate + China index on March 1.  Briscoe said that the inclusions are the “warning shot across the bow for everybody to get ready.” He declined to comment on the number of hires the firm plans to make but said that it is “applying for our WFOE status within China,” referring to the wholly foreign-owned enterprise designation.  Foreign funds with investment management enterprises that have that status can raise money from onshore institutional and high-net-worth investors once registered with the Asset Management Association of China. The moves focused on China’s bond market come even as Sam Kendall, who runs UBS Group AG’s regional investment bank, is trying to widen the firm’s scope by assigning more bankers to a pan-Asian focus and pushing them to pursue deals that aren’t directly linked to the health of the broader Chinese markets. UBS Group is the asset management unit’s parent. UBS Asset has also been readying China funds and in March launched its China High Yield Bond fund, which invests in U.S. dollar and yuan debt. With China now the world’s second-largest economy, UBS Asset is positioning itself to take global investors onshore. “You need to get China right if you want to get Asia right,” Briscoe said.

The LSC’s funding was marked for elimination in President Donald Trump’s proposed budget. The nonprofit organization is the largest provider of civil legal aid services in the country, serving 1.9 million people last year. The ABA launched the #LegalAidDefender social media campaign earlier this month to urge Congress not to let the LSC be destroyed. In their letter (PDF) to Congress, the general counsel of major companies such as Hewlett Packard, FedEx, Comcast, Walt Disney Company, General Electric, General Motors, JP Morgan Chase, Starbucks, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Amazon all advocated not only for the LSC to be saved, but for its funding to be set at $450 million for fiscal year 2018. The LSC received $385 million in 2016; $450 million would set its funding equal to its FY2010 level, adjusted for inflation, the letter argued. “As the cornerstone of equal justice in America, LSC creates a level playing field for the many lower and moderate-income families who cannot afford a lawyer,” the GCs wrote. “By upholding the fundamental American promise of liberty and justice for all, the minimal investment in LSC generates a significant positive return for business and for the health of individuals and communities across the nation. … Civil legal issues can have devastating, life-altering consequences for people who are forced to face the justice system alone.” Eric Steiner, the general counsel for ABA Insurance Services, was a signatory to the Tuesday letter. Even before Trump’s budget proposal had been announced, rumors about cuts to LSC funding led to the heads of more than 150 U.S. law firms writing to the administration to urge that the LSC be fully funded. “The pro bono activity facilitated by LSC funding is exactly the kind of public-private partnership the government should encourage, not eliminate,” the law firm heads wrote. Last week, the deans of 166 law schools also asked Congress to support funding the LSC. Among the signatories of their letter (PDF) was constitutional scholar Erwin Chemerinsky, a columnist for the ABA Journal and dean of UC Irvine School of Law. Chemerinsky also wrote an opinion piece for the Orange County Register. “The legal system is complex, and having a lawyer often can make all of the difference in a person’s life,” Chemerinsky wrote in the newspaper. “For over 40 years, this has been acknowledged by both Democratic and Republican presidents and by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Access to the courts and to justice should not depend on income, and it should not be a partisan issue.” “Support for the Legal Services Corp. is bipartisan because guaranteeing representation to all is not a political issue, but an issue of fairness,” ABA President Linda Klein told the ABA Journal earlier in March. “It benefits every congressional district and returns far more on every dollar spent than it costs.” In their Tuesday letter, the GCs framed the issue of LSC funding as vital for American infrastructure. “While we understand that within this fiscal environment difficult decisions about spending must be made, we believe that access to justice is not an expendable luxury but an indispensable manifestation of our country’s most fundamental values,” they wrote. “Just as investing in America’s roads and bridges are vital to our transportation infrastructure, LSC is a vital part of the infrastructure that undergirds our justice system, ensuring that fair treatment is not dependent on a person’s ability to pay for it.” Hat tips: Wall Street Journal Law Blog (sub. req.), @ABAGrassroots Previous: Former BigLaw partner says he felt like a pawn in securities fraud case after judge tosses claims Next: Despite kinks in program, nonlawyers are successfully providing some legal services in Washington Filed under: Civil Rights | Law Firms | Corporate Law | Law Practice Management | Legislation & Lobbying | ABA | In-house Counsel | Civil Procedure | Pro Bono | Bar Associations | Business of Law | Legal Education You might also like: Supreme Court lets stand ruling in favor of ABA in blind man's LSAT disability suit ABA puts Arizona Summit School of Law on probation Law school debt--and private school tuition revenue--may be declining Despite significant rise in US News & World Report rankings, law school dean placed on leave View the comments for this story We welcome your comments, but please adhere to our comment policy and the ABA Code of Conduct.

The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY slipped 0.48 percent, weighed down by Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N). The sector had risen more than 1 percent a day earlier. However, losses on the S&P and the Dow were limited by a rise in energy shares due to a 2 percent gain in oil prices. The S&P 500 energy index .SPNY was up 1.1 percent after data showed a smaller-than-expected build in U.S. crude stockpiles. With an August target date set for a highly anticipated U.S. tax reform bill and the quarter nearing an end, analysts expect the market to trade in a tight range. "We're going to be fairly range-bound as we get to the earnings season or until there is some significant development on tax reforms," said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. The reaction of U.S. markets to Britain formally initiating a process to separate from the European Union was muted.At 12:35 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 53.02 points, or 0.26 percent, at 20,648.48, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 0.74 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,359.31 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 15.03 points, or 0.26 percent, at 5,890.17.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals, (VRTX.O) jumped 23 percent to $110.25 after its cystic fibrosis treatment succeeded in a late-stage trial. UnitedHealth (UNH.N), which rose for the first time in nine days on Tuesday, was off 1.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,787 to 1,079.

This is an upgraded Amazon Store Card specifically for Amazon Prime members. This isn’t exactly an Amazon cash back credit card, because the credit only hits your statement, but it is an interesting option that savvy shoppers will want to pay attention to. With the right budgeting and planning this offers an option for users to save 5% on an iPad, new Android tablet, most Android phones, MacBooks, Windows notebooks and tablets, HDTVs, the PS4, Xbox One, major appliances, DVDs and books to name a few things. Many of these items also qualify for the special Amazon Store Card financing options for 5, 12 or 24 months. What you need to know about the Amazon Store Card for Prime Members. The Amazon Store Card for Prime Members is issued through Synchrony Bank, the same bank that handles the mainAmazon.com Store Card. There are some negative reviews from users who did not understand the payment terms with the special financing options, so make sure you pay attention to the details. Here are seven important details you need to know about the new Amazon Prime Store Card. 5% Back on Amazon Purchases The biggest reason this new Amazon Store Card is a tempting option for Amazon Prime members is that you can score 5% back every day. For comparison the Amazon Rewards Visa only offers 3% back at Amazon, but there is a bigger sign up bonus and you can use the Amazon Rewards Visa by Chase at other stores. Unlike the Chase Freedom card that only offers 5% back on Amazon purchases in the last several months of the year, this works every day. No Interest on Major Purchases for 6, 12 or 24 Months For users who don’t want to get the 5% cash back on a purchase it is possible to use the promotional financing. As long as you pay off the purchase before the 6, 12 or 24 month period there is no interest on the purchase, but if you don’t pay it off on time you need to pay interest on the whole purchase from the date of the purchase. This will stack of the 25.99% interest rate on your card for the last 6, 12 or 24 months. If you use this, it may be best to only make one major purchase at a time. What Qualifies for Special Financing Offers Here’s what you can get special financing on. Amazon offers a handy list of things that qualify for the special Amazon Store Card financing deals. The 24-month special financing offers on Amazon are only good on HDTVs and Autodesk software. The 12-month and 6-month special financing options are valid on any order above $599 or $149 respectively. That means you can add almost anything to your cart to hit this level and use the promotional financing. When you check out you can choose 5% back or the financing offer, but beware that Amazon may set a default for you or set this card to a default payment option as part of the checkout process, so be sure to verify that your payment options are right for the next purchase you make. No Annual Fee, But $99 Amazon Prime Required There is no annual fee for the Amazon Store Card, but that doesn’t mean that it is free to use. You need to be an Amazon Prime member to use this special Amazon Prime Store Card. Amazon Prime is $99 a year and it includes free two day shipping, $3.99 one day shipping options, unlimited access to music, movies and TV shows. Users also get free Amazon Cloud Drive storage with unlimited photo storage and can read free books through the Kindle First and Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. $40 Sign Up Bonus When you apply and are approved for the Amazon Prime Store Card you get a $40 Amazon account credit. This is small compared to some of the other bonus sign up options, but it is almost like getting Amazon Prime for half off for one year. This is on top of the 5% back bonus and financing offers, so you don’t have to choose between this offer and the others — but you only get it once. Only Purchases at Amazon.com The new Amazon Store Card for Prime Members only works at Amazon. The Amazon Store Card and Amazon Prime Store Card are only good for purchases at Amazon. You cannot use this to make purchases at the gas station, McDonald’s and any other store. This is fine as long as you know what you are signing up for and plan to use it accordingly, but if you want one you can use at other locations there are other cards to look at. Compare to Other Credit Cards Before you jump in and sign up for the Amazon Store Card and Amazon Prime Store Card you should look at other options. The Amazon.com Rewards Visa Card offers a $70 sign up option, 3% back at Amazon, 2% back at gas stations, restaurants and drugstores as well as 1% cash back on other purchases. This card also offers drastically lower interest rate options starting at 14.24% — but without any special financing options. There is also a Chase Freedom card that includes 5% cash back on Amazon purchases from October through December only. 10 Responses 04/16/2015 Austin Powers Reply When comparing other cards, your math doesn’t add up Josh. 05/24/2015 Ninja Reply Great article, very informative. Hopefully you’ll be able to answer this question: I applied for this card after being approved for the Amazon Visa. I was denied but I thought that it was because I forgot to add my suffix to my application details, however, I was denied again, for the second time within 5 minutes. So my question is; did they do a hard or soft pull to my credit and did it happen twice? Thanks for your time! 07/29/2015 Francia Reply Is only for USA? 08/04/2015 Hannah Reply I like the 5% but I only use this card for items that I know I won’t have issues with, like dog food. I would never use it to buy electronics or other important items bc using a major cc gives you an extra year warranty so getting an extra 2% isn’t worth losing a free year warranty. 10/30/2015 RJ Reply I have the amazon store card with a very healthy CL and im grateful because i purchase a lot from amazon even though i have the ebay mastercard with a higher CL amazon’s zero interest for 6 months is great. i bought a brand new laptop and as a prime member got it the next day and since it was new i got a one year manf. warranty directly from HP im wondering if i should wait till i pay off the purchase first before switching because im not sure if i will lose the financing for the 5% cash back does anyone know ? 01/15/2016 Bonita J sianis Reply I have been trying to cancel my amazon prime card, I want to keep my amazon.com card. It said on your page that you can cancel at any time. Well I have chatted and called everyone and no one will cancel thisw card. 07/22/2016 Atheena Reply The truth about this card. 1.) They choose what to pay off Randomly. I sent in a larger than normal payment to pay off my non promotional balances (what I owe that is not on payment plans – the base debt). There was plenty left over to pay off my upcoming August thru October promotional balances (each time you order something on a promotion each item incurs a separate promotional plan. IF you buy 4 items each over 149 on one order instead of getting on that is financed for 6 months you get 4 that are each financed for 6 months. This seems harmless and ok find out the *computer pays off your upcoming promotional balances RANDOMLY* This is what the assistant said to me. 2.) IF you ask them to pay it off off in order of sale date they have to file a ticket which will take 2 to 3 statement cycles to show up AND it will not show up on your statement till then. Since your accounts are aging out and you have to pay off the interest in those times which are as stated in item 3 below. YOU have no way to see they actually paid off the items OR if they add the interest you did not pay during these times. 3.) Statements do not show your separate balances. On your statement they DO NOT provide you with simple broken down totals, a.) your non-promotional balance. b.) They do not give you a balance to pay off they next total for upcoming months. They expect you to do the simple math that quote the assistant “Even a human can do it” Sure I can do it… but why???? Why should I have to? There is a level of standards generally accepted in the USA. These have dropped. IF You need this card and stuck getting it… BEWARE the people behind this are people who are doing a very high class SCAM!!! Anyone who tricks you out of money or sets you up to give them more money than is fair is a SCAM. IF I had been able to add a photo I have one of my statement to prove what I have said here. 02/10/2017 Terry Weaver Reply Amazon Prime store card is not for me! I am having statement mailed to me to pay bill! These terms are confusing, as I do not pay bills thru e-mail. How do I cancel AmazonPrime store card? Last digits 7633 I will pay bill when received in mail. Thank You! 02/18/2017 Under cabinet radio.tech Reply It’s awesome to pay a visit this site and reading the views of all colleagues concerning this piece of writing, while I am also zealous of getting familiarity. 03/29/2017 Kay Latona Reply 1. When I read the information about the Amazon.com store card, I see “eligible purchases.” What are they? 2. I think I recall reading, when I signed up, that .eligible purchases were those both “sold by” and “fulfilled by” Amazon.com. Is that the case? 1. What does “fulfilled by” mean?

Anirudh Laskar On 10 March, 2015, Sebi had initiated adjudication proceedings against JP Morgan mutual fund for alleged violations of certain mutual fund norms. Photo: Mint Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India or Sebi on Wednesday said the market regulator has settled a case against JP Morgan Mutual Fund through so-called consent mechanism for a fee of Rs91.8 lakh and on the condition that the fund house will debar itself from issuing any new scheme for a year. On 10 March, 2015, Sebi had initiated adjudication proceedings against JP Morgan mutual fund for alleged violations of certain mutual fund norms with regards to the launch of JPMorgan India Fixed Maturity Plan - Series 39 in 2014 and certain statements made by the fund house regarding the scheme then. Sebi said according to its clearance terms for the scheme, JP Morgan mutual fund was supposed to launch the scheme before 12 August 2014, while the fund house launched the scheme on 19 August 2014. Further, in a show cause notice served on the fund house in June, 2015 it was alleged that the offer document for the scheme contained misleading and incorrect scheme name and information and even the units that were allotted to the investors were under the incorrect scheme name. Also, allegedly the listing of the units of the scheme, which was supposed to be completed by 04 September, 2014, was done on 9 September 2014, Sebi’s settlement said. While adjudication proceedings against JP Morgan mutual fund were on, the company approached Sebi for consent in the matter on 30 September, 2015, which led to the latest settlement order by Sebi. In March last year, Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd agreed to buy JP Morgan Asset Management India Pvt. Ltd. The acquisition was completed in November 2016.

JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc. and Evercore Partners Inc. are the leading underwriters on the deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Barclays Plc, once poised to lead the IPO, will now have a more passive role after the departure of its airline analyst, the people said. Frontier, owned by private equity firm Indigo Partners, first began talks with banks about going public in December 2015. Spokesmen for Frontier, Indigo Partners and Evercore didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Citi and Barclays declined to comment.

Airline IPOs in the U.S. are rare. Virgin America Inc. was the last to go public, raising $353 million in November 2014, including an overallotment. The carrier has since agreed to be acquired by Alaska Air Group Inc. for $2.6 billion, continuing a flurry of consolidation within the industry over the past decade. Last month, Azul SA, the Brazilian airline led by JetBlue Airways Corp. founder David Neeleman, filed for a U.S. IPO, following at least two previous delays because of slumping Brazilian stocks. The deal is scheduled to price April 6, according to a person familiar with the matter. Frontier, whose planes sport images of animals such as bears and foxes, operates a fleet of Airbus Group SE jets on more than 275 daily flights within the U.S. and to Mexico and Jamaica. Indigo acquired the Denver-based airline from Republic Airways Holdings Inc. for $36 million in cash. The total transaction value was $145 million including debt. Frontier has changed hands twice since filing for bankruptcy protection in April 2008. Republic bought the carrier in October 2009 for $108.8 million, agreeing not to pursue a $150 million unsecured bankruptcy claim. After the Indigo buyout, Frontier’s new owner transformed it into what’s known as an ultra-low-cost carrier — an airline that offers inexpensive base fares and adds fees for everything else.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: The benchmark S&P 500 eked out a gain on Wednesday as strength in the energy and consumer sectors offset declines in financial shares and investors began looking ahead to first-quarter earnings season. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended slightly lower, falling for the ninth session out of the past 10, while the Nasdaq rose for a fourth straight day. Investors have been assessing what the Republicans' failure to pass a healthcare bill means for tax reform and the rest of President Donald Trump's agenda, hopes for which have helped drive stocks to record highs. They are looking to first-quarter earnings to support lofty valuations for stocks, with the S&P 500 trading at nearly 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months against its long-term average of 15 times. First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 10.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The policy risk has increased ... but economic data still remains solid and therefore earnings should be good," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer of Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. "Absent some revelation on the policy front, I think that’s the next catalyst for the market, is when we start seeing companies report." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.18 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,659.32, the S&P 500 gained 2.56 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,361.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.41 points, or 0.38 percent, to 5,897.55. The energy sector gained 1.2 percent, leading all sectors, supported by stronger oil prices . The consumer discretionary sector rose 0.6 percent as retailers such as Nordstrom and Kohl's surged. Amazon.com rose 2.1 percent and hit an all-time high, giving the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Financial shares fell back 0.5 percent a day after leading a rally. Investors also digested comments from Federal Reserve officials. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said he favors further interest rate hikes this year, while Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said the Fed should raise rates three more times in 2017. "The market seems to be unfazed by the fact that the Fed is looking to be somewhat aggressive in raising rates," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The stock rally fueled by optimism President Donald Trump will boost the economy may be near its peak, according to a Reuters poll of strategists, who forecast U.S. shares will gain less than 3 percent between now and year-end. In corporate news, Vertex Pharmaceuticals soared 20.5 percent after the company's cystic fibrosis treatment succeeded in a late-stage study. The stock boosted the S&P and helped drive the Nasdaq Biotechnology index up 0.9 percent. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well below the 6.9 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions and among the lightest volume days in 2017. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.88-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.59-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 86 new highs and 24 new lows.

She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. She is a qualified chartered accountant. Follow @GillianTan Facebook Twitter Email Print Share March 29, 2017 11:53 AM EDT WELLS FARGO & CO -0.29 At Closing, March 29th 55.67 USD Wells Fargo & Co.'s CEO Tim Sloan is earning his keep.  Late Tuesday, the bank reached a $110 million settlement over claims that its employees opened more than 2 million accounts without permission from customers. Sloan made the right call: In order to move past the scandal and as part of the settlement, Wells Fargo relented on its efforts to keep customers out of court. Its focus on settling claims by arbitration had received legislative backlash and could have prolonged and enhanced the damage to its reputation. Wells Fargo's Class-Action Settlement $110 Million The $110 million figure likely made backing down from arbitration easier to swallow -- it's far less than the bank had put aside in reserves, and at roughly 2 cents a share, below what Wall Street analysts had expected. It's now possible, in fact, that Wells Fargo will be able to eventually close the book on the scandal without a meaningful hit to its bottom line.   By the Numbers Wells Fargo still has a lead over the biggest U.S. banks, though it doesn't trade at as wide a premium as it did before the scandal Source: Bloomberg *Profitability metrics as of Dec. 31, 2016 Still, there have been costs. Wells Fargo has been surpassed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. as the biggest bank by market value. And back in September, it agreed to pay $185 million as part of a settlement with federal regulators and the Los Angeles city attorney’s office. Plus, as a sign of accountability, its top executives were stripped of $32 million in pay and equity awards.  Catch Me If You Can Shortly after the bogus-account scandal, Wells Fargo gave up its "most valuable bank" crown to JPMorgan Source: Bloomberg Although Tuesday's settlement (which needs to be approved by a judge) will be well received, other issues remain. Wells Fargo is still subject to criminal and other regulatory examinations or investigations, lawsuits from former employees and investors and it's still undergoing an internal review that may uncover other impacted customers or lead to additional legal battles (results are anticipated next month). On top of that, it has its hands full getting back in the good books with bank regulators, who have criticized everything from its "living will" plan to its community banking practices. Plus, its board may be further shaken up if disillusioned shareholders vote against the re-election of some directors at next month's annual general meeting, which -- as I've written -- wouldn't be a bad thing. Tenured Wells Fargo's independent director nominees have served 8.4 years on average. Time for a refresh? Source: Company presentation There's no point pretending that the road to redemption won't be a long one. But fortunately for investors, Wells Fargo is making ground. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Consulting firms previously projected the lender could lose up to $8 billion in revenue and $212 billion in deposits in an 18-month period.  To contact the author of this story: Gillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.net Are You Entertained?

The S&amp;P 500 financial index slipped 0.48 percent, weighed down by Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan . The sector had risen more than 1 percent a day earlier. However, losses on the S&amp;P and the Dow were limited by a rise in energy shares due to a 2 percent gain in oil prices. The S&amp;P 500 energy index was up 1.1 percent after data showed a smaller-than-expected build in U.S. crude stockpiles. With an August target date set for a highly anticipated U.S. tax reform bill and the quarter nearing an end, analysts expect the market to trade in a tight range. "We're going to be fairly range-bound as we get to the earnings season or until there is some significant development on tax reforms," said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. The reaction of U.S. markets to Britain formally initiating a process to separate from the European Union was muted. At 12:35 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones industrial average was down 53.02 points, or 0.26 percent, at 20,648.48, the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.74 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,359.31 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 15.03 points, or 0.26 percent, at 5,890.17. Amazon.com hit an all-time high of $870.88 and gave the biggest boost to the Nasdaq. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, jumped 23 percent to $110.25 after its cystic fibrosis treatment succeeded in a late-stage trial. UnitedHealth, which rose for the first time in nine days on Tuesday, was off 1.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,787 to 1,079. On the Nasdaq, 1,618 issues rose and 1,136 fell. The S&amp;P 500 index showed 11 52-week highs and one low, while the Nasdaq recorded 66 highs and 21 lows.

Sebi has settled proceedings against JP Morgan Mutual Fund and two related entities after they paid a total of Rs 2.75 crore and also voluntarily restrained from issuing new schemes for one year. The adjudication proceedings pertained to JP Morgan Mutual Fund launching a scheme, back in 2014, after expiry of the right to launch deadline. Besides, JP Morgan Mutual Fund, the proceedings were initiated by the regulator against trustee -- JP Morgan Mutual Fund India Pvt Ltd -- and JP Morgan Asset Management India Pvt Ltd. According to three separate but similarly-worded settlement orders issued today, each of the three entities have paid Rs 91.8 lakh to the regulator. Besides, they had proposed "voluntary debarment" from issuing of new schemes for a period of one year. The total settlement amount is little over Rs 2.75 crore. These entities paid the settlement amounts in February and three settlement orders were passed today by Sebi's Adjudicating Officer Suresh B Menon. The settlement terms were approved by the High Powered Advisory Committee on Consent. It was alleged in the show cause notice that JP Morgan Mutual Fund launched the scheme --JP Morgan India Fixed Maturity Plan - Series 39 -- when the right to launch the said scheme had already expired.Among others, it was alleged that the offer document contained misleading and incorrect scheme name and information and even the units that were allotted to the investors were under the incorrect scheme name. tags #JP Morgan MF #Market news #markets #SEBI Related news Business Under new chief Ajay Tyagi, SEBI is working overtime to resolve legacy issues Mar 30, 2017 11:28 AM Business Ahead of IPO, NSE would do well to resolve algo trading controversy Mar 30, 2017 11:06 AM Business Here are Prathamesh Mallya's views on commodities market Mar 30, 2017 10:57 AM Business Here are a few stock ideas by Amit Gupta Mar 30, 2017 10:47 AM Business Market waiting for next positive catalyst to carry this move forward: Credit Suisse Mar 30, 2017 08:58 AM Business Reliance Infra's Rs 3,000-cr InvIT fund gets NHAI approval Mar 30, 2017 08:45 AM Business Sebi settles proceedings against JP Morgan Mutual Fund Mar 29, 2017 10:14 PM Business Banks lift Sensex 122 pts; Nifty ends tad below 9150 ahead of F&O expiry; autos skid Mar 29, 2017 04:10 PM Business See earnings growth in mid-teen percentage for FY17, like auto: Axis Securities Mar 29, 2017 01:39 PM News Most Popular Top News Maybe it's time for hostile takeovers; govt must back honest risks: Uday Kotak D-Mart bumper listing: Should you buy, book profits or hold shares?

Edward Hardy Mar 29, 2017 12:20 PM EDT The most likely victim of the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union, if not the economy itself, is widely expected to be Britain's banking sector. A hub of financial activity and home to the international headquarters of many of the world's premier financial institutions, London enjoys at least some of its status as a result of its proximity to the European continent and access to consumers inside the EU. Both British and international banks are able to operate across all countries in the EU without holding individual regulatory permissions due to the 'Financial Services Passport' they receive by virtue of being registered and regulated in London. But Brexit means passporting is almost certain to go. As a result, banks are contemplating their operational presence in the U.K. JPMorgan After much speculation that up to 4,000 jobs could go as JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon has kept his cards close to his chest when in public. "The most important thing is that we will continue in every single country to serve our clients day in and day out," Dimon said. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs has been a frequent subject of speculation, with some reports suggesting it could move 350 jobs across to Frankfurt. But management are staying silent. "I think the answer is it's just too early to tell in terms of how this process is going to unfold...we'll contingency plan for multiple outcomes" said CFO Harvey Schwartz. Bank of America "We've developed plans based upon various scenarios and we're just going to have to wait and see how everything unfolds to know what we're going to do," CFO Paul Donofrio warned in October  But in February it hired real estate agents CBRE to scout for 500,000 square foot of City office space, which would house its European HQ from 2020 onwards if it decides not to renew the lease on its current site near St Paul's Cathedral. Citigroup Citigroup already has a subsidiary established in Ireland, which could be bulked up with extra people and additional capital if Brexit negotiations threaten its ability to operate across the rest of Europe. "Brexit, hard, soft, or scrambled, is still an open question and is likely to remain so for the near future," said Michael Corbat, CEO of Citigroup. Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley has said that it might need to move its European headquarters out of London if Brexit negotiations do not go the right way. "To the extent we have to comply with obviously the Brexit rules, we'll be putting our headquarters somewhere in Continental Europe," said CEO James Gorman. HSBC HSBC has said that it might need to move bankers out of London over the next two years, depending on the Brexit negotiation. "Current contingency planning suggests we may need to relocate some 1,000 roles from London to Paris progressively over the next two years," said Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC.  Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank currently operate in London using the EU passport. But they'll inevitably face having to apply for a U.K. banking license in the aftermath of Brexit, if a bilateral agreement cannot be reached. "We, in the vast, vast majority of cases, operate out of Deutsche Bank AG itself, so we're facing our clients and counterparties out of the German bank. We do add, comma, 'London branch' to our documents, but it's essentially we're dealing with DB AG," said CEO John Cryan READ MORE: How Brexit Is Already Taking Its Toll on Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Other Big Banks If you liked this article you might like How Has Brexit Affected the Value of the Pound?

The adjudication proceedings pertained to JP Morgan Mutual Fund launching a scheme, back in 2014, after expiry of the right to launch deadline. Besides, JP Morgan Mutual Fund, the proceedings were initiated by the regulator against trustee -- JP Morgan Mutual Fund India Pvt Ltd -- and JP Morgan Asset Management India Pvt Ltd. According to three separate but similarly-worded settlement orders issued today, each of the three entities have paid Rs 91.8 lakh to the regulator. Besides, they had proposed "voluntary debarment" from issuing of new schemes for a period of one year. The total settlement amount is little over Rs 2.75 crore. These entities paid the settlement amounts in February and three settlement orders were passed today by Sebi's Adjudicating Officer Suresh B Menon. The settlement terms were approved by the High Powered Advisory Committee on Consent. It was alleged in the show cause notice that JP Morgan Mutual Fund launched the scheme --JP Morgan India Fixed Maturity Plan - Series 39 -- when the right to launch the said scheme had already expired. Among others, it was alleged that the offer document contained misleading and incorrect scheme name and information and even the units that were allotted to the investors were under the incorrect scheme name.

Incidentally, Edelweiss Asset Management acquired JP Morgan's mutual fund business in March 2016. JP Morgan had entered the Indian mutual funds business in 2007. According to the order, the fund house failed to comply with certain provisions of the mutual fund regulations as laid down by the capital market regulator. The SEBI investigation found that the fund house launched a particular scheme after the expiry of the scheme information document (SID). Further, the offer document contained misleading and incorrect scheme name and investors were allotted units under the incorrect scheme name, says the SEBI order. While the SEBI probe was on, the fund house filed an application for consent settlement. The consent mechanism is like an out-of-court process through which SEBI settles cases in the form of penalty and/or debarment. The case is settled without any admission or denial of guilt by the alleged defaulter.

By Crystal Kim March 29, 2017 11:10 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Financial stocks have been the worst-performing sector since the beginning of March. The SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund (KBE) fell 13.8% from its March 2 high to the opening low on Monday. "That was the damaging period, and it took the ETF below its January lows," notes Instinet technical analyst Frank Capelleri. "Even with the mini-pop over the last two days, KBE remains below the meat of the former eight-week trading range." Illustration: Getty Images/iStockphoto KBE has fallen 0.31% today. Top index constituents JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and Northern Trust (NTRS) have declined 0.28%, 0.34%, and 0.06%, respectively. Meanwhile CIT Group (CIT) has gained 0.17% and Citigroup (C), 20%. Cappelleri doesn't think KBE can come back without support from rates. "The Banks' aggregate breakout suggested that they were ready (and hoping) for a higher interest rate environment," he says. This echoes what happened around the last rate hike in December, though banks held their own. Cappelleri doesn't see that occurring now:  The reaction now has been sloppy at best. The ironic part is that KBE now has witnessed a false breakout and a possible false breakdown, too (time will tell). Through it all, the 10 Year Yield has remained confined to the same 2.3%-2.6% range it has been in since December. Needless to say, then, rates continue to play the biggest role in the Banks’ current and future direction. The silver lining now is that with the Banks having pulled back so much they are now more aligned with rates again. KBE is is oversold and trying to bounce, as the 10-Yr Yields allegedly tries to do the same. And if the same pattern plays out over the next few weeks, rates could once again rally further, which could help KBE claw its way back. The key, then, is seeing the 10-Year Yield once again respect support near 2.3%.

GroupM, the world’s biggest media-buying firm, on Wednesday announced a partnership with social-analytics provider OpenSlate to help advertisers analyze YouTube content for quality and brand safety. GroupM said the new solution with OpenSlate will initially roll out in the U.S. and U.K., with plans under way to expand to additional international markets. The company said Google is enabling its partnership with OpenSlate to identify content that’s not brand-safe. Currently, GroupM’s clients are the only advertisers able to monitor content in the Google Preferred program — which comprises the most popular YouTube channels in specific categories — in this way. Advertisers that have pulled ad spending from YouTube, and in some cases Google’s display advertising networks, include AT&T, Verizon, FX Networks, PepsiCo, Walmart, Dish Network, Starbucks, GM, JP Morgan Chase & Co., Johnson & Johnson and Lyft. That’s in addition to more than 250 U.K. advertisers who have frozen spending on YouTube, an exodus touched off by a report by the Times of London that ads from major brands were appearing in videos posted by white supremacists and other hatemongers. Related YouTube Hate-Speech Ad Fallout Continues: U.S. Advertising Trade Group Urges Google to Rectify ‘Crisis’ Some analysts expect the impact on Google’s bottom line to be minimal. But the company could lose up to $750 million in ad revenue from the controversy, according to an estimate released last week by Nomura’s Instinet. According to GroupM, under the deal with OpenSlate the analytics firm will provide clients of its agencies additional controls and content safeguards to support their YouTube media buys. The solution will span both reservation media, including Google Preferred, and in auction-based inventory bought through AdWords or DoubleClick Bid Manager. Using OpenSlate’s data, clients will be able to better define the type of content that should be excluded from their YouTube media buys, the companies said. In addition, OpenSlate will provide GroupM agency clients with reporting that details exactly where their campaigns have run. “Most brands today have scaled their advertising on digital platforms like YouTube, where most content is user-generated, but their needs for mature and safe ad products and environments persist,” Susan Schiekofer, chief digital investment officer at GroupM North America, said in a statement. GroupM’s Schiekofer conceded that it’s not possible to eliminate all risk for advertisers when it comes to user-generated media, but she positioned the partnership with OpenSlate as an extra step it is taking to ensure clients’ brand reputations. Together, GroupM and Kantar account for over half of WPP’s more than $20 billion in annual revenue. Google has publicly stated that it’s taking a number of steps to make sure ads are not placed against offensive content. The internet giant’s chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, wrote in a blog post last week that Google is improving the controls and reporting tools advertisers have about where their ads are displayed. He said the company also is hiring more staff and developing artificial-intelligence algorithms to better identify hate speech. That hasn’t mollified the concerns of some major advertisers. Last week Bob Liodice, CEO of the Association of National Advertisers, said Google and other digital advertising platforms must do more to make digital advertising absolutely safe for brands. “Brands choose those platforms to work hard for them to achieve all of their business and brand building objectives. But the most important of those priorities is ‘to do no harm,'” Liodice said. Filed Under: Google GroupM OpenSlate Youtube Want to read more articles like this one? SUBSCRIBE TO VARIETY TODAY.

Financial News Asset Management Rankings shake-up for top 10 fund managers Franklin Templeton and Carmignac give ground to Nordea, Robeco, and Pictet in key annual survey of a €2.8 trillion industry Diana Mackay, joint chief executive of MackayWilliams Company Photograph By David Ricketts March 29, 2017 Updated: 2:36 p.m. GMT Asset management giants Franklin Templeton and Carmignac have fallen out of a list of Europe’s top 10 funds brands, overtaken by rivals deemed to have more innovative products. US-headquartered Franklin Templeton, which has struggled with outflows from its blockbuster Global Total Return and Global Bond funds, has fallen from fourth to 11th place in the annual rankings of fund management brands in Europe by market research firm Fund Buyer Focus. Paris-based Carmignac has dropped from ninth to 12th. The firm, the Berlin-based arm of consultancy MackayWilliams, specialises in telling fund managers how they are perceived among the advisers who buy or recommend mutual funds for retail clients.  Fund Buyer Focus interviewed 1,000 fund selectors that oversee €2.8 trillion of assets between them. Templeton and Carmignac were the only two asset managers to have dropped out of their top 10 list. According to Morningstar data, Templeton's Global Bond and Global Total Return funds – which have a bias towards emerging markets – together haemorrhaged total assets of $14.7 billion last year. Nordea, the biggest climber in this year's ranking, moved up 14 places to eighth. Robeco moved up four places, to 10th. Both appeared in the top 10 brands for the first time. The top three brands – BlackRock, JPMorgan and Fidelity – remained unchanged from last year. Pictet climbed from 10th position to fourth, joining Europe's elite top five brands for the first time. UK-listed asset manager Schroders rose one place to finish fifth, as did Invesco at sixth and Deutsche Asset Management at seventh. M&G was the only asset manager in the top 10 to slip, down four places to ninth. Diana Mackay, joint chief executive of MackayWilliams, said high scores for innovation and "client- oriented thinking" were common among all top 10 fund firms. She said despite Franklin losing its coveted top 10 spot, prospects for the US fund house are "on the turn". "Franklin shot through the stars with its bond products a few years ago but when that fell away others leapt over them in terms of innovation." "But they have launched a lot of products and our expectation is that the tide is turning.  We expect Franklin will be on the rise," she said. Franklin Templeton declined to comment but a spokesperson for the US manager pointed to comments made by chief executive Greg Johnson earlier this year, in which he said the impact of rising interest rates during the first quarter "was felt across geographies and sectors, and contributed to shifts in market leadership in a number of areas". Johnson said: "In this environment, improved performance across the board, particularly for our hybrid and global macro strategies, validates our sound, long-term investment approach and belief in the importance of active management." Mackay said the brand score of Carmignac, had slipped due to its "specialist approach", and a particularly heavy reliance on its flagship Patrimoine fund. She said that having a heavy reliance on blockbuster products can leave a fund brand vulnerable, particularly when selectors lose appetite for that investment approach. Morningstar data shows Carmignac's Patrimoine fund, which has almost $26bn in assets, saw outflows of $1.5 billion during 2016. "The problem for Camignac is that they invented this mixed asset product – they made it but there are now so many competitors. If their fund is slightly off the boil selectors will have plenty of other choice. People are waiting for them to come up with something that is different to the Patrimoine legacy," she said. Carmignac declined to comment. Mackay said that Pictet's rise to the top five was due to its "strong reputation for thematic funds," and said: "The other side of the coin is the mixed asset arena, where Nordea has shone through." Ben Seager-Scott, director of investment strategy at wealth management firm Tilney Bestinvest, said there had been a "noticeable pick-up in activity from Pictet and Nordea, particularly from a UK perspective". "I certainly get the impression that they're engaging with wealth managers and promoting their products at conferences and events more than they were," he said. Darius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Financial Services, said Pictet's Robotics fund stood out as being particularly innovative. He also said Nordea's €18bn Stable Return fund has been popular among fund selectors. The product has been seen as a rival to Standard Life's Global Absolute Return Strategies – another blockbuster multi-asset vehicle. However, he acknowledged the tough landscape for asset managers to shine: "Asset management is extremely competitive. There are over 100 fund managers for us to look at," said McDermott. "Maintaining contact and relationships with fund buyers is critical for them and it is getting harder for them to achieve. They need to know the people who do the research and the funds they want," he said.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was 0.1 per cent higher by 1000 GMT, with modest gains driven by broker upgrades and results. Markets were muted as investors awaited details on the two parties' negotiating positions ahead of long and complex talks. “It's like a race: we are firing the starting gun and now we just have to see how it develops,” said Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JP Morgan Asset Management. “When you have a market that's more driven by macro than fundamentals it can be tricky, but the playbook is well rehearsed. Everyone has already positioned for this,” he said. Both Britain's FTSE 100 and the more domestically exposed mid caps were flat. “If the negotiations go well, domestic stocks could do a bit better,” said Macklow-Smith, noting their devaluation after investors shifted away from domestic exposure since the Brexit referendum last June. Separately, merger negotiations between London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse were halted after EU antitrust regulators blocked the proposed deal, as expected, saying the merger's size would have harmed competition. LSE shares gained 1.8 per cent, while Deutsche Boerse was up 0.3 per cent. Autos stocks were the best sectoral gainers, rising 0.5 per cent. German carmaker Daimler drove gains after it said it expected record sales for its Mercedes-Benz cars for the first quarter. Automotive suppliers Faurecia and Valeo benefited from broker upgrades. Engie rose 2.9 per cent to its highest in more than four months, the top French and European gainer, after JP Morgan upgraded its view on the gas and electricity supplier to overweight. Top-ranked JPM analyst Vincent Ayral said Engie had reached an inflection point, with the dilutive effects of the company's transformation plan more than compensated by restructuring gains, supportive FX, and organic growth. 3I Group gained 3.2 percent after Morgan Stanley raised the private equity group to “overweight", saying the value proposition of Benelux-based discount retailer Action, an important part of 3I's portfolio, is not fully priced in to the shares. Norsk Hydro led basic resource stocks higher, up 2.7 per cent after ratings agency Moody's upgraded its baseline credit assessment of the aluminium producer to Baa2 from Baa3. German online classified ads firm Scout24 was the worst-performing European stock, down 7.1 per cent and set for its worst day in 3 1/2 months after it posted results and a 2017 outlook below consensus. “There seems to have been a good deal of introspection and reflection at Scout ... 2H16 may not be much better than 1H16, but 2017 will be intriguing,” say Jefferies analysts. Swedish bank SEB was down 5.3 per cent after going ex-dividend.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was 0.1 percent higher by 1000 GMT, with modest gains driven by broker upgrades and results. Markets were muted as investors awaited details on the two parties' negotiating positions ahead of long and complex talks. "It's like a race: we are firing the starting gun and now we just have to see how it develops," said Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JP Morgan Asset Management. "When you have a market that's more driven by macro than fundamentals it can be tricky, but the playbook is well rehearsed. Everyone has already positioned for this," he said. Both Britain's FTSE 100 and the more domestically exposed mid caps were flat. "If the negotiations go well, domestic stocks could do a bit better," said Macklow-Smith, noting their devaluation after investors shifted away from domestic exposure since the Brexit referendum last June. Separately, merger negotiations between London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse were halted after EU antitrust regulators blocked the proposed deal, as expected, saying the merger's size would have harmed competition. LSE shares gained 1.8 percent, while Deutsche Boerse was up 0.3 percent. Autos stocks were the best sectoral gainers, rising 0.5 percent. German carmaker Daimler drove gains after it said it expected record sales for its Mercedes-Benz cars for the first quarter. Automotive suppliers Faurecia and Valeo benefited from broker upgrades. Engie rose 2.9 percent to its highest in more than four months, the top French and European gainer, after JP Morgan upgraded its view on the gas and electricity supplier to overweight. Top-ranked JPM analyst Vincent Ayral said Engie had reached an inflection point, with the dilutive effects of the company's transformation plan more than compensated by restructuring gains, supportive FX, and organic growth. 3I Group gained 3.2 percent after Morgan Stanley raised the private equity group to "overweight", saying the value proposition of Benelux-based discount retailer Action, an important part of 3I's portfolio, is not fully priced in to the shares. Norsk Hydro led basic resource stocks higher, up 2.7 percent after ratings agency Moody's upgraded its baseline credit assessment of the aluminium producer to Baa2 from Baa3. German online classified ads firm Scout24 was the worst-performing European stock, down 7.1 percent and set for its worst day in 3 1/2 months after it posted results and a 2017 outlook below consensus. "There seems to have been a good deal of introspection and reflection at Scout ... 2H16 may not be much better than 1H16, but 2017 will be intriguing," say Jefferies analysts.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was 0.1 percent higher by 1000 GMT, with modest gains driven by broker upgrades and results. Markets were muted as investors awaited details on the two parties' negotiating positions ahead of long and complex talks. "It's like a race: we are firing the starting gun and now we just have to see how it develops," said Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JP Morgan Asset Management. "When you have a market that's more driven by macro than fundamentals it can be tricky, but the playbook is well rehearsed. Everyone has already positioned for this," he said. Both Britain's FTSE 100 and the more domestically exposed mid caps were flat. "If the negotiations go well, domestic stocks could do a bit better," said Macklow-Smith, noting their devaluation after investors shifted away from domestic exposure since the Brexit referendum last June. Separately, merger negotiations between London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse were halted after EU antitrust regulators blocked the proposed deal, as expected, saying the merger's size would have harmed competition. LSE shares gained 1.8 percent, while Deutsche Boerse was up 0.3 percent. Autos stocks were the best sectoral gainers, rising 0.5 percent. German carmaker Daimler drove gains after it said it expected record sales for its Mercedes-Benz cars for the first quarter. Automotive suppliers Faurecia and Valeo benefited from broker upgrades. Engie rose 2.9 percent to its highest in more than four months, the top French and European gainer, after JP Morgan upgraded its view on the gas and electricity supplier to overweight. Top-ranked JPM analyst Vincent Ayral said Engie had reached an inflection point, with the dilutive effects of the company's transformation plan more than compensated by restructuring gains, supportive FX, and organic growth. 3I Group gained 3.2 percent after Morgan Stanley raised the private equity group to "overweight", saying the value proposition of Benelux-based discount retailer Action, an important part of 3I's portfolio, is not fully priced in to the shares. Norsk Hydro led basic resource stocks higher, up 2.7 percent after ratings agency Moody's upgraded its baseline credit assessment of the aluminium producer to Baa2 from Baa3. German online classified ads firm Scout24 was the worst-performing European stock, down 7.1 percent and set for its worst day in 3 1/2 months after it posted results and a 2017 outlook below consensus. "There seems to have been a good deal of introspection and reflection at Scout ... 2H16 may not be much better than 1H16, but 2017 will be intriguing," say Jefferies analysts. Swedish bank SEB was down 5.3 percent after going ex-dividend.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was 0.1 percent higher by 1000 GMT, with modest gains driven by broker upgrades and results. Markets were muted as investors awaited details on the two parties' negotiating positions ahead of long and complex talks. "It's like a race: we are firing the starting gun and now we just have to see how it develops," said Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JP Morgan Asset Management. "When you have a market that's more driven by macro than fundamentals it can be tricky, but the playbook is well rehearsed. Everyone has already positioned for this," he said. Both Britain's FTSE 100 and the more domestically exposed mid caps were flat. "If the negotiations go well, domestic stocks could do a bit better," said Macklow-Smith, noting their devaluation after investors shifted away from domestic exposure since the Brexit referendum last June. Separately, merger negotiations between London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse were halted after EU antitrust regulators blocked the proposed deal, as expected, saying the merger's size would have harmed competition. LSE shares gained 1.8 percent, while Deutsche Boerse was up 0.3 percent. Autos stocks were the best sectoral gainers, rising 0.5 percent. German carmaker Daimler drove gains after it said it expected record sales for its Mercedes-Benz cars for the first quarter. Automotive suppliers Faurecia and Valeo benefited from broker upgrades. Engie rose 2.9 percent to its highest in more than four months, the top French and European gainer, after JP Morgan upgraded its view on the gas and electricity supplier to overweight. Top-ranked JPM analyst Vincent Ayral said Engie had reached an inflection point, with the dilutive effects of the company's transformation plan more than compensated by restructuring gains, supportive FX, and organic growth. 3I Group gained 3.2 percent after Morgan Stanley raised the private equity group to "overweight", saying the value proposition of Benelux-based discount retailer Action, an important part of 3I's portfolio, is not fully priced in to the shares. Norsk Hydro led basic resource stocks higher, up 2.7 percent after ratings agency Moody's upgraded its baseline credit assessment of the aluminium producer to Baa2 from Baa3. German online classified ads firm Scout24 was the worst-performing European stock, down 7.1 percent and set for its worst day in 3 1/2 months after it posted results and a 2017 outlook below consensus. "There seems to have been a good deal of introspection and reflection at Scout ... 2H16 may not be much better than 1H16, but 2017 will be intriguing," say Jefferies analysts. Swedish bank SEB was down 5.3 percent after going ex-dividend.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Thursday March 30, 2017 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode Banks lift ASX to a new high Patrick Commins and Jens Meyer 29 Mar 2017, 5:05 p.m. The local sharemarket extended Tuesday's strong gains to hit another near two-year high, with banks once again at the vanguard of the rally. Banks lift ASX to a new high Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit The local sharemarket extended Tuesday's strong gains to hit another near two-year high, with banks once again at the vanguard of the rally. The S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed a further 52 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 5874 points, its highest since May 2015, bringing gains in the benchmark measure over the past two days to 127 points, or 2.2 per cent. Wednesday's sharemarket rise was widely spread, with around three in four of the top 200 names closing higher, and all sectors in the green. But most of the day's upwards impetus was from investors piling into the major lenders for the second session in a row, as investors were buoyed by analysis suggesting the recent wave of mortgage rate rises will flow through to higher earnings. Commonwealth Bank of Australia added 1 per cent, National Australia Bank ,1.2 per cent, ANZ Banking Group, 1.1 per cent and Westpac Banking Corp up 1.3 per cent. Macquarie Group also climbed 1.3 per cent. In corporate news, veteran retailer Solomon Lew confirmed he acquired a 10.8 per cent stake in Myer through his listed investment company, Premier Investments, which also informed the market it did not "currently intend" to make a bid for the department store. Fairfax Media shares jumped 2.8 per cent amid increasing talk of a private equity takeover offer. After wobbling last week amid fears of an end to the "Trump trade" rally that has followed the US election, the ASX 200 has recouped all those losses and pushed to new heights. In addition to improving sentiment around the heavyweight ASX-listed lenders, stocks have also been buoyed by "the realisation that actually the world is getting better, and it's not all about Donald Trump," JP Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Kerry Craig said. This renewed optimism in the drivers of the post-US election rally helped push commodity prices and miners higher on Wednesday. BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals added 0.3 per cent, while Rio Tinto added 0.7 per cent. Energy names were well supported as the recent slide in oil prices looks to have been arrested. Woodside Petroleum climbed 1 per cent. Earnings expectations for the Australian sharemarket have climbed by 20 per cent since the middle of 2016, IG chief markets strategist Chris Weston said. "The market is pricey, but not at a level where the fund managers really start getting hot under the collar, going to cash or looking at hedging structures," Mr Weston said. "But the key question from here is what is going to propel earnings higher, given a lot of the [earnings per share] revisions have come from higher oil, bulk [commodities] and base metals [prices]." Expected profit growth outside mining and more recently banking is more subdued, Mr Kerry agreed. "I think you are getting a very positive view at the index level in terms of what the market is going to deliver in earnings, but it's very focused [on a sector level] in where it will come through," Mr Kerry agreed. "I don't know how many investors appreciate that." "This commodities windfall has been very slow to feed through to the rest of the economy and the rest of the market," he said. Stock of the day - Cooper Energy Oil and gas developer Cooper Energy has launched a $151 million equity raising to help fund its new Sole offshore gas project in Victoria's Gippsland Basin. The Sole gas project is expected to cost $355 million, and Cooper says the the project will increase the company's proven and probable reserves by 43 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) from the 11.6 mmboe held at the start of the year. The stock was put in a trading halt for the duration of the institutional portion of the equity raising, with 150 million new shares issued to raise $47 million. The shares are valued at 31.5??, a discount on the 38.5?? at which Cooper last traded. All three analysts following the company have a 'buy' rating on the stock, with an average price target of 60??. Market movers Sterling jitters The pound was on the skids after British Prime Minister Theresa May signed a letter to formally start the country's exit from the European Union. The pound fell another 0.6 per cent against the greenback to $US1.2377 on Wednesday after sliding 0.9 per cent overnight. The Aussie in turn gained 0.5 per cent to 61.62 pence, following a 1.1 per cent overnight rally. Traders said that investors still nervous about the exit process were the likely sellers. Global trade More signs pointing to a pick-up in global growth: world trade is recovering, despite worries about rising protectionism. Trade volumes increased by 2.9 per cent in January in three-month average year-on-year terms, which compares favourably to annual growth of 1.3 per cent in 2016 as a whole. The upbeat figures chime with alternative measures of world trade, such as an up-tick in both the volume of containers shipped through major ports and the volume of air freight in January. Iron ore Steel and iron ore futures in China on Wednesday pulled away from multi-week lows, but traders predict further price declines as supply outpaces demand in the world's top market. Iron ore for September delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange was up 2.6 per cent. Prospective buyers of iron ore in China are holding back following the recent price slide that took spot prices of the steelmaking raw material to a seven-week trough of $81.57 a tonne on Monday. "Every time the price starts to drop, buying interest would shrink," said a Shanghai-based iron ore trader. Australian dollar The Aussie edged higher on Tuesday to US76.4?? in late trade, and CBA chief currency strategist Richard Grace said to keep an eye on US politics for an indication of where the Aussie dollar is headed. "The biggest single determinant for the Australian dollar's direction over the next months will be what Trump does on tax," Mr Grace said. Any signs that Trump will secure the significant tax cuts he's flagged will deliver a boost to the greenback, he said.

Reuters Mar 28, 2017 5:57 PM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Rudolph Giuliani, former mayor of New York, speaks to members of the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, U.S., on Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017. John Taggart/Bloomberg WATCH Trump wanted a 'Muslim ban,' asked me to find a legal way to do it, says Rudy Giuliani Giuliani meets with Netanyahu, 'conveys personal message' from Trump Adelson, Israeli envoy Dermer and Giuliani hobnob at Trump's D.C. gala A wealthy Turkish gold trader's decision to hire former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey to represent him, as he defends against charges he conspired to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran, raises a potential conflict of interest, prosecutors said. At least eight big banks allegedly victimized by the trader, Reza Zarrab, are current or former clients of Giuliani and Mukasey's law firms, acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said in a letter dated Monday to the federal judge hearing the case. The banks' relationships with the law firms require a special hearing, known as a "Curcio" hearing, to make sure Zarrab understands the potential conflict, Kim said. Giuliani is a lawyer for Greenberg Traurig, while Mukasey, who is also a former federal judge, is a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton. Neither firm had an immediate comment. The eight banks are Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Standard Chartered Plc, UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co. "Through various deceptive acts, including layering the transactions and omitting information concerning the Iranian nexus, Zarrab and his co-conspirators allegedly tricked numerous U.S. financial institutions into processing barred transactions, thus exposing them to significant potential loss," Kim said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, explaining the potential conflict of interest. Prosecutors accused the Iranian-born Zarrab and two others of engaging in hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions for Iran's government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015, in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions. A trial is scheduled for August 21. Zarrab has been in federal custody since his March 21, 2016, arrest in Miami, while en route to Disney World with his wife and daughter. Holding a Curcio hearing now could eliminate one ground for appeal if the case goes against Zarrab. The case has been closely watched in Turkey, where Zarrab was arrested in 2013 in a corruption probe into individuals with close ties to Tayyip Erdogan, then Turkey's prime minister and now its president. Zarrab is a dual national of Iran and Turkey. Another lawyer for Zarrab, Benjamin Brafman, said in a letter on Monday that Giuliani and Mukasey's roles "will not require any appearance in court and, accordingly, a hearing is not required." The case is U.S. v. Zarrab, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00867.

Banks and other financial companies led stock indexes sharply higher Tuesday, March 28, 2017, snapping an eight-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Banks and other financial companies led stock indexes sharply higher Tuesday, snapping an eight-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. The rally was broad, with materials and industrial companies among the biggest gainers. Energy stocks notched a big gain as crude oil prices moved higher. The market got a boost from data showing that consumer confidence in the United States hit its highest level since 2000. Investor optimism that Congress and the White House are focusing on tax cuts and other business-friendly policy proposals after spending recent weeks focused on health care also helped send the market higher, said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “The consumer confidence number was really good, but more importantly, it seems like both sides of the aisle do want to get something done around tax reform,” Kinahan said. “That's all the market is really hanging its hat on.” The Dow rose 150.52 points, or 0.7 percent, to 20,701.50. The 30-company average's decline in the previous eight consecutive days was its longest slide in more than five years. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 16.98 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,358.57. The Nasdaq composite index gained 34.77 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,875.14. Bond prices edged lower. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.42 percent from 2.38 percent. Since Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, investors have been optimistic that the administration will deliver on promises to slash taxes, loosen regulations for companies and institute other business-friendly policies. Republicans' failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act last week dashed some of that optimism, pulling down stocks. But this week, Republicans appear to be shifting their focus back to tax cuts, among other issues. “The market is sort of in a holding pattern waiting for additional clarity from the administration on corporate tax reform,” said Nadia Lovell, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “We do view the pivot away from health care reform on Friday as an overall net positive.” Trading got off to a downbeat start Tuesday as investors weighed the latest batch of company earnings news. But the market livened up around midmorning when the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose this month to its highest level in more than 16 years. The index measures both consumers' assessment of current conditions and their expectations for the future. Both improved this month. Traders also got some encouragement from the latest Standard & Poor's Core­Logic Case-Shiller home price index, which showed that U.S. home prices rose at the fastest pace in more than two years in January. Mortgage rates are rising, but that's not expected to affect home sales yet because hiring is still strong, rates are low and there aren't a lot of homes on the market. That's a positive combination for homebuilders, many of which have seen their stocks move sharply higher this year. Beazer Homes USA notched the biggest gain among builders Tuesday, adding 38 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $12.06. The stock remains down 9.3 percent this year. Several companies reported improved quarterly results or outlooks, which also helped put traders in a buying mood. Darden Restaurants jumped 9.3 percent after the owner of Olive Garden reported strong quarterly results and said it will buy the Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen chain for $780 million. Cheddar has 165 locations in 28 states. Darden was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, rising $7.04 to $82.62. Red Hat climbed 5.2 percent after the open-source software company reported strong sales and solid guidance for the current quarter. The stock added $4.28 to $86.48. Carnival rose 0.7 percent after the cruise line operator served up solid first-quarter results and a better-than-expected estimate for the second quarter. The stock, which closed at an all-time high on Monday, gained another 39 cents to $59.26. General Motors rose 2.4 percent to $35.56 after its board voted to reject a proposal from investor David Einhorn to split the automaker's stock into two classes. GM shares picked up 85 cents to $35.56. Several major stock indexes overseas closed higher. In Europe, Germany's DAX gained 1.3 percent, while France's CAC 40 rose 0.6 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares added 0.7 percent. Investors, particularly in U.K.-related assets, will have more to chew on Wednesday when the British government finally triggers the two-year process by which it leaves the European Union. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1.1 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.5 percent. Seoul's Kospi rose 0.3 percent. The euro weakened to $1.0808 from $1.0868, while the dollar strengthened to 111.09 yen from 110.57 yen. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 64 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $48.37 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, climbed 58 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $51.33 a barrel in London. Natural gas added 4 cents to $3.10 per 1,000 cubic feet, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.64 per gallon and heating oil gained a penny to $1.52 per gallon. In metals trading, the price of gold slipped 10 cents to settle at $1,255.60 an ounce. Silver rose 14 cents to $18.25 per ounce. Copper added 4 cents to $2.68 per pound.

Terminal rentals declined by about 1 percent last year, to 324,485 worldwide, as banks downsized and cut the cord, according to a report released Tuesday by Burton-Taylor International Consulting. The 2016 decline in terminal sales was only the second time in the company’s nearly 36-year history. The only other down year was 2009, during the financial crisis. Last year, The Post exclusively reported that JPMorgan and Bank of America, two of the company’s biggest customers, were looking to cut as many as 7,000 terminals during the next three years as part of larger budget overhauls. Bloomberg is still the biggest player in the field — with more than a third of the entire market share. The next-biggest company, Thomson Reuters, fell to 23 percent. Despite the terminal drop-off, Bloomberg still managed to increase revenue by about 3.4 percent, to $9.2 billion — in part because of a 10 percent spike in bankers buying raw data feeds.

It isn’t clear how profitable Bloomberg is, since the company reports revenues but not costs. One reason for the decline in terminal sales has to do with the terminal contracts, almost all of which are denominated in US dollars, three sources in the company told The Post. The US dollar has gained so much against others that in places like Brazil — where the value of its currency has collapsed against the greenback since 2012 — terminals have effectively doubled in price from only a few years ago. Overall, the company’s growth has slowed around the world during the last four years. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, terminal sales have dropped 1.8 percent during that time. They’re up 5.8 percent in Asia and 0.6 percent in the Americas. “Even though it’s a reality that people in Brazil or other countries suffer those problems when paying for those Bloombergs, Bloomberg has been able to sell enough terminals around the world that the net isn’t crushing them,” Douglas B. Taylor, the author of the report, told The Post. Ty Trippet, a spokesman for Bloomberg, declined to comment.

REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci - RTX2AHAB By Tatiana Bautzer | NEW YORK NEW YORK Latin American governments and companies could soon step up bond sales, seizing on an increased appetite for deals as a regional economic recovery gains steam and concerns about aggressive U.S. policy changes ease, bankers and investors said this week. Returns on Latin American bonds remain attractive and the new openness to deals has already allowed Brazil's government to raise funds at a record low yield. Argentine's Santa Fé province also recently returned to the capital market after a long hiatus. Brazil's Suzano Papel e Celulose SA's (SUZB5.SA) is one example of the warmer reception for Latin American debt. Its recent sale of a 30-year junk global bond - the first of its kind by a Brazilian company - underscored investors' receptiveness to less traditional structures, bankers said. Brazilian logistics firm JSL SA (JSLG3.SA) could be next in line, two people familiar with the plans said. Concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump would lure capital out of Latin America have subsided, according to bankers, who spoke on background on the eve of Brazilian bank Itau BBA's annual debt capital markets conference in New York. That, coupled with market stability after the U.S. Federal Reserve's single rate hike so far this year, is fueling inflows, the bankers added. Emerging market funds registered a $6.5 billion net inflow in the week ending March 22, their highest in nearly four years, Institute of International Finance data showed. About $4.5 billion of that total went to bonds. "We'll still see a lot of debt refinancing deals, but there are a few first-time issuers tapping the market," said Felipe Wilberg, global head of fixed income for Itaú BBA, Brazil's largest corporate and investment bank. Cheaper funding for the region's borrowers largely hinges on governments' ability to push ahead with key reforms ahead of a busy Latin America election calendar, Wilberg said. Investors had initially expected Trump-related turmoil to slam the brakes on access to capital markets in Latin America, which has struggled with the end of a decade-long commodities boom. The premium that investors demand to own Latin American bonds over U.S. Treasuries now stands at about 7.6 percentage points, compared with about 7.1 points at the start of the year, according to JPMorgan's EMBI Diversified Latin America bond index .JPMEGDLAT. DIFFERENT INVESTOR REACTION However, the pushback has been minor relative to prior U.S. tightening cycles that triggered violent swings in Latin American issuers' borrowing costs. "Although conventional wisdom states that U.S. rate hikes lead to pressure on asset prices in emerging markets, we are seeing a different reaction from investors," said Marc Nachmann, head of Latin America for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Western Asset Management Co has raised the Latin America share of its emerging markets debt positions to 47 percent from 40 percent over the past year, as prices turned attractive and the outlook improved, said Mark Hughes, who helps oversee $40 billion in bonds for the firm. The ramp-up has been gradual though, Hughes said, noting that bonds from Brazilian exporters now offer a better entry point than those of domestic-oriented companies. Latin American sovereign and corporate borrowers have raised $34 billion from sales of global debt this year, Itaú BBA data showed. Last year, bond borrowing in the region reached $102 billion. Bankers are raising their estimates for new Latin American bond supply this year to $80 billion from as low as $60 billion in November as initially negative sentiment on Mexico has recovered. In the case of Brazil, President Michel Temer's progress in pushing reforms is fueling demand for bonds like Suzano's. "When the deal hit the road, we sensed that investors were in general more optimistic about fiscal consolidation than they were a year earlier," Marcelo Bacci, Suzano's chief financial officer, said in an interview.

Returns on Latin American bonds remain attractive and the new openness to deals has already allowed Brazil's government to raise funds at a record low yield. Argentine's Santa Fé province also recently returned to the capital market after a long hiatus. Brazil's Suzano Papel e Celulose SA's is one example of the warmer reception for Latin American debt. Its recent sale of a 30-year junk global bond - the first of its kind by a Brazilian company - underscored investors' receptiveness to less traditional structures, bankers said. Brazilian logistics firm JSL SA could be next in line, two people familiar with the plans said. Concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump would lure capital out of Latin America have subsided, according to bankers, who spoke on background on the eve of Brazilian bank Itau BBA's annual debt capital markets conference in New York. That, coupled with market stability after the U.S. Federal Reserve's single rate hike so far this year, is fueling inflows, the bankers added. Emerging market funds registered a $6.5 billion net inflow in the week ending March 22, their highest in nearly four years, Institute of International Finance data showed. About $4.5 billion of that total went to bonds. "We'll still see a lot of debt refinancing deals, but there are a few first-time issuers tapping the market," said Felipe Wilberg, global head of fixed income for Itaú BBA, Brazil's largest corporate and investment bank. Cheaper funding for the region's borrowers largely hinges on governments' ability to push ahead with key reforms ahead of a busy Latin America election calendar, Wilberg said. Investors had initially expected Trump-related turmoil to slam the brakes on access to capital markets in Latin America, which has struggled with the end of a decade-long commodities boom. The premium that investors demand to own Latin American bonds over U.S. Treasuries now stands at about 7.6 percentage points, compared with about 7.1 points at the start of the year, according to JPMorgan's EMBI Diversified Latin America bond index. DIFFERENT INVESTOR REACTION However, the pushback has been minor relative to prior U.S. tightening cycles that triggered violent swings in Latin American issuers' borrowing costs. "Although conventional wisdom states that U.S. rate hikes lead to pressure on asset prices in emerging markets, we are seeing a different reaction from investors," said Marc Nachmann, head of Latin America for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Western Asset Management Co has raised the Latin America share of its emerging markets debt positions to 47 percent from 40 percent over the past year, as prices turned attractive and the outlook improved, said Mark Hughes, who helps oversee $40 billion in bonds for the firm. The ramp-up has been gradual though, Hughes said, noting that bonds from Brazilian exporters now offer a better entry point than those of domestic-oriented companies. Latin American sovereign and corporate borrowers have raised $34 billion from sales of global debt this year, Itaú BBA data showed. Last year, bond borrowing in the region reached $102 billion. Bankers are raising their estimates for new Latin American bond supply this year to $80 billion from as low as $60 billion in November as initially negative sentiment on Mexico has recovered. In the case of Brazil, President Michel Temer's progress in pushing reforms is fueling demand for bonds like Suzano's. "When the deal hit the road, we sensed that investors were in general more optimistic about fiscal consolidation than they were a year earlier," Marcelo Bacci, Suzano's chief financial officer, said in an interview.

Michel O'Sullivan Share on twitter by Michael Smith TPG has a $1 billion-plus debt package in place to fund a potential takeover bid for Fairfax Media, although the private equity firm's appetite for the publisher is believed to have cooled following a surge in the target's share price this week. TPG's banking syndicate, led by Credit Suisse's Michael Stock, is believed to have funding in place at 4.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation(EBITDA). JPMorgan is also on board. Peter Cook, a partner at Gilbert + Tobin, is also on the deal. Based on Fairfax's 2016 earnings, this would give TPG access to more than $1.2 billion in debt to fund a takeover bid. Fairfax's current market capitalisation is $2.5 billion. Shares in Fairfax, publisher of The Australian Financial Review, spiked this week after reports that TPG was believed to have bought a stake in the company. After rising 2.8 per cent on Wednesday, the stock was down 1.6 per cent on Thursday morning. Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements It is believed TPG was looking to launch an offer priced at around $1.15 per share as early as this week. However, banking sources say the surge in Fairfax shares has now made pricing difficult and TPG is cooling on the idea. TPG has been eyeing Fairfax's fast-growing real estate advertising business, which is led by Antony Catalano, for some time. It has also been shopping for a buyer for the media assets, initially contemplating partnering with a non-equity consortium member on an offer but later decided against that approach. Fairfax announced last month it was spinning off Domain into a separately-listed company, triggering a jump in the company's shares and throwing a spanner in the works for TPG's takeover ambitions.  About $2 billion of Fairfax's total market value of $2.5 billion is tied up in Domain, analysts say. The funding package shows TPG was serious about a Fairfax bid but it with a takeover premium now priced into the stock, along with the upside of the Domain spin-off, pricing will be an issue. magazine.afr.com FXJ Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Advertisement Advertisement Related articles Hunting The Cat; TPG to back Domain boss How TPG bid for Fairfax would work Credit Suisse, G+T working with private equity giant on Fairfax Media Private equity giant TPG buys Fairfax shares Southern Cross confirms WIN deal Latest Stories 'Excessive' minimum wage rise threatens jobs 2 mins ago $1b solar-battery farm for SA by Xmas 5 mins ago Premier shareholders back Lew on Myer stake 12 mins ago More 43 little accessories to stash away Why chefs need a fashion makeover Why fashion label Cos invests in the arts The Ingham family scion behind racehorse Winx From no credit to $350K turnover in 4 years 3 signs that your leadership is failing Why startups don't need corporate advisers How to foster team chemistry Sydney's best and hottest new spots Why women founders need funding Walk through Australia's best homes this week Can age settle the cork v screwcap debate?

Reuters/Neil Hall Overseas companies issued warnings about how Brexit may affect their business. Forty European business lobbies representing companies in 34 countries have called for a post-Brexit settlement that seeks to maintain the integrity of the single market and prevents “unnecessary” barriers to both trade and investment. Meanwhile, a large business group in Japan is currently in the process of preparing a communiqué taking issue with the “no Brexit deal is better than a bad deal,” the mantra within the British government as it pushes for its split with the European Union. It supposedly sent a chill through the boardrooms of Japanese companies that provide jobs for 140,000 people in the UK. Irish Times reported that a person who has seen a draft from Keidanren’s demands and policy proposals said the pivotal message is to “negotiate with deeper consideration for the economy.” Keidanren’s membership includes Toyota, Hitachi and other huge Japanese investors in the UK. Deutsche Bank, on the other hand, reportedly plans to move to a new headquarters in London in 2023. Siemens expressed a more positive note as it reaffirmed its commitment to the UK during a recent event in Berlin. Siemens, which is among the largest engineering companies globally, employs over 15,000 in the UK. JPMorgan Chase & Co, along with other banks that hope to continue serving the community in London, is expected to speed up the shift of jobs and operations into the EU or to New York. Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm, estimated that 70,000 financial-services jobs would be at risk in a worst-case scenario. In other Brexit news, Donald Tusk has warned that there will no winner from the United Kingdom's planned withdrawal from the European Union, and that the next two years would be about “damage control.” The president of the European council notes that most Europeans, including almost half the British voters, do not wish to drift apart, but hope to stay together. Tusk assured that until the UK leaves the EU, the EU law will still apply to and within the country. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, has warned that the UK’s choice to quit the bloc is something it will regret one day. Manfred Weber, the chair of the largest party grouping in the European parliament, said the consequences of Brexit would affect the daily lives of Britain’s citizens and warned that the EU would be “tough” on the UK, the Guardian reported.

Quotes in the article Cenovus Energy Inc CVE ▲ 13.08 +0.11 +0.85% ConocoPhillips COP ▲ 45.95 +0.57 +1.26% Canadian Natural Resources Ltd CNQ ▲ 32.89 +0.90 +2.81% Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDS.B ▲ 56.30 +0.28 +0.50% The agreement includes Conoco’s 50 percent interest in a joint venture with Cenovus in the Canadian oil sands, the Calgary-based company said in a statement Wednesday. Cenovus will also acquire most of Conoco’s Deep Basin conventional assets in Alberta and British Columbia. Combined, they are forecast to produce about 298,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2017. The purchase comes two weeks after Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. announced its biggest deal ever, spending C$12.7 billion to buy Alberta oil fields and processing facilities from Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Marathon Oil Corp. It marks the latest sale of Canadian assets by international oil companies stung by falling prices. Conoco said last month its reserves fell to a 15-year low after removing oil-sands barrels that were no longer economic. “This is an easy fit," said Michael Kay, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. “ConocoPhillips is focused elsewhere, and Cenovus has made it a priority to expand in the oil sands. It’s mostly a domestic industry now." The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. It will be financed with C$14.1 billion in cash and 208 million Cenovus shares, according to the statement. That will make Conoco into Cenovus’s largest shareholder, with about a 27 percent stake. Full Control The deal allows Cenovus “to take full control of our best-in-class oil sands projects and to add a second growth platform across the prolific Deep Basin that provides complementary short-cycle development opportunities," said Brian Ferguson, Cenovus chief executive officer. Along with announcing the sale, Cenovus said it will sell 187.5 million shares at C$16 each, a price 8.3 percent below the closing price Wednesday, to raise about C$3 billion. Cenovus has a C$10.5 billion bridge loan in place with Royal Bank of Canada and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the company said in the statement. Cenovus will also make contingency payments to Conoco in certain circumstances, depending on oil prices. In a separate statement, Houston-based Conoco said it would use the proceeds to reduce debt to $20 billion in 2017, and to double a share repurchase program to $6 billion. The company plans to triple its buybacks this year to $3 billion, with the remaining $3 billion spent in the next two years. Conoco’s shares rose 6.2 percent to $48.80 at 5:18 p.m., after the official close of trading in New York. The transaction will be Cenovus’s biggest since it was separated from Encana Corp. in 2008. In that split, Encana retained most of the previous company’s natural gas assets, while Cenovus held the oil assets. The current deal is the largest in the Canadian oil patch since CNOOC Corp. bought Nexen Energy for US$17 billion in 2012. Transport Issues The industry has long been hampered by a lack of adequate transport options to move its crude to market. A series of proposed pipelines -- and renewed support in the U.S. for the Keystone XL project -- may help to ease a bottleneck that has kept Western Canadian oil prices below global benchmarks. Canadian Natural, Cenovus and MEG Energy Corp. have announced expansion projects in the past five months that will add a total of 110,000 barrels a day of capacity when completed in 2019.

Michael Hiltzik Columnist BUSINESS Michael Hiltzik Column With Brexit, Britain pulls the trigger — on itself British Prime Minister Theresa May ANDY RAIN / EPA British Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street Wednesday to announce the official beginning of Britain's departure from the European Union. British Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street Wednesday to announce the official beginning of Britain's departure from the European Union. (ANDY RAIN / EPA) Michael HiltzikContact Reporter Ever since June 23, when the British public cast a stunning, if narrow, vote to leave the European Union, many of Britain’s wiser and more thoughtful political and business leaders have been living in a state of wishful thinking, cherishing the hope that somehow, the decision to end 45 years of increasing integration with Europe would be abandoned or undone — an exit from Brexit, so to speak. On Wednesday, that hope ended. British Prime Minister Theresa May put her signature to a letter invoking the EU’s Article 50, triggering an irreversible process of divorce and the start of at least two years of negotiations over terms. To the “remain” camp, those who opposed the split, the action is a self-inflicted wound of historic magnitude. To Brexit supporters, it’s the dawn of a new era of British economic supremacy, though they can’t quite define what that will look like. On the specifics, any sensible person would have to give the debate to the Remain side. Few commentators put their case as succinctly as the editorial board of the firmly pro-Europe Observer newspaper, over the weekend. “Like sheep, the British people are being herded off a cliff,” the paper declared, “duped and misled by the most irresponsible, least trustworthy government in living memory.” Car manufacturers are threatening to leave Britain, the Observer reported, as are banks and other institutions that earlier had turned London into the financial capital of Europe. Britain’s National Health Service will lose tens of thousands of doctors and nurses prompted to return to their home countries by the uncertainties of residency in a post-Brexit Britain. Like sheep, the British people are being herded off a cliff, duped and misled by the most irresponsible, least trustworthy government in living memory. — The Observer To Brexit opponents, these were totally unnecessary developments. Brexit happened because its voters were caught up in a nationalistic spasm fostered by a few opportunistic leaders who had little expectation of succeeding, and therefore were unprepared for victory. The EU had become a generic, sloganized shorthand for bureaucracy, much like your local DMV in the U.S. Discontented voters gave little attention to the benefits of EU membership, and the country’s political establishment devoted little effort to emphasizing how much was at stake. As a result, my colleague Shashank Bengali reported after the vote, communities that survived on EU resources voted to leave. They included Ebbw Vale, Wales, whose voters chose “leave” while served by a highway and rail line financed with European Union funds, as were job training programs, improvements to the town center and a new college. Meanwhile, promises made by the leave party have already been shown to have been lies. Within days of the vote, they were disavowing such promises that 350 million pounds ($435 million) would be newly available per week for the health service as soon as the EU fetters were removed. The 'Brexit' crisis from the ground up: Will Britain really leave the EU — and should it? Michael Hiltzik Nearly two weeks after a majority of Britons voted to split from the European Union, some consequences of  “Brexit” are becoming  clear. Clear as mud. All that has come into focus since the June 23 referendum are the issues that must be resolved, now that the people ostensibly have spoken. These... Nearly two weeks after a majority of Britons voted to split from the European Union, some consequences of  “Brexit” are becoming  clear. Clear as mud. All that has come into focus since the June 23 referendum are the issues that must be resolved, now that the people ostensibly have spoken. These... (Michael Hiltzik) Britain is just beginning to sense the consequences of trying to unravel an economic fabric that took more than four decades to knit. The British pound lost some 11.5% of its value against the U.S. dollar and the euro in the immediate aftermath of the vote, and never regained its footing. That has meant higher prices for British consumers for any foreign-sourced products, including food, gasoline, auto parts or clothing. The Daily Mirror documented inflationary prices in February for baked beans (up 9%), beer (up 4%) and bread (up as much as 5%). London seems on the verge of ceding at least part of its financial supremacy to Paris; Frankfurt, Germany; or Dublin, Ireland; or a combination of all three. That’s because the “passport” that allowed firms located in London to trade in Europe without restrictions will end with Brexit, forcing firms to move at least part of their staffs to the mainland. Estimates of the job losses in Britain range from 75,000 to 232,000. Financial firms aren’t happy about the prospect themselves. “The clustering of financial services in London is hugely efficient for all of Europe,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg this month. “Now you’re going to have a de-clustering, which creates huge duplicative cost which is expensive to clients.” Nevertheless, he said, “we have no choice.” Even more serious are the political ramifications. These include a fracturing of British union itself. Supporters of Scottish independence are preparing for a second referendum on the issue in the next year or so, anticipating a reversal of the result of a 2014 referendum in which Scottish voters elected to remain in Britain. That’s because Scotland voted decisively in the June referendum to remain in the EU. Its voters feel their interests have been trampled in Prime Minister May’s headlong sprint to trigger Article 50.   Look out below: The British pound lost more than 11% against the dollar immediately after last summer's Brexit vote, and never recovered. Look out below: The British pound lost more than 11% against the dollar immediately after last summer's Brexit vote, and never recovered. Another reason for unease is that no one has a clear idea how the divorce negotiations will unfold. Some sticking points are obvious, such as the EU’s demand that Britain fork over as much as 60 billion euros ($65 billion) to cover its prior budget commitments to the union before serious talks can start. Other principles dear to the EU idea but opposed by the British, such as the free movement of workers throughout the union, will be major obstacles to any new pact. In return for granting Britain some residual economic rights on the mainland, EU hard-liners are insisting that those principles continue to be honored. Almost everyone agrees that this will be a negotiation like none other in European — perhaps world — history. “This is not a classical (trade) negotiation that starts from a situation where barriers exist and the objective is to bring them down,” observed Mogens Peter Carl, a former trade official for the European Commission, in a proposed blueprint for the talks. “With Brexit the situation is the reverse: we start with a situation of totally free trade and movement of people and capital, with the purpose of … doing what? Restricting one or the other, or both — and if so, to what extent?” Critics of May’s government fault her for doing little to prepare for the talks, or for a Britain cut loose from the EU. During the years of union, Britain ceded regulation and management of large swaths of its economy to EU bureaucrats, allowing home-grown expertise to wither away. One employers group estimated that Britain would have to replace as many as 34 EU regulatory agencies with domestic versions, including those devoted to agriculture, transportation and energy, according to the Financial Times. “We simply don’t have the expertise,” one official said. Brexit supporters defend the decision by observing that the gloomiest forecasts of a post-vote economic slump haven’t come true. Gross domestic product increased at about the same rate in the last quarter of 2016 as it had a year earlier, for example. But many economic forecasters predicted that the real damage was being staved off by residual doubts that Brexit would actually happen, and would emerge only after the divorce was triggered — as has now happened. Some also observe, fairly, that Britain is not entirely without leverage in the coming talks. The EU still needs trade with Britain in some form, so it might not take the harshest position. Nor is the EU as unified as it seems on the surface; different member countries have different interests to protect in negotiations. “Brexit does not spell disaster,” Carl said. “Far from it. It is the responsibility of governments to make these negotiations succeed, and quickly.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss President Trump ordered an abrupt halt to America's crusade against climate change.

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Sign In/Up Levin Report Even ExxonMobil is Begging Trump to Show the Environment Mercy Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Levin Report Even ExxonMobil is Begging Trump to Show the Environment Mercy The oil and gas giant has urged the White House not to abandon the Paris climate accord. by Bess LevinMarch 29, 2017 5:35 pm Email Facebook Twitter Left: The C.E.O. of ExxonMobil, right: a 70 year-old man-child. Left, by F. Carter Smith/Bloomberg; Right, by Shawn Thew-Pool, both from Getty Images. ExxonMobil is a multinational oil and gas company headquartered in Texas. In 2014, it was the second-most profitable company in the Fortune 500. It is considered one of the “supermajors,” i.e., the seven biggest publicly-owned oil and gas companies in the the world. It knew about the harmful effects of fossil fuels as early as 1977 but kept them to itself and, in the 1980s, began a campaign of climate-change denial. Currently, the company is being investigated over whether or not it intentionally “misled the public about the role fossil fuels play in climate change.” In short, it’s not exactly the kind of organization you’d think would take a stand against Donald Trump's plan to destroy the environment to bring back a couple of coal jobs. But you would be wrong, which is perhaps an indication of just how much the Trump administration has turned things upside down. ExxonMobil, the largest American oil group, has written to the Trump administration urging it to keep the U.S. in the Paris climate accord agreed to at the end of 2015. In a letter to President Donald Trump’s special assistant for international energy and the environment, Exxon argues that the Paris accord is “an effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change.” Exxon argues in its letter that there are several reasons for the U.S. to stay in the Paris accord, including the opportunity to support greater use of natural gas, which creates lower carbon-dioxide emissions than coal when burned for power generation. Peter Trelenberg, Exxon’s manager for environmental policy and planning, writes in the letter: “It is prudent that the United States remain a party to the Paris agreement to ensure a level playing field, so that global energy markets remain as free and competitive as possible.” Darren Woods, the new chief executive who took over at the start of the year [when former C.E.O. Rex Tillerson became secretary of state], said in his first blog post that “climate risks warrant action” from businesses, governments, and consumers, and described the pledges made at Paris as “an effective framework for all countries to address rising emissions.” Although Trump’s Tuesday executive order directing the Environmental Protection Agency to dismantle Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan—or as Trump calls it, a “war on coal”—did not touch on the Paris agreement, experts note that “by rolling back the policies needed to meet American commitments, the United States essentially announced that it would not comply, whether the nation remains a signatory or not.” Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he would “cancel” the agreement, while his new E.P.A chief, Scott Pruitt, said over the weekend that it was “a bad deal.” Within the White House, Ivanka Trump is said to be in favor of the U.S. not pulling out of the accord—though that may have just been an excuse to meet with environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio—while dark lord Stephen Bannon has, to nobody’s surprise, reportedly “press[ed] the president to officially pull the United States from the landmark accord.” In Bannon’s mind, Trump made a campaign promise to his supporters to bring back planet-destroying jobs and he needs to stick to it, whether or not sticking to it means there won’t be a planet in several hundred years, or if there is, its inhabitants have extra fingers growing where the sun don’t shine. Of course, Exxon is not pushing to stick with the Paris agreement and promoting a carbon tax out of the goodness of its socialist bleeding heart. Darren Woods, the oil giant’s new C.E.O., is hardly preparing to chain himself to a coal mine until Trump agrees to back down. Supporting a decrease in carbon emissions is ultimately good business for Exxon, which had a not-inconsequential public relations disaster on its hands. A carbon tax would create a more stabile regulatory environment, polls show most people support the idea, and Exxon would be more than willing to pay a little more—with the expectation that other corporate tax rates would come down in exchange, of course—to buy some good P.R. Most importantly, Obama’s climate rules were actually pretty beneficial to Exxon in the long run. The Texas-based multinational is investing heavily in natural gas, a cleaner, cheaper alternative to coal that Obama touted as a bridge to building more renewable energy capacity. Since the domestic shale gas boom was already driving the nails into coal’s coffin, Exxon might as well extract some good press at Trump’s expense. The president might not give a baker’s damn about the planet he’s leaving behind to his grandchildren, but as a so-called businessman, surely Trump can understand where Woods is coming from. Then again, as fellow New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg has pointed out, before he was C.E.O.-in-Chief, Trump was actually a terrible businessman.

As you may recall, last summer, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. It was scary and upsetting, for those who don’t like the idea of the the U.K. turning into an isolationist backwater hell-hole with a jingoistic streak, but the vote was just a vote. Nothing actually happened, until today, when Prime Minister Theresa May gave the E.U. formal notice that the U.K. was packing up its things and getting the hell out of there. Britain will officially be a former member of the E.U. by March 30, 2019, and if worried Remainers wanted to hear some reassuring words from their Prime Minister that everything will be O.K., they will likely be disappointed. “This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back,” May said in London. E.U. president Donald Tusk, in no mood to put on a happy face, responded that “there is no reason to pretend that this is a happy day, neither in Brussels nor in London,” while European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker commented that Brits made “a choice they will regret one day.” In the meantime, J.P. Morgan Chase and other banks with large presences in London have been looking for new homes for their U.K.-based employees, with Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, and Dublin reportedly in the running. Enjoy the tea and crumpets while you still can! Hedge-fund manager says he’s sorry Earlier this month, hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman shocked the investing world when he sold his entire stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals, after incurring a loss thought to be in excess of $4 billion, not including the potential for $2 billion in damages in a Valeant lawsuit in which he and his firm are named as defendants. It was shocking, because when Ackman gets invested in a company, he doesn’t just get invested financially—he does so emotionally, often spending many years and tears on his position. (His disastrous short position in Herbalife, for example, is still going strong, and by strong we mean he’s yet to make a profit since he declared the company a pyramid scheme in December 2012.) Today, prepared to be shocked yet again, because Ackman, known as “one of Wall Street’s brashest and most self-assured hedge-fund managers,” has taken the unusual step of apologizing for the losses. Per Fortune: “Clearly, our investment in Valeant was a huge mistake,“ Ackman wrote in his annual letter to Pershing Square shareholders, published Tuesday night. "In retrospect, we misjudged the prior management team and this contributed to our loss. We deeply regret this mistake, which has cost all of us a tremendous amount, and which has damaged the record of success of our firm." Ackman took a larger share of blame for the Valeant misstep than he seemed to do in the past. Previously, Ackman has largely danced around the issue, or said that Pershing's mistake with Valeant was not being more actively involved in the company's operations. “My approach to mistakes is that I personally assume 100 percent of the responsibility on behalf of the firm while sharing the credit for our successes,” Ackman wrote in the letter, noting that he and other Pershing Square employees, as the fund's largest investors, had personally borne the brunt of the Valeant losses. “It is much more painful to lose our shareholders’ money, and for this I deeply and profoundly apologize,” he continued. Money manager replaces humans with bots Not a lot of bots, just a few to start but enough to say that BlackRock founder and C.E.O. Larry Fink welcomes our new overlords. Per Bloomberg: The world’s largest money manager is firing more than 30 people in its active-equities group, including five of its 53 fundamental portfolio managers, according to a person familiar with the matter. The revamp moves $6 billion of the $201 billion run by traditional stock pickers into cheaper funds where quants play a role, the person said. Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink’s shift to quantitative strategies follows similar moves by hedge funds seeking a high-tech fix to their investment woes. Fink, who has rejiggered his stock picking unit several times in recent years, now sees computer models and data science as the future of active-equity management. His move is driven by clients who are flocking to cheaper index-tracking exchange-traded funds, which benefits BlackRock’s ETF business while hurting its active managers. Citizens Bankers faked a few customer meetings What do you do when your company makes a big show of a new program that “invites customers into branches for what the bank calls a financial checkup,” but no one actually wants to come in for a physical? Eleven current and former Citizens branch employees in five states claim that information about some meetings was fabricated by those employees or others as they struggled to meet goals set by the bank. “For a week or so, I had my bankers [try to make] real appointments. No one was picking up the phone,” said a former branch manager in Massachusetts, recalling when the “Citizens Checkup” program was introduced in February 2016. “So we put random people’s names down and said, ‘We have an appointment.’ ” After a fake appointment was supposed to have occurred, bankers sometimes marked that the customer didn’t show up or attended but didn’t sign up for any new products, the former employees said. One former Citizens branch manager in New York state recalled putting stars or exclamation points on falsified forms to make them look like authentic meeting notes. According to The Wall Street Journal, employees, who were typically instructed to make 25 cold calls each day, were issued scripts that, if a customer said he or she wasn’t interested, told them to respond, “Just like you would meet with a doctor or dentist every six months or year it is important to review your financial health as well.” It’s truly a wonder bankers were forced to falsify the number of people who came in for a financial cleaning. According to a spokesman for the bank, it has “no data to suggest that any aspect of the Citizens Checkup program was fabricated or falsified” and has “strict controls and standards to ensure that inappropriate behavior is detected and addressed.” Elsewhere!

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Lebenthal made the allegation in her response to a lawsuit Cayne filed last month seeking more than $438,000 he says is owed under the 2008 loan, made just weeks before Bear Stearns’s collapse. Cayne alleges that Lebenthal, a longtime friend, approached him early that year and asked to borrow money because she was struggling financially. He says he offered to loan her $1 million, to be paid back with interest, “without hesitation and out of personal affection." James "Jimmy" Cayne Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg In her filing Wednesday, Lebenthal denied most of the allegations while asking a New York state judge to throw out the complaint. The 53-year-old also claimed that Cayne failed to comply with the terms of the loan. "The complaint must be dismissed because plaintiff has intentionally manipulated defendant in various ways in order to cause a circumstance that plaintiff could subsequently allege to be adverse to his interest," Lebenthal said in her filing, without elaborating. Learn more about the Lebenthal’s attempts to revive their business. Cayne’s attorney, Ronald Greenberg, didn’t immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment on the filing. Lebenthal’s attorney, Joshua Reitzas, declined to elaborate on the filing. Cayne, 83, led Bear Stearns for 15 years until January 2008, when he stepped down after the New York-based firm posted the first loss in its 85-year history. Once the biggest underwriter of mortgage-backed bonds, the company was forced to seek funding from the Federal Reserve before it was taken over by JPMorgan Chase & Co. According to the suit, Lebenthal asked Cayne in late 2013 or 2014 if he would consider converting the loan balance into a pre-initial public offering investment in Lebenthal Holdings LLC. He declined the offer. In late 2014, Lebenthal began regularly delaying quarterly payments, according to the suit. Cayne says he agreed to temporarily suspend her obligations in early 2016 after she contacted him and said she was "experiencing hardship" and unable to make payments. Then, in late 2016, a lawyer for Lebenthal Holdings contacted Cayne’s attorney and said the company was seeking to sell itself contingent on reducing its outside liabilities and offered to resolve the loan for slightly more than $18,000. After Cayne’s attorney demanded full repayment, Lebenthal’s lawyer indicated she didn’t intend to pay the remaining balance, according to the lawsuit. The case is Cayne v. Lebenthal, 650776/2017, New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

New School of Transformation March 29, 2017 by Judith Magyar March 29, 2017 by Judith Magyar 8 If you want to be a doctor, you go to medical school. But where do you go if you want to get the skills and knowledge needed to drive change in a digital world? The best place is Hyper Island – the “Harvard of digital” and, according to CNN, one of the most interesting learning spaces in the world if you want to keep up with innovation. Communicating the Whole Story Customers that attended the recent SAP Select in São, Paulo, Brazil got the very best. “We chose Hyper Island because, until now, the SAP Select events were very IT driven,” says Ricardo Kazuo, Chief Marketing Officer, SAP Brazil.  “Now, after listening to customers, the team in Brazil decided to make the event more business driven. We want to strengthen SAP’s reputation with leaders in the various lines of business at key enterprises. This effort will help prepare the ground at the customer, get the LoB heads to ‘open their minds’ and be more receptive toward SAP’s end-to-end solutions.  It makes it much easier to have discussions about holistic transformation across the entire business.” SAP is helping customers move from a legacy mindset to a digital mindset At the event, 250 C-level executives from 120 key accounts mingled with SAP CEO Bill McDermott and other digital experts to learn about new ways of thinking in the digital era. The main mission is to help customers move from a legacy mindset to a digital mindset. To achieve this, SAP is starting to communicate with the companies in a holistic way instead of approaching the different lines of business in the enterprise individually. This will help all players to view themselves as travelers on a long-term journey that requires a proactive, collaborative, and open-minded approach. Learning from the Pros “Technology is ready now to support consumer needs,” says Cristina Palmaka, president of SAP Brazil. “The world is divided into companies that adapt and transform, and others that don’t. Our mission is to unleash the potential in our customers!” Early adopters were on hand to share their stories of digital change. Cirque du Soleil CEO Daniel Lamarre explained how SAP helps simplify information about 27 bank accounts in 26 countries, 16,000 suppliers, 4,000 employees and 12 million tickets sold each year. SAP is enabling digital transformation in all functions – procurement, HR, finance, marketing, logistics, sales, and distribution – to move its business forward. Jonathan Ridgwell, Global Supplier Services Operations Director at JP Morgan Chase, described how the company uses the SAP Ariba Supplier Network to create a simple, seamless procurement process. Now they are able to find more goods at better prices and still stay within contractual terms, thereby creating better supplier relationships. Guilherme Machado Rabello, Marketing Intelligence Head at INCOR, Brazil’s top cardiac institution and one of the world’s top five for heart transplants, revealed how doctors and hospital administrators teamed up with SAP Labs Latin America: “We needed a platform that would integrate and display data on one big dashboard where all medical staff have one view of all patient data. With the right signals in our hands we can get early indicators of a heart attack 6 hours before it happens. This is a lifesaving application!” Ricardo Kazuo is convinced that true transformation is something that goes beyond products and services: “It starts with empathy and a creative mindset and requires a new way of communicating with customers and employees. In this digital era, innovation comes from everywhere. It’s a multi-directional, fluid process for exchanging ideas between HQ and local market units. This new paradigm fosters business agility. Let’s learn and empower the team.” Tags: Digital Economy, Digital Era, Digital Revolution, digital transformation, empathy, Hyper Island, innovation, Latin America, SAP Brazil, SAP HANA Related Video: SAP & Hyper Island Related Sign up for the weekly SAP News Center newsletter Add a comment Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up In the end, the letter that triggered Brexit was neither long nor short, neither fair nor foul. It restated several things we already knew about what Prime Minister Theresa May was seeking and planning — the U.K. will leave the single market, for example — but brought in new intricacies, such as an explicit desire to include financial services in any future trade deal, and some not-so-veiled threats over the issue of continued security cooperation.  How will it all pan out? We’ll follow every step of the way. In any case, we should have an answer by March 29, 2019. A letter from London: The moment nine months in the making came at around 12:20 p.m. in London when Tim Barrow, the U.K. envoy to the EU, handed EU President Donald Tusk a letter invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Two years of talks over a divorce deal and potentially a new trade pact will now follow. After nine months the UK has delivered. #Brexit— Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) March 29, 2017 What did the letter say? May struck a conciliatory tone, calling for the upcoming negotiations to be conducted “constructively and respectively” and saying she wanted the bloc to “succeed and prosper.” Her warm words were matched by those in the EU, with Tusk expressing hope that the U.K. would be a “close partner.” This will be a defining moment for our country, as we begin to forge a new relationship with Europe & a new role for ourselves in the world. pic.twitter.com/zM69aZlhpa— Theresa May (@theresa_may) March 14, 2017 What does she want? The U.K. is seeking the political version of a friendly divorce. May wants to also nail down a sweeping free trade deal that encompasses finance, a key part of the U.K. economy. An immediate clash: While May again pitched for talks on the divorce and trade deal to take place in tandem, Tusk drew a line by insisting the “orderly withdrawal” must be the initial focus. The European Parliament took an even harder line in arguing that “the U.K. must honor all its legal, financial and budgetary obligations.” EU's Tusk Says 'We Already Miss' U.K. Money talks: Although May said the U.K. would cover some of its financial commitments, May hinted Britain would also make claims on its share of EU assets. “We will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the U.K.’s rights and obligations as a departing member state,” she said. A hint of menace: May said a collapse in talks and the imposition of tariffs on U.K. exports to Europe would carry security implications for the bloc as the joint fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened. She reminded her counterparts that regional “security is more fragile today than at an time since the end of the Cold War.” That did not go down well on the continent. “Security is far too important to start to bargain it against an economic agreement,” said Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s representative on Brexit matters. The business backdrop: The U.K. government is almost alone in thinking it can nail down a trade deal within two years, but May opened the door for a longer period by saying she wants “to avoid any cliff edge” for business. The pressure from industry built on Wednesday as carmaker Ford lobbied for tariff-free trade and Ryanair worried about losing access to the continent. JPMorgan Chase said it will “inevitably” have to move some staff from London. Excerpt from Theresa May's letter to Donald Tusk What next? Having had to wait for the U.K., the rest of the EU now controls the clock, and the two years on it are already ticking down. Tusk will release draft guidelines for negotiator Michel Barnier by the end of Friday, but leaders won’t get around to ratifying them until April 29. Proper engagement may not even take place until after France’s elections. People you’ve never heard of are going to be negotiating Brexit. With the letter out of the way, it’s time for the talks to begin. We know that U.K. Brexit point man David Davis is going to lock horns with his EU counterpart Barnier.

The markets got off to a positive start, but pared their gains ahead of today's announcement from the U.K. Traders reacted to the news that Article 50 had been triggered with relative calm in the afternoon. The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union as Britons wished and can look forward with optimism and hope that the best days are ahead, Prime Minister Theresa May said Wednesday, after announcing that her letter invoking Article 50 that triggers the Brexit process was delivered to the European Union. "This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back," May said in her statement in the House of Commons. "Britain is leaving the European Union." She spoke shortly after the UK envoy Tim Barrow delivered the letter to the European Council President Donald Tusk in Brussels around 13.20 CET. With this, the formal process of exiting the EU began, which must conclude in two years. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.30 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chip stocks increased 0.29 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, added 0.41 percent. The DAX of Germany climbed 0.44 percent and the CAC 40 of France rose 0.45 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. gained 0.41 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.75 percent. In Frankfurt, Siemens advanced 0.52 percent. The company plans to keep the majority stake in its healthcare unit Healthineers after an IPO or spin-off, CEO Joe Kaeser told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft in an interview. Volkswagen rose 0.11 percent. The automaker would recall more than 572,000 vehicles in china to address a potential problem caused by panoramic sunroofs, the country's quality regulator said. Drug-maker Stada increased 0.23 percent after confirming its 2017 outlook. Deutsche Bank climbed 1.32 percent after its U.K. subsidiary Deutsch DB Group Services agreed to pay a record $775 million in fines for rigging interest rates in a multi-bank conspiracy. In Paris, Engie gained 2.95 percent after announcing it would return its Pelican Point plant in South Australia to full capacity. In London, Tesco slid 0.50 percent after its boss Dave Lewis defended the supermarket's takeover of Booker Group. Tour operator TUI dropped 1.06 percent after reiterating its full-year guidance. London Stock Exchange jumped 2.71 percent after the European Commission has decided to prohibit the recommended all-share merger between the exchange and Deutsche Börse. Deutsche Börse also gained 1.70 percent in Frankfurt. Norsk Hydro rallied 1.68 percent in Oslo after JPMorgan Chase said it sees scope for earnings upgrades at the company. Germany's import prices increased at the fastest pace in nearly six years in February, figures from Destatis showed Wednesday. Import prices climbed by more-than-expected 7.4 percent year-on-year in February, the highest rise since April 2011, when prices surged 7.6 percent. Economists had forecast an annual growth of 7 percent. Prices had increased 6 percent in January and 3.5 percent in December. At the same time, export prices climbed 2.5 percent in February from the same period of previous year, faster than January's 1.8 percent increase. French consumer sentiment remained unchanged in March, survey results from the statistical office Insee showed Wednesday. The consumer confidence index came in at 100 in March, the same as in February and in line with expectations. UK mortgage approvals declined in February and consumer credit growth slowed from January, the Bank of England reported Wednesday. The number of loans approved for house purchases fell to 68,315 in February from 69,114 in January. Approvals were forecast to remain at 69,100. After reporting a steep drop in U.S. pending home sales in the previous month, the National Association of Realtors released a report on Wednesday showing that pending sales rebounded by much more than expected in the month of February. NAR said its pending home sales index spiked by 5.5 percent to 112.3 in February from 106.4 in January. Economists had expected pending home sales to jump by 2.4 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Market Analysis Experience Pays: The 10 Oldest CEOs at Fortune 500 companies Clunkers and Blockbusters: The 10 Most Expensive Movies in history Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April Next Story European Market news European Shares May See Subdued Start European Shares Mixed As Formal Brexit Process Starts European Commission Prohibits Deutsche Börse-LSEG Merger FTSE 100 Marginally Lower In Choppy Trade CAC 40 Rises On Firm Wall Street Lead DAX Extends Gains As Investors Shrug Off Brexit Risk European Shares Seen Up As British PM Signs Brexit Letter European Markets Climb As Trump Concerns Ease European Shares Mostly Higher Ahead Of Brexit Triggering FTSE 100 Fluctuates Ahead Of Brexit Triggering CAC 40 Little Changed In Early Trade DAX Rises As Trump Jitters Fade European Shares Seen Up In Cautious Trade European Markets Drop On Concerns Over Trump Agenda European Shares Broadly Lower After US Healthcare Bill Setback <<Previous        24 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Major Averages Close Mixed Following Lackluster Session - U.S. Commentary Nunes Claims Democrats Are Not Serious About Russia Investigation Poll Shows Trump Less Trusted Than Major Media Outlets Mark Cuban: Healthcare Is A Right UK PM May Pulls Brexit Trigger African Court Says Coca-Cola Is 'Poisonous' Trump's Childhood Home Sold At Auction For $2.14 Mln U.S. Pending Home Sales Rebound Strongly In February US Congress Passes Resolution To Repeal FCC's Online Privacy Rules Burned By Madoff, Hedge Fund Bigwig Plunges To Death In NYC IPO Watch: BuzzFeed Reportedly Has Big Plans British PM May Says Triggering Article 50 'Historic Moment' Street Set For Mixed Opening Street Seems To Be More Optimistic Stocks Close Mostly Higher On Upbeat Consumer Confidence Data - U.S. Commentary Asian Shares Retreat On Trump's Healthcare Defeat Asian Shares Rise As Risk Appetite Improves Rally May Stall For Singapore Stock Market Asian Markets Mostly Higher Major Averages Close Mixed Following Lackluster Session - U.S. Commentary European Shares Mostly Higher Ahead Of Brexit Triggering Mild Pressure Tipped For China Stock Market Asian Shares Follow Wall Street Higher European Markets Climb As Trump Concerns Ease Singapore Market Draws Flat Lead For Tuesday Tech Shares May Support South Korea Stocks Stocks Close Flat Following Choppy Trading Day - U.S. Commentary The Swiss Stock Market Kicked Off The New Trading Week With A Loss Canadian Stocks Has Recovered From Early Losses - Canadian Commentary Stocks Recover From Initial Sell-Off But Remain Mostly Lower - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Come Under Pressure Amid Weakness Overseas - U.S. Commentary Early Signals Point To Rough Session -- Canadian Commentary CAC 40 Inches Lower As Trump Healthcare Setback Pushes Up Euro DAX Drifts Lower, Led By Banks And Automakers European Shares Seen Lower On US Policy Woes Sensex Drops 160 Points On Weak Global Cues; Nifty At 9055 Copyright © 2017 RTTNews.

ASSOCIATED PRESS Ivanka Trump, daughter of President Trump, and her husband Jared Kushner, senior adviser to the president, attend a news conference with the president and German Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier this month. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print WASHINGTON — Jared Kushner has been a power player able to avoid much of the harsh scrutiny that comes with working in the White House. But this week he’s found that even the president’s son-in-law takes his turn in the spotlight. In a matter of days, Kushner, a senior Trump adviser, drew headlines for leaving Washington for a ski vacation while a signature campaign promise fell apart. The White House then confirmed he had volunteered to be interviewed before the Senate intelligence committee about meetings with Russian officials. At the same time, the White House announced he’ll helm a new task force that some in the West Wing have suggested carries little real influence. Kushner became the fourth Trump associate to get entangled in the Russia probe. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said Tuesday that Kushner would likely be under oath and would submit to a “private interview” about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials. The news came as the White House announced Kushner would lead a new White House Office of American Innovation, a task force billed as a powerful assignment for Kushner. But the task force’s true power in the White House remained unclear, according to a half-dozen West Wing officials and Kushner associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official White House line is that the group would have sweeping authority to modernize government, acting as strategic consultants who can draw from experiences in the private sector — and sometimes receive input from the president himself — to fulfill campaign promises like battling opioid addiction and transforming health care for veterans. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that it would “apply the president’s ahead-of-schedule-and-under-budget mentality” to the government. But others inside and outside the White House cast doubt on the task force’s significance and reach, suggesting it was a lower priority for the administration and pointing out that similar measures have been tried by previous presidents with middling success. The assignment revived lingering questions about whether Kushner had opted to focus his time on a project that would put him at some distance from some Trump’s more conservative and controversial policy overhauls.   The announcement came just days after Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were photographed on the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, as the GOP health care deal began to unravel amid protests from conservative Republicans that it did not go far enough in replacing President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Kushner rushed back to Washington on Friday but it was too late to save the bill, which was scuttled hours later by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Two people close to Kushner vehemently denied the president was upset at his son-in-law for being absent, saying Trump had given the trip his blessing. And a senior White House official insisted the timing of the task force announcement was planned weeks in advance. Kushner, who has been at his father-in-law’s right hand since the campaign, has long been viewed as a first-among-equals among the disparate power centers competing for the president’s ear. Kushner, who routinely avoids interviews, draws power from his ability to access Trump at all hours, including the White House residence often off-limits to staffers. His portfolio is robust: He has been deeply involved with presidential staffing and has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. Though Kushner and Ivanka Trump have been spotted with some frequency on the Washington social circuit, the president’s son-in-law is routinely in the office early and leaves late, other than on Fridays when he observes the Sabbath. While those close to Trump flatly state that Kushner, by virtue of marriage, is untouchable, this is a rare moment when he has been the center of the sort of political storm that has routinely swept up the likes of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. It points to a White House whose power matrix is constantly in flux. Kushner has been closely allied with senior counselor Dina Powell and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and a registered Democrat. That group has, at times, been at odds with conservatives led by Bannon, who to this point has been the driving force behind the White House’s policy shop. When Kushner officially joined the administration in January as a senior adviser, it was suggested that the real estate heir would draw upon the private sector to streamline and modernize government. His task force has been meeting since shortly after the inauguration and started talking to CEOs from various sectors about ways to make changes to entrenched federal programs. “Jared is a visionary with an endless appetite for strategic, inventive solutions that will improve quality of life for all Americans,” said Hope Hicks, Trump’s longtime spokeswoman. A list supplied by the White House of some of those who have met with Kushner reads like a who’s who of the American business world, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tim Cook of Apple and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. Kushner usually does more listening than talking in the meetings, largely avoiding ideological arguments while asking questions about efficiency and best practices, according to a person who has attended a gathering but is not authorized to discuss private conversations. But the Trump team is hardly the first seeking to improve how the government operates. The Reagan administration tasked the Grace Commission in 1982 with uncovering wasteful spending and practices, while the Clinton administration sought its own reinvention of government in 1993 with what was initially called the National Performance Review. Previous commissions have not produced overwhelming results in changing the stubborn bureaucracy, casting some doubt on what Kushner’s team can accomplish. Philip Joyce, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said the domestic spending cuts in Trump’s budget blueprint suggest that this new committee would most likely focus more on shrinking the government than improving its performance. Even then, any change would be unlikely to deliver significant budget savings compared to reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. “It’s not the main thing we ought to be focusing on,” Joyce said. “It’s at the margins of the big issues facing the country, certainly in terms of the budget.” Related Items United States government , Goldman Sachs Group Inc , russia , Eastern Europe , Europe , District of Columbia , united states , north america , bill gates , Jamie Dimon , Gary Cohn , Ivanka Trump , Jared Kushner , Donald Trump , Kellyanne Conway , Reince Priebus , Sean Spicer , Richard Burr , Barack Obama , paul ryan , Stephen Bannon Click to comment Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

But that’s only a small part of what builds a connection between a news organization and an audience. By Joshua Benton @jbenton March 29, 2017, 10:56 a.m. March 29, 2017, 10:56 a.m. Editor’s note: Our sister publication Nieman Reports is out with their new issue — go check it out. I write a column for each issue of the print edition; here’s my latest. Something sometimes forgotten in the endless handwringing over the decline in trust in the media is that we’re hardly alone. Over the past decade, Americans’ trust in many of the country’s most prominent institutions has been shrinking. Trust in organized religion? Down. Trust in public schools? Down. Trust in the presidency? Down even before the current occupant. Trust in Congress? They barely make numbers low enough to show how far down. In 2001, a few months before 9/11, Gallup surveyed how people felt about 14 different major American institutions. On average, each was trusted by 43 percent of Americans. By 2016, that had slid to 32 percent. It’s not hard to connect that growing distrust to Donald Trump’s electoral success, or to some people’s seemingly increased capacity to believe factually untrue things. If an institution — the media, political leaders, a government agency — tries to dissuade you of an afactual belief, it’s unlikely to be effective if you don’t consider that institution’s standing to make a truth claim at least a little higher than some comment-section rando’s. Lately I’ve been thinking about the correlations between the media’s audience problems and those of another not-so-beloved national institution: banks. As of last year, just 27 percent of Americans said they had confidence in the nation’s banks, down by half from 53 percent in 2004. And just as some share of Americans have checked out of the traditional journalism ecosystem — happy to dine on partisan clickbait, Facebook fake news, or the airy meringue of 2017-vintage Internet #content — many have dropped out of the banking system. The term of art in that industry is “the unbanked” — usually defined as people who don’t have a traditional checking or savings account. Instead, they rely on some assemblage of informal service providers — check-cashing centers, payday lenders, neighborhood loan sharks, prepaid debit cards, pawnshops — to do some of the work that most Americans trust a big bank or a local credit union to do. (The “underbanked” have a formal bank account, but also use some of these informal services.) Estimates vary, but an FDIC report from 2015 found that 9 million American households were unbanked and another 24.5 million were underbanked. They’re more likely to be low-income and low-education. Just as many journalists remain puzzled by the media diets of their aunts and uncles back home, some in the banking industry wonder why anyone would prefer to use what they see as obviously inferior services. If you don’t have a bank account, traditional American goals like saving up for a house or building a credit history become almost impossible. Luckily, there’s been some good research on why the unbanked do what they do. Here are a few of the reasons that have surfaced: — Many think they don’t need a regular bank and that banks don’t want them anyway. The most common reason cited in one study for not having a bank account was that they felt they didn’t have enough money to bother. If someone doesn’t see any potential reward to engaging with the industry, it’s hard to convince them otherwise. Particularly if they believe that the other side of the relationship isn’t interested either. An FDIC study found that 55.8 percent of the unbanked surveyed said the Wells Fargos and JPMorgan Chases of the world are “not at all interested” in serving people like them. — Many can’t afford regular banks. They’ve been burned by banks’ increasing hunger for fees and penalties, much of which focuses on people who can least afford it. A Pew study found that 18 percent of consumers had paid an overdraft fee in the previous year, and about a third of all those who’ve overdrafted closed their account as a result. In 2009, 76 percent of banks offered a free checking account; by 2016, that number had dropped to 38 percent. The average ATM fee increased 131 percent between 1998 and 2016; over the same span, the average overdraft fee moved from $21.57 to $33.04. Big banks have chosen to extract more money from those at the low end of their customer base, and many walk away rather than face a barrage of fees. — The unbanked have customer service needs that aren’t well met by traditional banks. Some of this is practical: For poor Americans, check-cashing centers are in their neighborhood; the big retail banks are often farther away. Thirty years ago, banks were typically locally owned and based; today, five giant banking corporations control nearly half of the industry. That increased distance makes it both easier and more accurate to think the banks’ interests diverge from your own. But part of it is also that people want more from a financial relationship than a statement whose numbers add up correctly each month. Lisa Servon, a professor of urban policy at the New School, spent time actually working at check-cashing centers in New York and California to better understand why their customers were loyal to them. While cost was an overriding factor, she also found that personal relationships and a feeling of connection with the centers’ staff was critical for many. Tellers remembered customers’ names and built up relationships that weren’t institutional; as one regular put it, “We can be family. We know all of them.” RELATED ARTICLE The game of concentration: The Internet is pushing the American news business to New York and the coasts March 25, 2016 RELATED ARTICLE Avoiding articles from “the creep”: People trust news based on who shared it, not on who published it March 20, 2017Does any of that sound familiar to those of us in the media? The decline of print newspapers has replaced a set of trusted local businesses with distant giants in places like New York and D.C. The power of personal relationships means the quality of the friend sharing the news story on Facebook can seem more important than the quality of the news outlet producing it. The price of reading a print daily newspaper has soared as customer bases have shifted upmarket; most news sites are still free, but an increasing share of the best have put up paywalls. Swapping mass for niche media means there are plenty of top-notch news outlets targeting well-off, highly educated people, or demographically appealing young people — but fewer targeting everybody else. And as people feel increasingly disengaged from traditional institutions, the incentives to invest time in consuming high-quality news shrink. If you can’t really make a difference by becoming more informed, why not just take in “news” that’ll flatter your existing notions and give you the jolt of rage/pity/victimhood/schadenfreude you want? One lesson I learned early on in news is that what journalists value and what their audiences value are often frustratingly misaligned. We see high-quality news outlets and low-quality ones and wonder why anyone would choose the latter over the former — just as a VP at Bank of America might wonder why anyone would use some place called EZChekNow instead of his tastefully appointed branch a couple strip malls over. But the decisions of customers aren’t driven solely by perceptions of “quality”; they’re also derived from more prosaic factors like customer service, cost, feelings of community and personal connection, and a sense that both sides of the transaction have similar interests at heart. In an environment where trust is no longer the default — where reading your local daily in the morning and watching a news broadcast at night have moved from standard to niche behavior — doing great journalistic work isn’t enough.

Also, one group you didn’t mention were all the “unbanked” illegal aliens. samrat The disconnect also comes from the one-way relationship media houses have with readers. People want to be heard, hence the social media boom. This need ought to be recognised, and addressed. ProfDeanMiller Josh, it might be fun for the Lab to go find and interview Chris LaVictoire Mahai, who was a bigwig at the Minneapolis Star Tribune in the early 1990s. She led attempts at redesign/rethink that quantified startling gap between what audience valued vs. what journos thought audience valued. As everywhere else: big disconnect. What would make her an interesting interview is that she’s gone on to other industries. That broad perspective could be interesting. Does ANYONE listen to the audience? Clyde Smith What a weird comparison. Stretching to eliminate the unbanked data that’s based on poverty is a big stretch. But I get it. I’ve written about topics on a daily basis that other people are also covering to death. It’s tough to come up with a new angle. Which is why I don’t miss that game. On the other hand, this kind of stretching is why I’m regularly disappointed by a variety of writers and news outlets especially when it stretches into clickbait territory.   What’s the best way to follow how the news is changing?

Broad building as concert venue Mar 28 - 5:41 PM Michael Kappeler / DPA / Zuma Press / TNS Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, attend a press conference at the White House on March 17. by JONATHAN LEMIRE and JOSH BOAK, The Associated Press Close icon JONATHAN LEMIRE and JOSH BOAK The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - Jared Kushner has been a power player able to avoid much of the harsh scrutiny that comes with working in the White House. But this week he's found that even the president's son-in-law takes his turn in the spotlight. Slideshow Kushner, taking new White House role, faces rare scrutiny Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon In a matter of days, Kushner, a senior Trump adviser, drew headlines for leaving Washington for a ski vacation while a signature campaign promise fell apart. The White House then confirmed he had volunteered to be interviewed before the Senate intelligence committee about meetings with Russian officials. At the same time, the White House announced he'll helm a new task force that some in the West Wing have suggested carries little real influence. Kushner became the fourth Trump associate to get entangled in the Russia probe. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said Tuesday that Kushner would likely be under oath and would submit to a "private interview" about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials. The news came as the White House announced Kushner would lead a new White House Office of American Innovation, a task force billed as a powerful assignment for Kushner. But the task force's true power in the White House remained unclear, according to a half-dozen West Wing officials and Kushner associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official White House line is that the group would have sweeping authority to modernize government, acting as strategic consultants who can draw from experiences in the private sector - and sometimes receive input from the president himself - to fulfill campaign promises like battling opioid addiction and transforming health care for veterans. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that it would "apply the president's ahead-of-schedule-and-under-budget mentality" to the government. But others inside and outside the White House cast doubt on the task force's significance and reach, suggesting it was a lower priority for the administration and pointing out that similar measures have been tried by previous presidents with middling success. The assignment revived lingering questions about whether Kushner had opted to focus his time on a project that would put him at some distance from some Trump's more conservative and controversial policy overhauls. The announcement came just days after Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were photographed on the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, as the GOP health care deal began to unravel amid protests from conservative Republicans that it did not go far enough in replacing President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Kushner rushed back to Washington on Friday but it was too late to save the bill, which was scuttled hours later by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Two people close to Kushner vehemently denied the president was upset at his son-in-law for being absent, saying Trump had given the trip his blessing. And a senior White House official insisted the timing of the task force announcement was planned weeks in advance. Kushner, who has been at his father-in-law's right hand since the campaign, has long been viewed as a first-among-equals among the disparate power centers competing for the president's ear. Kushner, who routinely avoids interviews, draws power from his ability to access Trump at all hours, including the White House residence often off-limits to staffers. His portfolio is robust: He has been deeply involved with presidential staffing and has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. Though Kushner and Ivanka Trump have been spotted with some frequency on the Washington social circuit, the president's son-in-law is routinely in the office early and leaves late, other than on Fridays when he observes the Sabbath. While those close to Trump flatly state that Kushner, by virtue of marriage, is untouchable, this is a rare moment when he has been the center of the sort of political storm that has routinely swept up the likes of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. It points to a White House whose power matrix is constantly in flux. Kushner has been closely allied with senior counselor Dina Powell and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and a registered Democrat. That group has, at times, been at odds with conservatives led by Bannon, who to this point has been the driving force behind the White House's policy shop. When Kushner officially joined the administration in January as a senior adviser, it was suggested that the real estate heir would draw upon the private sector to streamline and modernize government. His task force has been meeting since shortly after the inauguration and started talking to CEOs from various sectors about ways to make changes to entrenched federal programs. "Jared is a visionary with an endless appetite for strategic, inventive solutions that will improve quality of life for all Americans," said Hope Hicks, Trump's longtime spokeswoman. A list supplied by the White House of some of those who have met with Kushner reads like a who's who of the American business world, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tim Cook of Apple and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. Kushner usually does more listening than talking in the meetings, largely avoiding ideological arguments while asking questions about efficiency and best practices, according to a person who has attended a gathering but is not authorized to discuss private conversations. But the Trump team is hardly the first seeking to improve how the government operates. The Reagan administration tasked the Grace Commission in 1982 with uncovering wasteful spending and practices, while the Clinton administration sought its own reinvention of government in 1993 with what was initially called the National Performance Review. Previous commissions have not produced overwhelming results in changing the stubborn bureaucracy, casting some doubt on what Kushner's team can accomplish. Philip Joyce, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said the domestic spending cuts in Trump's budget blueprint suggest that this new committee would most likely focus more on shrinking the government than improving its performance. Even then, any change would be unlikely to deliver significant budget savings compared to reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. "It's not the main thing we ought to be focusing on," Joyce said. "It's at the margins of the big issues facing the country, certainly in terms of the budget." ___ Lemire reported from New York.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print McConnell's gamble By Victoria Guida and Aubree Eliza Weaver 03/29/17 08:00 AM EDT MCCONNELL’S GAMBLE — News has been pretty bleak for President Trump these days, but Mitch McConnell is aiming to deliver him his first big legislative win: confirming his Supreme Court nominee. The Senate majority leader said Neil Gorsuch will be confirmed on April 7. How the confirmation fight plays out could either give Trump some much needed momentum for the rest of his agenda — taxes, the infrastructure, financial-reg reform — or further poison the well in an already fiercely divided Senate. POLITICO’s Elana Schor: “Senate Democrats on Tuesday left Judge Neil Gorsuch with two roads to the Supreme Court: winning over all of the party's remaining swing votes, or relying on the so-called nuclear option. Story Continued Below “The five Democratic senators up for reelection next year in states where President Donald Trump won by single digits have all endorsed a filibuster of Gorsuch, while the five facing voters next year in states Trump won by double digits all remain undecided. Gorsuch would have to carry all five of those fence-sitters in order to overcome a Democratic filibuster — plus his home-state Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Maine Independent Sen. Angus King, and another more surprising senator.” MM continues to wonder if the political climate will ever cool off under Trump. With the Democratic base still paying laser-focused (negative) attention to the president’s actions, it’s possible that achieving anything substantial in a bipartisan way was always a pipe dream, nuclear option or no. Still, POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt reports that Senate “Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and ranking member Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) kept up their bipartisan drumbeat [at their hearing on Tuesday]. The hearing steered clear of advancing specific deregulatory proposals that could have provoked a conflict. The two have called for legislative pitches that would ‘enable consumers, market participants and financial companies to better participate in the economy.’” Read more. ROCK ’EM, FSOC ’EM — All but two Senate Banking Republicans teamed up Tuesday to call on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to fix the process that has led the country’s largest insurers to be placed under the Fed’s supervision. As head of Treasury, Mnuchin chairs the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a Dodd-Frank creation that has the power to name nonbank financial firms as “systemically important,” placing them under stricter regulation. “You have our strong support for using all the tools available as Secretary of Treasury to end ‘Too Big To Fail’ and ensure that hard-working Americans are not responsible for any new bailouts,” says the letter, led by Sen. Tom Cotton and signed by all his GOP committee colleagues except Bob Corker and Dean Heller. One message here: Drop the MetLife case. The government has been fighting in court to defend FSOC's designation of the giant insurer as systemically important after a judge struck it down. But Cotton is now suggesting that the Trump administration walk away. “By dropping the FSOC-MetLife appeal, they can effectively de-designate MetLife with ease, without having to go through a long FSOC process,” Cotton spokeswoman Caroline Rabbitt told POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt. FSOC also saw some heat from the other side of the Capitol building, where House Republicans led by Rep. Ann Wagner held a hearing centered on the argument that the panel lacks transparency and creates an unnecessary regulatory burden. POWELL DEFENDS THE FED — Meanwhile, Fed Gov. Jay Powell on Tuesday defended the the central bank’s structure against criticisms from politicians on both sides of the aisle. Some Republicans lament the Fed’s lack of monetary policy transparency, while some Democrats hate the presence of bankers on regional Fed bank boards. Some free-market observers would like to abolish the central bank altogether. Powell took on all of these concepts in a 14-page speech that includes an image of Lin-Manuel Miranda, the mastermind behind the Broadway hit “Hamilton.” Powell mainly strove to lay out the factors that have led the Fed to be the way it is. “Throughout our history, Americans have questioned the structure and even, at times, the need for a central bank. Current discussions of Fed reforms echo these past debates,” he said. “But it is important to understand that history in both advanced and emerging economies across the world has consistently demonstrated the need for a central bank, and both the existence and the structure of the Federal Reserve are products of that historical experience. … The structure achieves a practical balance that should not be changed lightly, as it continues to serve the country well.” Read the speech here. MM sidebar: This speech is reminiscent of one that Chair Janet Yellen gave just before Trump’s inauguration that argued against tying the Fed to a particular monetary policy rule. Even if Fed reforms don’t go anywhere, the central bank is still clearly taking the congressional chatter seriously and is trying to combat the narrative in ways that aren’t overtly political. CONFUSED CONSUMERS — Consumer confidence surged in March, but it also dropped to its lowest weekly average since the election. Wait, what? The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index increased to 125.6 out of 200 this month (100 is neutral), up from 116.1 in February and the highest confidence level since 2000. That’s a big effing deal, Mr. President, as former VP Biden might say. But according to Gallup’s U.S. Economic Confidence Index, consumer confidence dropped six points to a score of +5 for the week of March 26. “Confidence waned prior to the effort to replace the [health care bill] dying in Congress on Friday,” Gallup explained. “This suggests that the broader GOP infighting earlier in the week, rather than the decision to pull the bill itself, may have been a factor, in addition to the market's poor performance.” MUFG Union Bank’s Chris Rupkey emails: “They always say every economic expansion has its one best day, and maybe the surge in the Conference Board measure today for the month of March reflects this. The latest tea leaf readings on consumer confidence clearly seem to be flagging. The outlook is not dark enough to say ‘Lights out’ yet, but we need to monitor consumer sentiment certainly. The other thing to note is sometimes people reply one way to blue-sky questions on how-do-you-feel confidence surveys and do something completely the opposite when it comes to spending on goods and services.” GOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING — Ben White will be back in your inboxes April 3.

Crapo, CFTC Acting Chairman Giancarlo, Rock Holdings’ Emerson, CFPB Director Cordray, Allstate’s Wilson, Primerica’s Schneider, and Dallas Federal Reserve President Kaplan. ** THE LOWDOWN FROM BROWN — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: In a speech this afternoon, Senate Banking ranking member Sherrod Brown will address one of the panel’s most difficult legislative priorities: housing finance reform. The Ohio Democrat will tell a conference hosted by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition it's "essential that we don’t just hear from the big banks — that we hear the people’s stories.” "Stable mortgage credit like the 30-year fixed rate mortgage — available because of FHA and the GSEs — is essential for Americans dreaming of homeownership, and it’s essential for growth,” Brown will say. "As the committee moves forward, remind members that housing finance reform isn’t about who controls the system, but who has access to it.” DOW’S LOSING STREAK ENDS — WSJ’s Akane Otani and Christopher Whittall: “The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended its losing streak with its best day since the start of the month. “Major indexes wavered shortly after the opening bell, then climbed in a broad rally following the release of upbeat U.S. economic data. All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 ended higher, with shares of energy and financial companies posting the biggest gains. The Dow industrials added 150.52 points, or 0.7 percent, to 20701.50 after eight consecutive sessions of declines. Early Tuesday, the blue-chip index was on track for its longest losing streak since 1978.” Read more. JPMORGAN IS THE PLACE TO BE — JPMorgan Chase ranked No. 1 on financial sector employees’ list of dream employers, according to a survey by eFinancialCareers. The bank passed last year’s top dog, Goldman Sachs (some of whose former high-profile people have moved on to Trump administration jobs.). Google and Morgan Stanley held steady at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, while Citibank nudged out BlackRock for the No. 5 spot, after placing seventh last year. “Google's high ranking again this year shows that tech firms maintain a strong employer brand among financial services professionals, despite operating outside of the sector,” said George McFerran, senior vice president of customer engagement at eFinancialCareers. “Large tech companies should be considered tough competitors for financial services employers seeking to attract top talent.” See the list here. WILL BANKS’ EXIT FROM COMMODITIES LAST? — WSJ’s Sarah McFarlane: “Some of the world’s largest oil traders doubt that banks will return to commodity markets, even if U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration follows through on its promise to reduce the sort of regulation that helped push them out. “Many banks said the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law encouraged them to stop trading physical commodities, given it meant higher capital requirements and limits on trading activity. Mr. Trump has said he intends to roll back these and other financial regulations from the post-financial crisis era. Trading houses expanded into the space that banks vacated and some in the sector aren’t convinced they will return, saying banks used regulation as an excuse to leave markets where they were already struggling to make money.” Read more. FIRST LOOK: VENTURING OUT ON VOLCKER — Ahead of a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing today on the Volcker rule, the National Venture Capital Association asked Congress to examine the effect of the proprietary trading ban on capital formation for startups, “particularly in the Midwest and other areas of the country not typically associated with startup activity.” Read the letter. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — FISCHER: ONE IN HAND, TWO IN THE BUSH FOR 2017 — Bloomberg’s Craig Torres: “Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said the Federal Open Market Committee’s median estimate for two more rate hikes this year ‘seems about right.’ … Fischer said the U.S. central bank is watching fiscal policy negotiations between Congress and the White House without prejudging the outcome. Watching and waiting ‘is the sensible thing to do,’ he said, because proposals will be ‘different’ as they work through the legislative process.” Read more. WHITE HOUSE WANTS CUTS TO PAY FOR BORDER WALL — AP’s Andrew Taylor: “President Donald Trump is proposing immediate budget cuts of $18 billion from programs like medical research, infrastructure and community grants so U.S. taxpayers, not Mexico, can cover the down payment on the border wall. “The White House documents were submitted to Congress amid negotiations over a catchall spending bill that would avert a partial government shutdown at the end of next month. The package would wrap up $1.1 trillion in unfinished spending bills and address the Trump administration's request for an immediate $30 billion in additional Pentagon spending.” Read more. WELLS FARGO FALLS SHORT — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida: “Wells Fargo said [Tuesday] it failed its most recent Community Reinvestment Act evaluation due to enforcement actions that regulators have taken against the lender, a move that could hinder the bank's potential for growth and acquisitions. “The evaluation, which covered the period from 2009 to 2012, cites the sales practice scandal, as well as discriminatory lending practices, violations of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and other deceptive practices, in the downgrade. Wells has never before publicly received a rating below outstanding from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulators involved.” Read more. GM NOT SO SURE ABOUT EINHORN’S STOCK SUGGESTION — Business Insider’s Matthew DeBord: “It is no wonder that General Motors' investors are frustrated. While the US's biggest automaker has been enjoying years of booming and highly profitable sales, its stock performance has been weak. “This frustration has now come to a head, with activist investor David Einhorn demanding GM consider a very unorthodox idea. Einhorn is proposing that GM split its stock into two classes — one that pays a dividend to investors who would like that, and another that would somehow track growth in the business.” Read more. ** A message from US Chamber Center for Capital Markets: One the biggest barriers to growth for American businesses ––and one that has increased significantly over the past decade–– is access to capital.

Traders may be reluctant to make any significant moves amid continued uncertainty about President Donald Trump's policy agenda following the failure of the Republican health care bill. Developments in the U.K. are also in focus after the British government sent a notification letter to European Council President Donald Tusk formally beginning the country's exit from the European Union. After initially showing a lack of direction, stocks moved mostly higher over the course of the trading session on Tuesday. With the upward move on the day, the Dow snapped an eight-session losing streak. The major averages ended the day firmly in positive territory. The Dow climbed 150.52 points or 0.7 percent to 20,701.50, the Nasdaq rose 34.77 points or 0.6 percent to 5,875.14 and the S&P 500 advanced 16.98 points or 0.7 percent to 2,358.57. The strength on Wall Street came following the release of a report from the Conference Board showing an unexpected improvement in consumer confidence in the month of March. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped to 125.6 in March from a revised 116.1 in February. The increase surprised economists, who had expected the index to dip to 113.8 from the 114.8 originally reported for the previous month. With the unexpected increase, the consumer confidence index climb to its highest level since reaching 128.6 in December of 2000. "Consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions improved considerably," said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. "Consumers also expressed much greater optimism regarding the short-term outlook for business, jobs and personal income prospects." She added, "Thus, consumers feel current economic conditions have improved over the recent period, and their renewed optimism suggests the possibility of some upside to the prospects for economic growth in the coming months." Energy stocks showed a strong move to the upside on the day, benefiting from an increase by the price of crude oil. Reflecting the strength in the energy sector, the Philadelphia Oil Service Index jumped by 2.1 percent, the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index surged up by 1.9 percent and the NYSE Arca Oil & Gas Index climbed by 1.3 percent. Transportation, steel, and financial stocks also saw considerable strength on the day, moving higher along with most of the other major sectors. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are rising $0.19 to $48.56 a barrel after climbing $0.64 to $48.37 a barrel on Tuesday. Gold futures, which edged down $0.10 to $1,255.60 an ounce in the previous session, are slipping $2.60 to $1,253 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 110.86 yen compared to the 111.15 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0762 compared to yesterday's $1.0814. Asia Asian stocks moved mostly higher on Wednesday as the yen weakened on downbeat retail sales data and oil extended overnight gains, buoyed by disruptions to Libyan crude production and a more positive OPEC attitude towards extending production cuts. The dollar held gains in the wake of better-than-expected consumer sentiment data and upbeat comments from Federal Reserve officials. Japanese shares closed marginally higher as gains by energy stocks were partly offset by losses in the banking and realty sectors. While the yen continued to slide, retail sales data disappointed investors. Sales rose 0.2 percent in February from the previous month, official data showed, missing forecasts for 0.3 percent growth. The Nikkei 225 Index closed up 14.61 points or 0.08 percent at 19,217.48, while the broader Topix index fell 0.18 percent to 1,542.07. Exporters turned in a mixed performance, with Sony and Panasonic climbing about 3 percent, while Toyota Motor shed 1.5 percent. Toshiba rose 0.9 percent on a Nikkei report that its board has approved Westinghouse's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the U.S. Oil explorer Inpex Corp gained 1.3 percent and JX Holdings advanced 1.9 percent after oil futures rose more than 1 percent overnight on news that Libya has halted the pipeline from its biggest field. Australian shares moved higher across the board, with the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index closing 52.30 points or 0.90 percent higher at 5,873.50. The broader All Ordinaries Index jumped 50.30 points or 0.86 percent to finish at 5,910.70. While miners BHP Billiton, Fortescue and Rio Tinto rose between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent, the big four banks ended up more than 1 percent each. Origin Energy rallied 2.2 percent after it signed two deals to supply gas to French energy giant Engie's Pelican Point power plant in South Australia. Oil Search, Woodside Petroleum and Santos all rose about 1 percent. Fairfax Media advanced 2.8 percent after reports that TPG had acquired a stake of up to 4.9 percent in the media group. Shares of Thorn Group plunged 11.7 percent after Maurice Blackburn Lawyers lodged a class action against the practices of its unit Radio Rentals. Meanwhile, Chinese shares fell slightly amid concerns about liquidity and tighter regulation to curb speculation in the housing market. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 11.63 points or 0.36 percent to 3,241.31. Europe The major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has dipped by 0.2 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.2 percent and the German DAX Index is up by 0.5 percent. In stock-specific action, Norsk Hydro has rallied after JPMorgan Chase said it sees scope for earnings upgrades at the company. Siemens shares have also advanced on news the company plans to keep the majority stake in its healthcare unit Healthineers after an IPO or spin-off. The day's economic reports have proved to be a mixed bag, with a gauge of French consumer sentiment coming in flat in March, while the number of loans approved for house purchases in the U.K. fell in February. U.S. Economic Reports At 10 am ET, the National Association of Realtors is due to release its report on pending home sales in the month of February. Pending sales are expected to jump by 2.4 percent in February after slumping by 2.8 percent in January. A pending home sale is one in which a contract was signed but not yet closed. Normally, it takes four to six weeks to close a contracted sale. The Energy Information Administration is scheduled to release its report on oil inventories in the week ended March 24th at 10:30 am ET. At 11:30 am ET, Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren is due to speak on the economic outlook to the Boston Economic Club. The Treasury Department is scheduled to announce the results of its auction of $28 billion worth of seven-year notes at 1 pm ET. At 1:15 pm ET, San Francisco Fed President John Williams is due to deliver a presentation to the Forecasters Club of New York. Stocks in Focus Shares of Exar (EXAR) are moving sharply higher in pre-market trading after the integrated circuit maker agreed to be acquired by MaxLinear (MXL) for $13.00 per share in cash. Home furnishings retailer Restoration Hardware (RH) is also likely to see early strength after reporting better than expected fourth quarter results and providing upbeat guidance. Sonic (SONC) reported second quarter earnings that came in slightly above estimates, although the restaurant chain's revenues came in below expectations. Meanwhile, shares of Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) may move to the downside after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the company's stock to Sell from Neutral. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Experience Pays: The 10 Oldest CEOs at Fortune 500 companies Clunkers and Blockbusters: The 10 Most Expensive Movies in history Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed African Court Says Coca-Cola Is 'Poisonous' Burned By Madoff, Hedge Fund Bigwig Plunges To Death In NYC IPO Watch: BuzzFeed Reportedly Has Big Plans European Commission Prohibits Deutsche Börse-LSEG Merger Tinder Moving To Desktop Crayola Dropping One Color From 24-Crayon Box Report: Yamaha Will Soon Recall Certain Motorcycles Uber Says Goodbye To Denmark Breitbart Denied Capitol Hill Credentials Samsung To Offer Refurbished Galaxy Note 7, Except In US Clunkers To Classics: The 10 Most Expensive Movies In History GameStop Shutters 150 Stores As Retail Carnage Continues First Drug For 2 Forms Of MS Gets FDA Nod, RTTR Abuzz, VRTX Gains On Trial Data FDA Nod For TSRO, Déjà Vu For ARQL, FOMX Plunges On Trial Data, SELB Abuzz Report: Toshiba's Westinghouse Electric May File Bankruptcy Tuesday Gainers & Losers Of Mar.27: APOP, IPXL, ZIOP, FOMX...

Home Congress FUBAR News Opinion Politics Reader Rant White House Jared Kushner under hard scrutiny March 29, 2017 3:59 am | by JONATHAN LEMIRE and JOSH BOAK Ivanka Trump, the daughter of President Donald Trump, and her husband Jared Kushner, senior adviser to President Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Jared Kushner has been a power player able to avoid much of the harsh scrutiny that comes with working in the White House. But this week he’s found that even the president’s son-in-law takes his turn in the spotlight. In a matter of days, Kushner, a senior Trump adviser, drew headlines for leaving Washington for a ski vacation while a signature campaign promise fell apart. The White House then confirmed he had volunteered to be interviewed before the Senate intelligence committee about meetings with Russian officials. At the same time, the White House announced he’ll helm a new task force that some in the West Wing have suggested carries little real influence. Kushner became the fourth Trump associate to get entangled in the Russia probe. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said Tuesday that Kushner would likely be under oath and would submit to a “private interview” about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials. The news came as the White House announced Kushner would lead a new White House Office of American Innovation, a task force billed as a powerful assignment for Kushner. But the task force’s true power in the White House remained unclear, according to a half-dozen West Wing officials and Kushner associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official White House line is that the group would have sweeping authority to modernize government, acting as strategic consultants who can draw from experiences in the private sector — and sometimes receive input from the president himself — to fulfill campaign promises like battling opioid addiction and transforming health care for veterans. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that it would “apply the president’s ahead-of-schedule-and-under-budget mentality” to the government. But others inside and outside the White House cast doubt on the task force’s significance and reach, suggesting it was a lower priority for the administration and pointing out that similar measures have been tried by previous presidents with middling success. The assignment revived lingering questions about whether Kushner had opted to focus his time on a project that would put him at some distance from some Trump’s more conservative and controversial policy overhauls. The announcement came just days after Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were photographed on the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, as the GOP health care deal began to unravel amid protests from conservative Republicans that it did not go far enough in replacing President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Kushner rushed back to Washington on Friday but it was too late to save the bill, which was scuttled hours later by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Two people close to Kushner vehemently denied the president was upset at his son-in-law for being absent, saying Trump had given the trip his blessing. And a senior White House official insisted the timing of the task force announcement was planned weeks in advance. Kushner, who has been at his father-in-law’s right hand since the campaign, has long been viewed as a first-among-equals among the disparate power centers competing for the president’s ear. Kushner, who routinely avoids interviews, draws power from his ability to access Trump at all hours, including the White House residence often off-limits to staffers. His portfolio is robust: He has been deeply involved with presidential staffing and has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. Though Kushner and Ivanka Trump have been spotted with some frequency on the Washington social circuit, the president’s son-in-law is routinely in the office early and leaves late, other than on Fridays when he observes the Sabbath. While those close to Trump flatly state that Kushner, by virtue of marriage, is untouchable, this is a rare moment when he has been the center of the sort of political storm that has routinely swept up the likes of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. It points to a White House whose power matrix is constantly in flux. Kushner has been closely allied with senior counselor Dina Powell and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and a registered Democrat. That group has, at times, been at odds with conservatives led by Bannon, who to this point has been the driving force behind the White House’s policy shop. When Kushner officially joined the administration in January as a senior adviser, it was suggested that the real estate heir would draw upon the private sector to streamline and modernize government. His task force has been meeting since shortly after the inauguration and started talking to CEOs from various sectors about ways to make changes to entrenched federal programs. “Jared is a visionary with an endless appetite for strategic, inventive solutions that will improve quality of life for all Americans,” said Hope Hicks, Trump’s longtime spokeswoman. A list supplied by the White House of some of those who have met with Kushner reads like a who’s who of the American business world, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tim Cook of Apple and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. Kushner usually does more listening than talking in the meetings, largely avoiding ideological arguments while asking questions about efficiency and best practices, according to a person who has attended a gathering but is not authorized to discuss private conversations. But the Trump team is hardly the first seeking to improve how the government operates. The Reagan administration tasked the Grace Commission in 1982 with uncovering wasteful spending and practices, while the Clinton administration sought its own reinvention of government in 1993 with what was initially called the National Performance Review. Previous commissions have not produced overwhelming results in changing the stubborn bureaucracy, casting some doubt on what Kushner’s team can accomplish. Philip Joyce, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said the domestic spending cuts in Trump’s budget blueprint suggest that this new committee would most likely focus more on shrinking the government than improving its performance. Even then, any change would be unlikely to deliver significant budget savings compared to reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. “It’s not the main thing we ought to be focusing on,” Joyce said. “It’s at the margins of the big issues facing the country, certainly in terms of the budget.” ___ Lemire reported from New York.

But we have seen numerous examples over the years where applying business principles simply do not have that much of an effect. Government is not a business. It is a service-based enterprise that provides said service at the bequest of the voters, and something that business tends to avoid because of a lack of profit.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) WASHINGTON – Jared Kushner has been a power player able to avoid much of the harsh scrutiny that comes with working in the White House. But this week he’s found that even the president’s son-in-law takes his turn in the spotlight. In a matter of days, Kushner, a senior Trump adviser, drew headlines for leaving Washington for a ski vacation while a signature campaign promise fell apart. The White House then confirmed he had volunteered to be interviewed before the Senate intelligence committee about meetings with Russian officials. At the same time, the White House announced he’ll helm a new task force that some in the West Wing have suggested carries little real influence. Kushner became the fourth Trump associate to get entangled in the Russia probe. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said Tuesday that Kushner would likely be under oath and would submit to a “private interview” about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials. The news came as the White House announced Kushner would lead a new White House Office of American Innovation, a task force billed as a powerful assignment for Kushner. But the task force’s true power in the White House remained unclear, according to a half-dozen West Wing officials and Kushner associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official White House line is that the group would have sweeping authority to modernize government, acting as strategic consultants who can draw from experiences in the private sector – and sometimes receive input from the president himself – to fulfil campaign promises like battling opioid addiction and transforming health care for veterans. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that it would “apply the president’s ahead-of-schedule-and-under-budget mentality” to the government. But others inside and outside the White House cast doubt on the task force’s significance and reach, suggesting it was a lower priority for the administration and pointing out that similar measures have been tried by previous presidents with middling success. The assignment revived lingering questions about whether Kushner had opted to focus his time on a project that would put him at some distance from some Trump’s more conservative and controversial policy overhauls. The announcement came just days after Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were photographed on the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, as the GOP health care deal began to unravel amid protests from conservative Republicans that it did not go far enough in replacing President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Kushner rushed back to Washington on Friday but it was too late to save the bill, which was scuttled hours later by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Two people close to Kushner vehemently denied the president was upset at his son-in-law for being absent, saying Trump had given the trip his blessing. And a senior White House official insisted the timing of the task force announcement was planned weeks in advance. Kushner, who has been at his father-in-law’s right hand since the campaign, has long been viewed as a first-among-equals among the disparate power centres competing for the president’s ear.

Associated Press/Pablo Martinez Monsivais WASHINGTON (AP) — Jared Kushner has been a power player able to avoid much of the harsh scrutiny that comes with working in the White House.

But this week he's found that even the president's son-in-law takes his turn in the spotlight. In a matter of days, Kushner, a senior Trump adviser, drew headlines for leaving Washington for a ski vacation while a signature campaign promise fell apart. The White House then confirmed he had volunteered to be interviewed before the Senate intelligence committee about meetings with Russian officials. At the same time, the White House announced he'll helm a new task force that some in the West Wing have suggested carries little real influence. Kushner became the fourth Trump associate to get entangled in the Russia probe. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said Tuesday that Kushner would likely be under oath and would submit to a "private interview" about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials. The news came as the White House announced Kushner would lead a new White House Office of American Innovation, a task force billed as a powerful assignment for Kushner. But the task force's true power in the White House remained unclear, according to a half-dozen West Wing officials and Kushner associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official White House line is that the group would have sweeping authority to modernize government, acting as strategic consultants who can draw from experiences in the private sector -- and sometimes receive input from the president himself -- to fulfil campaign promises like battling opioid addiction and transforming health care for veterans. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that it would "apply the president's ahead-of-schedule-and-under-budget mentality" to the government. But others inside and outside the White House cast doubt on the task force's significance and reach, suggesting it was a lower priority for the administration and pointing out that similar measures have been tried by previous presidents with middling success. The assignment revived lingering questions about whether Kushner had opted to focus his time on a project that would put him at some distance from some Trump's more conservative and controversial policy overhauls. The announcement came just days after Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were photographed on the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, as the GOP health care deal began to unravel amid protests from conservative Republicans that it did not go far enough in replacing President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Kushner rushed back to Washington on Friday but it was too late to save the bill, which was scuttled hours later by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Two people close to Kushner vehemently denied the president was upset at his son-in-law for being absent, saying Trump had given the trip his blessing. And a senior White House official insisted the timing of the task force announcement was planned weeks in advance. Kushner, who has been at his father-in-law's right hand since the campaign, has long been viewed as a first-among-equals among the disparate power centres competing for the president's ear. Kushner, who routinely avoids interviews, draws power from his ability to access Trump at all hours, including the White House residence often off-limits to staffers. His portfolio is robust: He has been deeply involved with presidential staffing and has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. Though Kushner and Ivanka Trump have been spotted with some frequency on the Washington social circuit, the president's son-in-law is routinely in the office early and leaves late, other than on Fridays when he observes the Sabbath. While those close to Trump flatly state that Kushner, by virtue of marriage, is untouchable, this is a rare moment when he has been the centre of the sort of political storm that has routinely swept up the likes of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior counsellor Kellyanne Conway. It points to a White House whose power matrix is constantly in flux. Kushner has been closely allied with senior counsellor Dina Powell and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and a registered Democrat. That group has, at times, been at odds with conservatives led by Bannon, who to this point has been the driving force behind the White House's policy shop. When Kushner officially joined the administration in January as a senior adviser, it was suggested that the real estate heir would draw upon the private sector to streamline and modernize government. His task force has been meeting since shortly after the inauguration and started talking to CEOs from various sectors about ways to make changes to entrenched federal programs. "Jared is a visionary with an endless appetite for strategic, inventive solutions that will improve quality of life for all Americans," said Hope Hicks, Trump's longtime spokeswoman. A list supplied by the White House of some of those who have met with Kushner reads like a who's who of the American business world, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tim Cook of Apple and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. Kushner usually does more listening than talking in the meetings, largely avoiding ideological arguments while asking questions about efficiency and best practices, according to a person who has attended a gathering but is not authorized to discuss private conversations. But the Trump team is hardly the first seeking to improve how the government operates. The Reagan administration tasked the Grace Commission in 1982 with uncovering wasteful spending and practices, while the Clinton administration sought its own reinvention of government in 1993 with what was initially called the National Performance Review. Previous commissions have not produced overwhelming results in changing the stubborn bureaucracy, casting some doubt on what Kushner's team can accomplish. Philip Joyce, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said the domestic spending cuts in Trump's budget blueprint suggest that this new committee would most likely focus more on shrinking the government than improving its performance. Even then, any change would be unlikely to deliver significant budget savings compared to reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. "It's not the main thing we ought to be focusing on," Joyce said. "It's at the margins of the big issues facing the country, certainly in terms of the budget." ------ Lemire reported from New York.

Previous commissions have not produced overwhelming results in changing the stubborn bureaucracy, casting some doubt on what Kushner's team can accomplish. Philip Joyce, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said the domestic spending cuts in Trump's budget blueprint suggest that this new committee would most likely focus more on shrinking the government than improving its performance. Even then, any change would be unlikely to deliver significant budget savings compared to reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. "It's not the main thing we ought to be focusing on," Joyce said. "It's at the margins of the big issues facing the country, certainly in terms of the budget."

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Washington — Jared Kushner has been a power player able to avoid much of the harsh scrutiny that comes with working in the White House. But this week he’s found that even the president’s son-in-law takes his turn in the spotlight. In a matter of days, Kushner, a senior Trump adviser, drew headlines for leaving Washington for a ski vacation while a signature campaign promise fell apart. The White House then confirmed he had volunteered to be interviewed before the Senate intelligence committee about meetings with Russian officials. At the same time, the White House announced he’ll helm a new task force that some in the West Wing have suggested carries little real influence. Kushner became the fourth Trump associate to get entangled in the Russia probe. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said Tuesday that Kushner would likely be under oath and would submit to a “private interview” about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials. The news came as the White House announced Kushner would lead a new White House Office of American Innovation, a task force billed as a powerful assignment for Kushner. But the task force’s true power in the White House remained unclear, according to a half-dozen West Wing officials and Kushner associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official White House line is that the group would have sweeping authority to modernize government, acting as strategic consultants who can draw from experiences in the private sector — and sometimes receive input from the president himself — to fulfill campaign promises like battling opioid addiction and transforming health care for veterans. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that it would “apply the president’s ahead-of-schedule-and-under-budget mentality” to the government. But others inside and outside the White House cast doubt on the task force’s significance and reach, suggesting it was a lower priority for the administration and pointing out that similar measures have been tried by previous presidents with middling success. The assignment revived lingering questions about whether Kushner had opted to focus his time on a project that would put him at some distance from some Trump’s more conservative and controversial policy overhauls. The announcement came just days after Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were photographed on the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, as the GOP health care deal began to unravel amid protests from conservative Republicans that it did not go far enough in replacing President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Kushner rushed back to Washington on Friday but it was too late to save the bill, which was scuttled hours later by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Two people close to Kushner vehemently denied the president was upset at his son-in-law for being absent, saying Trump had given the trip his blessing. And a senior White House official insisted the timing of the task force announcement was planned weeks in advance. Kushner, who has been at his father-in-law’s right hand since the campaign, has long been viewed as a first-among-equals among the disparate power centers competing for the president’s ear. Kushner, who routinely avoids interviews, draws power from his ability to access Trump at all hours, including the White House residence often off-limits to staffers. His portfolio is robust: He has been deeply involved with presidential staffing and has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. Though Kushner and Ivanka Trump have been spotted with some frequency on the Washington social circuit, the president’s son-in-law is routinely in the office early and leaves late, other than on Fridays when he observes the Sabbath. While those close to Trump flatly state that Kushner, by virtue of marriage, is untouchable, this is a rare moment when he has been the center of the sort of political storm that has routinely swept up the likes of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. It points to a White House whose power matrix is constantly in flux. Kushner has been closely allied with senior counselor Dina Powell and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and a registered Democrat. That group has, at times, been at odds with conservatives led by Bannon, who to this point has been the driving force behind the White House’s policy shop. When Kushner officially joined the administration in January as a senior adviser, it was suggested that the real estate heir would draw upon the private sector to streamline and modernize government. His task force has been meeting since shortly after the inauguration and started talking to CEOs from various sectors about ways to make changes to entrenched federal programs. “Jared is a visionary with an endless appetite for strategic, inventive solutions that will improve quality of life for all Americans,” said Hope Hicks, Trump’s longtime spokeswoman. A list supplied by the White House of some of those who have met with Kushner reads like a who’s who of the American business world, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tim Cook of Apple and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. Kushner usually does more listening than talking in the meetings, largely avoiding ideological arguments while asking questions about efficiency and best practices, according to a person who has attended a gathering but is not authorized to discuss private conversations. But the Trump team is hardly the first seeking to improve how the government operates. The Reagan administration tasked the Grace Commission in 1982 with uncovering wasteful spending and practices, while the Clinton administration sought its own reinvention of government in 1993 with what was initially called the National Performance Review. Previous commissions have not produced overwhelming results in changing the stubborn bureaucracy, casting some doubt on what Kushner’s team can accomplish. Philip Joyce, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said the domestic spending cuts in Trump’s budget blueprint suggest that this new committee would most likely focus more on shrinking the government than improving its performance. Even then, any change would be unlikely to deliver significant budget savings compared to reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. “It’s not the main thing we ought to be focusing on,” Joyce said. “It’s at the margins of the big issues facing the country, certainly in terms of the budget.” CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was marginally lower at 377.07 in late opening deals, with rising oil prices and positive cues from the U.S. and Asia helping limit losses. The German DAX was rising 0.4 percent and France's CAC 40 index was edging up 0.1 percent while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was down about 0.1 percent in choppy trade. European Council President Donald Tusk is scheduled to make a press statement in Brussels on the U.K. notification around 13.45 local time. Interestingly, the start of the formal Brexit process comes a day after the Scottish Parliament backed Nicola Sturgeon's call for a second independence referendum. In stock-specific action, Norsk Hydro rallied 2 percent after JPMorgan Chase said it sees scope for earnings upgrades at the company. Siemens shares advanced 1.5 percent. The company plans to keep the majority stake in its healthcare unit Healthineers after an IPO or spin-off, CEO Joe Kaeser told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft in an interview. Volkswagen rose half a percent. The automaker would recall more than 572,000 vehicles in china to address a potential problem caused by panoramic sunroofs, the country's quality regulator said. The day's economic reports proved to be a mixed bag, with a gauge of French consumer sentiment coming in flat in March, while the number of loans approved for house purchases in the U.K. fell in February from the previous month. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Market Analysis Experience Pays: The 10 Oldest CEOs at Fortune 500 companies Clunkers and Blockbusters: The 10 Most Expensive Movies in history Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April Previous Story Next Story European Market news European Shares May See Subdued Start European Markets Finish Slightly Higher After Brexit Process Begins European Commission Prohibits Deutsche Börse-LSEG Merger FTSE 100 Marginally Lower In Choppy Trade CAC 40 Rises On Firm Wall Street Lead DAX Extends Gains As Investors Shrug Off Brexit Risk European Shares Seen Up As British PM Signs Brexit Letter European Markets Climb As Trump Concerns Ease European Shares Mostly Higher Ahead Of Brexit Triggering FTSE 100 Fluctuates Ahead Of Brexit Triggering CAC 40 Little Changed In Early Trade DAX Rises As Trump Jitters Fade European Shares Seen Up In Cautious Trade European Markets Drop On Concerns Over Trump Agenda European Shares Broadly Lower After US Healthcare Bill Setback <<Previous        24 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Major Averages Close Mixed Following Lackluster Session - U.S. Commentary Nunes Claims Democrats Are Not Serious About Russia Investigation Poll Shows Trump Less Trusted Than Major Media Outlets Mark Cuban: Healthcare Is A Right UK PM May Pulls Brexit Trigger African Court Says Coca-Cola Is 'Poisonous' Trump's Childhood Home Sold At Auction For $2.14 Mln U.S. Pending Home Sales Rebound Strongly In February US Congress Passes Resolution To Repeal FCC's Online Privacy Rules Burned By Madoff, Hedge Fund Bigwig Plunges To Death In NYC IPO Watch: BuzzFeed Reportedly Has Big Plans British PM May Says Triggering Article 50 'Historic Moment' Street Set For Mixed Opening Street Seems To Be More Optimistic Stocks Close Mostly Higher On Upbeat Consumer Confidence Data - U.S. Commentary Asian Shares Retreat On Trump's Healthcare Defeat Asian Shares Rise As Risk Appetite Improves Rally May Stall For Singapore Stock Market Asian Markets Mostly Higher Major Averages Close Mixed Following Lackluster Session - U.S. Commentary European Shares Mostly Higher Ahead Of Brexit Triggering Mild Pressure Tipped For China Stock Market Asian Shares Follow Wall Street Higher European Markets Climb As Trump Concerns Ease Singapore Market Draws Flat Lead For Tuesday Tech Shares May Support South Korea Stocks Stocks Close Flat Following Choppy Trading Day - U.S. Commentary The Swiss Stock Market Kicked Off The New Trading Week With A Loss Canadian Stocks Has Recovered From Early Losses - Canadian Commentary Stocks Recover From Initial Sell-Off But Remain Mostly Lower - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Come Under Pressure Amid Weakness Overseas - U.S. Commentary Early Signals Point To Rough Session -- Canadian Commentary CAC 40 Inches Lower As Trump Healthcare Setback Pushes Up Euro DAX Drifts Lower, Led By Banks And Automakers European Shares Seen Lower On US Policy Woes Sensex Drops 160 Points On Weak Global Cues; Nifty At 9055 Copyright © 2017 RTTNews.

The group, headquartered in Chicago, has independent local branches across the United States, including in Philadelphia.  One firm in Bunker Labs is the South Jersey-based veteran head-hunting company Hire Served, founded by former FBI special agent and military spouse Jean South. Hire Served matches small businesses and other groups that need veteran skills or special security clearances.   There’s also Jennifer Gallagher’s GoPaperboy, which helps users find talented local children for homework help or tennis instruction. And Preston Forchion sought out mentors at Bunker Labs to build his vehicle crash safety investigation firm Comprehensive Accident Reconstruction Specialists (CARS). The former Air Defense Artillery officer was stationed in Germany for four years before beginning a multi-decade career in law enforcement. There, he developed an expertise in the scientific analysis of car crashes. He now teaches basic and advance crash reconstruction at Kean University. CARS, which provides services to lawyers, insurance companies, fleet managers, and other parties, was founded in February 2016. It plans to hire three employees by year's end. It booked $10,000 in revenues last year and forecasts consulting fees of $100,000 by the end of 2017.  Forchion thanks Bunker for assistance with branding and mentorship in navigating his weaknesses. “Bunker helped me put down a gun and put on a suit and tie to run a business,” he said. Philadelphia’s Bunker efforts are led by executive director and  Iraq war veteran Joe Witte. A retired Army captain, Witte cofounded the city’s chapter in 2016 and has since helped more than 20 early-stage veteran-founded companies and engaged with more than 300 veteran business owners. Bunker Labs does not take equity in the companies it mentors; it relies on donors and corporate sponsors to finance operations. The program's core is the 18-week EPIC program. Eight to 12 veteran entrepreneurs are selected for each cohort and receive advice on nearly every facet of building a company. This can range from advice on culture or sales, to selecting the right office space or making introductions for raising funds.  “We cast our net wide and don’t have one specific industry focus,” Witte said. “Success for us is in seeing our cohort members build self-sustaining companies.” The nonprofit also holds monthly meetups called Bunker Brews that give attendees a chance to hear from thought leaders. The event, held at Benjamin’s Desk, typically draws 50 to 70 veteran entrepreneurs at a time. These monthly gigs lead to the annual Muster event, this year on Sept. 27 at the Pennovation Center. At last year’s meetup, more than 300 people came out to hear Mayor Kenney and Michele Jones, the first woman to become a command sergeant major in the U.S. Army Reserve. “Our goal is to encourage veterans to talk about their journey, share their experience, hardships and successes,” Witte said.  Bunker Labs’ efforts are attracting corporate support, such as the $1.5 million that JP Morgan Chase provided. Bunker used the funds to launch a 10-month tour, holding events and opening new chapters across America.    “After World War II, nearly half of returning service members started their own businesses,” said Jon Cox, a Navy veteran and executive director of JP Morgan Chase’s Small Business & Strategic Initiatives in Military and Veterans Affairs. “We fast-forward to today and 25 percent of veterans say they want to start a business, but only 6 percent do because they lack access to capital.” Because nearly 10 percent — or 2.5 million — of the nation’s small businesses are veteran-founded, the work has macroeconomic impact.     “We work with Bunker Labs because they provide an excellent platform for veterans to get help with starting a business,” he said. “Not only is this the right thing to do, it’s great for the U.S. economy.” Read more by Aswin Mannepalli Published: March 29, 2017 — 6:52 AM EDT | Updated: March 29, 2017 — 9:01 AM EDT The Philadelphia Inquirer Do you have a minute?...

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) By Jonathan Lemire and Josh Boak | AP By Jonathan Lemire and Josh Boak | AP March 29 at 6:44 AM WASHINGTON — Jared Kushner has been a power player able to avoid much of the harsh scrutiny that comes with working in the White House. But this week he’s found that even the president’s son-in-law takes his turn in the spotlight. In a matter of days, Kushner, a senior Trump adviser, drew headlines for leaving Washington for a ski vacation while a signature campaign promise fell apart. The White House then confirmed he had volunteered to be interviewed before the Senate intelligence committee about meetings with Russian officials. At the same time, the White House announced he’ll helm a new task force that some in the West Wing have suggested carries little real influence. Kushner became the fourth Trump associate to get entangled in the Russia probe. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said Tuesday that Kushner would likely be under oath and would submit to a “private interview” about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials. The news came as the White House announced Kushner would lead a new White House Office of American Innovation, a task force billed as a powerful assignment for Kushner. But the task force’s true power in the White House remained unclear, according to a half-dozen West Wing officials and Kushner associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official White House line is that the group would have sweeping authority to modernize government, acting as strategic consultants who can draw from experiences in the private sector — and sometimes receive input from the president himself — to fulfill campaign promises like battling opioid addiction and transforming health care for veterans. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that it would “apply the president’s ahead-of-schedule-and-under-budget mentality” to the government. But others inside and outside the White House cast doubt on the task force’s significance and reach, suggesting it was a lower priority for the administration and pointing out that similar measures have been tried by previous presidents with middling success. The assignment revived lingering questions about whether Kushner had opted to focus his time on a project that would put him at some distance from some Trump’s more conservative and controversial policy overhauls. The announcement came just days after Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were photographed on the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, as the GOP health care deal began to unravel amid protests from conservative Republicans that it did not go far enough in replacing President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Kushner rushed back to Washington on Friday but it was too late to save the bill, which was scuttled hours later by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Two people close to Kushner vehemently denied the president was upset at his son-in-law for being absent, saying Trump had given the trip his blessing. And a senior White House official insisted the timing of the task force announcement was planned weeks in advance. Kushner, who has been at his father-in-law’s right hand since the campaign, has long been viewed as a first-among-equals among the disparate power centers competing for the president’s ear. Kushner, who routinely avoids interviews, draws power from his ability to access Trump at all hours, including the White House residence often off-limits to staffers. His portfolio is robust: He has been deeply involved with presidential staffing and has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. Though Kushner and Ivanka Trump have been spotted with some frequency on the Washington social circuit, the president’s son-in-law is routinely in the office early and leaves late, other than on Fridays when he observes the Sabbath. While those close to Trump flatly state that Kushner, by virtue of marriage, is untouchable, this is a rare moment when he has been the center of the sort of political storm that has routinely swept up the likes of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. It points to a White House whose power matrix is constantly in flux. Kushner has been closely allied with senior counselor Dina Powell and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and a registered Democrat. That group has, at times, been at odds with conservatives led by Bannon, who to this point has been the driving force behind the White House’s policy shop. When Kushner officially joined the administration in January as a senior adviser, it was suggested that the real estate heir would draw upon the private sector to streamline and modernize government. His task force has been meeting since shortly after the inauguration and started talking to CEOs from various sectors about ways to make changes to entrenched federal programs. “Jared is a visionary with an endless appetite for strategic, inventive solutions that will improve quality of life for all Americans,” said Hope Hicks, Trump’s longtime spokeswoman. A list supplied by the White House of some of those who have met with Kushner reads like a who’s who of the American business world, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tim Cook of Apple and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. Kushner usually does more listening than talking in the meetings, largely avoiding ideological arguments while asking questions about efficiency and best practices, according to a person who has attended a gathering but is not authorized to discuss private conversations. But the Trump team is hardly the first seeking to improve how the government operates. The Reagan administration tasked the Grace Commission in 1982 with uncovering wasteful spending and practices, while the Clinton administration sought its own reinvention of government in 1993 with what was initially called the National Performance Review. Previous commissions have not produced overwhelming results in changing the stubborn bureaucracy, casting some doubt on what Kushner’s team can accomplish. Philip Joyce, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said the domestic spending cuts in Trump’s budget blueprint suggest that this new committee would most likely focus more on shrinking the government than improving its performance. Even then, any change would be unlikely to deliver significant budget savings compared to reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. “It’s not the main thing we ought to be focusing on,” Joyce said. “It’s at the margins of the big issues facing the country, certainly in terms of the budget.” ___ Lemire reported from New York.

Britain. Published: 12:36 March 29, 2017 By Simon Kennedy, Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE The mantra within the British government as it prepares to hammer out the terms of its break-up with the European Union is that no deal is better than a bad deal. Walking away with no regime for £230 billion (Dh1.04 trillion, $287 billion) of annual exports to the bloc and the 3.3 million Europeans in the UKwould be “perfectly OK”, says Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Not “frightening” at all, says Brexit tsar David Davis. But analysts are painting an entirely different picture of an outcome they view as increasingly plausible: UK Prime Minister Theresa May balking at the EU’s demands or giving up on getting the sweeping trade accord she wants. And a collapse in the two-year talks would unleash costs and regulations that stand to damage Britain far more than the EU. “A deal will take a lot more time, goodwill and tact than has been on display from either side,” said Anand Menon, director of The UK in a Changing Europe research group, who sees a 50 per cent chance of there being no deal on March 29, 2019. “I find it very hard to see how May gets all she wants.” An official in May’s government puts the chance of the talk collapsing at about 30 per cent. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc should ready to deal with the “serious consequences” of a breakdown, such as longer queues at borders to how to handle transportation of nuclear materials. If May does walk away, then the UK would truly be in uncharted territory. Based on interviews and published analysis, here’s a rough map of what might happen should Britain spin out of the EU without a safety net. Even before May delivers an emergency statement to the House of Commons to explain the failure, financial markets would have already priced in the ramifications. Jordan Rochester, a London-based strategist at Nomura International Plc, predicts the pound would slump towards $1.15, extending its post-referendum slump to almost a quarter. The day in 2013 when David Cameron announced his intention to call a referendum sterling was at $1.58. Tariffs Companies, meantime, would activate plans for the tumble over what they’ve long described as a “cliff edge” of uncertainty. Absent a deal, the UK would surrender tariff-free or frictionless trade with the EU’s 440 million consumers and any hope of a transitional phase to adjust. For manufacturers, World Trade Organisation tariffs averaging about 5 per cent — and twice that for cars produced by the likes of Ford Motor Co. — would be immediately imposed on trade with the EU, the market for 44 per cent of Britain’s overseas sales. Farmers could face duties of around 40 per cent and most industries would suffer higher import costs if Britain imposed its own tariffs on trade from the EU. That would reduce trade by about 30 per cent, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Oxford Economics Ltd. estimates gross domestic product would be 3.9 per cent smaller by 2030 or 96 billion pounds in inflation-adjusted terms. At ports, border checks would impede commerce further; the likes of BAE Systems Plc to J Sainsbury Plc might struggle to get timely delivery from the continent to keep assembly lines humming and supermarket shelves stacked. Then there’s the City of London — a global hub of finance and the gateway for capital to and from Europe. JPMorgan Chase & Co and other banks that had hoped to keep servicing the bloc from London would likely accelerate the shift of jobs and operations into the EU or to New York. The consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimated that in a worst-case scenario, 70,000 financial services jobs would be lost. “On day one, JPMorgan has to be able to conduct business with our clients in Europe,” CEO Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg. Job loss The French or Germans would, without delay, repatriate control of the clearing of euro derivatives and credit-rating companies with bases in London would lose their authority to police continental companies. Xavier Rolet, CEO of London Stock Exchange Group Plc, has said 232,000 jobs could eventually be lost from the UK. No deal would also further punish industries likely to be hamstrung by Brexit. Airlines such as easyJet Plc might see their access to the continent cut off unless they relocate headquarters or sell more shares to investors in the region to satisfy regulators. The hospitality and agriculture sectors already face a struggle to get the workers they need as do pharmaceutical firms like AstraZeneca Plc, which would also have to deal with the loss of the European Medicines Agency from London. The hardest of Brexits would also risk the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and embolden Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s push for a second independence referendum. For May, the threat to walk away is a basic negotiating tactic if the UK is to avoid being punished by the EU. “No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain,” she said in January, adding it would be an “act of calamitous self harm” for Europe to try to retaliate against the nation for its desire to leave. May’s bullishness reflects the bet that Britain’s Blitz spirit would carry it through. She herself has held out the prospect of slashing corporate taxes to lure businesses and investment. Released of the EU’s constraints, the UK would also count on free-trade deals from China to the US. If the talks do blow up, the most likely detonator is the demand that Britain must pay to leave. The EU’s need to prevent other breakaway efforts requires a cost be imposed on Britain — a settling of accounts, in the view from Brussels. “We have to calculate scientifically what the British commitments were and then the bill has to be paid,” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said. Asked if the bill will be 50 billion pounds, Juncker replied: “It’s around that.” UK Trade Secretary Liam Fox has described such a fee as “absurd”. Some in government have questioned its legality; the EU could force the issue before the International Court of Justice. Brexit campaigners back home would also balk at paying too much. Unravelling of negotiations While May wants to discuss divorce and a new trade deal at the same time, EU officials say they won’t even engage on commerce until the matter of the money is settled. “The EU recognises it has huge leverage and is ready to use it,” said Gregor Irwin, chief economist at Global Counsel, a consulting firm. “There is a risk of the negotiations unravelling because you’re never quite sure how much it all means to the other side. If you push too far and it turns out they weren’t bluffing you end up with no deal.” Even if a bill is paid, things don’t get any easier. While willing to give up membership of the single market for goods and services to regain control of immigration and lawmaking, May wants to win as much trade free of tariffs and bureaucracy as she can. That smacks of “cherry picking” to some in the region and if the EU balks, May could again walk. She will also know the risk of a poor trade deal would leave her prone to attack from the anti-Brexit lobby at home. Talks might ultimately need to break down for progress to be made, according to Oliver Harvey, a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. In that event, May would call an election aimed at winning a mandate to strike a deal some in her own ruling Conservative Party won’t like. “The UK will eventually compromise,” said Harvey. “But this will depend on a weakening economy and market pressure, with a full cliff-edge Brexit likely to be fully priced in at some point in the next two years.” More from Features Trump’s trade swagger will not carry him far Central Bank releases regulation on data privacy The nations most gripped by economic misery $1tr US infrastructure spend could be wasted US airlines worry over wages as a load factor Dollar’s domination won’t be easily challenged A soft regulatory regime sits well on an economy The time-tested oil-and-gold connection tags from this storyBrexit follow this tag on MGNTheresa May follow this tag on MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGNDavid Cameron follow this tag on MGNChina follow this tag on MGNUnited Kingdom follow this tag on MGNBoris Johnson follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsFeatures tagsBrexit follow this tag on MGN+ MGNTheresa May follow this tag on MGN+ MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDavid Cameron follow this tag on MGN+ MGNChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In FeaturesTrump’s trade swagger will not carry him far Business Gallery Manufacturing is order of the day Pink diamond worth millions shown in London Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01A bad Brexit deal may be better than none 02Taking it to the bank 03Keeping it all in the family Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 11Images Pink diamond worth millions shown in London Mar 21, 2017 6Images Manufacturing is order of the day Mar 28, 2017 8Images Dubai’s next big mall gets into project mode Mar 16, 2017 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 Currencies currenciesAgainst USDAgainst BHD Against EUR Against GBP Against PHILIPINE PESO Against SAR Against OMR Against QAR Against KWD Against AED Value % Change As on World, UAE Markets Data OverviewGccEuropeAsiau.s.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) By: Jonathan Lemire And Josh Boak The Associated Press Published on WASHINGTON — Jared Kushner has been a power player able to avoid much of the harsh scrutiny that comes with working in the White House. But this week he's found that even the president's son-in-law takes his turn in the spotlight. In a matter of days, Kushner, a senior Trump adviser, drew headlines for leaving Washington for a ski vacation while a signature campaign promise fell apart. The White House then confirmed he had volunteered to be interviewed before the Senate intelligence committee about meetings with Russian officials. At the same time, the White House announced he'll helm a new task force that some in the West Wing have suggested carries little real influence. Kushner became the fourth Trump associate to get entangled in the Russia probe. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said Tuesday that Kushner would likely be under oath and would submit to a "private interview" about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials. The news came as the White House announced Kushner would lead a new White House Office of American Innovation, a task force billed as a powerful assignment for Kushner. But the task force's true power in the White House remained unclear, according to a half-dozen West Wing officials and Kushner associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official White House line is that the group would have sweeping authority to modernize government, acting as strategic consultants who can draw from experiences in the private sector — and sometimes receive input from the president himself — to fulfil campaign promises like battling opioid addiction and transforming health care for veterans. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that it would "apply the president's ahead-of-schedule-and-under-budget mentality" to the government. But others inside and outside the White House cast doubt on the task force's significance and reach, suggesting it was a lower priority for the administration and pointing out that similar measures have been tried by previous presidents with middling success. The assignment revived lingering questions about whether Kushner had opted to focus his time on a project that would put him at some distance from some Trump's more conservative and controversial policy overhauls. The announcement came just days after Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were photographed on the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, as the GOP health care deal began to unravel amid protests from conservative Republicans that it did not go far enough in replacing President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Kushner rushed back to Washington on Friday but it was too late to save the bill, which was scuttled hours later by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Two people close to Kushner vehemently denied the president was upset at his son-in-law for being absent, saying Trump had given the trip his blessing. And a senior White House official insisted the timing of the task force announcement was planned weeks in advance. Kushner, who has been at his father-in-law's right hand since the campaign, has long been viewed as a first-among-equals among the disparate power centres competing for the president's ear. Kushner, who routinely avoids interviews, draws power from his ability to access Trump at all hours, including the White House residence often off-limits to staffers. His portfolio is robust: He has been deeply involved with presidential staffing and has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. Though Kushner and Ivanka Trump have been spotted with some frequency on the Washington social circuit, the president's son-in-law is routinely in the office early and leaves late, other than on Fridays when he observes the Sabbath. While those close to Trump flatly state that Kushner, by virtue of marriage, is untouchable, this is a rare moment when he has been the centre of the sort of political storm that has routinely swept up the likes of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior counsellor Kellyanne Conway. It points to a White House whose power matrix is constantly in flux. Kushner has been closely allied with senior counsellor Dina Powell and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and a registered Democrat. That group has, at times, been at odds with conservatives led by Bannon, who to this point has been the driving force behind the White House's policy shop. When Kushner officially joined the administration in January as a senior adviser, it was suggested that the real estate heir would draw upon the private sector to streamline and modernize government. His task force has been meeting since shortly after the inauguration and started talking to CEOs from various sectors about ways to make changes to entrenched federal programs. "Jared is a visionary with an endless appetite for strategic, inventive solutions that will improve quality of life for all Americans," said Hope Hicks, Trump's longtime spokeswoman. A list supplied by the White House of some of those who have met with Kushner reads like a who's who of the American business world, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tim Cook of Apple and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. Kushner usually does more listening than talking in the meetings, largely avoiding ideological arguments while asking questions about efficiency and best practices, according to a person who has attended a gathering but is not authorized to discuss private conversations. But the Trump team is hardly the first seeking to improve how the government operates. The Reagan administration tasked the Grace Commission in 1982 with uncovering wasteful spending and practices, while the Clinton administration sought its own reinvention of government in 1993 with what was initially called the National Performance Review. Previous commissions have not produced overwhelming results in changing the stubborn bureaucracy, casting some doubt on what Kushner's team can accomplish. Philip Joyce, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said the domestic spending cuts in Trump's budget blueprint suggest that this new committee would most likely focus more on shrinking the government than improving its performance. Even then, any change would be unlikely to deliver significant budget savings compared to reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. "It's not the main thing we ought to be focusing on," Joyce said. "It's at the margins of the big issues facing the country, certainly in terms of the budget." ___ Lemire reported from New York.

WASHINGTON: Jared Kushner has been a power player able to avoid much of the harsh scrutiny that comes with working in the White House.

But this week he’s found that even the president’s son-in-law takes his turn in the spotlight. In a matter of days, Kushner, a senior Trump adviser, drew headlines for leaving Washington for a ski vacation while a signature campaign promise fell apart. The White House then confirmed he had volunteered to be interviewed before the Senate intelligence committee about meetings with Russian officials. At the same time, the White House announced he’ll helm a new task force that some in the West Wing have suggested carries little real influence. Kushner became the fourth Trump associate to get entangled in the Russia probe. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said Tuesday that Kushner would likely be under oath and would submit to a “private interview” about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials. Sponsored Content: Why Governance, Risk and Compliance is Everyone’s Business - Download the Executive Brief Today. The news came as the White House announced Kushner would lead a new White House Office of American Innovation, a task force billed as a powerful assignment for Kushner. But the task force’s true power in the White House remained unclear, according to a half-dozen West Wing officials and Kushner associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Advertisement The official White House line is that the group would have sweeping authority to modernize government, acting as strategic consultants who can draw from experiences in the private sector — and sometimes receive input from the president himself — to fulfill campaign promises like battling opioid addiction and transforming health care for veterans. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that it would “apply the president’s ahead-of-schedule-and-under-budget mentality” to the government. But others inside and outside the White House cast doubt on the task force’s significance and reach, suggesting it was a lower priority for the administration and pointing out that similar measures have been tried by previous presidents with middling success. The assignment revived lingering questions about whether Kushner had opted to focus his time on a project that would put him at some distance from some Trump’s more conservative and controversial policy overhauls. The announcement came just days after Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, were photographed on the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, as the GOP health care deal began to unravel amid protests from conservative Republicans that it did not go far enough in replacing President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Kushner rushed back to Washington on Friday but it was too late to save the bill, which was scuttled hours later by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Two people close to Kushner vehemently denied the president was upset at his son-in-law for being absent, saying Trump had given the trip his blessing. And a senior White House official insisted the timing of the task force announcement was planned weeks in advance. Kushner, who has been at his father-in-law’s right hand since the campaign, has long been viewed as a first-among-equals among the disparate power centers competing for the president’s ear. Kushner, who routinely avoids interviews, draws power from his ability to access Trump at all hours, including the White House residence often off-limits to staffers. His portfolio is robust: He has been deeply involved with presidential staffing and has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. Though Kushner and Ivanka Trump have been spotted with some frequency on the Washington social circuit, the president’s son-in-law is routinely in the office early and leaves late, other than on Fridays when he observes the Sabbath. While those close to Trump flatly state that Kushner, by virtue of marriage, is untouchable, this is a rare moment when he has been the center of the sort of political storm that has routinely swept up the likes of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. It points to a White House whose power matrix is constantly in flux. Kushner has been closely allied with senior counselor Dina Powell and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and a registered Democrat. That group has, at times, been at odds with conservatives led by Bannon, who to this point has been the driving force behind the White House’s policy shop. When Kushner officially joined the administration in January as a senior adviser, it was suggested that the real estate heir would draw upon the private sector to streamline and modernize government. His task force has been meeting since shortly after the inauguration and started talking to CEOs from various sectors about ways to make changes to entrenched federal programs. “Jared is a visionary with an endless appetite for strategic, inventive solutions that will improve quality of life for all Americans,” said Hope Hicks, Trump’s longtime spokeswoman. A list supplied by the White House of some of those who have met with Kushner reads like a who’s who of the American business world, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tim Cook of Apple and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. Kushner usually does more listening than talking in the meetings, largely avoiding ideological arguments while asking questions about efficiency and best practices, according to a person who has attended a gathering but is not authorized to discuss private conversations. But the Trump team is hardly the first seeking to improve how the government operates. The Reagan administration tasked the Grace Commission in 1982 with uncovering wasteful spending and practices, while the Clinton administration sought its own reinvention of government in 1993 with what was initially called the National Performance Review. Previous commissions have not produced overwhelming results in changing the stubborn bureaucracy, casting some doubt on what Kushner’s team can accomplish. Philip Joyce, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said the domestic spending cuts in Trump’s budget blueprint suggest that this new committee would most likely focus more on shrinking the government than improving its performance. Even then, any change would be unlikely to deliver significant budget savings compared to reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. “It’s not the main thing we ought to be focusing on,” Joyce said. “It’s at the margins of the big issues facing the country, certainly in terms of the budget.” ___ Lemire reported from New York.

Photographer: Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg Talk about risk-on: the demand for higher-yielding securities is proving so strong that Papua New Guinea, one of Asia’s poorest nations, is contemplating a debut issue of dollar bonds. The southwest Pacific nation plans to raise $500 million in five-year bonds, central bank governor Loi Martin Bakani said Tuesday at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. The country would join Mongolia among sub-investment grade issuers in 2017. Sales of high-yield bonds total almost $15 billion so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s part of a broader trend of enduring strength in emerging markets that are weathering the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening cycle with aplomb. Concerns about trade wars and the potential renewed decline of commodity prices have been set aside for now, with the long-awaited end of the global bond bull market seeming to be on hold. “There is strong appetite for frontier issues -- and markets have taken the Federal Reserve tightening policy in their stride,” Stuart Culverhouse, chief economist at Exotix Partners LLP in London, said by phone. Issuers in the single-B tier -- the second-highest in the junk rating scale -- have found yields “are not prohibitively high for their financing needs,” he said. With U.S. Treasuries range-bound and volatility in broader markets remaining subdued, investors have piled into high-yield borrowers. That pushed down the premiums on Asian junk bonds to 411.9 basis points on March 3, a near four-year low, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Indexes. Papua New Guinea aims to woo buyers from Asia, Europe and the U.S. for its bond sale in the second half of the year. This isn’t the country’s first attempt, after it hired banks in 2013 for an issue of dollar-denominated securities that didn’t pan out. Success this time would follow several years of current-account surpluses for the natural-resource dominated economy -- though the period has seen slower growth and wider fiscal deficits. Mongolia, which has been struggling with a shrinking economy, ballooning budget deficit and debt downgrades, benefited from a rebound in copper and the prospect of an International Monetary Fund rescue package to pull off its sale of $600 million seven-year debt earlier this month. Sri Lanka is also planning a $1.5 billion bond sale. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The S&P 500's best day in nearly two weeks came after a record-setting rally for stocks in the wake of President Donald Trump's election in November had stalled this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped an eight-day losing streak, which had been its longest run of losses since 2011. U.S. consumer confidence surged to a more than 16-year high in March amid growing labor market optimism, while the trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in February. The economy's strengthening fundamentals were bolstered by other data showing further increases in house prices in January. The data "underscore what has been going on really in this whole rally, and that is that confidence is pretty high and optimism is high and that has kind of been underpinning the resiliency of the equity markets," said Jim Davis, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Springfield, Illinois. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 150.52 points, or 0.73 percent, to 20,701.5, the S&P 500 gained 16.98 points, or 0.73 percent, to 2,358.57 and the Nasdaq Composite added 34.77 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,875.14. Tuesday's gains follow declines last week as investors fretted over Trump's ability to enact his agenda after his fellow Republicans failed to pass their healthcare bill. However, investors appear to have shrugged off the setback, choosing instead to focus on Trump's promise of reforming the U.S. tax code, which has been a key driver in the post-election record rally. "You have got maybe some rethinking of the political calculus related to the demise of healthcare, but what that may mean for a quicker focus on tax reform," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. The financial and energy sectors, which have lagged the broader market this year, fueled the S&P 500 on Tuesday. The financial sector jumped 1.4 percent, with JPMorgan and Bank of America giving big boosts to the S&P 500. Energy shares gained 1.3 percent, supported by stronger oil prices. The Dow Jones Transport Average, seen by some as a barometer of the economy, gained 1.8 percent for its second-best day of the year. Apple rose 2.1 percent and gave the biggest boost to the S&P and the Nasdaq, as the shares hit an all-time high. In corporate news, General Motors rose 2.4 percent after activist investor David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital urged the carmaker to split its stock into two classes. Tesla rose 2.7 percent after disclosing that Chinese technology giant Tencent Holdings had taken a 5 percent stake in the electric car maker for $1.78 billion. Darden Restaurants jumped 9.3 percent, making it the best performer on the S&P 500, after the Olive Garden owner announced quarterly results and said it would buy Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for $780 million. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.63-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 33 new lows.

Tags Fosun CHINA Asia China's Fosun says co-founder steps down in surprise reshuffle Reuters | Wednesday, Mar 29, 2017 A view of the headquarters of Shanghai Fosun Pharma Group in Shanghai Photo: Reuters Reuters Wednesday, Mar 29, 2017 HONG KONG - Fosun International Ltd , one of China's most aggressively acquisitive conglomerates, said late on Tuesday that its co-founder and chief executive would step down in a broader reshuffle announced alongside annual earnings. The leisure-to-insurance group, one of China's largest privately held firms, said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange that Liang Xinjun had resigned for health reasons. It gave no further details. Senior vice-president Ding Guoqi also stepped down from the group. Read also: China calls for explanation after Paris police shoot dead Chinese man Liang has been a public face of Fosun, particularly around the battle for French leisure group Club Med. He founded Fosun in 1992 with chairman Guo Guangchang and a handful of others, with the aim of emulating the strategy of US investor Warren Buffet, using insurance cash for more lucrative investments. For Fosun, that has included bets on everything from Portuguese insurance to One Chase Manhattan Plaza, the headquarters of JPMorgan, bought in 2013. Fosun said in the statement that its net profit rose 28 per cent to a record high of over 10 billion yuan (S$2 billion). In the Tuesday statement Guo emphasised the group's strategy to contain funding costs while investing heavily in new technologies, including artificial intelligence and automation.
