"I am committed to this group and after some profit-taking, I think it runs anew," the "Mad Money" host said. On Friday, three of the largest banks in the U.S. — Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo — issued statements that were incredibly positive. Many investors believe that the recent rally in financials is based on a mere post-election high, but Cramer disagreed. Banks have been waiting for this moment, Cramer said, and they have been prepared to strike at the right time. Scott Mlyn | CNBC Pedestrians pass in front of a Bank of America branch in New York City. "It is the ideal backdrop for the bank stocks to go higher." -Jim Cramer All three banks took advantage of the Great Recession to increase national market share, as JPMorgan controls 13 percent of the nation's deposits, followed by Bank of America at 9.9 percent and Wells Fargo at 9.7 percent. Wells Fargo is the country's largest lender with 12 percent of the market. JPMorgan has 6.3 percent and Bank of America has 4.2 percent. Needless to say, the three banks all have a solid read on what is happening in the industry. All three confirmed there are more loans, more spending and fewer customers going broke on their conference calls. They all painted a very strong picture that things have picked up after the election. "I cannot stress how important all of this is," Cramer said. That means the banks will be ready when more rate hikes come along, and will have a large amount of cash ready to lend. "It is the ideal backdrop for the bank stocks to go higher," Cramer said.

Find out how it will benefit you. They can track where you spend, what you're buying, and how this changes according to age or gender. "We know exactly who's spending what, how many times people are interacting with Apple Pay, which cards they use," ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott said late last year. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Illustration: Andrew Dyson  Elliott was referring to customers who've uploaded their credit cards onto their iPhones using a system called Apple Pay, which turns a phone into a "digital wallet". But all banks get the same information on anyone using a credit card. ANZ's oldest customer to upload their credit card onto their iPhone is 90, by the way. In Japan, things have gone further. Banks there are reportedly experimenting with computer programs that analyse recorded conversations between customers and staff in call centres, then figure out what type of comments prompt customers to buy products. It can then helpfully suggest to bankers when to "interject" to best make a sale. Advertisement The potential for things to cross a line and get creepy is pretty clear. But what if this information could be used to get customers a better deal? Well, perhaps it could be. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Australia's banks will need to raise up to $130 billion on debt markets in 2017, analysts predict. Photo: Louie Douvis One of the more interesting recommendations of last year's House of Representatives banking inquiry was to force banks to securely "share" more of the financial data they hold on millions of Australians. The idea isn't as crazy as it may sound. Indeed, if the government is serious about putting more competitive heat on the Big Four banks – something it's been pursuing since Labor's popular call for a banking royal commission – this would be a good place to start. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The banks are less than thrilled about calls for them to share the most lucrative data they hold.  Your data, you see, has become a hot commodity in the financial world. Why shouldn't you be able to get value out of it? Banks have always known huge amounts about their customers. But the online revolution means this data is now being sought by a new wave of financial technology, or "fintech" businesses, who also want to lend you money or provide you with a transaction account. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link NAB and ANZ Bank have said they'd support consumers having more access to their data. Photo: Glenn Hunt Aside from their (recently tarnished) reputations, banks' data is one of the biggest advantages they have against these upstarts. In Britain, the government wants to even the playing field. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Your data has become a hot commodity in the financial world. Photo: Bloomberg In what it calls an "open banking revolution", big British lenders have been given until 2018 to comply with a system that would allow customers to easily "share" their bank account histories with rival banks, in search of a better deal. It's being done in a way that means no one's passwords would be released, nor would private financial material without the customer's permission. And guess why Britain went down this path: it said the older established banks weren't competing hard enough in a market they dominated. Sound familiar? After the Australian banks failed to match official interest rate cuts last August, politicians and regulators here took notice. A parliamentary inquiry into banks that Malcolm Turnbull ordered that month said the local banks should be forced into a similar scheme by 2018. Why would that help? You can see why the banks' rivals want to get their hands on the data. But economics suggest consumers end up ahead if corporations give people access to the data they hold on them, especially in a concentrated market like banking, where about 80 per cent of home loans are with the big four. One benefit of data sharing is it could make it easier to dump your bank if you weren't happy with its performance – something very few of us do today, possibly because of the hassles involved. Data sharing could mean being able to change banks without needing to hand over piles of documents to prove your identity, because your existing bank would have to pass this information on. If smaller rival banks could easily get electronic files showing your income and spending, they'd also be better placed to offer you a competitive interest rate on your mortgage. Big data can even help deter consumers from making financial decisions that only really serve to enrich bank shareholders, like paying sky-high interest rates of 20 per cent or higher on credit cards. The inquiry describes an online program that would tell people – based on their financial history – whether they really should sign up for that platinum rewards credit card, or if a no-frills card with a lower rate might make more sense for them. As you'd expect, the banks are less than thrilled about calls for them to share the most lucrative data they hold. National Australia Bank and ANZ told a Productivity Commission inquiry in this area they'd support consumers having more access to their data, but have also raised concerns about their commercial interests. But for a Prime Minister who loves talking about innovation and has a political problem with the banks, adopting this recommendation could make a lot of sense.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 18 January 2017 What’s disrupting equity research by risen jayaseelan IT does seem as if the equity research world is going through an existential crisis. A plethora of issues are impacting the industry. Regulatory and technology-driven changes are among them. The industry faces new research payment unbundling rules under the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). Under MiFID II, investment research must be tailor-made for each institution. Fund managers will have to pay for research either from their own money or through a separate account which is then billed to the end-client. Crucially, research fees will have to be separated from execution and trading fees. The new rules are aimed at improving transparency in financial markets. MiFID II is being implemented in the European Union, but it is speculated that this trend will creep into markets globally due to competitive issues – brokerages will have to follow suit to win business from asset managers and their end-investors. The impact to the industry could be significant. Clients will soon start questioning the cost of research and may opt out of that service from brokerages in favour of smaller independent research outfits. Consider the case of Societe Generale. Late last year, the European financial group said it would use Singapore-based fintech company Smartkarma to provide third-party Asian equity research to its institutional clients. Smartkarma provides a pool of aggregated independent research. It provides users access to more than a hundred independent analysts. And similar to popular film-streaming website Netflix, Smartkarma allows users to search for specific content and consume it on-demand. The model allows investors greater control over the research production process, SmartKarma says. In a 2015 report by Slator on the impact of economic, digital, and regulatory changes on the equity research industry, it quoted a hedge fund manager as saying: “How do you price something that has been free for 40 years?” The report highlighted that global equity research budgets would have shrunk from US$8.2bil in 2007 to US$3.4bil in 2017, the result of lower trading volumes caused by post-financial crisis industry deleveraging; fierce competition from electronic trading automation and the rise of passive investing with exchange-traded fund (ETF) products rather than direct equity ownership. Still on the subject of equity research, it is interesting to follow the recent saga involving JPMorgan and Indonesia. In November, JPMorgan’s Asia-Pacific equity strategists dropped Indonesia’s equity rating outlook two notches to underweight. In retaliation, the Indonesian government cut some ties with JPMorgan, including ceasing to use it as a primary bond dealer and revoking a special designation that allows the investment bank to perform certain banking functions. Indonesian government officials said JPMorgan’s November report “did not make sense” because it gave better recommendations for equities of other emerging economies that Indonesia argued were not doing better than its economy, South-East Asia’s largest, Reuters had reported. That was in January. Interestingly, on Monday, JPMorgan equity research reversed its view on Indonesia. It upgraded its investment recommendation on Indonesian stocks to “neutral” from “underweight”. JPMorgan’s equities research team wrote on Monday that in the month after Donald Trump’s surprise victory, funds sold large amount of emerging markets’ bonds and equities which it estimated at US$15bil each. “Redemption and bond volatility risks have now played out, in our view. Bond volatility should now decay, allowing us to partially reverse November’s tactical moves including upgrading Indonesia to neutral,” according to a note sent to clients, Reuters reported. JPMorgan said in its latest report that “Indonesia’s macro fundamentals are strong, with high potential growth rate and low debt/GDP with economic reform. Within Asia, it was the biggest beneficiary of bond inflows”. There is no proof to show that the research finding had anything to do with any other factors other than its own research team’s fundamental findings. However, for years now, there has been chatter that the “china wall” built to separate functions within banking groups such as its research side and its investment banking deal-making side, has been porous. Meaning that there are those who believe that the research is somewhat biased in support of some of the deal-making side of the business which brings in tonnes of money in fees. Notably, markets in Asia remain a lucrative one for international banks, especially those that get the plum jobs of advising Governments, whether it be in asset or bond sales or in drawing up economic and financial market policy. It remains to be seen how equity research will go through the changes impacting it.

Ricardo Hill, 38, entered his plea in Manhattan federal court to seven counts, including conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, wire fraud and bank fraud. The Brandon, Florida-resident is one of nine people to face charges following an investigation connected to a data breach that JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 involving records for more than 83 million accounts. The charges against Hill stemmed from his employment as a finance support manager and business development consultant for an unlicensed bitcoin exchange called Coin.mx, according to court papers. Prosecutors have said Coin.mx was operated by another Florida man, Anthony Murgio, from 2013 to 2015 and exchanged millions of dollars into bitcoin while operating through several fronts, including one called "Collectables Club." Prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli who with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron orchestrated cyber attacks on companies including JPMorgan that resulted in more than 100 million people's information being stolen. Prosecutors said the men carried out the cybercrimes to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with sham promotional emails. Aaron was deported from Russia in December and taken into U.S. custody, while Shalon and Orenstein were extradited from Israel in June. All three have pleaded not guilty. Murgio, who like Hill was not accused of engaging in the hacking scheme, pleaded guilty on Jan. 9 to charges that included conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Five other individuals have been charged in connection with Coin.mx, including Murgio's father. Two individuals linked to it are scheduled to face trial on Feb. 6. The case is U.S. v. Murgio et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-769.

(QCOM), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Arista Networks Inc (ANET) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks JPM, ANET and QCOM stock got the new trading week started on the wrong foot By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Jan 17, 2017, 4:47 pm EST     Popular Posts: 10 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are SOMEHOW Still Bargains Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings Preview Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Building an AI Monster Recent Posts: Why Starbucks Corporation (SBUX), Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL) and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Holders: This Chart Should Have You Asking Questions Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Whiffs on Earnings, But Here’s the Bright Side View All Posts The bears were in charge from the get-go on Tuesday, never letting any of the major indices into positive territory for the session. When it became clear the bulls were fighting a losing battle by mid-day though, the buyers largely threw in the towel. The S&P 500’s close of 2,267.89 was 0.30% less than Friday’s final trade. Leading the bearish charge today were Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). Each was driven lower by news, with most of the selling spurred one way or another by legal trouble. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) It was a rough day for banks as a whole, with the group’s profit-takers coming out of the woodwork on the heels of market weakness. JPMorgan Chase largely led the way though, with JPM losing 3.5% of its value following a key downgrade. KBW analysts Brian Kleinhanzl and Michael Brown did the deed, downgrading JPM to “Market Perform,” explaining: “We continue to believe that JPMorgan is a high-quality bank but our outperform thesis for JPM focused on the potential to improve returns and we believe the current share price captures that return improvement JPM could achieve in the near term … There is a possibility that a new expense save program could be announced at the upcoming investor day but it is difficult to remain Outperform on the hope for an expense save announcement.” Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) On the precipice of another wave of bullishness, the rug got pulled out from underneath Qualcomm investors today. On Tuesday, the Department of Justice reported it was preparing a suit against the mobile phone technology maker, claiming it was unfairly and unreasonably requiring licensing fees for technology used in most mobile phones. The potential suit is founded on an ongoing investigation from the Federal Trade Commission, which has been investigating the company for several years now. The FTC is specifically trying to determine if QCOM is essentially capitalizing on a monopoly by charging fees on equipment that meets the industry standards it also dictates. The heart of the impending litigation will be the precise definition of “reasonable and non-discriminatory”… terms that are supposed to serve as the standard of fairness among technology companies. QCOM ended the day down 4%. Arista Networks Inc (ANET) Finally, although the fight has been brewing for months, the legal battle between Arista Networks and networking giant Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) sparked a particularly adverse development for the smaller outfit, sending ANET to a loss of 12% for the session. That development? Late Friday, the U.S. Customs department reinstated a ban on the import of Arista routers that may — as Cisco claims — be in violation of U.S. patent laws. The agency had lifted the ban in November, suggesting the legal battle had taken a positive turn in favor of ANET shareholders. Now, though, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Agency is publicly questioning its decision to lift the ban before the matter had been settled in court. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Related Content Inequality, jobless youth and social media: a combustible mix for 2017 Trump team to shun Davos meeting of world's economic elite The Chinese president called on the world's business and political elite to address the problems of globalisation, without turning away from economic trends that have fuelled decades of growth. Leaders should address the excesses of growth, such as growing wealth gaps, while embracing new industries and innovation, he said. "There is no point in blaming economic globalisation for the world's problems because that is simply not the case," Xi said "And that will not help to solve the problems." Advertisement "The history of mankind has shown us that problems are not to be feared," Xi said. "What should concern us is the refusal to face up to the problems." The world's second-largest economy represents a bastion of consistency to Davos attendees facing a string of European elections - in France, the Netherlands, Germany and possibly Italy - after the twin shocks of Trump's victory and the UK's Brexit vote. Such "extreme weather events" topped the list of most likely risks in the forum's annual survey this year.

China set high expectations for Xi's speech, which one top diplomat said would provide a "blueprint for the future progress of human society."

More videos Davos kicks off as Trump era dawns Anxiety about the uncertainty surrounding the US presidency of Donald Trump is set to dominate discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The Ipsos survey of 16,069 adults in 22 countries paints a global picture of widespread resentment of the rich and powerful, distrust of traditional politics and pessimism about the future. And Australians are very much in tune with these sentiments, the research reveals - despite attempts by Australian politicians to distance Australian populism from the populist backlash around the world.  Related Content The world's most (and least) free and tolerant countries named More than 70 per cent of Australians believe the nation "needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful" and nearly half believe "to fix the country, we need a strong leader willing to break the rules", the survey found. Over two-thirds (68 per cent) believe "the economy is rigged to the advantage of the rich and powerful" and 61 per cent believe "traditional parties and politicians don't care about people like me". Advertisement Notably, Australians were more likely than most around the world to want a strong leader to take the country back, with 71 per cent of Australian respondents supporting this statement, compared with 69 per cent in the US, 67 per cent in Great Britain and 63 per cent globally.

Sixty per cent believe that "experts in this country don't understand the lives of people like me", according to the survey.   It's a sign that Trump's America and the wave of resentment he rode to the White House may be closer to home than we think, experts say. "We should be concerned," said Carol Johnson, Professor of Politics and International Studies at the University of Adelaide. "If there's anything we can learn from Trump's victory and from Brexit, it's that these forces can emerge far more quickly than mainstream politicians and commentators expect."   While previous surveys have shown some dissatisfaction with traditional politics, these latest findings come at a time of declining primary votes for both Australia's major parties, she said. "While there has been distrust before, these are very high figures," Professor Johnson said. "I think they are a sign that in economic policy in particular the major parties need to think about whether they have been adequately addressing the concerns of voters."   Globally, 69 per cent believed the economy was rigged to favour the elite, 57 per cent of people believed their country was in decline and 43 per cent believed their lives would be worse than their parents', the Ipsos survey found. Ipsos Social Research Institute director David Elliott said recent political events had galvanised populist forces across the globe. "There is growing discontent and with things like Brexit and Trump, people holding similar views feel more confident to speak out about it," Ipsos Social Research Institute director David Elliott said.   "[In Australia] the increase of support for Pauline Hanson and her party in the previous election certainly supports that." While Australia was on par with, or very close to, the global average for most of the survey's questions, Australians emerged as more likely than most to support closing the door on globalisation. More than 30 per cent of Australians see foreign business and trade as a threat, compared with 26 per cent globally, while 37 per cent believed we should protect ourselves from the world, compared with 31 per cent globally.   Mr Elliott said Australian political discourse had focused heavily on immigration and refugees in recent years, often linking these issues with terrorism. "As we get more fearful of what might be coming to our shores, I think it's a natural reaction for people to want to huddle in and close the doors to the outside world," he said. Professor Johnson said the major parties would find these results "very concerning".   "Especially the Liberal Party, given that Malcolm Turnbull is a very strong supporter of globalisation and free trade," she said. "Both parties will be very worried that this anti-globalisation sentiment will encourage parties like One Nation, who have such a strong anti-globalisation stand." Professor Johnson said these sentiments were "fertile ground for the growth of right-wing populism", which often tried to tie the belief that elites haven't been pursuing the economic interests of ordinary workers to the idea that immigrants are getting more than their fair share.   However, she pointed out that it was not clear how respondents had interpreted the survey's questions and anti-elite, anti-establishment discontent could include people with either left-wing or right-wing political views. One bright spot in the survey found Australians were slightly less pessimistic than most people around the world. While half of Australian respondents believed their country was in decline, this was below the global average of 57 per cent and significantly lower than in countries such as the US (60 per cent), Spain (69 per cent) and South Africa (77 per cent). Similarly, 38 per cent of Australians said they felt their generation would have a worse life than their parents' generation, compared with 43 per cent globally and 47 per cent in the US. Ipsos surveyed more than 1000 Australians in October and November 2016, and weighted the results to reflect the general population.

Ogg January 17, 2017 9:05 am EST Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated to open lower on Tuesday after a three-day weekend. Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average not yet cracking the elusive 20,000 mark, there is a path for the 21,422 Dow in late 2017 or the start of 2018. The two themes that have remained are post-election market strength followed by investors wanting to buy pullbacks. The notion that this bull market is about eight years old and that valuations remain high just has not mattered. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst reports each day of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, while some others cover stocks to sell or to avoid.

(NYSE: CMG) to Neutral from Overweight, as the stock has sustained at levels above its $375 price target. Furthermore, the brokerage is bearish on the casual dining sector. “While we do think it's interesting to see the company be more operationally focused and technologically current, we believe we are capturing much of this improvement in both our current and out year estimates,” analyst John Ivankoe wrote in a note. Skepticism Remains The analyst is skeptical whether the improved operations have been or will be met with additional demand in an increasingly competitive restaurant landscape. However, Ivankoe still believes mid-$300s represents an attractive entry point for Chipotle shares, which closed Friday’s trading at $410.75. The analyst said Chipotle would need a F20 AUV and restaurant margin of $2.2 million and 23.4 –24.1 percent to achieve 10 percent–15 percent plus upside from current levels. Ivankoe also noted Chipotle is likely to benefit from corporate tax reform, but such reforms may be significantly delayed. The Fast-Casual Restaurant Sector On the sector front, the analyst said the supply is continuing to outpace demand coupled with headwinds from labor and commodities. Wall Street is mixed on the prospects of Chipotle, with some saying the company is primed for turnaround, while others say there is limited visibility in to sales and margins. In this scenario, Ivankoe prefers Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) closer to $55, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) near $120 and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM) in the low-$60s as lower risk ideas.

The study of 3800 people aged 18 to 29 from across the country is the first to investigate the prevalence of unpaid work in Australia and suggests it is becoming a pervasive norm in an increasingly competitive labour market.

More videos An eight hour shift without pay Frances Johns worked an eight hour trial shift finishing at 1am not knowing she wouldn't be paid. Unpaid work experience now extends beyond traditional student placements in medicine, nursing and teaching to all areas across the workforce, including law, finance, creative arts, retail and hospitality. The study findings have been released as the federal government prepares to introduce 120,000 internship placements over four years from this year as part of its Youth Jobs PaTH youth employment program. The University of Sydney is also planning to make work experience compulsory for all undergraduate students from next year.

While one in four people doing unpaid work experience were offered a job and many were highly satisfied with the experience they gained, the study said it was unclear if unpaid work improved a person's chances of getting a job. Commissioned by the Federal Department of Employment, the study found 58 per cent of people aged 18 to 29 had done unpaid work experience in the past five years. It estimated a third of Australians aged 18-64 had done some unpaid work. Advertisement The researchers from the University of Technology Sydney, Queensland University of Technology and University of Adelaide raised concerns about the need to improve access to work experience for young people from poorer backgrounds or in regional areas.   "There's a great degree of willingness from young people to participate in internships," lead study author Damian Oliver from the UTS business school said. "The challenge is ensuring that those who struggle to afford an unpaid placement aren't excluded from employment opportunities." Costs mount The study showed that many young people had to pay for their own insurance, travel, equipment and other costs to secure an internship. It found those from poor backgrounds were less likely to participate in an unpaid internship. Professions, including law, finance and journalism, had been generally dominated by people from privileged backgrounds because social networks promoted job opportunities and because wealthy families could afford to support their children while they did work experience, the researchers said. If I'd known it was a trial shift I wouldn't have stayed as long as I did. Frances Johns Young adults living in a capital city were more likely to have done internships or other work experience placements than those in regional areas. Men were more likely to participate than women.   Paula McDonald from the Queensland University of Technology said, if unpaid work continued to expand as an essential prerequisite for getting a job, it could contribute to higher levels of social and economic inequality. Study co-author Andrew Stewart from the University of Adelaide law school said, while internships could provide a useful bridge between education and work, the more common they became, "the more important it is to ensure that they are properly managed and regulated". About half of unpaid work experiences were connected to a formal tertiary, high school or vocational education or training. Unsupervised training But 43 per cent were outside the supervision of any formal education or training system. This included the 13 per cent of people surveyed who had done an unpaid work trial or unpaid training or work orientation. Professor Stewart said it was OK for a prospective barista to be asked to demonstrate they could make a cup of coffee, but an unpaid trial that lasted for days could be illegal. Fairfax Media recently reported on Wollongong University students doing several days of unpaid work as part of a job trial at many local restaurants and cafes.   Frances Johns, 21, worked an 8½ hour shift on a Sunday night at the Bella Portofino function centre in February last year in the hope of getting a permanent job. "We were serving food and drinks and cleaning up," she said. "It was flat out the entire time. "At the end we had to pack up the event and put chairs and tables aside and clean up the decorations. "If I'd known it was a trial shift I wouldn't have stayed as long as I did." The national study found 8 per cent of young adults it surveyed were doing unpaid work as part of requirements for youth allowance or welfare payments. More than a third said their unpaid work experience lasted more than a month. A similar number said they had only participated in one episode. One in five said they had taken part in five or more episodes in the past five years. The study did not include volunteering work for organisations such as a church, charity or club. 113 comments Comment are now closed Sort comments by Oldest Newest Advertisement HuffPost Australia This Man Took Out A Bank Loan To Pay ...

The survey of 1379 CEOs from 79 countries carried out in the last four months of 2016 shows 77 per cent are concerned about skill shortages - more than double the number when the poll was first taken 20 years ago. Skill shortages has been one of the fastest growing concerns since 2015, when it troubled 73 per cent of CEOs. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link CEOs are worried about finding staff with science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills.  Photo: Louie Douvis Fears over skills were most acute among CEOs in Africa (80 per cent) and the Asia Pacific (82 per cent).  The number of business leaders who expected to increase their staff headcount over the next 12 months grew from 48 per cent in 2016 to 52 per cent, while 16 per cent expected to cut staff, overwhelmingly due to technology and automation making jobs obsolete.  Advertisement Creativity and innovation, leadership, and emotional intelligence were the most sought after skills, PwC found, while over half of CEOs had issues recruiting workers with digital and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) skills.  "CEOs are concerned that key skill shortages will impair their company's growth potential, relevance and sustainability," PwC's global chairman Bob Moritz said.   SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link PwC's CEO survey is in its 20th year.  Photo: Ryan Stuart "And it's soft skills that they value the most. Innovation and relationship skills can't be coded. So to drive the change CEOs need... a balance between technology and irreplaceable skills in their people is key."  Uncertain economic growth (82 per cent) and over-regulation (80 per cent) rounded out the top-three threats to business, followed by geopolitical uncertainty (74 per cent) and speed of technological change (70 per cent).  Despite a volatile year including the shock Brexit vote and the surprise election of Donald Trump to the White House on a populist and anti-trade platform, CEOs were more confident about their businesses than a year ago, with 38 per cent "very confident" about their growth prospects over the next 12 months. Last year 35 per cent felt that way, but the figure still languishes below pre-GFC highs of 52 per cent in 2006.  Twenty-nine per cent of CEOs thought global economic growth would pick up in 2017, up from 27 per cent a year earlier.  "Despite a tumultuous 2016, CEO confidence is moving back up – albeit slowly and still a long way from the levels we saw back in 2007," Mr Moritz said.  "But there are signs of optimism right across the globe, including in the UK and US, where despite predictions of a Trump slump and a Brexit exit, CEOs confidence in their company's growth are up from 2016. And that mood is reflected elsewhere, with more CEOs across the world targeting the US and UK for investment than a year ago."  Also keeping CEOs awake at night is the challenge of gaining and keeping people's trust in a digital-driven world (69 per cent) and the risks of data privacy and ethics issues (91 per cent).  Meanwhile CEOs are becoming more sceptical about globalisation's ability to close the gap between the rich and poor and to mitigate climate change, but were still out of step with an even more sceptical public.   "Public discontent has the potential to erode trust which is needed for long term sustainable performance," Mr Moritz said while calling for CEO's to forge "deeper, two-way relationship with stakeholders, customers, employees, and the public".  "There's a lot at stake if we do not achieve inclusive global growth," he said.  Advertisement HuffPost Australia This Man Took Out A Bank Loan To Pay ...

Indonesia cut its business ties with JPMorgan after the US investment bank downgraded its recommendation on Indonesian stocks to “underweight” from “overweight” in a research report issued after the US presidential election. Government officials said JPMorgan’s November report “did not make sense” because it gave better recommendations for equities of other emerging economies that Indonesia argued were not doing better than its economy, Southeast Asia’s largest. JPMorgan’s equities research team wrote today that in the month after Donald Trump’s surprise victory, funds sold large amount of emerging markets’ bonds and equities which it estimated at US$15 billion each. “Redemption and bond volatility risks have now played out, in our view. Bond volatility should now decay allowing us to partially reverse November’s tactical moves including upgrading Indonesia to neutral,” according to the note sent to clients and seen by Reuters. “Indonesia’s macro fundamentals are strong, with high potential growth rate and low debt/GDP with economic reform. Within Asia it was the biggest beneficiary of bond inflows,” the bank said, adding that better motorcycle sales data also supported its upgrade. JPMorgan said it remained concerned about volatility in the first half of 2017 and “manages risk with a neutral call”. When asked about JPMorgan’s upgrade, Indonesia’s Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said “it’s good”, without elaborating. Responding to the upgrade, Indonesia’s central bank governor Agus Martowardojo said 2017 will be a year of recovery for Indonesian corporates, banks and fiscal spending, while 2016 was a year of consolidation. Indonesia’s main benchmark index has dipped so far this year after gaining more than 15 per cent in 2016. After JPMorgan’s November downgrade, Indonesia’s finance ministry dropped the bank’s services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to global markets. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. The ministry then issued new rules that require all primary bond dealers — banks and securities appointed to buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market — to “safeguard” their partnership with the government and avoid conflict of interest. JPMorgan did not mention the government’s sanction in the note it published today. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Wall Street slips after soft GDP data, earnings Stocks slip on earnings, data; dollar advances Microsoft’s market value tops US$500b again after 17 years US economy posts slowest growth since 2011 Ringgit ends lower against US dollar Trump pulls US out of Pacific trade deal, loosening Asia ties (VIDEO) US dollar slides near seven-week lows on fading Trump trade Saudi Aramco shelves plans for RAPID venture with Petronas, source says Ringgit to trade softer against US dollar next week At some Singapore suburban malls, retailers confront the sound of silence Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Alexa versus Siri Reutes Video: Miss Universe’s preliminary show starts in Manila Reuters Video: Ryan Gosling brings ‘La La Land’ to Tokyo Reuters Video: Mexicans build makeshift wall around US embassy in Trump protest Reuters Video: President Trump, Melania share 'first dance' Reuters Video: Marketing experts on how best to spend money, time, energy in 2017 Related Articles Indonesia’s worried about market ‘psychology’ with JPMorgan report JPMorgan boosts CEO Dimon’s annual pay 3.7pc to US$28m Major US banks post strong 2016 earnings Trump rally makes stock options great again for some CEOs Indonesia bars JPMorgan from next dollar sukuk issuance, says official Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

"This positive feeling is likely to help the broader Australian market in the short term and we'll get a price-to-earnings increase in the banks, " says Paul Taylor, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Australian Equities fund. "But that valuation-driven sentiment can only take you so far. You really need those underlying earnings of our companies need to come through, though I don't expect a huge divergence from the US market." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link  Photo: Daniel Munoz US earnings season kicks off Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all reported strong results and in response investors lifted their share prices to multi-year highs. "US financials have had a very good run post-election," says Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advertisement "The data we've gotten from the big banks has been very good and we do expect this sector to post strong earnings mostly due to the rising interest rate environment." While American banks are looking to the prospect of more expensive debt, Australian banks, which begin reporting in February, are likely to keep growing slowly as lending growth remains constrained, with limited expansion in interest margins and some bad debts on the books. "There are still headwinds for the banks, but generally they'll be okay," says Mr Taylor. "There's not a lot of growth, maybe mid-single digit growth, but investors will see that as a reasonable job." In a note to clients on Monday, Deutsche Bank suggests Australia's major banks are now cheaper than a selection of offshore banks, excluding Asia and UK banks, on a 12 month forward per-share basis. "Overall they provide a much better forward yield," says Andrew Triggs, research analyst at Deutsche Bank. Mr Trigg's and his team calculate the average 12 month forward dividend yield for the big four banks is 5.5 per cent, now well below the 5-year average of 6.2 per cent. "On a relative basis the sector still looks attractive against other interest-rate sensitive sectors," he says. Eyes on miners Barring an upset for the banks, the ASX is likely to stay elevated but Mr Taylor points to the resources stocks as the engine behind the positive momentum. A solid turnaround in commodity prices could see some reasonably strong cash flow generated from Australian resource companies which could lead to a solid earnings season. "Miners will be the companies that will keep us going," says Mr Taylor. "What will be interesting to see is whether that has flowed through to mining contractors and manufacturers."

Oscar Nominees' Parent Media Companies Watch These 10 Huge Call Purchases In Wednesday Trade Looking at parks and films, Piper Jaffray gives Disney a boost (Seeking Alpha) It’s only mid-January, but Loop Capital is already looking ahead to 2018 when it comes to Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS). According to analyst David Miller, 2017 will be a transition year for Disney, but the company should bounce back to solid growth numbers in 2018. Transition Year Followed By A Year Of Growth “With DIS citing F2017 as a ‘transition year’ due to pension expenses, as well as tough comps at both Studio and Consumer Products due to last year’s Star Wars event, we continue to abandon valuing DIS off F2017 and move to F2018 as the more appropriate FY, as that will be the year that the mid/high teens earnings growth which DIS shareholders have enjoyed the past 10 years will likely re-emerge,” Miller explained. Miller isn’t concerned with the relatively weak performance of “Rogue One” in China, and Loop has not adjusted its Q4 studio-specific revenue or EBIT projections. Disney currently has a net debt ratio of only 0.78x compared to an average ratio of 2.36x among Disney’s peers. Some shareholders have been calling for Disney to increase its leverage in-line with its large-cap media peers and use the proceeds for share buybacks. Miller believes it is unlikely management will take this approach. Disney prioritizes its “A” credit ratings and the company prefers to use free cash flow for buybacks rather than debt. Loop Capital maintains a Buy rating on Disney and has raised its price target from $113 to $117.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Money | Tue Jan 17, 2017 | 10:31am EST Despite Dimon's criticism, JPMorgan funds closely track ISS on executive pay JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon speaks at an event at JP Morgan's corporate centre in Bournemouth, southern Britain, June 3, 2016. REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo By Ross Kerber | BOSTON BOSTON JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has been no fan of Institutional Shareholder Services and once called investors "lazy" if they cast votes in corporate elections based on recommendations from the leading proxy adviser or its rival. But JPMorgan itself turns out to be a close follower of ISS, at least when it comes to proxy votes on pay, new data show. JPMorgan funds voted in line with ISS 95 percent of the time when U.S. companies held advisory votes on their executive pay, according to securities filings over a four-year period analyzed by researcher Proxy Insight. That was the highest level of any asset manager at least the size of JPMorgan, which oversees $1.8 trillion. Some investors may see the record as being at odds with Dimon's criticism of the advisers, said Francis Byrd, an independent governance consultant, although proxy voting carries many nuances. "It's as much an art as a science," Byrd said. Proxy Insight's findings, which it provided to Reuters News last week, come amid a debate over whether proxy advisers like ISS wield too much influence over some asset managers who blindly follow their voting recommendations. Proxy Insight found a number of fund managers who voted nearly all the time with ISS on the pay questions. These included ProFund Advisors, which voted with ISS 100 percent of the time; AQR Capital Management, which voted with ISS 99.9 percent of the time; and an arm of Deutsche Bank, which voted with ISS 99.7 percent of the time. Representatives of each of the three declined to comment. In its voting, JPMorgan funds opposed executive pay 10 percent of the time, the research firm found, close to the 12 percent of the time ISS recommended against pay in recent years. Both were more critical of pay than other big fund firms like Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc, which each opposed pay 5 percent of the time. Dimon famously clashed with ISS and its rival Glass Lewis in 2015 after the advisers recommended votes against his own pay and backed an independent chairman. JPMorgan won both votes at its annual meeting that year. (reut.rs/2j968VH) "God knows how any of you can place your vote based on ISS or Glass Lewis," Dimon said at an investor conference shortly afterward. "If you do that you are just irresponsible, I am sorry. And, you probably aren't a very good investor, either," he said. He added that "I know some of you here do it because you are lazy." Dimon has since said he does not believe investors should automatically delegate votes to a proxy adviser, said spokesman Joe Evangelisti. JPMorgan did not make Dimon available, but spokeswoman Kristen Chambers said, "Each and every company vote is carefully reviewed and considered by our portfolio management team, and whether or not that happens to also be the proxy adviser's view may be coincidental." In its voting guidelines, JPMorgan states ISS' work forms "only the 'base case' voting recommendation and we will frequently take a differing view, based on the results of our engagement activity or our own insights." JPMorgan funds followed Glass Lewis' recommendations 84 percent of the time, Proxy Insight found.

Hong/AP Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis poses for photos in his home in Los Angeles on Jan. 10. 1 of 2 By Joyce M. Rosenberg Joyce M. Rosenberg Denton Record-Chronicle AP Business Writer Published: 14 January 2017 08:59 PM NEW YORK — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. “Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it’s not really your money till you pay your taxes,” said Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. “At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped.” Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous’ cash reserves. “Cash is king” is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn’t coming in, and owners can’t get loans or investors, there’s no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they’d have and underestimated expenses, said George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It’s especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. “They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement [contracts] for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy,” Solomon said. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. “The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks,” JPMorgan Chase said. Romis said his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he’s willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company’s more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company’s busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The three-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company’s cash position. “If everything went south, we’d probably have enough cash for two or three months,” he said. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They’ve given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They’ve also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that’s a sign of trouble to Basilo — they’re not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. “That’s how they think when they start their business. They’re very unprepared,” he said. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores’ down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor’s ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don’t want to tap them for cash flow. “We pretend that the savings doesn’t exist,” Dan Robinson said. Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

The bank's analysts raised their "tactical" view of Indonesian equities one level to "neutral" in a report dated yesterday, saying volatility in emerging-market bonds following Mr Donald Trump's US election victory in November should now subside. The upgrade came two weeks after Indonesia's government cut business ties with JPMorgan, citing a two-notch equities downgrade by the bank in November. "Our tactical downgrade two months ago was driven by the risk of Indonesia underperforming the Asia-Pacific ex Japan and EM indices as investors de-risked," analysts said. "Redemption and bond volatility risks have now played out, in our view." Indonesia welcomed the bank's new assessment. The neutral recommendation is more in line with fundamentals, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Darmin Nasution told reporters yesterday. The finance ministry had earlier said it would stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and an underwriter for sovereign bonds. When asked about JPMorgan's upgrade, Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said "it's good", without elaborating. RISKS HAVE 'PLAYED OUT' Our tactical downgrade two months ago was driven by the risk of Indonesia underperforming the Asia-Pacific ex Japan and EM indices as investors de-risked... Redemption and bond volatility risks have now played out, in our view. JPMORGAN ANALYSTS, on the upgrade of its assessment of Indonesia's stock market. JPMorgan said in an e-mail that its research views are independent and yesterday's report, like previous ones, "is no different". Foreign investors sold a net US$2.8 billion (S$4 billion) of Indonesian stocks and bonds in the last quarter as emerging-market assets retreated following Mr Trump's victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policymakers to intervene to stabilise the currency. Last week, Indonesia widened its campaign against negative research by ordering all primary dealers in Indonesian bonds to maintain relations with the government "based on professionalism, integrity and avoiding conflicts of interest". Firms that fail to comply with the rule, which took effect on Dec 30, risk losing their dealership licences, the government said. Global banks that are primary dealers in Indonesia's bonds include Standard Chartered, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup.

(CMG), Noble Energy, Inc. (NBL) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) CMG downgraded, NBL makes another acquisition and WFC announces new branch closings Jan 17, 2017, 8:55 am EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     View All   U.S. markets will get back up to speed today after a long holiday weekend. But the shortened week will still be an interesting week, as earnings season will kick into high gear before it’s all punctuated by President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Friday. As we head into Tuesday’s trading day, investors and traders should have their eyes on a few stocks, including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NBL) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC). Here’s what you should know: Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) CMG shares are sliding this morning on another downgrade — this time from JPMorgan’s John Ivankoe. The note wasn’t terribly-heavy handed, with the main criticism being that much of Chipotle’s potential improvement is already factored into JPMorgan’s price target of $375. Instead, the analyst chose to downgrade CMG’s rating from “Overweight” to “Neutral.” Per Ivankoe: “We value CMG at 26x our F20 EPS of $16.54, discount back 2 years at a 10% cost of equity, and add F19 ending cash per share for our Dec-17 price target of $375. CMG will likely be a beneficiary from corporate tax reform (~23% accretion from using a lower tax rate of 24% vs our modeled F20 rate of 38%) implying a ~22x target P/E multiple on a PF F20 EPS of ~$20+.” Chipotle has actually been putting in a series of higher lows and higher highs since January. However, today’s news and subsequent 1%-plus dip threatens to pull CMG shares off their current perch of around $410, where they’ve been battling to break above the 200-day moving average. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) Wells Fargo’s issues continue as the mega-bank announced it will shut down more than 400 branches over the next two years. WFC has been embroiled in scandal after the bank opened more than two million fraudulent accounts in customers’ names — an episode that led to Wells Fargo paying $185 million in fines and that cost CEO John G. Stumpf his job. New CEO Timothy J. Sloan is now tasked with doing damage control and making the necessary adjustments to regain the trust of its customers. Wells previously was considered one of the cleanest of America’s large banks. Now, however, it’s wracked by a plunge in new account openings. The restructuring plan should save about $2 billion in costs by the end of 2018. Wells Fargo already shut down 84 stores last year, most of which closed in the second half of 2016.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:10 PM, January 17, 2017 Updated: 11:50 PM, January 17, 2017 BOSTON - JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has been no fan of Institutional Shareholder Services and once called investors "lazy" if they cast votes in corporate elections based on recommendations from the leading proxy adviser or its rival. But JPMorgan itself turns out to be a close follower of ISS, at least when it comes to proxy votes on pay, new data show. JPMorgan funds voted in line with ISS 95 percent of the time when U.S. companies held advisory votes on their executive pay, according to securities filings over a four-year period analyzed by researcher Proxy Insight. That was the highest level of any asset manager at least the size of JPMorgan, which oversees $1.8 trillion. Some investors may see the record as being at odds with Dimon's criticism of the advisers, said Francis Byrd, an independent governance consultant, although proxy voting carries many nuances. "It's as much an art as a science," Byrd said. Proxy Insight's findings, which it provided to Reuters News last week, come amid a debate over whether proxy advisers like ISS wield too much influence over some asset managers who blindly follow their voting recommendations. Proxy Insight found a number of fund managers who voted nearly all the time with ISS on the pay questions. These included ProFund Advisors, which voted with ISS 100 percent of the time; AQR Capital Management, which voted with ISS 99.9 percent of the time; and an arm of Deutsche Bank, which voted with ISS 99.7 percent of the time. Representatives of each of the three declined to comment. In its voting, JPMorgan funds opposed executive pay 10 percent of the time, the research firm found, close to the 12 percent of the time ISS recommended against pay in recent years. Both were more critical of pay than other big fund firms like Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc, which each opposed pay 5 percent of the time. Dimon famously clashed with ISS and its rival Glass Lewis in 2015 after the advisers recommended votes against his own pay and backed an independent chairman. JPMorgan won both votes at its annual meeting that year. (http://reut.rs/2j968VH) "God knows how any of you can place your vote based on ISS or Glass Lewis," Dimon said at an investor conference shortly afterward. "If you do that you are just irresponsible, I am sorry. And, you probably aren't a very good investor, either," he said. He added that "I know some of you here do it because you are lazy." Dimon has since said he does not believe investors should automatically delegate votes to a proxy adviser, said spokesman Joe Evangelisti. JPMorgan did not make Dimon available, but spokeswoman Kristen Chambers said, "Each and every company vote is carefully reviewed and considered by our portfolio management team, and whether or not that happens to also be the proxy adviser's view may be coincidental." In its voting guidelines, JPMorgan states ISS' work forms "only the 'base case' voting recommendation and we will frequently take a differing view, based on the results of our engagement activity or our own insights." JPMorgan funds followed Glass Lewis' recommendations 84 percent of the time, Proxy Insight found.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A BOSTON: JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has been no fan of Institutional Shareholder Services and once called investors "lazy" if they cast votes in corporate elections based on recommendations from the leading proxy adviser or its rival. But JPMorgan itself turns out to be a close follower of ISS, at least when it comes to proxy votes on pay, new data show. JPMorgan funds voted in line with ISS 95 percent of the time when U.S. companies held advisory votes on their executive pay, according to securities filings over a four-year period analyzed by researcher Proxy Insight. That was the highest level of any asset manager at least the size of JPMorgan, which oversees US$1.8 trillion. Some investors may see the record as being at odds with Dimon's criticism of the advisers, said Francis Byrd, an independent governance consultant, although proxy voting carries many nuances. "It's as much an art as a science," Byrd said. Proxy Insight's findings, which it provided to Reuters News last week, come amid a debate over whether proxy advisers like ISS wield too much influence over some asset managers who blindly follow their voting recommendations. Proxy Insight found a number of fund managers who voted nearly all the time with ISS on the pay questions. These included ProFund Advisors, which voted with ISS 100 percent of the time; AQR Capital Management, which voted with ISS 99.9 percent of the time; and an arm of Deutsche Bank, which voted with ISS 99.7 percent of the time. Representatives of each of the three declined to comment. In its voting, JPMorgan funds opposed executive pay 10 percent of the time, the research firm found, close to the 12 percent of the time ISS recommended against pay in recent years. Both were more critical of pay than other big fund firms like Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc, which each opposed pay 5 percent of the time. Dimon famously clashed with ISS and its rival Glass Lewis in 2015 after the advisers recommended votes against his own pay and backed an independent chairman. JPMorgan won both votes at its annual meeting that year. (http://reut.rs/2j968VH) "God knows how any of you can place your vote based on ISS or Glass Lewis," Dimon said at an investor conference shortly afterward. "If you do that you are just irresponsible, I am sorry. And, you probably aren't a very good investor, either," he said. He added that "I know some of you here do it because you are lazy." Dimon has since said he does not believe investors should automatically delegate votes to a proxy adviser, said spokesman Joe Evangelisti. JPMorgan did not make Dimon available, but spokeswoman Kristen Chambers said, "Each and every company vote is carefully reviewed and considered by our portfolio management team, and whether or not that happens to also be the proxy adviser's view may be coincidental." In its voting guidelines, JPMorgan states ISS' work forms "only the 'base case' voting recommendation and we will frequently take a differing view, based on the results of our engagement activity or our own insights." JPMorgan funds followed Glass Lewis' recommendations 84 percent of the time, Proxy Insight found.

The speech will attempt to set out 12 priorities for Brexit negotiations — such as control over immigration and removing Britain from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. The currency markets moved ahead of the speech, with traders betting the prime minister would sound a conciliatory tone. Her reluctance to give details on what type of Brexit her government wants has exacerbated currency uncertainty and on Monday prompted sterling to plunge to a 30-year low. A new poll has revealed that voters are critical of Mrs May’s handling of Brexit preparations, with many respondents slating a lack of clarity over her plans. (FT, Guardian, Independent) © Reuters In the news China’s not-so-independent judges The president of China’s supreme court has formally acknowledged that China’s court system is not independent. For good measure Zhou Qiang denounced the concept of judicial independence. Campaigners say the move “totally turns back the wheel of history”. FT) MH370 search ends The underwater search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has ended in failure. In a joint statement, China, Malaysia and Australia said they were suspending the operation without locating the plane. The announcement leaves one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries unsolved almost three years after the aircraft disappeared on a routine trip from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The victims’ families have condemned the move. (FT, BBC) New Tobacco giant British American Tobacco has agreed to acquire a remaining stake in Reynolds American — maker of Camel cigarettes — for $49.4bn in a deal that would create the world’s largest listed tobacco company by sales. The deal would pave the way for further consolidation in the sector, with other large global tobacco groups eager to tap into the US, where low pack prices, a dominant ecigarette market and waning worries about litigation costs are expected to drive growth. (FT) Rolls-Royce bribery deal The maker of jet and marine engines has agreed to pay a £671m fine to the US, UK and Brazilian governments over longstanding corruption allegations. The company’s shares were up almost 7 per cent on the news of the settlement. (WSJ, FT) Europe’s backlash against Trump Europe’s leaders are hitting back at the president-elect after he accused Germany’s Angela Merkel of making a “catastrophic mistake” with her open-door migration policy. The latest salvo came from French finance minister Michel Sapin, who on Tuesday said “the more he [Trump] makes this sort of statement [against Ms Merkel], the more Europeans close ranks”. James Rubin, former assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration, says that by insulting the continent’s most respected leader he may have done her a favour. (Reuters, Politico) Davos briefing Why Davos matters Ten things to watch for, from departing Democrats to the Chinese president’s speech. When the unlikely becomes reality Last year, Gideon Rachman ended his report from Davos, where the business and political elites have mixed since the 1970s, by writing: “It is possible — if still unlikely — that when the WEF gathers this time next year, Mr Trump will be US president and the UK will have voted to leave the EU . . . These developments would turn the Davos world upside down.” Now the world view epitomised by the WEF is under attack as never before, Mr Rachman argues. End of Davos Man? Martin Wolf cautions that the mistakes made by the cheerleaders of global co-operation and economic globalisation are not nearly as bad as those likely to be made by the new populists.

It's a big day for Russia diplomacy Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will deliver his annual press conference, with Syria and sanctions likely to be big topics. Xi Jinping The Chinese president is set to make a keynote address defending globalisation at that bastion of global capitalism, Davos. (NAR) Food for thought It’s time to talk about China The questions surrounding Donald Trump’s relationship with Russia may be lurid and compelling but they could distract us from signs that the Trump administration is heading for a clash with China that could lead to military conflict. (FT) Zika report card Almost a year ago, the World Health Organisation declared the Zika epidemic a global health emergency, calling for an epic campaign against a virus few had ever heard of. The emergency status ended in November, but the consequences will be with us for years. How did we do? Not so well, apparently.

Follow @Asia_G3 Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Jan 16, 2017 11:04 PM EST JPMORGAN CHASE & CO +0.18 At Closing, Jan 27th 86.93 USD Don't leap to conclusions about JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s decision to upgrade its assessment of Indonesia's stock market. The New York-based bank has elevated internal compliance to nuisance levels in Asia since a scandal over its hiring practices in China broke three years ago, people who work at JPMorgan tell me. In such an environment, the Indonesia rating change was probably just what the analysts said it was: a tactical shift. Objectively, the reasons look solid. On Nov. 13, when JPMorgan's equity research team said it was changing its assessment of Indonesian stocks to a "sell," the bank's analysts predicted that emerging markets would suffer outflows and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields would rise. That was a tactical move, or a position that typically can be reversed in a few months, unlike a longer-term, strategic change. Both forecasts proved correct. Exchange-traded funds that focus on Asia excluding Japan lost a net $423 million in the past three months, according to Bloomberg data. The yield on the U.S. bond benchmark peaked on Dec. 15 at 2.6 percent, 45 basis points higher than its 2.15 percent level when JPMorgan decided it was time to reduce exposure to the Jakarta Composite Index. Since Dec. 15, the yield has retreated about 20 basis points. Shifting Direction Treasury yields peaked on Dec. 15 and have dropped 20 basis points since then as "Trumpflation" bets are pared Source: Bloomberg Emerging markets have been receiving more love since the new year started, after what the International Institute of Finance called the worst year for portfolio flows since the 2008 crisis. In the first 16 days of January, a couple of billion dollars have flowed into Asian ETFs, excluding China, Bloomberg data show. The premium to net asset value of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, a good gauge of which way money is going, has been mostly positive in 2017, having been deeply negative after the U.S. election. On the Bright Side Investors have been willing to pay a premium to the holdings of the biggest emerging market ETF since 2017 started, a sign that there's more demand for the asset class Source: Bloomberg So it's easy to see why JPMorgan equity analysts would have changed their views on Indonesia. The bank is hardly alone: The country has been mentioned as one of the darlings for 2017 in every year-ahead outlook meeting I've attended in the past two weeks. The Indonesian government stopped doing business with the U.S. bank after its earlier bearish call. Just to settle the issue, let's consider what JPMorgan was missing out on after it was cut off from bond underwriting for Jakarta. The bank participated in only three large foreign-currency transactions in the country last year, of which only one involved the government. That one, a 3 billion euro ($3.2 billion) sale of seven- and 12-year bonds, was shared with three other institutions. Even assuming the sovereign paid 50 basis points as a fee to the underwriters (a more usual level would be 25 basis points or less), JPMorgan would have made about $4 million. In investment banking, that's not a lot. Debt and equity are separate businesses within the bank, so none of that money is likely to have ended up in the pockets of stock analysts via bonuses. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has very clear and strict rules on analyst independence (explained well in this piece by Bloomberg View's Matt Levine). Having paid $264 million to U.S. regulators to settle the China hiring case in November, JPMorgan was hardly likely to risk another controversy so soon. The Indonesian government, meanwhile, has to make up its mind. Either it wants financial analysts to be independent, and dealings with the country to be “based on professionalism, integrity and avoiding conflicts of interest,” as the finance ministry told banks last week, or it wants everyone to dance to its tune.  If Jakarta keeps meddling, international banks may decide to pull out of the country of their own accord, whether or not they have been banned. As of December, 38 percent of Indonesia's local-currency government bonds were owned by non-residents.

PHOTO: AFP [SINGAPORE] JPMorgan Chase & Co upgraded its assessment of the Indonesian stock market, reversing an earlier bearish call that prompted Jakarta to stop doing business with the US bank. The bank's analysts raised their "tactical" view of Indonesian equities one level to "neutral" in a report dated Monday, saying volatility in emerging-market bonds following Donald Trump's US election victory in November should now subside. The upgrade came two weeks after Indonesia's government cut business ties with JPMorgan, citing a two-notch equities downgrade by the bank in November. "Our tactical downgrade two months ago was driven by the risk of Indonesia underperforming the Asia Pacific ex Japan and EM indices as investors de-risked," analysts led by Adrian Mowat said. "Redemption and bond volatility risks have now played out, in our view." Indonesia welcomed JPMorgan's new assessment. The neutral recommendation is more in line with fundamentals, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Darmin Nasution told reporters in Jakarta on Monday. The finance ministry had earlier said it would stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and an underwriter for sovereign bonds. With its move to punish JPMorgan, Indonesia joined the ranks of emerging-market countries retaliating against analysts which publish negative research. Turkey's banking regulator issued an industrywide warning to avoid negative reports and in 2014, then Brazil President Dilma Rousseff chastised an analyst for suggesting her election would hurt the economy. SEE ALSO: Indonesia IS suspect was finance ministry official JPMorgan's research "is independent and anything published is a result of extensive and objective analysis," the bank said in an e-mail. "Our research views and recommendations on Indonesia are no different." Foreign investors sold a net US$2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as emerging-market assets retreated following Trump's victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policy makers to intervene to stabilise the currency. Indonesian stocks have under-performed wider emerging-market indexes since JPMorgan issued its downgrade on Nov 13. Mr Mowat said in a phone interview that JPMorgan upgraded its view of Indonesian equities due to signs that the rise in US treasury yields has peaked, and that investors are returning to emerging markets. He said the decision to upgrade had nothing to do with the Indonesian government's actions. Last week, Indonesia widened its campaign against negative research by ordering all primary dealers in Indonesian bonds to maintain relations with the government "based on professionalism, integrity and avoiding conflicts of interest." Firms that fail to comply with the rule, which took effect on Dec 30, risk losing their dealership licenses, the government said. Global banks that are primary dealers in Indonesia's bonds include Standard Chartered Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup Inc. JPMorgan's latest move could form the basis of a compromise with the government, since the latest call remains somewhat negative, according to Alan Richardson, an investment manager at Samsung Asset Management in Hong Kong. "A upgrade to neutral from the sell-side implies an upgrade from a hard sell to a soft sell. I would say the neutral recommendation should help to appease the Indonesia government," Mr Richardson said. The new rules published last week state that banks which are suspended as primary dealers have to wait 12 months before reapplying. As well as issuing the new call on Indonesia, JPMorgan's note upgraded equities in Australia and technology stocks in China. The brokerage downgraded Taiwan and Malaysia, and technology stocks in South Korea.

Over the past five years, stock analysts have challenged JPMorgan Chase & Co executives for keeping so many branches open as customers did more and more banking online. Giving up real estate, the analysts said, was an obvious way the bank could save money when interest income was flagging and regulatory and legal costs were climbing. But executives at the largest U.S. bank resisted. They argued that branches are great billboards for the Chase brand and essential to attracting people who want to open accounts or make major transactions in person. Now it looks like the executives were right, or at least closer than other banks to delivering the right mix of physical and digital customer service. JPMorgan has grown deposits over the last five years faster than major competitors and twice as fast as the industry, according to analysts at Bernstein Research. Deposits in the Chase consumer bank grew in 2016 by 11 percent, or some $61 billion, the bank said when reporting quarterly results last week. Chase now has $607 billion in deposits, setting it up for a massive payoff if it can keep those funds and the company can lend them at higher interest rates in a stronger economy. "We've been growing our deposits very strongly and we're going to enjoy the benefits," Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on Friday. For the first time in roughly a decade, banks' ability to gather deposits is poised to matter mightily to financial performance. Interest rates are rising and the U.S. economy, which has been on the mend for a while, is expected to improve even more with stimulus from federal spending and tax cuts under the new government in Washington. Banks that did not take steps to grow deposits while loan demand was sluggish and interest rates were low may struggle to catch up in the coming years, experts said. "JPMorgan has invested through the slower times," said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA who has questioned JPMorgan's branch office strategy in the past. "Now it's time for them to try to achieve a greater payoff." Struggles Ahead The full payoff is not a sure thing. Loan demand and lending rates could fall short. The economy might become so strong that depositors put their money to better use. Or, lending could be so attractive that JPMorgan rivals lure deposits away with higher and higher rates. Wary of fickle customers, JPMorgan executives say they are not offering high rates for deposits in a widespread, indiscriminate manner. "We have among the lowest rates paid for deposits in the industry," Lake said in a conference call with journalists on Friday. "We've been very disciplined." The Bernstein analysis concurred, finding that JPMorgan offers relatively little for deposits. Still, the bank has been using promotions to get more people in the door. For example, in recent months, Chase has been mailing offers of a $500 cash payment to new depositors who meet certain conditions, such as holding at least $15,000 in a savings account for three months. Such come-ons are a marketing expense and do not lower the profit margin the bank reports for its deposits, Lake said. Chase's consumer deposit profit margin has fallen for at least five years, reaching 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.76 percent in the same period in 2011. It is difficult for outsiders to assess how customer-acquisition costs would depress that rate, or how many depositors lured through promotions will stay with the bank for the long haul, taking out the loans and paying the fees Chase expects. Flexing Muscle Much of JPMorgan's deposit growth was born through mistakes, the financial crisis and sheer necessity. Before 2007, Chase, like many banks, would lose a lot of customers each year because of poor service. Replacing them was expensive, but the churning expense could be covered by assorted fees, such as for overdrafts. That was sharply curtailed by post-crisis reform. Since then, banks have focused on better service to keep customers. JPMorgan also took over Washington Mutual during the crisis. WaMu had a branch network full of holes in California and Florida, which Chase has tried to plug with new locations. Deposit growth has been a byproduct. Regulator demands that banks shore up funding has also been a factor. Deposits are more stable than short-term financing from capital markets, and new requirements on banks favor deposits from consumers. A big chunk of Chase's additional deposits have also come from the bank's push to gain more investment management business from "mass affluent" individuals, who may not be multi-millionaires but still have a meaningful level of household wealth. They are often Chase customers already, who open Chase Private Client accounts through branches and are offered perks for higher balances. Perhaps the most substantial driver of Chase's deposit growth? Sheer size and scale: it has more resources than competitors to spend to build up deposits. "It is about flexing their muscle," said Mayo.   To read more stories , click here Loading Other Articles... « Previous Article | Next Article » 0 Comments Login in order to post a comment Quick Poll Should Medicare be converted to a voucher system to save the U.S. money?

He showed on a daily chart of KBW Nasdaq Bank Index that it's trading sideways after a huge run higher and he explained that stocks usually pull back to its trendline after such pattern forms on a chart. Mike Khouw thinks that we could see a pull back or a continuation of sideways trading in the sector and he suggested a bearish options strategy in Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) as the best way to make money in that scenario. He wants to sell the March 60/62.50 call spread for $1. If Citigroup trades below $60 at the March expiration, Khouw is going to make the maximal profit of $1. Above $61, he's going to lose money and he can maximally lose $1.50. Posted-In: Carter Worth Mike Khouw Options ActionCNBC Options Markets Media © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Close share panel Image copyright AFP US investment bank JP Morgan Chase has upgraded its view of the Indonesian stock market, partially reversing a previous downgrade that prompted an angry reaction from the government. The bank uprated Indonesian shares one notch to "neutral". Emerging-market volatility in the wake of Donald Trump's US election win had now subsided, it said. In November last year, the bank took its assessment down two levels from "overweight" to "underweight". In response, the Indonesian government stopped doing business with JP Morgan. In the month after the US presidential election, funds had sold large amounts of emerging-market countries' shares and bonds, bank researchers said in a note to clients. "Our tactical downgrade two months ago was driven by the risk of Indonesia underperforming the Asia Pacific ex-Japan," they said. "Bond volatility risks have now played out, in our view." However, it said there were still concerns about further volatility, hence the neutral rating. Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said the upgrade was "good", but made no further comment.

Giving up real estate, the analysts said, was an obvious way the bank could save money when interest income was flagging and regulatory and legal costs were climbing. But executives at the largest U.S. bank resisted. They argued that branches are great billboards for the Chase brand and essential to attracting people who want to open accounts or make major transactions in person. Now it looks like the executives were right, or at least closer than other banks to delivering the right mix of physical and digital customer service. JPMorgan has grown deposits over the last five years faster than major competitors and twice as fast as the industry, according to analysts at Bernstein Research. Deposits in the Chase consumer bank grew in 2016 by 11 percent, or some $61 billion, the bank said when reporting quarterly results last week. Chase now has $607 billion in deposits, setting it up for a massive payoff if it can keep those funds and the company can lend them at higher interest rates in a stronger economy. "We've been growing our deposits very strongly and we're going to enjoy the benefits," Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on Friday. For the first time in roughly a decade, banks' ability to gather deposits is poised to matter mightily to financial performance. Interest rates are rising and the U.S. economy, which has been on the mend for a while, is expected to improve even more with stimulus from federal spending and tax cuts under the new government in Washington. Banks that did not take steps to grow deposits while loan demand was sluggish and interest rates were low may struggle to catch up in the coming years, experts said. "JPMorgan has invested through the slower times," said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA who has questioned JPMorgan's branch office strategy in the past. "Now it's time for them to try to achieve a greater payoff." STRUGGLES AHEAD The full payoff is not a sure thing. Loan demand and lending rates could fall short. The economy might become so strong that depositors put their money to better use. Or, lending could be so attractive that JPMorgan rivals lure deposits away with higher and higher rates. Wary of fickle customers, JPMorgan executives say they are not offering high rates for deposits in a widespread, indiscriminate manner. "We have among the lowest rates paid for deposits in the industry," Lake said in a conference call with journalists on Friday. "We've been very disciplined." The Bernstein analysis concurred, finding that JPMorgan offers relatively little for deposits. Still, the bank has been using promotions to get more people in the door. For example, in recent months, Chase has been mailing offers of a $500 cash payment to new depositors who meet certain conditions, such as holding at least $15,000 in a savings account for three months. Such come-ons are a marketing expense and do not lower the profit margin the bank reports for its deposits, Lake said. Chase's consumer deposit profit margin has fallen for at least five years, reaching 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.76 percent in the same period in 2011. It is difficult for outsiders to assess how customer-acquisition costs would depress that rate, or how many depositors lured through promotions will stay with the bank for the long haul, taking out the loans and paying the fees Chase expects. FLEXING MUSCLE Much of JPMorgan's deposit growth was born through mistakes, the financial crisis and sheer necessity. Before 2007, Chase, like many banks, would lose a lot of customers each year because of poor service. Replacing them was expensive, but the churning expense could be covered by assorted fees, such as for overdrafts. That was sharply curtailed by post-crisis reform. Since then, banks have focused on better service to keep customers. JPMorgan also took over Washington Mutual during the crisis. WaMu had a branch network full of holes in California and Florida, which Chase has tried to plug with new locations. Deposit growth has been a byproduct. Regulator demands that banks shore up funding has also been a factor. Deposits are more stable than short-term financing from capital markets, and new requirements on banks favor deposits from consumers. A big chunk of Chase's additional deposits have also come from the bank's push to gain more investment management business from "mass affluent" individuals, who may not be multi-millionaires but still have a meaningful level of household wealth. They are often Chase customers already, who open Chase Private Client accounts through branches and are offered perks for higher balances. Perhaps the most substantial driver of Chase's deposit growth? Sheer size and scale: it has more resources than competitors to spend to build up deposits. "It is about flexing their muscle," said Mayo.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:50 PM, January 16, 2017 JAKARTA - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> upgraded its investment recommendation on Indonesian stocks to "neutral" from "underweight" on Monday, partially reversing a move it made in November that upset the government. Indonesia cut its business ties with JPMorgan after the U.S. investment bank downgraded its recommendation on Indonesian stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a research report issued after the U.S. presidential election. Government officials said JPMorgan's November report "did not make sense" because it gave better recommendations for equities of other emerging economies that Indonesia argued were not doing better than its economy, Southeast Asia's largest. JPMorgan's equities research team wrote on Monday that in the month after Donald Trump's surprise victory, funds sold large amount of emerging markets' bonds and equities which it estimated at $15 billion each. "Redemption and bond volatility risks have now played out, in our view. Bond volatility should now decay allowing us to partially reverse November's tactical moves including upgrading Indonesia to neutral," according to the note sent to clients and seen by Reuters. "Indonesia's macro fundamentals are strong, with high potential growth rate and low debt/GDP with economic reform. Within Asia it was the biggest beneficiary of bond inflows," the bank said, adding that better motorcycle sales data also supported its upgrade. JPMorgan said it remained concerned about volatility in the first half of 2017 and "manages risk with a neutral call". When asked about JPMorgan's upgrade, Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said "it's good", without elaborating. Responding to the upgrade, Indonesia's central bank governor Agus Martowardojo said 2017 will be a year of recovery for Indonesian corporates, banks and fiscal spending, while 2016 was a year of consolidation. Indonesia's main benchmark index <.JKSE> has dipped so far this year after gaining more than 15 percent in 2016. After JPMorgan's November downgrade, Indonesia's finance ministry dropped the bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to global markets. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. The ministry then issued new rules that require all primary bond dealers - banks and securities appointed to buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market - to "safeguard" their partnership with the government and avoid conflict of interest. JPMorgan did not mention the government's sanction in the note it published on Monday.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 16 January 2017 | MYT 6:19 PM Bank stocks drag KLCI into the red, key Asian markets down by joseph chin KUALA LUMPUR: Bank stocks took a hit on Monday on selling of Maybank and CIMB as the FBM KLCI closed lower in tandem with the cautious key Asian markets. The weaker market sentiment was due to concerns over the impact of Britain's exit from the European Union, said Reuters. Sentiment was also hit as US policy uncertainty lingered ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration this week. At 5pm, the FBM KLCI was down 13.66 points or 0.82% to 1,658.84 as selling picked up about 3.30pm when European markets opened.   Turnover was 1.79 billion shares valued at RM1.61bil. Decliners beat advancers nearly three to one or 611 losers to 225 gainers and 303 counters unchanged. Market data showed that foreign funds were net sellers at more than RM92mil while local retailers and local institutions were net buyers.  Meanwhile, JPMorgan lowered its recommendation on Malaysian stocks to neutral from overweight, cited that weakness in the Ringgit hit equity investors’ confidence, according to Bloomberg. It said the downgrade was “consistent with a more cautious view on Tenaga”. JPMorgan’s preferred large caps are Petronas Chemicals Group, CIMB Group Holdings and Sime Darby.

The Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan after the U.S. bank downgraded its investment recommendation on Indonesian stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a November research note. "Redemption and bond volatility risks have now played out, in our view. Bond volatility should now decay allowing us to partially reverse November's tactical moves including upgrading Indonesia to neutral," its equity research team wrote in a note sent to clients on Monday and seen by Reuters, referring to $15 billion of capital flows out of emerging markets' bonds and equities after the U.S. presidential election in early November. JPMorgan's research team said "Indonesia's macro fundamentals are strong, with high potential growth rate and low debt/GDP with economic reform. Within Asia it was the biggest beneficiary of bond inflows." Indonesia's main benchmarket index has dipped so far this year after gaining more than 15 percent in 2016.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:30 PM, January 16, 2017 NEW YORK - Over the past five years, stock analysts have challenged JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> executives for keeping so many branches open as customers did more and more banking online. Giving up real estate, the analysts said, was an obvious way the bank could save money when interest income was flagging and regulatory and legal costs were climbing. But executives at the largest U.S. bank resisted. They argued that branches are great billboards for the Chase brand and essential to attracting people who want to open accounts or make major transactions in person. Now it looks like the executives were right, or at least closer than other banks to delivering the right mix of physical and digital customer service. JPMorgan has grown deposits over the last five years faster than major competitors and twice as fast as the industry, according to analysts at Bernstein Research. Deposits in the Chase consumer bank grew in 2016 by 11 percent, or some $61 billion, the bank said when reporting quarterly results last week. Chase now has $607 billion in deposits, setting it up for a massive payoff if it can keep those funds and the company can lend them at higher interest rates in a stronger economy. "We've been growing our deposits very strongly and we're going to enjoy the benefits,” Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on Friday. For the first time in roughly a decade, banks’ ability to gather deposits is poised to matter mightily to financial performance. Interest rates are rising and the U.S. economy, which has been on the mend for a while, is expected to improve even more with stimulus from federal spending and tax cuts under the new government in Washington. Banks that did not take steps to grow deposits while loan demand was sluggish and interest rates were low may struggle to catch up in the coming years, experts said. “JPMorgan has invested through the slower times,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA who has questioned JPMorgan’s branch office strategy in the past. “Now it's time for them to try to achieve a greater payoff.” STRUGGLES AHEAD The full payoff is not a sure thing. Loan demand and lending rates could fall short. The economy might become so strong that depositors put their money to better use. Or, lending could be so attractive that JPMorgan rivals lure deposits away with higher and higher rates. Wary of fickle customers, JPMorgan executives say they are not offering high rates for deposits in a widespread, indiscriminate manner. “We have among the lowest rates paid for deposits in the industry,” Lake said in a conference call with journalists on Friday. “We've been very disciplined.” The Bernstein analysis concurred, finding that JPMorgan offers relatively little for deposits. Still, the bank has been using promotions to get more people in the door. For example, in recent months, Chase has been mailing offers of a $500 cash payment to new depositors who meet certain conditions, such as holding at least $15,000 in a savings account for three months. Such come-ons are a marketing expense and do not lower the profit margin the bank reports for its deposits, Lake said. Chase’s consumer deposit profit margin has fallen for at least five years, reaching 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.76 percent in the same period in 2011. It is difficult for outsiders to assess how customer-acquisition costs would depress that rate, or how many depositors lured through promotions will stay with the bank for the long haul, taking out the loans and paying the fees Chase expects. FLEXING MUSCLE Much of JPMorgan's deposit growth was born through mistakes, the financial crisis and sheer necessity. Before 2007, Chase, like many banks, would lose a lot of customers each year because of poor service. Replacing them was expensive, but the churning expense could be covered by assorted fees, such as for overdrafts. That was sharply curtailed by post-crisis reform. Since then, banks have focused on better service to keep customers. JPMorgan also took over Washington Mutual during the crisis. WaMu had a branch network full of holes in California and Florida, which Chase has tried to plug with new locations. Deposit growth has been a byproduct. Regulator demands that banks shore up funding has also been a factor. Deposits are more stable than short-term financing from capital markets, and new requirements on banks favor deposits from consumers. A big chunk of Chase’s additional deposits have also come from the bank's push to gain more investment management business from “mass affluent” individuals, who may not be multi-millionaires but still have a meaningful level of household wealth. They are often Chase customers already, who open Chase Private Client accounts through branches and are offered perks for higher balances. Perhaps the most substantial driver of Chase’s deposit growth? Sheer size and scale: it has more resources than competitors to spend to build up deposits. "It is about flexing their muscle," said Mayo.

PHOTO: REUTERS [NEW YORK] A Florida man pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges stemming from his employment with an unlicensed bitcoin exchange that prosecutors say was owned by an Israeli who oversaw a massive scheme to hack companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Ricardo Hill, 38, entered his plea in Manhattan federal court to seven counts, including conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, wire fraud and bank fraud. The Brandon, Florida-resident is one of nine people to face charges following an investigation connected to a data breach that JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 involving records for more than 83 million accounts. The charges against Hill stemmed from his employment as a finance support manager and business development consultant for an unlicensed bitcoin exchange called Coin.mx, according to court papers. Prosecutors have said Coin.mx was operated by another Florida man, Anthony Murgio, from 2013 to 2015 and exchanged millions of US dollars into bitcoin while operating through several fronts, including one called "Collectables Club." SEE ALSO: Americans distrustful after hacking epidemic: survey Prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli who with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron orchestrated cyber attacks on companies including JPMorgan that resulted in more than 100 million people's information being stolen. Prosecutors said the men carried out the cybercrimes to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with sham promotional emails. Aaron was deported from Russia in December and taken into US custody, while Shalon and Orenstein were extradited from Israel in June. All three have pleaded not guilty. Murgio, who like Hill was not accused of engaging in the hacking scheme, pleaded guilty on Jan 9 to charges that included conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Five other individuals have been charged in connection with Coin.mx, including Murgio's father. Two individuals linked to it are scheduled to face trial on Feb 6. The case is US v Murgio et al, US District Court, Southern District of New York, No 15-cr-769.

The KBW Bank index declined 3.5 percent, the most since June 27, while bonds and gold advanced after Trump told the Wall Street Journal the dollar is too high in part because China holds down its own currency. Morgan Stanley fell 4.2 percent to $41.98 at 3 p.m., reversing gains in early trading after reporting fourth-quarter results that beat analysts' estimates. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The firm had surged 28 percent since the election through Friday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. also slid more than 3 percent Tuesday. Trump's "comments could be causing some folks to think that growth expectations should come in a little, bringing rates down, which in turn can bring financial stocks down," said Shannon Stemm, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. "These stocks were due for a breather, you could be seeing some folks taking profit." The KBW index of 24 major U.S. lenders has climbed 20 percent since the Nov. 8 election stoked expectations for corporate tax cuts, higher interest rates and lighter financial regulation. Investors will need to see the Trump administration make progress on those points to drive bank stocks higher, analysts have said. "Every day there's a different story and talking point" from Trump, said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities. "At this level, the market needs to see the positive momentum that's expected in results carry through, and some of that is dictated by details coming out of the new administration."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES The battle over MormonLeaks -- two websites with one name and one goal: target the LDS Church A Trump supporter was charged with voting twice.

That sent crude oil prices up a little and gold prices up a lot. Consumer staples, the home of timid, was Tuesday’s best performing sector. WTI crude oil for February delivery settled at $52.48 a barrel, up about 0.2% on the day. February gold added 1.4% on the day to settle at $1,212.90, the yellow metal’s highest finish in 2 months. Equities were headed for a lower close close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.35% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down 0.37%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded down 0.69%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Tuesday was JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) which traded down about 3.84% at $83.38. The stock’s 52-week range is $52.50 to $88.17. Volume was about 35% above the daily average of around 17.6 million shares. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Morgan and other banks related to the Libor fixing scandal. The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) traded down 3.40% at $236.00. The stock’s 52-week range is $138.20 to $247.77. Volume was about 20% above the daily average of around 4 million shares. The investment bank had no specific news ahead of Wednesday morning’s earnings report.. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) traded down 1.43% at $32.06. The stock’s 52-week range is $28.25 to $37.39. Volume was about 10% below the daily average of around 27 million shares. The company had no specific news. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) traded down 1.09% at $160.04. The stock’s 52-week range is $108.83 to $164.00. Volume was just more than the daily average of around 4 million shares. Better-than-expected earnings and revenues were not enough to escape the day’s malaise. Of the Dow 30 stocks, 11 are on track to close higher Tuesday and 19 are set to close lower.

Ogg January 17, 2017 12:55 pm EST Print Email Tweet If you have followed the saga of American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) for the past decade, you have probably noticed that it has migrated from an enviable company with a core list of top customers into an organization that had become quite painful for its investors. After having spent most of 2016 in the proverbial dog house, Amex came screaming back during the post-election rally. Now it may have seen more analyst upgrades than any of the 29 other Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) components since the start of 2017. Over the past two years, Amex faced serious account losses from the likes of Costco. Still, the 16% share price gain in the fourth quarter alone allowed its shares to generate a return of 8.6% in 2016. Its dividend-adjusted closing price was $74.08 per share on the last trading day of 2016. It seems obvious that some of the excitement has to be around rising interest rates allowing Amex to generate higher interest income from card balances that get carried over by its clients. Amex also can earn actual money on its own cash balances as well. What stood out at the end of 2016 was that the stock’s consensus analyst target price from Thomson Reuters was just $72.88. If that would have held, it implied downside risk of −1.6%. Amex’s 1.7% dividend yield was making for an expected 0.1% total return in 2017, if the pool analysts was correct on average. With investors having continued to look for opportunities in the financial services sector, Amex was actually the third-best performing Dow stock in the second half of 2016 (outpaced by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan). The issue that stands out in 2017 is what feels like an endless trail of analyst upgrades. Analysts have raised their ratings to Buy and Outperform, but they also have catapulted their price targets higher by $10 and $20 per share in some cases. These analysts do not even really care that Warren Buffett is the largest holder of American Express, with over 16% of the shares outstanding being held by Berkshire Hathaway. Before checking out the most recent upgrades, note that Stephens issued a $65 target late in 2016, and RBC’s new target from the first week of 2017 was just $60. What a difference a couple of weeks can make. Here are the seen Amex analyst upgrades, showing the statistics of the stock on each day as they were then. On January 17, 2017, JPMorgan raised Amex to Overweight from Neutral. Its target was raised to $90 from $76. After a prior close of $76.62, it had a consensus analyst target price of $77.80 and a 52-week trading range of $50.27 to $78.00. On January 10, Oppenheimer raised it to Outperform from Perform. Its price target was set at $98, versus a $75.86 prior closing price. The 52-week range was $50.27 to $76.55, and the consensus analyst target was $75.96. On Monday, January 9, 2017, Merrill Lynch raised its rating on Amex to Buy from Neutral. The firm’s objective was raised to $90 from $78 and compared to a $75.47 prior close. At that time it had a consensus target price of $75.96 and a 52-week range of $50.27 to $76.55. Merrill Lynch had raised its target to $78 from $74 less than a month earlier. Other key analyst calls have been seen as follows: Stifel raised its Amex price target to $80 from $68 on January 13. Barclays raised its target to $83 from $63 on January 6. Deutsche Bank raised its target to $88 from $66 on January 6. On January 5, Compass Point added the stock to its Alpha List with an $87 price target. American Express shares were up another 0.4% at $76.95 midday Tuesday. The 52-week range is $50.27 to $78.00, and its consensus price target is now up to $78.56. What matters here is that Thomson Reuters showed its consensus analyst target price as $71.63 just 30 days ago and $67.18 some 90 days ago.

Despite the yuan's nearly 7 percent slump against the dollar in 2016, Chinese companies including state-owned Bank of China raised a record $111 billion in offshore dollar bonds, according to data from Dealogic, up from $88 billion in 2015. JPMorgan analysts, using their own dataset, are forecasting another rise this year, even though many economists expect the yuan to fall further, making the loans more expensive to service and repay. The list includes issuers who need dollars to pay for overseas acquisitions and deals but are unable to use their yuan after China tightened its grip on capital outflows last year to support the currency. "It's getting increasingly difficult to move money out," said Shen Weizheng, fund manager at Ivy Capital, which invests in stocks and bonds in Hong Kong. "So for Chinese companies eager to invest overseas, the dollar bond market becomes an easier funding avenue." State firms are also doing so because the government has made it easier for them to tap offshore markets, and there is pressure on them to bring more dollars onshore, investment bankers said. Some property firms have also been left with little choice but to raise money offshore as government measures to contain a property bubble have included lending restrictions onshore. Both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have tightened bond issuance rules for real estate firms since October, and regulators have repeatedly urged Chinese lenders to restrict property lending. Chinese property developers have $7.9 billion in loans falling due in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data, which could push more into offshore markets if they need refinancing. On top of the exchange risks, the borrowers also have to swallow much higher borrowing costs. China Evergrande Group pays a 7 percent yield on its dollar bonds in Hong Kong, but just 3 percent in China, while China Aoyuan Property Group raised $250 million through three-year bonds in early January, paying 6.35 percent, almost double the average yield on yuan bonds onshore. Despite the cost, more issuers are lining up for after the Chinese New Year in late January. A fund manager at Invesco Asset Management in Hong Kong said his firm had signed confidential agreements with 10 Chinese issuers to become their cornerstone investor. FAST TRACK An underwriter who helps Chinese firms issue dollar bonds said state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were keen to issue dollar bonds partly because "the central government is encouraging them to bring dollars back to China, and SOEs are not very sensitive to borrowing costs". The government fast-tracked approvals for bringing dollar bond proceeds back onshore for several state firms, in a bid to ease depreciation pressure on the yuan and slow the pace at which the country was burning through currency reserves. Previously, all SOEs needed to register their offshore debt issuance plans with China's central planning agency, but last year it allowed 21 SOEs to proceed without registration. China's local government financing vehicles (LGFV) have also joined this growing band of bond issuers in Hong Kong. Last January, Jiangsu NewHeadline Development, a financing vehicle of the Lianyungang municipal government in Jiangsu Province, issued $200 million of 3-year bonds paying interest of 6.20 percent. NewHeadline, the first LGFV to sell offshore bonds, could have issued yuan bonds onshore paying around 5 percent, without the risk of the exchange rate moving against them. "I asked them: your fundamentals are not bad, so why are you willing to raise funds at a higher cost?" said a fund manager who subscribed to the bonds. "They said there was a political target to raise overseas money." A NewHeadline official told Reuters the purpose was to "boost our overseas branding, so that more foreign investors know us". She didn't say why the company, which is mainly involved in infrastructure and water treatment in China, wanted overseas branding. A stream of LGFVs followed in NewHeadline's footsteps, and the company is mulling a second offshore bond this year. The attractive yields, combined with investors' expectations of a rising dollar, led to an increasing number of funds targeting dollar bonds in China last year. That fuelled a fivefold increase in the outbound funds held in a scheme set up a decade ago to let domestic investors invest overseas, even as Beijing has suspended approvals for new quota for the scheme as part of its capital curbs. Quota holders can now rent out their quota for twice the price they could last year, such is the demand.

Morgan Stanley's profit doubled in the fourth quarter as trading activity surged across Wall Street, and the bank said it was on track to reach a number of financial goals set out by Chief Executive James Gorman. In announcing earnings on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley detailed huge gains in bond trading, an area where it has long struggled. The bank also reported stronger revenue in equities trading, where Morgan Stanley is typically a leader, and said it was close to hitting targets for cost-cutting, wealth management profits and returns on shareholder equity. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. Morgan Stanley's trading results echoed those of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp last week, driven by Donald Trump's surprise election victory on Nov. 8 and U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to boost a key interest rate target in mid-December. Overall, Morgan Stanley's profit soared to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from $753 million a year earlier. Earnings per share increased to 81 cents from 39 cents, easily beating expectations. Analysts on average had forecast a profit of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue jumped 17 percent to $9 billion, beating the average estimate $8.5 billion. Bond trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion in the quarter from $550 million last year, the second-highest level since the first quarter of 2015 in what is typically a slow period for the business. The bond trading bump came after a 25 percent reduction in staff, and helped Morgan Stanley exceed Gorman's $1 billion-per-quarter bond-trading revenue benchmark for the full year. With interest rates positioned to rise further - which would prompt investors to shift positions again - Morgan Stanley's results "should not necessarily be seen as a fluke," Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said. However, the bank's finance chief, Jonathan Pruzan, struck a cautious tone. Morgan Stanley will not increase its quarterly target for the business until it is clear that recent revenue trends were sustainable, he said. "There is clearly optimism out there, but how long that holds is really a question, given that political and geopolitical events can change sentiment very quickly," Pruzan said in an interview. Morgan Stanley's shares were down 3 percent at $42.48 in afternoon trading, more than other large-cap banks whose shares were broadly down. Analysts said much of the positive earnings news was already priced into Morgan Stanley's stock, which had risen 28.5 percent from the election through Friday's close. Citigroup's Keith Horowitz said investors might also have been disappointed with Morgan Stanley management keeping 2017 guidance steady. While bond trading was the main driver of Morgan Stanley's earnings beat, it is the most volatile business on Wall Street and big swings in revenue are common. Analysts pointed to several other indications that the sixth-largest U.S. bank is on steadier financial footing. Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr highlighted gains in investment banking, lower expenses and "solid" results in wealth management. Morgan Stanley said it was on track to hit Gorman's $1 billion annual cost-cutting target, and its 22 percent wealth profit margin is close to the 23-to-25 percent range it aims to hit next year. The bank's return on equity was 8.7 percent in the quarter, short of Gorman's 9-to-11 percent target by the end of 2017. Morgan Stanley management "still feel(s) very good" about the bank's ability to hit that goal, Pruzan said. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley's chief rival, report results on Wednesday. The article was provided by Reuters.

But how are you really doing? Nick Corcodilos EMAIL BY Nick Corcodilos  January 17, 2017 at 4:24 PM EST Photo by Jeff Kowalsky/Bloomberg. Nick Corcodilos started headhunting in Silicon Valley in 1979 and has answered over 30,000 questions from the Ask The Headhunter community. In this special Making Sen$e edition of Ask The Headhunter, Nick shares insider advice and contrarian methods about winning and keeping the right job, on one condition: that you, dear Making Sense reader, send Nick your questions about your personal challenges with job hunting, interviewing, networking, resumes, job boards or salary negotiations. No guarantees — just a promise to do his best to offer useful advice. Question: Have you been reading the jobs news? Am I crazy, or do people really believe unemployment is down and pay is up? That there is suddenly a job for anyone who wants it? That all our troubles are over? Man, sign me up for a new job for two times what I was making when I had a job! Nick Corcodilos: I took time off during the holidays, but the news kept coming hot and heavy from the U.S. Department of Labor and associated pundits and experts: You should stop complaining about jobs and salaries. Everything is great! READ MORE: 4 economists evaluate Obama’s economic legacy I’m sure you’re reading the same good news, but all I want to know is, does this reflect your experience with the job market and employers? In the past few days, the Department of Labor reported: “Unemployment rates were significantly lower in November in 18 states and stable in 32 states and the District of Columbia…” “The national unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in November, down from 4.9 percent in October, and 0.4 percentage point lower than in November 2015.” Fewer people are unemployed! (Still, employers complain there is a talent shortage. See “Half-Assed Recruiting: Why employers can’t find talent.”) Recent Bloomberg reports tell us: “The 4.7 percent jobless rate remains close to a nine-year low,even with a tick up last month.” We’re seeing “enduring wage gains as labor market tightens.” You’re getting paid more, and employers are working harder to hire you! “Worker pay rises at fastest pace since end of last recession.” “Fiscal stimulus would stoke further gains as labor [is] scarce.” “Average hourly earnings jumped by 2.9 percent in the 12 months through December, the most since the last recession ended in June 2009.” “Workers in almost every category, from mining and construction to retail and education, saw paychecks rise from November.” But who’s getting more pay? (See “Job promotion or more work for less pay?”) Michael Feroli, JPMorgan’s chief economist, says: “I expect to see continued acceleration in wages this year.” And get this: Labor shortages may become more common. Employers are going to be begging you to take a job! I hope that makes you feel better if you’re facing a shortage of exactly the one job you need to pay your bills. But then, there are the gotchas from the Department of Labor reported by Bloomberg. The Department of Labor touts higher levels of participation in the job market, but doesn’t try to explain why the uptake isn’t so hot: “More Americans joined the labor force but had not yet found jobs.” Oops. And try this double-talk on for size: “The number of people who were jobless and gave up looking for work declined to a three-month low…” but “One caveat: fewer people who were already in the labor force but unemployed were able to find jobs.” We discussed what may be behind this conundrum in “Employment In America: WTF?” The employment system itself seems to hinder or even prevent the matching of workers to open jobs. The Associated Press is right in there with its own stories: Since 2009, “the job market is in infinitely better shape.The unemployment rate is 4.7 percent. Jobs have been added for 75 straight months, the longest such streak on record.” But… “The proportion of Americans with jobs … dropped a full percentage point.” Apply the grammatical logic tool to that one and you get… More Americans are without jobs! Under President Obama, “Hiring has been solid yet still hasn’t kept up with population growth.” “…many workers, especially less-educated men, have become discouraged about finding jobs with decent pay and have stopped looking.” Yes, that means many, many Americans are screwed, and it seems we’re being told they’re not educated enough to parse those sentences to glean the economic reality. When unemployed and under-employed people keep trying to pay for food, do you think at some point they’ll take up their pitchforks and torches? And don’t miss this troubling fact: The “routine work” that pays middle-income wages is disappearing. But the good news is those of you doing “higher- and lower-paying jobs” should have no trouble finding work! Tech jobs have “soared” 42 percent. Hotel and food service jobs have “jumped” 19 percent! Apply the grammatical logic tool to that one and you get… middle-class America can’t find a job! More good news: “Over the past year, average hourly pay has risen 2.9 percent, the healthiest increase in seven years.” But in a “robust economy,” the Associated Press reports, pay gains would be more like 3.5 percent. There’s more, but your under-paid, under-fed or unemployed (or under-employed) brain probably couldn’t take it. Let’s stop pretending Readers complain to me that the news reports (and the government reports) about employment too often seem to contradict one another. While the government, economists, banks and pundits tell a story that makes heads spin, I think the wisdom about all this is in the crowd. READ MORE: Column: Work means everything to us — and hereafter it can’t The people living, succeeding, failing, giving up, dropping out, scraping by and dying in this economy have a clearer picture of what’s really going on than what’s being reported. How are you doing? January of a New Year is a good time to sweep away the news and ask you — How are you doing in all this? I think we all want to know what’s really going on in our economy and job market. Does this news reflect your experience? Are you finding more jobs — good-paying jobs — are begging to be filled? Are you getting paid more money? Are employers hiring you more quickly at higher salaries? If you already have a job, has your boss increased your salary to avoid losing you? What’s really going on with respect to jobs, employment and pay? Dear Readers: I don’t think we’ll sort this out, but we can do a better job of discussing the realities of the job market than all those confusing news reports do! How are you doing in this “great job market?” Nick Corcodilos invites Making Sense readers to subscribe to his free weekly Ask The Headhunter© Newsletter.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 17, 2017 1:45pm   Comments Share: This article originally appeared on finbox.io. Earnings Season is Back Three major banks reported earnings on Friday and officially kicked off the start of a new earnings season. Overall, investors gave a thumbs up as JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) both beat their EPS estimates while Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) slightly fell short. All three stocks, however, traded moderately higher Friday as investors remain optimistic for 2017 ahead of the incoming Trump administration. Looking Ahead There are 179 companies expected to report earnings this week (1/16 - 1/20) and only a few appear to be fundamentally undervalued. Finbox.io intrinsic value data shows that only five companies have at least 14% or more upside: United Continental (NYSE: UAL), Skyworks Solutions (Nasdaq: SWKS), Nautilus (NYSE: NLS), Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) and New Oriental Education & Technology (NYSE: EDU). United is expected to report on Tuesday and six separate cashflow analyses imply that the stock’s approximately 22 percent undervalued. Skyworks Solutions is expected to report earnings on Thursday while twelve valuation models conclude that shares are about 20 percent undervalued. Nautilus is also expected to report earnings on Thursday and the stock is currently trading near its 52 week low. Finbox.io fair value data implies that shares are 19 percent undervalued while Wall Street's consensus price target of $22.58 implies over 40 percent upside. Six valuation analyses imply that Schlumberger is approximately 14 percent undervalued prior to reporting earnings (expected Friday). This figure is right in line with Wall Street. New Oriental Education & Technology appears to be trading at a 14% discount to fair value before earnings (expected Tuesday). Finbox.io's $55.75 intrinsic value estimate is slightly below the Wall Street consensus price target of $57.83 which implies roughly 15 percent margin of safety. It may be worth taking a closer look at the stocks listed above prior to them reporting earnings. Posted-In: Earnings Price Target Markets Analyst Ratings Tech © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA Katie Allen Tuesday 17 January 2017 13.37 EST Last modified on Friday 27 January 2017 12.06 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close The pound has clocked up its biggest one-day gain against the dollar since 1998 as traders seized on Theresa May’s pledge that parliament would vote on any Brexit deal and welcomed some clarity on the government’s plans for leaving the EU. The FTSE 100 headed in the other direction, recording its biggest daily fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in June. The share index has been boosted for several months by the fall in the pound, which helps exporters and those companies with overseas earnings, and some of that effect was unwound on Tuesday as the pound jumped almost 3%. The UK currency had been under pressure in the days before the prime minister’s key speech, as investors fretted over the prospect of the blow to trade and economic prosperity from a hard Brexit deal that leaves the country outside the European single market. What do business leaders think of Theresa May's Brexit speech? Read more But on the day of the speech the pound was buoyed early on by news of a rise in inflation. Some investors took that as a further sign that the next move in interest rates would be up, which in turn would strengthen the attraction of sterling. Once May took the podium, the pound rallied further against the dollar and the euro as she confirmed the likely deal to leave the EU would mean quitting the single market but that it would be put to a vote in both the upper and lower houses of parliament. “In laying out the government’s 12 guiding principles for the upcoming negotiations, Mrs May did remove some key question marks about the government’s approach and promised that both houses of parliament would get to vote on any Brexit agreement,” said Stephanie Flanders, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “This seems to have reassured investors.” The pound is still down about 17% against the dollar since the referendum and economists warned there was scope for it to fall further, given much uncertainty remained around the UK’s likely Brexit deal and the nature of negotiations with the rest of the EU. But on Tuesday it managed to recover some of its recent losses to reach a 10-day high of $1.2398, a rise of 2.9% on the day. It had dipped below $1.20 on Monday on hard Brexit worries. The FTSE closed down 1.5% at 7,220.38. Market reaction to Theresa May's speech Market reaction to Theresa May’s speech Commenting on the jump in the pound, Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at spread-betting firm Spreadex said: “As some expected, the pound had worked out most of its negative feelings about Theresa May’s Brexit intentions already, leading the currency to piggy-back on the less terrifying aspects of the prime minister’s announcement for some rather impressive gains. “It shows just how desperate the currency was for clarity that May’s speech, with its firm stance on leaving the single market and vague promises of free trade and some kind of new customs agreement, could inspire such a reaction from sterling despite most of what was said being pound-negative.” Sterling’s gains were also flattered by weakness in the dollar after Donald Trump said the US currency was overvalued. Trump said US companies could not compete with China “because our currency is too strong. And it’s killing us”, the Wall Street Journal reported. Richard Falkenhall, senior currency strategist at the Nordic bank SEB said the rally would prove to be temporary. “Despite the threats in today’s speech, the UK’s position in negotiations will be very weak once exit negotiations under the treaty starts. There is only a two-year period and the UK has the most to lose if negotiations fail. The two-year period will create a lot of uncertainty which is likely to harm the British economy and in particular the important British financial industry. “We view today’s pound rally as temporary and expect sterling to weaken again. We would not be surprised if comments from the EU as well as the UK sound very negative in the initial phases of the negotiations and during the exit process.” Andrew Goodwin, senior economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, also noted that the negotiations were far from guaranteed to succeed. “The prime minister did make a potentially important commitment to ask both houses of parliament to vote on the final deal, a promise which caused sterling to spike upwards,” he said. “But we do not see this as materially reducing the probability of the UK leaving the EU; it looks unlikely that ‘remaining’ will be one of the two options that parliament will be able to vote for.” More news Topics Sterling FTSE Economics Currencies Stock markets More… EU referendum and Brexit European Union Theresa May Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Gregg Greenberg Jan 17, 2017 1:28 PM EST The S&P 500 is up more than 5% since Election Day, but the bull stampede is far from over, said Matt Jones, head of U.S. equity strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank. The profit recession is over and an earnings recovery is underway, according to Jones, who expects earnings to rebound to 7% to 8% in 2017.  Jones also sees Trump policies adding to the step-up in earnings.  Should corporate tax reform be passed, Jones sees an additional 9% to 11% upside on top of his base case, putting pro-forma S&P 500 earnings per share at $150.  If you liked this article you might like Why Trump's Radical Wall Plan Is Nothing New for Wall Street The president's idea of building a wall across America's southern border may sound radical, but it's not new.

"I think investors are at a pause trying to figure out what's next." He also said he is positive about U.S. equities, noting underlying global economic growth has been overlooked. The Dow closed 58 points lower after briefly falling 100 points, with Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth Group and JPMorgan Chase contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent, with financials dropping more than 2 percent. The Nasdaq underperformed, declining 0.63 percent. The S&P 500 "remains bound by a consolidation phase that reflects an indecisive market as we approach the inauguration," said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, in a note. "We believe the risk is greater to the downside in the near term, and would be wary of a breach of the lower boundary of the range near 2250." "You don't know what's going to happen. So it's hard to reposition into this or that," said Jeff Layman, a partner at BKD Wealth Advisors. Trump criticized a proposed corporate tax plan from the House of Representatives, labeling the plan as "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. The stock market has soared since the election partially on hopes of corporate tax reform, deregulation of certain sectors and more government spending. "There's a lot of nervousness as Trump gets set to take office," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "Until we see what he does in his first 100 days, I think the market is going to remain in a wait-and-see pattern."  Trump's inauguration is scheduled for Friday. Trump's remarks also took a bite out of the dollar, which fell 0.85 percent against a basket of currencies. In turn, the euro rose 0.88 percent to $1.0707 and the yen gained 1.11 percent to 112.67. Adding pressure to U.S. stocks were concerns of a hard Brexit. In a speech Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May indicated the United Kingdom would seek a clean break from the European Union. She added, however, The U.K. government will put the Brexit deal it agrees with the European Union to a parliamentary vote. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said May's speech was expected to be "catastrophic." "But, she has managed the expectations and delivered the speech very well. Moreover, the final Brexit deal will be put up for a vote in parliament and this makes things a little less pessimistic," he said. The British pound skyrocketed more than 2.5 percent against the dollar, trading around $1.239, on track for its best day since 2008. The pound briefly broke below $1.20 earlier this week. "The fact that the pound briefly broke below $1.20 and then rebounded shows you that the bears aren't ready to take the pound in that direction," said Adam Sarhan, CEO at 50 Park Investments. The pound has fallen sharply since last June's Brexit vote. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rebounded after May's speech, falling about 0.15 percent, paring losses. There are no major U.S. economic data due Tuesday, but a slew of firms reported quarterly results, including Morgan Stanley, which beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line. Morgan Stanley shares fell 2.5 percent, however. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 11.8.

Morgan Stanley's quarterly profit doubling, lifted by bond trading revenue that nearly tripled. Trading in bonds and stocks have surged since Donald Trump's surprise election victory in November. Morgan Stanley's fixed income trading results far exceeded the healthy gains posted by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America last week. Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski called it a "solid quarter," saying, "We think stronger fixed income, currencies and commodities trading should not necessarily be seen as a fluke. .. FICC trading should be a beneficiary of higher rates, as higher rates will require more bond portfolio repositioning."

Recent Posts: Profit From Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL) Earnings Miss Stop Worrying and Profit From Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock 2 Trades to Profit From Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock View All Posts The rally in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) has been impressive. So much so that the temptation to short BAC stock is too great to pass up. Source: Shutterstock Consensus on Wall Street is that banks under a Trump presidency should flourish to even higher highs. Add to it the fact that we are in a Federal Reserve rate hike cycle and you have a foolproof investment thesis. Therein lies the conundrum. I get the bullish logic, but I lack the faith. I don’t think that there will be a switch that flips in January suddenly giving bank stocks the floor lost in 2008. BAC stock is now just below the level that was the trap door during the financial debacle that crippled the globe. Last week, BAC reported a decent quarter, but Wall Street yawned with a mild upside poke. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) also reported, and it clobbered expectations, yet JPM stock barely budged. Usually, when a stock or a sector can’t rally on great news then the bulls may be tired. This week’s reports are not starting well either, with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) falling on another beat performance. That’s why I’m banking (pun intended) that the sector will be pressured from lackluster reactions to earnings reports from MS or Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS). Technically, this would be BAC’s sixth major bout with this price level. Twenty years ago, BAC stock broke out from $24 per share. In the following ten years, bulls successfully defended it twice, so it served as support. In 2008, $24 was lost and it’s not until now that BAC stock is this near to it again. Every great champion needs to rest. So I will make a small bet that BAC stock may not get the oomph it needs to power through $24 per share. Luckily, the options markets allow me to structure trades with small risks to capture the slip.

Morgan Stanley's quarterly profit doubling, lifted by bond trading revenue that nearly tripled. Trading in bonds and stocks have surged since Donald Trump's surprise election victory in November. Morgan Stanley's fixed income trading results far exceeded the healthy gains posted by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America last week. Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski called it a "solid quarter," saying, "We think stronger fixed income, currencies and commodities trading should not necessarily be seen as a fluke. .. FICC trading should be a beneficiary of higher rates, as higher rates will require more bond portfolio repositioning." Revenue also rose in the company's investment banking and wealth management businesses. Morgan Stanley's shares rose in early trading, adding on to their nearly 29 percent gain since the election.

The Ticker Tape , TD Ameritrade   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} January 17, 2017 11:52am   Comments Share: Two more big banks, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C), are scheduled to open the books on their Q4 performances before the markets open Wednesday. If Friday’s robust results from its competitors are any indication, and some analysts believe they are, Q4 may have been a boon for GS and C too. Overall, the three biggest U.S. banks that reported Friday, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) submitted total net income that climbed 2% on a year-over-year basis to $64.6 billion in 2016—results that came with partial thanks to a Q4 revival in their trading units. Did GS and C enjoy such a renaissance as well? And how might investors fare under a new administration that has vowed to lower taxes and loosen the regulatory reins? Goldman Sachs Revenue March Some analysts have said they expect Q4 to show sizable results from a revenue perspective. Rising prices in stocks and the increased trading volumes that appeared evident in Q4 may inflate GS’ top line. Why? Some analysts say it’s because GS has the highest revenue concentration in the capital markets when compared with its closest rivals. Like its big-bank competitors, GS’ investment units, both investing and lending, as well as its institutional client-services division, which makes markets and facilitates client transactions in equity, fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC), are likely to have rung up healthy revenues in the energetic post-election trading environment. Looking ahead, some analysts are likely to be listening for insight into what GS sees in mergers and acquisitions, as well as equity allocations. Like its competitors, GS’ M&A revenues appear to have been impacted by a slowdown in activity that some market watchers believe will be rejuvenated with the new administration in Washington. Some analysts also note that the possible uplift in trading activity expected under a Trump administration may lead investors to juice their equity allocations in 2017. FICC trading is expected to climb by an estimated $15 billion over the next two years, according to a recent Barron’s article. Analysts add, however, that volatility may be jumpy. Also of interest is what, if any, market share has GS picked up from European banks. JPM executives noted in their conference call that the bank had scooped up market share in investment banking fees in the U.S. and Europe. Some analysts say they expect the same from GS. Data from Estimize* point to per-share earnings of $4.76. GS' earnings numbers have been trending higher all year, with the last three quarters coming in at $2.68, $3.72 and $4.88 respectively. Revenues are anticipated to reach $7.72 billion, up 5.5% from last year’s $7.3 billion. GS has outperformed Wall Street’s expectations in the last three quarters. Short-term options traders have priced in a potential share price move of 2.7% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. There are call buyers at the weekly 245-strike and 250-strikes, with put activity heaviest at the 235 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 24th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.) Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  Citigroup Gets in on Rally Too At a banking conference in November, Jamie Froese, C’s president, said his financial holdings group trading levels also had been a beneficiary of the surprise election results. But he cautioned then that there was still plenty of time left in the quarter. Moreover, he noted that he was looking for trading revenues to be slightly lower than they were in Q3 when banks reaped the benefits of uncertainty around the Brexit vote and a Federal Reserve rate hike. How might that have played out for C? Remember, though, that C is well known for its credit card and consumer banking units. During the Q3 conference call, CFO Marianne Lake said she expected revenue growth across North America, Latin America and Asia on the consumer-banking business side. However, she remained cautious on mortgage activity, which she saw as slowing down from Q3, mostly because of seasonal factors. Analysts also are looking at progress the bank is making in whittling down Citi Holdings, the so-called “bad bank” created in 2009 to house troubled assets in the wake of the financial crisis. Last year, CEO Michael Corbat said in a statement that “winding down Holdings has been a longtime goal and shows Citi’s progress in becoming a simpler, smaller, safer and stronger institution. Some analysts expect the unit to break even in Q4, but say they want to know what the next steps are. At the Financial Times, analysts reporting see average earnings per share of $1.12 compared with $1.06 a year ago on revenues of $17.3 billion, below last years’ $18.6 billion. Short-term options traders have priced in a potential share price move of 2.1% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator. Options activity has been strong at the weekly 60-strike line for calls and at the 57.5 strike for puts. The implied volatility sits in the lower quarter at the 9th percentile.

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Jan 17, 2017 at 11:02AM If you have some extra money to put to work, but don't quite know what to invest in, there's good news. The best investment ideas for 2017 include: Paying off your credit cards, buying real estate, high-quality dividend investments, and banking stocks. Here are the best ways to approach each of those. Image Source: Getty Images. 1. Pay off your credit cards I listed this one first for a reason, even though it technically isn't an "investment." Simply put, it doesn't make sense to buy stocks or any other type of investment if you have high-interest credit card debt. The reason is simple mathematics. If you have $5,000 in credit card debt at 18% interest, you're paying $900 per year just for the privilege of owing that money. When investing, the best you can reasonably hope to earn on a consistent basis is 10-12% returns per year. Even at the top end of that range, you can reasonably expect a $5,000 investment to return $600 in its first year, at most. In other words, by investing instead of paying credit card debt, you're setting yourself up to lose money. 2. Play a little defense The current bull market is the second-longest in history, and while that doesn't necessarily mean that stocks are going to fall, at some point, we're going to see a correction or even a full-blown recession -- it's just a matter of when. For this reason, I'm a fan of adding some defensive investments to your portfolio in 2017. And contrary to popular myths, being defensive doesn't mean avoiding stocks. One example would be to buy an index fund that invests in dividend growth stocks, which tend to fare better during recessions. The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:SDY), which tracks the S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, is one good option. 3. Banks could have some great years ahead Financial stocks have been the biggest beneficiaries of the Trump rally, with the sector up nearly 18% since the election, and many banks performing even better, such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). XLF data by YCharts Even after the gains, I think we could still be in the early stages of a rally in banking. Not only are interest rates projected to rise under Trump, but he has pledged to cut burdensome regulations on banks and make it easier to do business. Also, if Trump's tax cuts, infrastructure spending, and other initiatives create the kind of job and wage growth he claims they will, the banks could have more lending demand as well as higher deposit bases. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) is a good way to invest in the entire sector, and if you want to buy an individual stock, Bank of America is one of my favorites -- and my single largest stock holding -- as we head into 2017. As I wrote after the bank reported earnings, even though the stock is up tremendously, Bank of America is actually increasing its buybacks for the first half of 2017, indicating that management feels that shares are still a compelling value. 4. Buy great high-dividend stocks on sale While much of the market was hitting record highs in 2016, the real estate sector was a big underperformer. Since equity REITs can be some of the best long-term dividend growth investments in the market, now is a good time to scoop up some of these on sale. One REIT in particular that I'm a big fan of is Realty Income (NYSE:O), which invests in freestanding retail properties, most which are occupied by businesses that are recession-resistant and not vulnerable to e-commerce competition. In addition, the company's long-term net leases add to the stability. You can read a complete description of Realty Income's business here, and now that it has fallen by 18% since mid-2016, this 4.1%-yielder looks like a good buy for long-term investors. O data by YCharts 5. Buy a home Before I say anything else about this one, you may have heard that your home is not a good investment. And that is a true statement, in the sense that if you put $200,000 into a stock index fund, it will likely grow much higher over time than the value of your home. Stocks have historically returned 9-10% per year, as compared with around 3% for home prices. However, a home is a smart investment in other ways. For starters, it takes the money you would otherwise be paying rent with, and turns it into a form of forced saving. Even if just 20% of your initial mortgage payment is going toward the principal, you're still building up a lot more equity than you would as a renter. Second, because you generally buy a home with leverage (aka borrowed money), those 3% annual price gains can be magnified considerably. For example, if you put $50,000 down on a $250,000 home, and over the next five years its value grows to $275,000, you have a gain of $25,000 -- 50% of your initial "investment." Finally, I like buying a home as an investment for the tax benefits. To be fair, you can only take advantage of these if you itemize deductions on your tax return, and there's no telling what could happen to them during the Trump presidency, but for now, this can be a big benefit. For example, if you live in a high-cost area, being able to deduct the mortgage interest and property taxes on a $500,000 home could easily translate into a $25,000 tax deduction or more every year.

Keris Alison Lahiff Jan 17, 2017 11:02 AM EST Stocks declined on Tuesday morning after President-elect Donald Trump introduced some volatility following comments on the U.S. dollar. The S&P 500 was down 0.17%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, and the Nasdaq slid 0.4%. Banks JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) led losses on Tuesday in a pullback following Friday's rally in financial stocks. The Volatility Index (VIX.X) increased 7%.  In an interview Friday with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said the U.S. dollar has become "too strong" and criticized China for what he sees as currency manipulation. Trump noted that U.S. "companies can't compete with [China] now because our currency is too strong and it's killing us." The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, was down 1.1% on Tuesday to 100.46. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday outlined long-awaited plans for Britain's exit from the European Union. The U.K. hopes to gain the greatest access to the European Union without being a member of it, May said in a highly anticipated speech on the country's plans for removal from the bloc. May also said she seeks to avoid a "cliff edge" that could prove disruptive and instead intends for the 'Brexit' to come in phases. The eventual deal would be voted upon in both houses of Parliament. The U.K. voted to exit the regional bloc in June after four decades of participation. "I want this United Kingdom to emerge from this period of change stronger, fairer, more united and more outward-looking than ever before," May told a London audience on Tuesday. "I want us to be a truly global Britain, the best friend and neighbor to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe too."

The high court let stand a New York appeals court ruling saying that 16 banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, had manipulated the Libor interest rate to boost profits. The case was brought by pensions, investors and individuals who owned bonds and other financial instruments that were impacted by Libor manipulation. The banks argued the investors had failed to show that they were sufficiently harmed. While the court rejected that argument, the suit goes back to federal court and could still get derailed. Libor has been a headache for Wall Street ever since 2012, when it was discovered that bankers had manipulated borrowing costs. Banks have paid billions in fines, and some individual traders have been slapped with criminal charges. The Supreme Court’s decision could allow for investors to reap billions of dollars from settlements, according to lawyers who have worked on similar antitrust lawsuits.

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Jan 17, 2017 at 11:02AM If you have some extra money to put to work, but don't quite know what to invest in, there's good news. The best investment ideas for 2017 include: Paying off your credit cards, buying real estate, high-quality dividend investments, and banking stocks. Here are the best ways to approach each of those. Image Source: Getty Images. 1. Pay off your credit cards I listed this one first for a reason, even though it technically isn't an "investment." Simply put, it doesn't make sense to buy stocks or any other type of investment if you have high-interest credit card debt. The reason is simple mathematics. If you have $5,000 in credit card debt at 18% interest, you're paying $900 per year just for the privilege of owing that money. When investing, the best you can reasonably hope to earn on a consistent basis is 10-12% returns per year. Even at the top end of that range, you can reasonably expect a $5,000 investment to return $600 in its first year, at most. In other words, by investing instead of paying credit card debt, you're setting yourself up to lose money. 2. Play a little defense The current bull market is the second-longest in history, and while that doesn't necessarily mean that stocks are going to fall, at some point, we're going to see a correction or even a full-blown recession -- it's just a matter of when. For this reason, I'm a fan of adding some defensive investments to your portfolio in 2017. And contrary to popular myths, being defensive doesn't mean avoiding stocks. One example would be to buy an index fund that invests in dividend growth stocks, which tend to fare better during recessions. The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:SDY), which tracks the S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, is one good option. 3.

Also, if Trump's tax cuts, infrastructure spending, and other initiatives create the kind of job and wage growth he claims they will, the banks could have more lending demand as well as higher deposit bases. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) is a good way to invest in the entire sector, and if you want to buy an individual stock, Bank of America is one of my favorites -- and my single largest stock holding -- as we head into 2017. As I wrote after the bank reported earnings, even though the stock is up tremendously, Bank of America is actually increasing its buybacks for the first half of 2017, indicating that management feels that shares are still a compelling value. 4.

And that is a true statement, in the sense that if you put $200,000 into a stock index fund, it will likely grow much higher over time than the value of your home. Stocks have historically returned 9-10% per year, as compared with around 3% for home prices. However, a home is a smart investment in other ways. For starters, it takes the money you would otherwise be paying rent with, and turns it into a form of forced saving. Even if just 20% of your initial mortgage payment is going toward the principal, you're still building up a lot more equity than you would as a renter. Second, because you generally buy a home with leverage (aka borrowed money), those 3% annual price gains can be magnified considerably. For example, if you put $50,000 down on a $250,000 home, and over the next five years its value grows to $275,000, you have a gain of $25,000 -- 50% of your initial "investment." Finally, I like buying a home as an investment for the tax benefits. To be fair, you can only take advantage of these if you itemize deductions on your tax return, and there's no telling what could happen to them during the Trump presidency, but for now, this can be a big benefit. For example, if you live in a high-cost area, being able to deduct the mortgage interest and property taxes on a $500,000 home could easily translate into a $25,000 tax deduction or more every year.

The justices rejected an appeal filed by a group of banks including Bank of America Corp, Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co of a May 2016 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed various lawsuits against them to proceed. The appeals court reversed a lower court judge's dismissal of investors' antitrust claims against the banks. Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions and is used to set rates on credit cards, student loans and mortgages. It is calculated based on submissions by banks that sit on panels. Investors including the University of California and cities such as Baltimore, Houston and Philadelphia accused the big banks of suppressing Libor during the 2007-2009 financial crisis to boost earnings or make their finances appear healthier. The appeals court ruling buttressed investors in several lawsuits in Manhattan seeking to hold banks liable for billions of dollars in damages for alleged price-fixing in U.S. Treasuries, commodities, currencies, derivatives and other rates. One such lawsuit, concerning credit default swaps, led to a $1.86 billion settlement in 2015 with a dozen banks. The appeals court ruling also overturned a 2013 dismissal by a federal judge in Manhattan of antitrust claims that could justify triple damages. Some other banks that were sued are Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Canada, Rabobank BA [RABOY.UL], Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Societe Generale. The private litigation is separate from Libor rigging probes that have resulted in roughly $9 billion of sanctions worldwide, including $2.5 billion against Deutsche Bank in April 2015. Several bank affiliates have pleaded guilty to criminal charges, and more than 20 people have been criminally charged.

In announcing earnings on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley detailed huge gains in bond trading, an area where it has long struggled. The bank also reported stronger revenue in equities trading, where Morgan Stanley is typically a leader, and said it was close to hitting targets for cost-cutting, wealth management profits and returns on shareholder equity. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. Morgan Stanley's trading results echoed those of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp last week, driven by Donald Trump's surprise election victory on Nov. 8 and U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to boost a key interest rate target in mid-December. Overall, Morgan Stanley's profit soared to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from $753 million a year earlier. Earnings per share increased to 81 cents from 39 cents, easily beating expectations. Analysts on average had forecast a profit of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue jumped 17 percent to $9 billion, beating the average estimate $8.5 billion. Bond trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion in the quarter from $550 million last year, the second-highest level since the first quarter of 2015 in what is typically a slow period for the business. The bond trading bump came after a 25 percent reduction in staff, and helped Morgan Stanley exceed Gorman's $1 billion-per-quarter bond-trading revenue benchmark for the full year. With interest rates positioned to rise further - which would prompt investors to shift positions again - Morgan Stanley's results "should not necessarily be seen as a fluke," Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said. However, the bank's finance chief, Jonathan Pruzan, struck a cautious tone. Morgan Stanley will not increase its quarterly target for the business until it is clear that recent revenue trends were sustainable, he said. "There is clearly optimism out there, but how long that holds is really a question, given that political and geopolitical events can change sentiment very quickly," Pruzan said in an interview. Morgan Stanley's shares were down 3 percent at $42.48 in afternoon trading, more than other large-cap banks whose shares were broadly down. Analysts said much of the positive earnings news was already priced into Morgan Stanley's stock, which had risen 28.5 percent from the election through Friday's close. Citigroup's Keith Horowitz said investors might also have been disappointed with Morgan Stanley management keeping 2017 guidance steady. While bond trading was the main driver of Morgan Stanley's earnings beat, it is the most volatile business on Wall Street and big swings in revenue are common. Analysts pointed to several other indications that the sixth-largest U.S. bank is on steadier financial footing. Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr highlighted gains in investment banking, lower expenses and "solid" results in wealth management. Morgan Stanley said it was on track to hit Gorman's $1 billion annual cost-cutting target, and its 22 percent wealth profit margin is close to the 23-to-25 percent range it aims to hit next year. The bank's return on equity was 8.7 percent in the quarter, short of Gorman's 9-to-11 percent target by the end of 2017. Morgan Stanley management "still feel(s) very good" about the bank's ability to hit that goal, Pruzan said. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley's chief rival, report results on Wednesday.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States What to Expect From 2 Megabanks Reporting Wednesday By Chris Lange January 17, 2017 10:10 am EST Print Email Tweet The U.S. economy is building momentum, and a large part of this has been the financial sector. A couple megabanks that have contributed massively to the rally are looking to report their latest earnings on Wednesday. So far the banks that have already reported, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have been solid wins for the industry, as all of them are well positioned to take advantage of the new administration’s policy decisions and the overall market sentiment going forward. The recent rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve might have been too late to impact the fourth-quarter of the major banks, but it sets an optimistic outlook for the industry. The question remains whether these results will set the tone for the rest of the earnings season. Looking at the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT: XLF), it has made strong gains since the November election. Specifically, it has gained 17.6% from November 8 to Friday’s close of $23.51, although this pales in comparison to some of the gains that these banks have made. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) is scheduled to reveal its fourth-quarter results Wednesday morning. The consensus estimates call for $4.82 in earnings per share (EPS), as well as $7.72 billion in revenue. The same period of last year reportedly had EPS of $1.27 and $7.27 billion in revenue. Shares were trading at $242.07 on Tuesday. The consensus price target is $240.04. The stock has a 52-week range of $138.20 to $247.77. So far the stock has gained 33% from November 8, but even more shocking a gain of 73.5% from the Brexit vote last summer. The latest quarterly earnings from Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) are due early on Wednesday as well. The consensus fourth-quarter forecast calls for $1.12 in EPS and revenue of $17.3 billion. In the same period of last year, it posted EPS of $1.06 and $18.64 billion in revenue. Its shares were last seen trading at $59.01, in a 52-week range of $34.52 to $61.63. The consensus price target is $64.31. So far the stock has gained 18% from November 8, but 53% since the Brexit vote.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 17, 2017 10:20am   Comments Share: This week, the rubber hits the road as more big banks report and other industries also begin to enter the earnings picture. But stocks looked likely to open lower Tuesday, hurt in part by Brexit concerns. British Prime Minister Theresa May appeared to put the United Kingdom on path toward a sharp break from the European Union, saying this morning, “What I am proposing cannot mean remaining in the single market,” The New York Times reported. Stock futures tumbled after her remarks. The dollar came under pressure too, apparently hurt by President-elect Trump’s comments over the weekend that the dollar was too strong. All this early excitement helped inject volatility into the market, with VIX rising 10% to 12.36. On the earnings watch, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) appeared to hit the ball out of the park, reporting an 83% jump in quarterly earnings due in part to a year-end surge in trading revenue associated with the post-election rally. Bond trading revenue looked especially strong. Quarterly profit increased to 81 cents a share, up from 39 cents in the same quarter a year earlier and above Wall Street analysts’ consensus of 65 cents a share. Sales increased 17% to $9.02 billion. That followed generally strong results last Friday from major financial names, particularly JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC). On a side note, MS announced cuts Friday in its investment banking units, so it could be interesting to see how that plays out over the longer haul, as investment banking places high in the business models of both MS and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS). Tomorrow brings two more financial behemoths in GS and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C), and then most of the big financial names are out of the way until next quarter. Once again, it may be wise for investors to look beyond the quarterly numbers and listen to what bank CEOs have to say about the economic outlook. With a new presidential administration taking office, it may be more important than ever to get a sense of what key executives think. Another major report is from managed health care company UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH), which released earnings before the open today and beat Wall Street’s estimates on both top- and bottom-lines. Health sector investors may want to listen for signals from UNH about the possible effects of the new administration and Congress, particularly what the company thinks of the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). UNH executives may also pinpoint trends in general medical spending. Wednesday morning brings the December consumer price index (CPI), after producer price index (PPI) data that came in pretty much as expected last Friday. Analysts on Wall Street expect a 0.3% rise in overall CPI, but just a 0.2% increase in the core number, according to Briefing.com. The November readings were 0.2% for both. There’s no major data on the calendar today. Beyond Banks The earnings season hit full stride last Friday when three big banks reported, and more major financial sector names are on the calendar this week. But now we start seeing some other industries come into the picture, with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) reporting on Wednesday, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) on Thursday, and General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) on Friday. NFLX is the first of the so-called “FANG” stocks to report, and the other members of this fraternity are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG). Some of these big names came under pressure after the election, but have shown more strength lately. NFLX says it’s now available in 190 countries, and grew its domestic subscribership in Q3. But some analysts point to increasing competition. The company’s Q3 earnings report was better than expected, so we’ll see tomorrow how NFLX follows that up. Singing the Biotech Blues The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, which crumbled at one point last week after remarks on drug pricing from President-elect Trump, managed to recover some losses by Friday. Still, there remains a lot of concern about how biotech might perform, as the industry has been under fire from both parties during the last year. Market performance reflects those concerns, with the index up a little more than 3% over the last three months, compared with a nearly 7% gain during that time period for the Nasdaq as a whole. Some of the biggest biotech stocks are flat or lower since the election. Consumer Sentiment In Line Initial January consumer sentiment slipped a touch to 98.1, the University of Michigan said Friday, down from 98.2 in December and a little under Wall Street analysts’ expectations.

 Here's how banks can deal with slowing mobile banking growth BI Intelligence Jan. 17, 2017, 10:11 AM 966 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also THE RETAILER MOBILE WALLETS REPORT: How stores can benefit from developing their own digital payments apps Credit cards are going the way of fax machines THE MOBILE PAYMENTS IN CHINA REPORT: What the US can learn from China's enormous success in mobile payments This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Three of the largest US banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo — held reported Q4 results on January 13. The banks, which posted mixed results, saw slowing growth in active mobile banking users. That could indicate market saturation and point to the need for banks to evolve their mobile strategy if they want to continue to capture and engage consumers.  This is how the banks stacked up: Bank of America now counts 21.6 million active mobile banking users, marking a 16% year-over- year (YoY) growth rate. JPMorgan Chase posted 26.5 million active mobile customers, up 14-16% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis. The bank added just 500,000 mobile banking users in the past quarter. For context, in the same period last year, the bank added 1.2 million mobile banking users. Wells Fargo still managed to add 800,000 mobile customers in the quarter, even after last year’s scandal that led to a slowdown in new accounts. That pushed total mobile users to 19.6 million, up 21% growth YoY. The bank counts an additional 7.8 million online banking users. Slowing gains in mobile banking users point to the idea that banks need to find better ways to capitalize on their mobile banking user base. The market is likely approaching saturation. When mobile banking was a new feature, banks offered it as a way to onboard customers and attract tech-savvy users, which led to rapid adoption. Now, it’s all but required — millennials, for example, will leave financial institutions that don’t offer the service. That means that, moving forward, it’s likely that the majority of mobile banking adds are new accounts, since existing users that want the service are already using it. Banks need to look to a service-based strategy in order to succeed. Since offering mobile banking is no longer enough, banks need to find ways to mobilize these massive user bases in order to increase engagement and loyalty, particularly because attrition is lower among mobile banking users, and they also tend to consume more banking products on average. One way to do that is to build hybrid offerings, which allow consumers to access important in-branch services, like ATMs or appointments, but building digital into that experience through cardless functionality or online booking. That could make interacting with the bank easier, which might push users to do it more regularly, making them more valuable.  Mobile payments are becoming more popular, but they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants. But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption. Here are some key takeaways from the report: In our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year. We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020. Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption. Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits. Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off. Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs. Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption. This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay. In full, the report: Forecasts the growth of US in-store mobile payments volume and users through 2020. Measures mobile wallet user engagement by forecasting mobile payments' share of their annual retail spending. Reviews the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Addresses the key barriers that are preventing mobile in-store payments from taking off. Identifies the growth drivers that will ultimately carve a path for mainstream adoption.

The pound, already up more than 1 percent as May began a keenly-awaited speech that had been extensively leaked to media, surged 2.5 percent on the day to a 10-day high of $1.2390 in the hour that followed. It also gained almost 2 percent to 86.38 pence against the euro, with dealers reporting a widespread squeeze on short positions – or bets against sterling – taken in derivatives markets in the past few days. One media report at the weekend had quoted a Downing Street source as predicting May’s speech would trigger a significant correction in the pound. Until Tuesday’s action most had assumed that would be downward, not upward. “In laying out the government’s 12 guiding principles for the upcoming negotiations, Mrs May did remove some key question marks about the government’s approach and promised that both houses of parliament would get to vote,” said JPMorgan Asset Management strategist Stephanie Flanders. “This seems to have reassured investors.” The FTSE 100 share index, which has tended to rise as sterling dropped in a series of sell-offs since the vote for Brexit last June, extended an early fall, led by exporters and mining companies, as May spoke. It last traded down 1.2 percent and was on track for its biggest daily fall since mid-November. May said she wanted to avoid a “disruptive cliff edge” for businesses when Britain leaves the European Union and backed a phasing-in of changes in immigration, customs and regulation in areas such as financial services. Short squeeze Analysts and traders said they expected more meat once the talks get under way after Britain triggers the EU’s Article 50 exit process in March. “The one revelation that stood out was the intention to put any deal before parliament, which in theory should tip the balance slightly further away from a hard Brexit,” said Craig Erlam, a strategist with Oanda in London. “This triggered a rally in the pound, which in turn was the catalyst for the short squeeze that followed.” Gilt yields, which have been falling as expectations for future UK growth suffered from concerns over the EU exit talks, rose around 2 basis points to 1.29 percent for 10-year paper. Overnight implied volatility – a measure of expected swings in the pound expressed through currency options – halved from six-month highs hit on Monday to 13.788 percent. One-week volatility fell from 15.5 percent to around 11.4 percent. “There was a lot of bad news in the market – people were positioned all one way, so there was always a risk (of a squeeze on those positions),” said Ian Gunner, a portfolio manager with Altana in London. “Some people will say ‘this is a hard Brexit, however she wants to dress it up’, and there will be criticisms from various politicians. But it’s a clean Brexit, and that’s the most important thing.” Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags 1998 2017 Brexit Pound Sterling Theresa May Previous Cyprus spokesman dismisses Erdogan map statement Next Lavrov: UN guarantees for Cyprus are best Related Articles Greek bond yields leap after failed bailout talks January 27, 2017 German prosecutors open fraud inquiry into former VW CEO January 27, 2017 Microsoft profit up as demand for cloud service soars January 27, 2017 Starbucks curbs 2017 revenue forecast after U.S. store visits drop January 27, 2017 Weak exports seen crimping U.S Q4 economic growth January 27, 2017 Foreign workers in Japan hit 1 million for the first time January 27, 2017 Australia’s LNG projects face major delays January 26, 2017 Lebanon opens five gas blocks January 26, 2017 After stronger 2016, Greece hopes lenders will drop austerity demands January 26, 2017 Check Also Australia’s Qantas restarts direct flights to Beijing after 8 years Australia’s Qantas Airways relaunched daily non-stop flights from Sydney to Beijing on Thursday ahead of … Iraq to double oil export capacity at terminal Iraq has started work to double the crude oil loading capacity at one of its … Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

CLARY/AFP/Getty Images Trump is expected to change many things for companies By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor CiaraLinnane Corporate news editor Investors hoping for insight on the outlook for 2017 during the fourth-quarter earnings season that kicked off Friday may be frustrated by the uncertainty surrounding the policies of a new administration. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged a number of measures viewed as potentially positive for the economy, including slashing regulations, reforming corporate taxes and launching a stimulus package focused on repairing and upgrading infrastructure. But then there’s Trump’s promise to bring jobs back for American workers by upending trade agreements and his aggressive use — even before his inauguration — of Twitter to shame big manufacturers like car makers into bringing jobs back from overseas centers like Mexico. See: Here’s why Trump’s inauguration could mark a near-term top for stocks “He wants a very aggressive pro-growth agenda,” said Steve Reitmeister, executive vice president of Zacks Investment Research. “Sounds great on the surface, except that if he pushes too hard on the gas pedal it will cause inflation. That is especially true with a nation near full employment that is already starting to show signs of wage price inflation.” The December jobs report showed wage growth at a seven-year high, its fastest pace since the Great Recession. The economy added 156,000 new jobs in the month. Lowering taxes and embarking on growth initiatives are strategies that are more typically used during the early stages of economic expansion, not eight years into one, said Reitmeister. Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA, agreed that expectations are for Trump policies to lead to an improvement in 2017 earnings, but advised caution. Trump’s actual policies are still unclear, and combined with the effects of a rising dollar and oil prices, will challenge management teams as they start to plan for the year ahead. Trump’s first press conference since July, held Wednesday, covered Russian relations, health care and the conflicts of interest with his now family-run Trump Organization, but didn’t extend to economic policy. Bell believes investors are pricing in a broad earnings beat for the fourth quarter, but she doubts results will “rock the market.” Don’t miss: What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry. “We expect guidance will unlikely move higher in the near term and could even be reduced from the current estimate, as is standard practice, disappointing investors and potentially causing a pullback or pause in the market,” she said. S&P 500 companies  SPX, -0.09%  are expected to report average earnings growth of 3.2% for the quarter, according to FactSet, after growth of 3.20% in the third quarter. Sales are expected to grow 4.2%, after growth of 2.77% in the third quarter. That was after four straight quarters of declining earnings and five straight quarter of declining sales. Energy and materials, which had weighed heavily on earnings in the last few years, are expected to lead the charge this quarter, as oil and other commodity prices have come back from their 2015 lows. See also: Energy companies are about ready to loosen the purse strings This earnings season marks a break with a long-held tradition: Aluminum giant Alcoa AA, +1.02%  was not the first company to post earnings, following its split into two companies. Instead, three big banks, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.21% Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.34%  and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, -1.03% led the way Friday. J.P. Morgan posted better-than-expected earnings thanks to buoyant trading revenue. The bank’s business tied to helping its clients buy and sell stocks, bonds and other securities, saw a 24% rise in revenue to $4.5 billion from $3.6 billion a year ago, with fixed-income specifically enjoying a more than 30% pop in revenue compared with the same period a year earlier. Those results helped the U.S.’s biggest bank by assets ring up a record annual profit of $24.73 billion, beating the previous record of $24.44 billion set in 2015. See: ‘Bearish divergence’ warns it isn’t safe to buy bank stocks Bank of America profit rose 43%, but revenue fell slightly short. Wells Fargo profit fell as mortgage revenue dipped and its recent sales-tactics scandal weighed. Don’t miss: End of a stock-market era: Alcoa breaks tradition of being first to report earnings See also: J.P. Morgan earnings: Expect a strong trading quarter and improved credit markets Here are five things to watch for this earnings season: The Trump factor Expect company conference calls to include plenty of mentions of the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to have a major impact on corporate behavior. His promise to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate, which at 35% is one of the highest in the world, and his pledge to give companies a tax holiday to encourage them to repatriate cash held overseas are expected to give some companies a bit of a windfall, if executed. That’s widely expected to boost share buybacks, which had begun to shrink in 2016 after years of spending. Goldman Sachs expects S&P 500 companies to spend about $780 billion on buybacks in 2017, up 30% from 2016. The bank is expecting 48% of an expected $2.6 trillion in corporate spending to go to shareholder rewards, either in the form of dividends or buybacks. Companies are likely to wait and see what tax moves are made before finalizing repatriation or buyback plans, so major announcements are unlikely this quarter. Still, General Motors Co. GM, -1.36%  said Tuesday it was adding $5 billion to its buyback program, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, -0.51%  said it would add $100 million to its $2.1 billion authorization and car parts-maker Visteon Corp. VC, -2.05%  approved a $400 million program. The big bad buck The strong dollar will once again be an easy target for companies that look to redirect blame should sales and earnings growth disappoint. Dollar strength relative to the currencies of countries in which a company does business lowers the value of profits and sales derived from those countries. A rising dollar also increases the prices of U.S. exports, reducing their appeal to overseas customers, and lowers the cost of imports, making them more attractive to U.S. consumers. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.03% which tracks the dollar against the currencies of six major trade partners, soared 7.1% during the fourth quarter, to take it 3.6% above where it was at the end of the same period a year ago. That was the biggest quarterly percentage gain in the buck since the first quarter of 2015. FactSet As J.P. Morgan equity strategists wrote in a recent note to clients, historically, a 6% rise in the trade-weighted dollar could cut S&P 500 earnings per share by 2% to 3%. So watch out for companies reporting EPS or sales growth rates using phrases such as “currency neutral,” or “constant currency” or “local currency,” which could overstate bottom-line results. There is good reason to expect the dollar to continue its upward trajectory if Trump keeps his policy promises. Fiscal stimulus by way of a big boost to infrastructure spending is expected to lead to further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, which in turn makes the dollar more attractive to foreign investors. And a potential byproduct of cash repatriation is dollar strength, because companies need to convert that cash to dollars before they can use it at home. The more money that is repatriated, the more dollars companies have to buy. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the information technology sector could be one of the hardest hit by the dollar’s rise, given its “substantial exposure to foreign sales.” The technology sector generated 58% of its revenue from international sources in 2015, according to data provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices, compared with the 44% exposure for the S&P 500. “The profits on non-U.S. revenues also tend to be relatively high, given generally lower tax obligations abroad,” Stovall said. A higher-than-usual EPS bar The biggest trick to beating expectations, is to lower those expectations enough to make them easier to beat. Quarterly earnings-per-share estimates for the S&P 500 have declined an average of 4.3% during that quarter over the past five years, and by an average of 5.6% over the past 10 years, according to data provided by FactSet. Don’t miss: Earnings beats are concealing bad results. Also read: Priceline investors are being fooled again. But the fourth quarter was different. The EPS estimate for the index declined just 2.2% from Sept. 30 through Dec. 31, according to FactSet. In addition, only 69% of S&P 500 companies that issued an EPS outlook during the quarter gave negative guidance, which is below the five-year average of 74%. The fact that the bar of expectations hasn’t been lowered as much as usual could make it harder to hurdle. With that in mind, the technology sector could be the most likely of the S&P 500’s 11 key sectors to get tripped up, as it was the only sector that has recorded an increase in expected earnings growth since the start of the quarter, of 1.3%. That contrasts with the average 3.8% drop over the past five years, FactSet said. The SPDR Technology Select Sector exchange-traded XLK, +0.40%  rose 1.2% during the fourth quarter, closing at a 16-year high on Dec. 27. Here's what Trump means for the tech industry(1:34) The incoming Trump administration has given Silicon Valley a headache, mainly due to potential plans to penalize companies that manufacture goods in China. But not all of Trump's proposed policies may have a harmful effect on the tech sector. Meanwhile, the sector that had its bar lowered the most was materials, which is expected to post year-over-year EPS growth of 4.3% as of Dec. 31, down from the 19.4% growth expected on Sept. 30. Rising rates a boon for banks but a concern for other sectors Another topic of company commentary will likely be the sharp rise in interest rates during the quarter, and expectations that they will continue to increase. While the financial sector may speak glowingly about the rising-rate environment, other sectors could use it as an excuse to provide conservative earnings guidance. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00%  soared 83.8 basis points (0.838 percentage points) during the fourth quarter, the biggest quarterly jump since the first quarter of 1994. The rate rally came one quarter after the yield hit a record low. The Federal Reserve raised its target for overnight interest rates during the just-completed quarter for only the second time since the Great Recession, and increased the number of expected rate hikes in 2017. FactSet Rising interest rates can provide a boost to bank profits and revenue, in the form of higher net interest income, as they increase what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, or loans, through shorter-term borrowings. The SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, -0.38%  soared 20% during the quarter, compared with a 3.3% gain in the S&P 500. Don’t miss: Financial stocks surge as Trump victory soothes regulatory fears, lifts rates. But other sectors may not be so upbeat about the interest-rate outlook, as J.P. Morgan strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said rising rates can act as “a gradual headwind to margins.” Lakos-Bujas said a 100-basis-point rise in the 10-year Treasury note yield should increase annual interest expenses for the S&P 500 by $15 billion in 2017, and by $19 billion in 2018, assuming all maturing debt is refinanced. Minding the GAAP Investors can expect this season’s earnings to be easier to follow, as the Securities and Exchange Commission has ramped up its efforts to ensure they fully comply with rules on the use of GAAP—or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles—and non-GAAP, adjusted numbers that companies argue can supplement officials ones and provide greater clarity for investors. The SEC issued new guidelines last May that oblige companies to give equal or greater prominence to GAAP numbers over non-GAAP one and explain how the two are reconciled. The regulator continued to send comment letters to companies that are failing to measure up during the fourth quarter, including some that MarketWatch had specifically highlighted in a series focusing on the issue.

Earnings applicable to common shareholders soared to $1.51-billion in the fourth quarter from $753-million a year earlier, while earnings per share increased to 81 cents from 39 cents, the bank said on Tuesday. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Bank stocks have rallied since the election, on the hope that the new Trump administration will usher in a new era of looser bank regulations along with economic growth. Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan, however, raised questions about how long this investor enthusiasm will last. “There is clearly optimism out there, but how long that holds is really a question, given that political and geopolitical events can change sentiment very quickly,” Pruzan said in an interview. Trading in debt securities and stocks shot up in the wake of Donald Trump’s surprise election victory on Nov. 8 as investors took the view that he would push policies that would boost the U.S. economy and kindle inflation. Revenue in the bank’s fixed-income business jumped to $1.5-billion in the quarter from $550-million in the same period last year. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the No. 1 U.S. bank by assets, had reported a 31-per cent rise fixed-income revenue last week, while second-ranked Bank of America Corp said its revenue from trading fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities rose 12 per cent. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley’s chief rival, report on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley’s shares were up 1.4 per cent at $44.40 in premarket trading, having risen 28.5 per cent since the election through Friday’s close. Revenue from equities trading, a business in which Morgan Stanley is typically strong, rose to $2-billion from $1.8-billion. Revenue from wealth management rose 6.4 per cent to $3.99-billion. The pretax margin in the business increased to 22 per cent from 20 per cent a year earlier. Total revenue jumped 16.6 per cent to $9.02-billion, beating the average estimate $8.47-billion. The bank’s return on equity was 8.7 per cent in the quarter, short of Chief Executive James Gorman’s target of 9 per cent to 11 per cent by the end of 2017. Investment banking revenue, which includes income from advising on mergers and acquisitions as well as underwriting bond and share offerings, rose 5.1 per cent to $1.38-billion. The bank, which has said it wants to cut costs by $1-billion this year, said non-interest expenses rose 7.6 per cent to $6.78-billion in the latest quarter. Total compensation and benefits expenses rose 11.9 per cent to $4.08-billion. Morgan Stanley ranked second in worldwide announced M&A deals during 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. The bank laid off a number of senior investment bankers earlier this month and cut bonuses by roughly 15 per cent, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Nonetheless, trading activity may be light ahead of the release of closely watched economic data later this week. Earnings season will also start to pick up steam in the comings days, with Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), American Express (AXP), IBM (IBM), and General Electric (GE) among a slew of companies due to report their quarterly results this week. Additionally, President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural address on Friday is also likely to attract considerable attention. While buying interest was somewhat subdued, stocks managed to end Friday's trading mostly higher. With the gains on the day, the tech-heavy Nasdaq reached a new record closing high. The Nasdaq climbed 26.63 points or 0.5 percent to 5,574.12, and the S&P 500 rose 4.20 points or 0.2 percent to 2,274.63. However, the Dow closed slightly lower, edging down 5.27 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 19,885.73. The major averages also turned in a mixed performance for the week. While the Nasdaq jumped by 1 percent, the Dow fell by 0.4 percent and the S&P 500 dipped by 0.1 percent. The mostly higher close on Wall Street came as traders digested earnings news from several financial giants as well as some key economic data. Before the start of trading, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported fourth quarter results that exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Bank of America (BAC) reported fourth quarter earnings that came in above analyst estimates, although its revenues for the quarter came in slightly below expectations. Wells Fargo (WFC) reported fourth quarter earnings that fell to $0.96 per share from $1.00 per share a year ago. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.03 per share. On the economic front, the Commerce Department released a report showing that retail sales rose by slightly less than expected in the month of December. The Commerce Department said retail sales climbed by 0.6 percent in December after edging up by a revised 0.2 percent in November. Economists had expected retail sales to increase by 0.7 percent. Excluding auto sales, retail sales inched up by 0.2 percent in December after rising by 0.3 percent in November. Ex-auto sales had been expected to climb by 0.5 percent. A separate report from the Labor Department showed that producer price growth came in line with economist estimates in December. The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose by 0.3 percent in December after climbing by 0.4 percent in November. Excluding food and energy prices, core producer prices edged up by 0.2 percent in December after rising by 0.4 percent in November. Core prices had been expected to inch up by 0.1 percent. The University of Michigan also released a report showing that its consumer sentiment index unexpectedly edged down to 98.1 in January from 98.2 in December. Most of the major sectors showed relatively modest moves on the day, although oil service stocks moved lower along with the price of crude oil. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are climbing $0.84 to $53.21 a barrel after falling $0.64 to $52.37 a barrel last Friday. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is trading at $1,212.40, up $16.20 from the previous session's close of $1,196.20. On Friday, gold fell $3.60 On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 113.43 yen compared to the 114.20 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Friday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0674 compared to Friday's $1.0601. Asia Asian stock markets ended mixed on Tuesday as investors turned cautious ahead of U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's speech on her government's Brexit plans and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration later this week. Japanese stocks fell for a second straight day, as the yen strengthened on safe-haven demand and weighed on exporters. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index lost 281.71 points or 1.48 percent to finish at 18,813.53. Among the major exporters, Canon and Panasonic fell 1.2 percent each, while Sony edged down 0.3 percent. Automaker Toyota lost 1.6 percent and Honda fell 2.7 percent. The Australian market closed lower amid cautious trades, with banking stocks among the major losers. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 49.00 points or 0.85 percent to close at 5,699.40 and the broader All Ordinaries fell 48.30 points or 0.83 percent to settle at 5,754.70. In the banking space, ANZ Banking, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac closed lower in a range of 0.9 percent to 1.3 percent. Among the major miners, Rio Tinto declined 0.8 percent after the company said it shipped iron ore from its Pilbara operations in line with its lowered full-year guidance. Fortescue Metals named travel group Helloworld's former chief executive Elizabeth Gaines as its new chief finance officer. However, the miner's shares declined more than 3 percent. Meanwhile, China's Shanghai Composite Index rose 5.35 points or 0.17 percent to close at 3,108.77, snapping a five-session losing streak. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also climbed 112.82 points or 0.5 percent to 22,840.97. Europe The major European markets have moved to the downside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has slumped by 0.9 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.2 percent and the German DAX Index is just below the unchanged line. In a highly anticipated speech, British Prime Minister Theresa May said the U.K. will not seek to "hold on to bits of EU membership." The U.K. also will not seek to adopt deals that are already available to other countries, May said in a speech at the Lancaster House. Britain "cannot be half in and half out," she said. Britain will also not seek to remain in the single market, as it would mean not leaving the EU at all, May said. However, she said the country will try to gain the "greatest possible" access to the EU. On the economic front, the Office for National Statistics said U.K. inflation reached its highest level in more than two years at the end of 2016 on air fares and food prices. Consumer price inflation increased more than expected to 1.6 percent in December from 1.2 percent in November. The Office for National Statistics also said input prices once again logged double-digit growth in December, climbing by 15.8 percent after rising 13.3 percent in November. Economists had forecast a 15.5 percent increase. Meanwhile, German economic sentiment improved to its highest level in seven months in January, as expectations were boosted by a strong run of positive data toward the end of last year. The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany rose to 16.6 from 13.8 in December. However, economists had forecast a score of 18.4. U.S. Economic Reports A number of key economic reports are scheduled to be released this week, including reports on industrial production, consumer prices, and housing starts. The Federal Reserve is also due to release its Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic conditions in the twelve Fed districts, which may shed some light on the outlook for interest rates. Growth in New York manufacturing activity has seen a modest slowdown in the month of January, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The New York Fed said its general business conditions index edged down to 6.5 in January from a revised 7.6 in December, although a positive reading still indicates growth. Economists had expected the general business conditions index to dip to 8.0 from the 9.0 originally reported for the previous month. Fed Governor Lael Brainard is due to discuss the impact of fiscal policy on monetary policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. at 10 am ET. At 6 pm ET, San Francisco Fed President John C. Williams will be the keynote speaker at the Sacramento Business Review Economic Forecast at Sacramento State University in California. Stocks In Focus Morgan Stanley (MS) reported fourth quarter earnings and revenues that exceeded analyst estimates, benefiting from a surge in trading activity after the presidential election. Health insurer UnitedHealth (UNH) also reported better than expected fourth quarter results and affirmed its 2017 financial outlook. Walmart (WMT) announced plans to create approximately 10,000 retail jobs through the opening of 59 new, expanded and relocated Walmart and Sam's Club facilities as well as e-commerce services. The retail giant said the moves would support about 24,000 construction jobs. British American Tobacco (BTI) agreed to buy the remaining 57.8 percent of Reynolds American (RAI) in a $49.4 billion cash and stock deal. The British tobacco giant currently owns 42.2 percent of Reynolds. Chinese Internet search provider Baidu (BIDU) announced the appointment of Qi Lu as Group President and Chief Operating Officer, effective immediately. Progress Software Corp. (PRGS) reported that its fourth quarter net loss widened to $1.52 per share from $0.19 per share last year, reflecting an impairment charge. The company reported adjusted earnings of $0.62 per share. Progress also said its Chief Operating Officer Jerry Rulli will be leaving at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2017. The company also intends to reduce its headcount by approximately 450 employees, totaling over 20 percent of its workforce. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February In Memorium: Business Giants We Lost In 2016 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico Chevron Turns To Profit In Q4, But Results Miss Estimates Air Products Sees Q2, FY17 Adj.

Keep me logged in I forgot my password No Thanks Briefing highlights Loonie at mercy of Trump's first 100 days Analysts expect Canadian dollar to slump CMHC to raise mortgage insurance premiums Global stock markets slide BAT strikes deal for the rest of Reynolds ‘Skewed to the bearish’ The Canadian dollar will soon be at the mercy of Donald Trump’s first 100 days as U.S. president. No one can predict what will happen with any certainty because of the lack of any certainty surrounding Mr. Trump’s fiscal and economic programs. But most analysts expect the loonie to fall. As JPMorgan Chase puts it, the risks to the Canadian dollar from developments in the United States are “firmly skewed to the bearish side.” It’s not just how the U.S. dollar fares after Mr. Trump takes office. Everything is in play, from economic growth to inflation and interest-rate expectations and, most importantly, trade. It’s the latter that has everyone wondering. While Mr. Trump’s threats have been largely aimed at China and Mexico, Canada can’t help but be caught up in the new administration’s trade policies. And, lest we forget, there are the usual suspects such as oil prices and Bank of Canada policy. “While the incoming news and information are mixed, we see a likely still dovish BoC, rich pricing, benign positioning, and most importantly collateral risks from U.S. trade policy in the first 100 days of the incoming Trump administration all skewed for more CAD weakness in the coming months,” said Daniel Hui and Niall O’Connor of JPMorgan. “Trump has not directly mentioned Canada, but trade policy of the incoming administration is still a very significant risk,” they added in a recent report in advance of Friday’s inauguration. “It is true that Canada is not a target of the president-elect’s trade rhetoric. But this does not mean that Canada would be immune from potential U.S. policy once the new administration takes office.” Crucial here are the administration’s plans for the North American free-trade agreement, which Mr. Trump has demanded be renegotiated or even killed, and Republican proposals for a “border adjustment tax” that could wound Canada. Border taxes such as Canada’s GST on imports are already a hot-button issue for Mr. Trump’s team. “This could come as a key element of the renegotiation of NAFTA, or as part of the U.S.’s own adoption of a border adjustment regime as part of comprehensive tax reform,” said Mr. Hui and Mr. O’Connor. “Discussions on both trade deal renegotiation and tax reform could begin within the new administration’s first 100 days.… For an economy for whom 77 per cent of exports are shipped to the U.S., and who has been struggling with a post-commodities supercycle rebalancing process, any disruption from U.S. trade policy would be a significant negative macro shock.” The loonie has bounced up and down since Mr. Trump won the November election, and analysts generally expect it to erode to between about 70 cents (U.S.) to 72 cents from its current level around the 76-cent mark. JPMorgan now sees the loonie at just shy of 71 cents by mid-2017, picking up to 72.5 cents in the second half the year. Some see it falling even further. The loonie was above 76.5 cents by mid-morning as the U.S. dollar sank again. Paul Ashworth, the chief North American economist at Capital Economics, said the Canadian dollar should actually change little, ending the year at about 77 cents, all things being equal. All things being equal is a key factor for Mr. Ashworth, given the lack of clarity surrounding Mr. Trump’s plans. But a border adjustment tax could be a biggie. “That would put upward pressure on the price of imported goods in the U.S. and downward pressure on U.S. export prices which, together, would push the U.S. dollar higher,” Mr. Ashworth said. “In the extreme, a 20-per-cent border-adjusted corporate tax could generate a 20-per-cent to 25-per-cent increase in the trade-weighted U.S. dollar, which would push the Canadian dollar down to below $0.60,” he added. “We are skeptical that the U.S. dollar would increase by quite that much, however, particularly not in the first 12 months. Nevertheless, if Congress did pass what would be a revolutionary change in the nature of U.S. corporate tax, the Canadian dollar would undoubtedly weaken from current levels and possibly quite substantially.” Capital Economics believes the proposal will die, a victim of trade lobbyists. But, then again, “we also thought that Hillary Clinton would win last year’s election,” said Mr. Ashworth. As for actual trade, Ontario and New Brunswick would be hit hardest by such a tax, said Warren Lovely, National Bank’s head of public sector research and strategy. “No province should be cheering the emergence of a more inwardly focused/protectionist U.S. administration, but for some, the successful diversification away from the U.S. – British Columbia has done the best job here – or a much greater reliance on low-elasticity sectors like energy/metals/minerals – the three oil-producing provinces come to mind – could significantly blunt the fallout,” Mr. Lovely said. “Let’s hope this comes to nothing, but as is the case with any number of economic, fiscal, financial metrics, not all provinces are created equal,” he added. “Alberta’s economy has had a tough go of late, but here’s one area where it’s relatively better positioned, as the province’s crude will likely continue to flow southbound with or without a border tax.” One thing is clear: Markets can expect world currencies to be in flux after Mr. Trump goes to Washington. “In the immediate wake of the elections in November, markets latched onto a Trump policy narrative that primarily focused on the reflationary aspects of the president-elect’s campaign rhetoric, but downplayed many other potential aspects of the new administration’s broader platform,” said JPMorgan’s Mr. Hui and Mr. O’Connor. “Markets may be currently in the process of a substantial reassessment of Trump’s approach towards economic policy following a disappointing first press conference in which the president-elect passed on the opportunity to comment on tax cuts, infrastructure spending, or deregulation (the core pillars of the ‘Trumpflation’ market narrative).” Indeed, the U.S. dollar slumped after that news conference, sending the Canadian dollar up to almost 77 cents at one point. “He instead focused on a multitude of political issues, but also highlighted more confrontational approaches towards economic policy, including border adjustments and punishment of firms engaged in production offshoring,” Mr. Hui and Mr. O’Connor said. “Certainly the inauguration address on Jan. 20 is an even more significant opportunity for Trump to present his vision and policy priorities, and thus for the market consensus to recalibrate baseline policy assumptions, while policy actions in the first 100 days will be continually benchmarked against market consensus expectations.” More on this topic How 149 world currencies fared against the loonie in 2016 The Trump dump: U.S. dollar's woes drive loonie higher Jeffrey Jones: Trump stance on trade to keep loonie under pressure Scott Barlow: The year ahead is going to get nasty for the loonie Some harsh views of Canada's economy and its loonie U.S. firms could move billions out of Canada What haunts the loonie: Suddenly, a 74-cent dollar CMHC raising premiums Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. is raising mortgage insurance premiums for home buyers, The Globe and Mail’s Tamsin McMahon reports. “We do not expect the higher premiums to have a significant impact on the ability of Canadians to buy a home,” said Steven Mennill, CMHC’ senior vice-resident of insurance, in a news release. “Over all, the changes will preserve competition in the mortgage loan insurance industry and contribute to financial stability.” The changes reflect stricter new capital requirements for mortgage lenders that the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions introduced at the start of the year.

The almost $50-billion (U.S.) cash-and-stock agreement, which will give BAT the 58 per cent of Reynolds it doesn’t already hold, will bring together the Newport, Kent and Pall Mall brands, among others, and create a company “with a world class pipeline of vapour and tobacco heating products,” BAT said. The companies expect to save at least $400-million in annual costs by the end of the third year of their marriage.

About 3,000 people were expected to arrive this week in the Swiss Alps region of Davos, Switzerland, to discuss matters like financial markets and automation, Fortune reported. The forum, which kicked off Monday evening, will host some of the world’s most significant leaders, philanthropists, academics and CEOs in the world. This year, attendees will include Vice President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, among others. “The World Economic Forum is an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas,” the site describes the prestigious, high-profile gathering. There will be nearly 400 events taking place at Davos 2017 and the forum will run through Friday. Daily live streams of the events will be available on the World Economic Forum website, as well as on through services live the Apple Store, Google Play and Roku. Related Stories World Economic Forum 2017 To Kick Off In Davos South Africa's Leader Slammed For Skipping Davos Panel On Africa The events are hosted in a number of languages, including Chinese, German, French and Spanish. The forum was first founded by an economics professor by the name of Klaus Schwab, according to the New York Times. The event was founded in 1971 and was created as a hub for European businessman and leaders to gather. The premise of the conference eventually shifted to include social and global economic issues, which would draw world leaders and businessmen from around the globe. Xi helped kick off the event Tuesday with a speech on global trade. "No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war. Pursuing protectionism is just like locking one's self in a dark room: wind and rain might be kept outside but so are light and air," he said.   Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

The justices rejected an appeal filed by a group of banks including Bank of America Corp, Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co of a May 2016 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed various lawsuits against them to proceed. The appeals court reversed a lower court judge's dismissal of investors' antitrust claims against the banks. Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions and is used to set rates on credit cards, student loans and mortgages. It is calculated based on submissions by banks that sit on panels. Investors including the University of California and cities such as Baltimore, Houston and Philadelphia accused the big banks of suppressing Libor during the 2007-2009 financial crisis to boost earnings or make their finances appear healthier. The appeals court ruling buttressed investors in several lawsuits in Manhattan seeking to hold banks liable for billions of dollars in damages for alleged price-fixing in U.S. Treasuries, commodities, currencies, derivatives and other rates. One such lawsuit, concerning credit default swaps, led to a $1.86 billion settlement in 2015 with a dozen banks. The appeals court ruling also overturned a 2013 dismissal by a federal judge in Manhattan of antitrust claims that could justify triple damages. Some other banks that were sued are Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Canada, Rabobank BA , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Societe Generale. The private litigation is separate from Libor rigging probes that have resulted in roughly $9 billion of sanctions worldwide, including $2.5 billion against Deutsche Bank in April 2015. Several bank affiliates have pleaded guilty to criminal charges, and more than 20 people have been criminally charged.

Posted 17 Jan 2017 20:10 Updated 18 Jan 2017 05:35 The corporate logo of financial firm Morgan Stanley is pictured on the company's world headquarters in New York, New York January 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Morgan Stanley's profit doubled in the fourth quarter as trading activity surged across Wall Street, and the bank said it was on track to reach a number of financial goals set out by Chief Executive James Gorman. In announcing earnings on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley detailed huge gains in bond trading, an area where it has long struggled. The bank also reported stronger revenue in equities trading, where Morgan Stanley is typically a leader, and said it was close to hitting targets for cost-cutting, wealth management profits and returns on shareholder equity. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. Morgan Stanley's trading results echoed those of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp last week, driven by Donald Trump's surprise election victory on Nov. 8 and U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to boost a key interest rate target in mid-December. Overall, Morgan Stanley's profit soared to US$1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from US$753 million a year earlier. Earnings per share increased to 81 cents from 39 cents, easily beating expectations. Analysts on average had forecast a profit of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue jumped 17 percent to US$9 billion, beating the average estimate US$8.5 billion. Bond trading revenue rose to US$1.5 billion in the quarter from US$550 million last year, the second-highest level since the first quarter of 2015 in what is typically a slow period for the business. The bond trading bump came after a 25 percent reduction in staff, and helped Morgan Stanley exceed Gorman's US$1 billion-per-quarter bond-trading revenue benchmark for the full year. With interest rates positioned to rise further - which would prompt investors to shift positions again - Morgan Stanley's results "should not necessarily be seen as a fluke," Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said. However, the bank's finance chief, Jonathan Pruzan, struck a cautious tone. Morgan Stanley will not increase its quarterly target for the business until it is clear that recent revenue trends were sustainable, he said. "There is clearly optimism out there, but how long that holds is really a question, given that political and geopolitical events can change sentiment very quickly," Pruzan said in an interview. Morgan Stanley's shares were down 3 percent at US$42.48 in afternoon trading, more than other large-cap banks whose shares were broadly down. Analysts said much of the positive earnings news was already priced into Morgan Stanley's stock, which had risen 28.5 percent from the election through Friday's close. Citigroup's Keith Horowitz said investors might also have been disappointed with Morgan Stanley management keeping 2017 guidance steady. While bond trading was the main driver of Morgan Stanley's earnings beat, it is the most volatile business on Wall Street and big swings in revenue are common. Analysts pointed to several other indications that the sixth-largest U.S. bank is on steadier financial footing. Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr highlighted gains in investment banking, lower expenses and "solid" results in wealth management. Morgan Stanley said it was on track to hit Gorman's US$1 billion annual cost-cutting target, and its 22 percent wealth profit margin is close to the 23-to-25 percent range it aims to hit next year. The bank's return on equity was 8.7 percent in the quarter, short of Gorman's 9-to-11 percent target by the end of 2017. Morgan Stanley management "still feel(s) very good" about the bank's ability to hit that goal, Pruzan said. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley's chief rival, report results on Wednesday.

"Free trade is always better than no trade, and we need to ensure … that it is inclusive and the benefits are shared," the chairman told "Worldwide Exchange." Frenkel said that those who are demonstrably against free trade misconstrue the issue, which in truth is less about trade and more about how to combat inevitable job losses stemming from problems outside of the global supply chain. "If you ask people who are against free trade, they will never tell you that they are against the benefits from trade. They will tell you that they are against some of the negative consequences that some parts of society are suffering," Frenkel said. "Well, if that's the case, then the focus of debate should not be about trade but rather how to alleviate the hardship that occasionally occurs," he continued. Job retraining and trade-adjustment assistance were two fiscal solutions that came to mind for Frenkel, who insisted that trade policy was not the fix to problems that some in Washington pin on globalized trade.

May said Britain would leave the European Union's single market when it exits the EU, but the final deal would be put to a parliamentary vote, helping U.S. stock futures trim some losses. The dollar index fell 0.5 percent against a basket of major currencies after Trump told the Wall Street Journal that U.S. companies could not compete with China "because our currency is too strong. And it's killing us". Investors are also focusing on quarterly earnings. Morgan Stanley rose about 1 percent to $44.30 premarket after reporting a quarterly profit that flew past expectations, continuing a trend set by Bank of America and JPMorgan on Friday. Dow component UnitedHealth edged up 0.12 percent to $162 after the largest U.S. health insurer reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.

"There have been some favorable comments from Prime Minister May on Brexit, and with oil and gold prices higher and the dollar moving lower, I think we can cushion any steep losses today," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Gold prices surged more than 1 percent, trading at a near two-month high, while the Japanese yen rose to a six-week high. Oil prices ticked up 1.5 percent, benefiting from the weak dollar.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Morgan Stanley's profit doubles on bond-trading surge ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Morgan Stanley's profit doubles on bond-trading surge By By Olivia Oran and Sruthi Shankar Published January 17, 2017 Markets Reuters Facebook Twitter Print The corporate logo of financial firm Morgan Stanley is pictured on the company's world headquarters in New York, New York January 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo (Copyright Reuters 2017) Morgan Stanley's profit doubled in the fourth quarter as trading activity surged across Wall Street, and the bank said it was on track to reach a number of financial goals set out by Chief Executive James Gorman. Continue Reading Below In announcing earnings on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley detailed huge gains in bond trading, an area where it has long struggled. The bank also reported stronger revenue in equities trading, where Morgan Stanley is typically a leader, and said it was close to hitting targets for cost-cutting, wealth management profits and returns on shareholder equity. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. Morgan Stanley's trading results echoed those of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp last week, driven by Donald Trump's surprise election victory on Nov. 8 and U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to boost a key interest rate target in mid-December. Overall, Morgan Stanley's profit soared to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from $753 million a year earlier. Earnings per share increased to 81 cents from 39 cents, easily beating expectations. Analysts on average had forecast a profit of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue jumped 17 percent to $9 billion, beating the average estimate $8.5 billion. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Bond trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion in the quarter from $550 million last year, the second-highest level since the first quarter of 2015 in what is typically a slow period for the business. The bond trading bump came after a 25 percent reduction in staff, and helped Morgan Stanley exceed Gorman's $1 billion-per-quarter bond-trading revenue benchmark for the full year. With interest rates positioned to rise further - which would prompt investors to shift positions again - Morgan Stanley's results "should not necessarily be seen as a fluke," Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said. However, the bank's finance chief, Jonathan Pruzan, struck a cautious tone. Morgan Stanley will not increase its quarterly target for the business until it is clear that recent revenue trends were sustainable, he said. "There is clearly optimism out there, but how long that holds is really a question, given that political and geopolitical events can change sentiment very quickly," Pruzan said in an interview. Morgan Stanley's shares were down 3 percent at $42.48 in afternoon trading, more than other large-cap banks whose shares were broadly down. Analysts said much of the positive earnings news was already priced into Morgan Stanley's stock, which had risen 28.5 percent from the election through Friday's close. Citigroup's Keith Horowitz said investors might also have been disappointed with Morgan Stanley management keeping 2017 guidance steady. While bond trading was the main driver of Morgan Stanley's earnings beat, it is the most volatile business on Wall Street and big swings in revenue are common. Analysts pointed to several other indications that the sixth-largest U.S. bank is on steadier financial footing. Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr highlighted gains in investment banking, lower expenses and "solid" results in wealth management. Morgan Stanley said it was on track to hit Gorman's $1 billion annual cost-cutting target, and its 22 percent wealth profit margin is close to the 23-to-25 percent range it aims to hit next year. The bank's return on equity was 8.7 percent in the quarter, short of Gorman's 9-to-11 percent target by the end of 2017. Morgan Stanley management "still feel(s) very good" about the bank's ability to hit that goal, Pruzan said. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley's chief rival, report results on Wednesday.

Earnings soared to $1.51 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31 from $753 million a year earlier, while earnings per share increased to 81 cents from 39 cents. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Trading in debt securities and stocks shot up in the wake of Donald Trump’s surprise election victory on Nov. 8 as investors took the view that he would push policies that would boost the US economy and kindle inflation. Revenue in the bank’s fixed-income business jumped to $1.5 billion in the quarter from $550 million in the same period last year, an increase of about 173 percent. JPMorgan Chase, the No. 1 US bank by assets, reported a 31 percent rise in fixed-income revenue last week, while second-ranked Bank of America said its revenue from trading fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities rose 12 percent. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley’s traditional rival, reports on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley’s shares were up 1.6 percent at $44.49 in premarket trading, having risen 28.5 percent since the election. Investors hope Trump will usher in a new era of looser bank regulations along with economic growth. “We reported solid results in sales and trading and advisory and record revenues in wealth management, while managing expenses prudently,” Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said in a statement. Revenue from equities trading, a business in which Morgan Stanley is typically strong, rose to $2 billion from $1.8 billion. Revenue from wealth management, which Morgan Stanley has been building for several years, rose 6.4 percent to $3.99 billion. The pretax margin in the business increased to 22 percent from 20 percent a year earlier. Total revenue jumped 16.6 percent to $9.02 billion, beating the average estimate $8.47 billion. The bank’s return on equity was 8.7 percent in the quarter, short of Gorman’s target of 9 percent to 11 percent by the end of 2017. Investment banking revenue, which includes income from advising on mergers and acquisitions as well as underwriting bond and share offerings, rose 5.1 percent to $1.38 billion. The bank, which has said it wants to cut costs by $1 billion this year, said non-interest expenses rose 7.6 percent to $6.78 billion in the latest quarter. Total compensation and benefits expenses rose 11.9 percent to $4.08 billion. Morgan Stanley ranked second in worldwide announced M&A deals during 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. The bank laid off a number of senior investment bankers earlier this month and cut bonuses by roughly 15 percent, according to sources familiar with the matter.

In announcing earnings on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley detailed huge gains in bond trading, an area where it has long struggled. The bank also reported stronger revenue in equities trading, where Morgan Stanley is typically a leader, and said it was close to hitting targets for cost-cutting, wealth management profits and returns on shareholder equity. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. Morgan Stanley's trading results echoed those of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp last week, driven by Donald Trump's surprise election victory on Nov. 8 and U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to boost a key interest rate target in mid-December. Overall, Morgan Stanley's profit soared to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from $753 million a year earlier. Earnings per share increased to 81 cents from 39 cents, easily beating expectations. Analysts on average had forecast a profit of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue jumped 17 percent to $9 billion, beating the average estimate $8.5 billion. Bond trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion in the quarter from $550 million last year, the second-highest level since the first quarter of 2015 in what is typically a slow period for the business. The bond trading bump came after a 25 percent reduction in staff, and helped Morgan Stanley exceed Gorman's $1 billion-per-quarter bond-trading revenue benchmark for the full year. With interest rates positioned to rise further - which would prompt investors to shift positions again - Morgan Stanley's results "should not necessarily be seen as a fluke," Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said.

Earnings applicable to the bank’s common shareholders soared to US$1.51bil (RM6.74bil) in the three months ended Dec 31 from US$753mil (RM3.36bil) a year earlier, while earnings per share increased to 81 cents from 39 cents.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:10 PM, January 17, 2017 Updated: 5:50 AM, January 18, 2017 Morgan Stanley's profit doubled in the fourth quarter as trading activity surged across Wall Street, and the bank said it was on track to reach a number of financial goals set out by Chief Executive James Gorman. In announcing earnings on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley detailed huge gains in bond trading, an area where it has long struggled. The bank also reported stronger revenue in equities trading, where Morgan Stanley is typically a leader, and said it was close to hitting targets for cost-cutting, wealth management profits and returns on shareholder equity. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. Morgan Stanley's trading results echoed those of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp last week, driven by Donald Trump's surprise election victory on Nov. 8 and U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to boost a key interest rate target in mid-December. Overall, Morgan Stanley's profit soared to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from $753 million a year earlier. Earnings per share increased to 81 cents from 39 cents, easily beating expectations. Analysts on average had forecast a profit of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue jumped 17 percent to $9 billion, beating the average estimate $8.5 billion. Bond trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion in the quarter from $550 million last year, the second-highest level since the first quarter of 2015 in what is typically a slow period for the business. The bond trading bump came after a 25 percent reduction in staff, and helped Morgan Stanley exceed Gorman's $1 billion-per-quarter bond-trading revenue benchmark for the full year. With interest rates positioned to rise further - which would prompt investors to shift positions again - Morgan Stanley's results "should not necessarily be seen as a fluke," Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said. However, the bank's finance chief, Jonathan Pruzan, struck a cautious tone. Morgan Stanley will not increase its quarterly target for the business until it is clear that recent revenue trends were sustainable, he said. "There is clearly optimism out there, but how long that holds is really a question, given that political and geopolitical events can change sentiment very quickly," Pruzan said in an interview. Morgan Stanley's shares were down 3 percent at $42.48 in afternoon trading, more than other large-cap banks whose shares were broadly down. Analysts said much of the positive earnings news was already priced into Morgan Stanley's stock, which had risen 28.5 percent from the election through Friday's close. Citigroup's Keith Horowitz said investors might also have been disappointed with Morgan Stanley management keeping 2017 guidance steady. While bond trading was the main driver of Morgan Stanley's earnings beat, it is the most volatile business on Wall Street and big swings in revenue are common. Analysts pointed to several other indications that the sixth-largest U.S. bank is on steadier financial footing. Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr highlighted gains in investment banking, lower expenses and "solid" results in wealth management. Morgan Stanley said it was on track to hit Gorman's $1 billion annual cost-cutting target, and its 22 percent wealth profit margin is close to the 23-to-25 percent range it aims to hit next year. The bank's return on equity was 8.7 percent in the quarter, short of Gorman's 9-to-11 percent target by the end of 2017. Morgan Stanley management "still feel(s) very good" about the bank's ability to hit that goal, Pruzan said. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley's chief rival, report results on Wednesday.

He says the cryptocurrency will never replace its traditional forebears, and he calls most of its proponents fanatics. But for Zhou, a 35-year-old high-speed trader in Beijing, bitcoin is also too good to resist. His computers trade it 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Using lightning quick orders, they profit from tiny price discrepancies on the myriad venues where it changes hands.

Lisa Murray investigates. "It's the golden age to be in the bitcoin market, because it's imperfect," said Zhou, a former IBM technology consultant whose firm, Fintech Blockchain Group, runs a bitcoin hedge fund and venture capital fund. Forget libertarians, speculative individual investors and Chinese savers trying to spirit money overseas. The reality is that professionals armed with cutting-edge technology now drive as much as 80 per cent of bitcoin trading, mimicking strategies honed by some of the biggest players on Wall Street. To them, bitcoin is just the latest asset class ripe for conquering with machines. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Professionals armed with cutting-edge technology now drive as much as 80 per cent of bitcoin trading. Photo: Bloomberg The cryptocurrency's market structure ticks all the right boxes: arbitrage opportunities across multiple exchanges, zero transaction costs on Chinese venues that host most of the world's turnover, round-the-clock trading, and co-location services allowing participants to place their servers right next to those of the exchange. With volumes tracked by Bitcoinity.org surging to a record this month, there's been no shortage of chances for high-speed traders to turn a profit. Exactly how much they're making is hard to pin down, because the vast majority aren't required to disclose performance figures (Zhou declined to comment on his). Chinese banks were banned from trading bitcoin in 2013, while capital controls mean foreign firms have a small presence on China's exchanges. Advertisement One of the few traders willing to talk about their returns is Chen Zhenguo, who founded China's largest platform for facilitating automated bitcoin strategies. Chen says he's generated annualized gains of 50 per cent for his own account, though he declined a Bloomberg News request to provide transaction details verifying his claims, saying they're private. "Bitcoin has a natural advantage when it comes to automated trading," said Chen, 30, whose Beijing-based BotVS allows clients to run live trials of their bitcoin algorithms on 23 exchanges. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link There's been no shortage of chances for high-speed traders to turn a profit. Photo: Bloomberg Like all markets, the one for bitcoin comes with risks. At least two exchanges, Bitfinex and Mt. Gox, have suffered cyber attacks that saddled traders with losses since 2011. The cryptocurrency's extreme price swings -- average daily moves over the past year were three times bigger than those in the S&P 500 Index - have deterred some high-speed firms, while the increasing dominance of sophisticated traders begs the question of how long the juiciest arbitrage opportunities will last. There's also growing concern over a regulatory crackdown in China, where authorities are wary of any investment vehicle that might help citizens move wealth overseas. The nation's central bank conducted on-site inspections at some of the biggest bitcoin exchanges this month, looking for evidence of violations including market manipulation and money laundering. Similar scrutiny of stock-index futures in 2015 led to trading restrictions that cut volumes by 99 per cent. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link There is growing concern over a regulatory crackdown in China. Photo: Bloomberg Still, policy makers could decide the bitcoin market is too small to warrant intervention. Its current market value is about $US13.5 billion, versus $US6.5 trillion for Chinese equities. The cryptocurrency gained 0.1 per cent to $US833.92 at 9:45 a.m. Hong Kong time. Rather than moving money out of the country, most automated traders in China are focused on cross-exchange arbitrage, said Arthur Hayes, a former market maker at Citigroup Inc. who now runs a bitcoin derivatives venue in Hong Kong. They can transact multiple times per second, reacting to price changes caused by individual investors and other speculators who often use technical patterns to guide their buying and selling decisions, Hayes said. If the market is here and I can see a chance to make money, I will. Zhou Shuoji 'Walk away' OkCoin, one of China's three biggest bitcoin exchanges, estimates 60 per cent of its transactions are executed by automated traders, while Huobi and BTC China put the figure at around 80 per cent. China is home to about 10 significant bitcoin venues, with a majority of trades executed on the top three, according to Neil Woodfine, the chief operating officer of Remitsy, a cross-border payment system. Instead of charging transaction costs, exchanges in China make money by levying a fee when clients withdraw bitcoin from their accounts; they also offer services including co-location and margin trading. Fintech Blockchain's Zhou, who sees more long-term potential in the distributed ledger technology underpinning bitcoin than the cryptocurrency itself, says he can't predict what the market will look like in a few years because it's still young and subject to Chinese regulatory risk. For now, though, he plans to keep trading. "If the market is here and I can see a chance to make money, I will," Zhou said. "If the market is gone, I'll just walk away."

In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost a fraction, the S&P 500 gained 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite wafted up 0.5% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.8%. Treasury bonds were weaker, the dollar fell for the third straight session, gold was weaker and oil fell to end a two-day rally down 1.2% despite a drop in U.S. drilling rig counts. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) gained 0.4% after reporting weaker-than-expected core earnings on soft net interest income and fees. Fixed income, currency and commodities trading was also light, but offset somewhat by lower expenses. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) gained 0.5% on an earnings beat from lower taxes despite light net interest income. Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) gained 1.5% despite missing expectations on lower free income and weak mortgage business. Overall, financial stocks led the way with a 0.6% gain while REITs were the laggards, down 0.3%. Pandora Media Inc (NYSE:P) gained 6.3% after announcing it expects fourth-quarter revenue and earnings to exceed guidance thanks to strong ad sales. GrubHub Inc (NYSE:GRUB) gained 4.5% on an upgrade to overweight by Morgan Stanley on accelerating restaurant adds. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) gained 3.3% on positive management comments on Q4 sales. And Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) gained 1.4% on an upgrade from Raymond James citing attractive valuation. On the downside, GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) lost 8.1% after reporting a 18.7% drop in holiday comp-store sales citing aggressive console promotions at other retailers. Retail sales came in at a weaker than expected 0.6% month-over-month growth in December, just below the 0.7% gain expected. Overall, sales were up 3.3% for 2016 vs. a 2.3% advance in 2015. Separately, the National Retail Federation said holiday shopping sales were up 4.3% from last year — ahead of the 3.6% expected. Online sales were up nearly 13%. Producer price inflation rose 0.3% in December following a 0.4% gain in November. That pushed the year-over-year rate to 1.6%, the highest since September. And finally, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment readers was largely unchanged from the cyclical peak hit in December. Overall, the Dow failed once again to take the 20,000 threshold — despite five weeks of trying — as technical indicators continue to flash overbought warnings signals amid narrowing breadth.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Markets Sterling skids on Brexit anxiety; investors hope for Trump clarity All the early action was in currencies where the pound sank as low as $1.1983, depths not seen since the flash crash of Oct. Reuters January 16, 2017 13:16 IST A pile of one pound coins is seen in a photo illustration shot June 17, 2008 [Representational Image].Reuters Sterling slid to three-month lows in Asia on Monday with investors spooked anew by concerns over Britain's divorce from the European Union, while U.S. policy uncertainty lingered ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. Regional share markets were hesitant. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.5 percent, Japan's Nikkei lost 0.6 percent and Shanghai shed 1.4 percent. Spread betters pointed to likely opening gains for UK shares, but a drop for German equities. All the early action was in currencies where the pound sank as low as $1.1983, depths not seen since the flash crash of October, having finished around $1.2175 in New York on Friday. It was last down 1.2 percent at $1.2032. Dealers said the market was reacting in part to a report in the Sunday Times that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will use a speech on Tuesday to signal plans for a "hard Brexit", quitting the EU's single market to regain control of Britain's borders. Investors have been worried such a decisive break from the single market would hurt British exports and drive foreign investment out of the country. "It is impossible to say by how much a hard Brexit could weaken GBP, but we do not believe that a further 5-10 percent depreciation should be regarded as an extreme scenario when set aside the UK's high dependence on foreign capital," wrote analysts at JPMorgan in a note. The flight from sterling benefited the safe-haven Japanese yen, with the pound down 1.5 percent to 137.34 yen while the U.S. dollar dipped to 114.17. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.3 percent at 101.510. The euro pared initial losses to stand at $1.0611. WAITING ON REFLATION The dollar index put in its worst weekly performance in more than two months last week as investors reconsidered the whole "reflation" trade - that Trump's promises of debt-funded fiscal spending and lower taxes would stoke inflation and drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster. Fed Chair Janet Yellen will have an opportunity to lay out her thinking with speeches on monetary policy scheduled for both Wednesday and Thursday this week. All eyes will then be on Trump's inauguration on Friday for any clarity on his economic plans. "The market is showing greater reluctance to push on with reflation-type trades without more details of proposed fiscal spending plans and the economic data to back it up," said analysts at ANZ in a research note. "It looks as though more than just reasonable data will be needed to see yields and the dollar push higher again. Some decent positive surprises may be necessary for the market to gain conviction." Asian markets are also waiting anxiously to see if Trump makes good on a campaign pledge to brand Beijing a currency manipulator on his first day in office, and starts to follow up on a threat to slap high tariffs on Chinese goods. Analysts fret that the spectre of deteriorating U.S.-China trade and political ties is likely to weigh on the confidence of exporters and investors worldwide. Wall Street ended last week mixed, with the Dow off slightly but the Nasdaq at a record high. Sentiment this week could be driven by results from the major banks with Morgan Stanley, Citibank and Bank of New York Mellon among those reporting. In commodity markets, oil prices inched higher after shedding around 3 percent last week. Brent crude was up 18 cents at $55.63 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 16 cents to $52.51.

Sentiment this week could be driven by results from the major banks with Morgan Stanley, Citibank and Bank of New York Mellon among those reporting.

turnover as gold shares and retailers strengthened but banks and financials weakened 16 January 2017 - 18:42 PM Maarten Mittner Picture: MICHAEL ETTERSHANK The JSE closed firmer on Monday in low-volume trade due to Martin Luther King Day in the US while gold shares soared on safe-haven demand. General retailers also recovered. The all share closed at a four-month high, but volume came to only R13bn from Friday’s R16bn. Gold shares were in favour as the gold price held above $1,200 an ounce in a continued recovery from the weaker trend after Donald Trump’s election on November 8. At the JSE’s close, the gold price was 0.54% higher at $1,203.48 an ounce. Banks were lower despite JPMorgan Chase posting record earnings growth on Friday. The pound tumbled before British Prime Minister Theresa May’s keenly awaited speech on Brexit on Tuesday. The market expects a "hard Brexit" announcement. The European Central Bank will meet on Wednesday and Donald Trump will be inaugurated as US president on Friday amid uncertainty about his policies. The all share closed 0.69% higher at 53,158.50 points, and the blue-chip top 40 gained 0.58%, with general retailers firming 3.71%. The gold index was 4.61% higher, platinums 2.42% and resources 1.50%. Banks dropped 0.39% and financials 0.26%. European markets were weaker at the JSE’s close after Trump said the EU could break up and Nato was obsolete. German leaders disagree strongly. At the same time, the FTSE 100 was 0.15% lower after earlier record levels on the weaker pound, while the Paris CAC 40 had shed 0.72% and Germany’s Dax 0.59%. Brent crude had given up 0.34% to $55.35 a barrel. SEI Investments said investors were betting that the shake-up in Washington would lead to higher growth, profitability and inflation. "There will be times in the year ahead when the more worrisome and controversial initiatives pushed by the Trump administration would rattle investor confidence," SEI said. Investor were expected to be cautious when the UK started talks at the end of March its EU exit. "We expect a tough period of negotiation that could lead to yet another period of investor uncertainty and angst," said SEI. BHP Billion rose 1.72% to R242.89 and Anglo American 1.64% to R223. Sasol added 1.42% to R429. Harmony Gold jumped 5.74% to R33.87 and Sibanye 5.26% to R28.20. Barclays Africa fared worst of the big four, down 1.12% to R169.19, while FirstRand shed 0.47% to R53.30 and Nedbank 1.1% to R236.91. TFG was the star performer among retailers, adding 5.29% to R168.50. Woolworths jumped 4.83% to R71.79 and Truworths 4.33% to R85.56. Massmart lifted 3.71% to R131.11 after it said in an update that sales rose 7.7% to R91.2bn in the 52 weeks to December 25, beating product inflation of 6.7%. Tiger Brands added 1.71% to R397.98.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 17 January 2017 Banks back in vogue by yvonne tan Banking sector expected to outperform the market once again in 2017 PETALING JAYA: Although interest rates are not likely to go up anytime soon in Malaysia, it has not stopped some form of renewed enthusiasm for the banking sector. The Kuala Lumpur Finance Index (KLFIN), which tracks the performance of banks, is up more than 2% since Nov 8 when Donald Trump was elected as the new president of the United States. On a comparison basis, the benchmark FBM KLCI has remained flat over the same period. Last Friday, the KLFIN hit a nine-month high while for the whole of 2016, the KLFIN outperformed the benchmark index by 4.6%. Observers reckon local sentiment is being helped by a spillover in optimism from the US banking sector, which is set to do better in view of rising interest rates and a less regulated environment as promised by Trump. Specifically, the expectation of a rising US interest rate environment would tend to discourage banks from giving discounts on their loans. This is because consumers and corporations themselves will tend to chase for loans with the view of locking in their borrowing costs if they anticipate interest rates to rise in the short term. At the same time, financially strong corporations could also undertake deleveraging exercises to reduce their debts. “Whatever the case, banks will benefit from rising rates. Their earnings have been compressed for the longest time due to ultra-low interest rates,” said a banker. In the US, Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America have all started to report good results, sending the S&P 500’s banking sub-sector to its highest level since February 2008 last Friday. Having said that, not all fund managers here are positive on the sector yet. “I am not positive on the sector yet, but I am buying selectively because banks being part of the index can’t really be ignored,” Danny Wong, fund manager at Areca Capital, said. Wong, who manages some RM700mil in funds, said he had accumulated some CIMB Group Holdings Bhd shares following the banking group’s massive cost-reduction programme over the past couple of years, and also has some Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) shares as part of Areca’s strategic holdings. “But for most banks, I need a couple of quarters more to see how they perform.” Thomas Yong, fund manager at Fortress Capital Asset Management, said he would still be staying away from banks for now. Banks both here and in the region have generally been hit in recent times by a confluence of factors, including a slowing economy, weak commodity prices and weak stock markets. Most hit were lenders with exposure to Indonesia due to the fall in commodity prices and steep rise in interest rates there that caused a spike in bad loans. As such valuations of banking stocks have come down in the past few years, with many financial institutions trading at below one times book value, which means that their intrinsic value is much higher than their liabilities. In good times, banking transactions are generally done at between 1.5 to two times book value. Valuations-wise, the five largest banks in Malaysia currently trade at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio range of between 0.8 times and 1.27 times, with one trading at a P/B ratio of around 2.3 times. Generally, a P/B ratio of less than one is thought of as compelling enough for investors to buy in. Meanwhile, in its report to clients yesterday, UOB Kay Hian said as the market here begins to price in the upcoming 14th General Election (GE14), the larger-cap banking stocks may be seen as indirect proxies to improved election-driven market sentiment. On Maybank specifically, the research house said drawing parallels to GE13, it is clear that Maybank’s share price could continue to outperform in the run-up to GE14. “Assuming valuations were to stretch towards the historical five-year mean P/B of 1.40 times (lower than the 10-year mean of 1.80 times), we believe a positive election-driven sentiment could drive the share price to the RM9 level,” it said. CIMB Research in a report yesterday predicted a better year ahead for the financial sector. It said that although loans growth is expected to be weak at between 5% and 6% this year, the margins of banks are expected to improve.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta / Associated Press) By Anita Kumar Tribune News Service Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Past inaugurations Estimates of how much money presidents raised for inaugurations Barack Obama, 2009, $53 million; 2012, $44 million. George W. Bush, 2005, $42.3 million; 2001, $30 million. Bill Clinton, 1997, $29 million; 1993, $25 million to $30 million. George H.W. Bush, 1989, $30 million. Ronald Reagan, 1985, $20 million; 1981, $16.3 million. Jimmy Carter, 1977, $3.5 million. Richard Nixon, 1973, $4 million. (Source: Congressional Research Service) NEW YORK – Donald Trump is trying to keep the names of the people and companies donating millions of dollars to his inauguration festivities this week a secret – a break from his Republican and Democratic predecessors in the White House. At least the last three presidents, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, all disclosed names of donors before they were sworn into office. A federal law passed when Bush was in office required presidents to reveal names of contributors, but only 90 days following the inauguration. Some names have been leaked out or have been released by the donors themselves. Chevron gave $500,000 and will sponsor additional events and Boeing pledged $1 million, according to the companies. AT&T and JPMorgan Chase also donated, according to the companies. Other corporate donors include those who donated to Obama’s inauguration or had declined to contribute to the Republican National Convention last summer, including UPS, Bank of America and Deloitte, according to The New York Times. “It is all about access and influence,” said Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the nonpartisan public advocacy group Public Citizen. “Donations come in very large amounts and from those who almost always want something from the new administration.” Occidental Petroleum, one of Clinton’s donors, for example, reached a settlement with the Energy Department in a price-fixing case after Clinton took office. AT&T, one of Obama’s donors, lobbied for regulatory approval of a merger with rival T-Mobile. Trump’s decision doesn’t surprise those who have watched him hire or appoint donors and lobbyists as well as advocate for secrecy. He failed to release the names of so-called bundlers who raised thousands of dollars for him from friends, acquaintances and associates. He failed to release his tax returns, a common practice for presidential nominees for four decades. Some of his nominees to be Cabinet secretaries have delayed providing background materials before their confirmation hearings. And in recent days, he has threatened to investigate how journalists received classified information. John Wonderlich, executive director for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for more openness in government, called Trump one of the most secretive candidates in modern history. “This trend is continuing through the pre-presidency and likely the presidency,” he said. Trump is expected to raise more than $90 million – a record amount – from people and corporations to pay for days of activities, including receptions, balls and the parade surrounding the 58th inauguration celebration. Taxpayers will spend millions more on the official swearing-in ceremony, security, construction and cleanup. His inaugural committee, like those of previous presidents, is offering special events and housing that includes access to Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence and their families in exchange for at least six-figure donations. For $100,000, donors will receive two tickets for dinner and a policy discussion with select Cabinet appointees. For $250,000, there’s two tickets to a lunch with women of the first family. For $1 million, there’s four tickets to a lunch featuring Cabinet appointees and congressional leaders and four tickets to a dinner with Pence and his wife, Karen. Trump tapped his longtime friend, Tom Barrack, a California a private equity real estate investor, to head his inaugural committee. Members include wealthy donors or Republican loyalists, including Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets; casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam; and Wisconsin businesswoman Diane Hendricks. They are likely to have made donations themselves and solicited donations from others. Messages left for other large companies that had donated to past inaugurations including Citigroup, Microsoft and UBS, were not returned. Others, including Wells Fargo, said they were not contributing. A spokesman for the committee did not return a request for comment. But a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly said that Trump’s team did consider whether to release the names of donors, but determined that disclosing the names early would produce multiple headlines instead of just one when they are required to be released by law. The government places no limits on contributions though Trump’s committee said it would not accept any money from registered lobbyists. Previous presidents have put some limits on the people who could donate and how much they could donate. For at least 24 years, presidents have disclosed inaugural donors but they varied on what additional information they provided In 1993, Clinton disclosed many names before the swearing-in, though the public didn’t learn how much they contributed for three years. Four years later, Clinton pledged disclosure by March 31. In 2001 and 2005, Bush disclosed before his inaugurations the names of his donors, their home cities and the amounts they gave. In 2009, Obama disclosed names, employers and states of residence for donors, along with the amounts of contribution.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint NEW YORK - Donald Trump is trying to keep the names of the people and companies donating millions of dollars to his inauguration festivities this week a secret — a break from his Republican and Democratic predecessors in the White House. At least the past three presidents, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, all disclosed names of donors before they were sworn into office. A federal law passed when Bush was in office required presidents to reveal names of contributors, but only 90 days following the inauguration. Some names have been leaked out or have been released by the donors themselves. Chevron gave $500,000 and will sponsor additional events and Boeing pledged $1 million, according to the companies. AT&T and JPMorgan Chase also donated, according to the companies. Other corporate donors include those who donated to Obama’s inauguration or had declined to contribute to the Republican National Convention last summer, including UPS, Bank of America and Deloitte, according to the New York Times. “It is all about access and influence,” said Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the nonpartisan public advocacy group Public Citizen. “Donations come in very large amounts and from those who almost always want something from the new administration.” Occidental Petroleum, one of Clinton’s donors, for example, reached a settlement with the Energy Department in a price-fixing case after Clinton took office. AT&T, one of Obama’s donors, lobbied for regulatory approval of a merger with rival T-Mobile. The making of an inauguration Estimates of how much money presidents have raised for inaugurations: Barack Obama: 2009, $53 million; 2012, $44 million. George W. Bush: 2005, $42.3 million; 2001, $30 million. Bill Clinton: 1997, $29 million; 1993, $25 million to $30 million. George H.W. Bush: 1989, $30 million. Ronald Reagan: 1985, $20 million; 1981, $16.3 million. Jimmy Carter: 1977, $3.5 million. Richard Nixon: 1973, $4 million. Source: Congressional Research Service Trump’s decision doesn’t surprise those who have watched him hire or appoint donors and lobbyists as well as advocate for secrecy. He did not release the names of so-called bundlers who raised thousands of dollars for him from friends, acquaintances and associates. He did not release his tax returns, a common practice for presidential nominees for four decades. Some of his nominees to be Cabinet secretaries have delayed providing background materials before their confirmation hearings. And in recent days, he has threatened to investigate how journalists received classified information. John Wonderlich, executive director for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for more openness in government, called Trump one of the most secretive candidates in modern history. “This trend is continuing through the pre-presidency and likely the presidency,” he said. Trump is expected to raise more than $90 million — a record amount — from people and corporations to pay for days of activities, including receptions, balls and the parade surrounding the 58th inauguration celebration. Taxpayers will spend millions more on the official swearing-in ceremony, security, construction and cleanup. His inaugural committee, like those of previous presidents, is offering special events and housing that includes access to Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence and their families in exchange for at least six-figure donations. For $100,000, donors will receive two tickets for dinner and a policy discussion with select Cabinet appointees. For $250,000, there’s two tickets to a lunch with women of the first family. For $1 million, there’s four tickets to a lunch featuring Cabinet appointees and congressional leaders and four tickets to a dinner with Pence and his wife, Karen. Trump tapped his longtime friend, Tom Barrack, a California a private equity real estate investor, to head his inaugural committee. Members include wealthy donors or Republican loyalists, including Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets; casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam; and Wisconsin businesswoman Diane Hendricks. They are likely to have made donations themselves and solicited donations from others. Messages left for other large companies that had donated to past inaugurations including Citigroup, Microsoft and UBS, were not returned. Others, including Wells Fargo, said they were not contributing. A spokesman for the committee did not return a request for comment. But a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly said that Trump’s team did consider whether to release the names of donors, but determined that disclosing the names early would produce multiple headlines instead of just one when they are required to be released by law. The government places no limits on contributions though Trump’s committee said it would not accept any money from registered lobbyists. Previous presidents have put some limits on the people who could donate and how much they could donate. For at least 24 years, presidents have disclosed inaugural donors but they varied on what additional information they provided In 1993, Clinton disclosed many names before the swearing-in, though the public didn’t learn how much they contributed for three years. Four years later, Clinton pledged disclosure by March 31. In 2001 and 2005, Bush disclosed before his inaugurations the names of his donors, their home cities and the amounts they gave. In 2009, Obama disclosed names, employers and states of residence for donors, along with the amounts of contribution. Four years later, he only released the names with no further identifying information. The Center for Responsive Politics has long advocated for Congress to pass a law requiring more timely disclosure as well as limits on the types of donors and the size of their donations. “Congress says contributions to candidates should be limited,” said Bob Biersack, a senior fellow for the group. “Those same principles should apply inaugurals.”   View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Monetary policy is tightening, government spending is expected to expand substantially, and, as the US presidential election and the vote in Britain to leave the European Union show, trade relations and other ties among nations may be fraying. How those trends progress sho­uld go a long way to determining the performan­ce of stocks and bonds as the year moves along. These aren’t the only issues for investors to contend with, either. Economic indicators have perked up — unemployment in December, reported on January 6, was 4.7%, and consumer confidence is near multiyear highs — but the earnings outlook remains subdued, stock valuations remain high and bond yields are low but rising. Under these circumstances, many investment advisers recommend taking only minimal, reasonably priced risks. “I’m hard pressed to locate any investment where you can make a strong argument that it’s undervalued,” said Joe Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard and head of the firm’s Investment Strategy Group. “Just as the economic environment seems to be improving, the investment environment is more challenging. Investors have more risk in their portfolios than at any time since 1999.” Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at the GMO investment firm, likewise finds “plenty of things to worry about.” The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index early this month traded at about 26 times the earnings that the constituent companies reported in the previous year, higher than at almost any time in history. One reason investors are willing to pay so much is that they see even less value in other assets. “The rest of the world looks scarier than the US,” Inker said. “Who would want to touch Europe? Who would want to touch emerging markets?” As scary as they may appear, he recommends investing in emerging stock markets as the best of a series of difficult choices. “It’s not that we have high hopes for the emerging world this year,” he said, “but they’re priced for a really bad outcome. The US is priced for a really good outcome.” American stocks had a really good outcome in 2016. The S&P 500 rose 9.5% to 2,238.83, including a 3.3% gain in the fourth quarter. The average domestic stock fund in Morningstar’s database rose 3.3% in the quarter and 10.9% on the year. Leading the way in the quarter, with double-digit gains, were portfolios that focused on financial services, smaller companies, energy and industrials. Whether managers make the most of it, David Kelly, chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, finds solid prospects in US stocks this year, more than many of his peers do. He favours sectors most sensitive to rising growth, such as financial services, technology and consumer discretionary stocks. “The general trend of government policy will be pretty pro-business and much more friendly to the US corporate sector than it has been,” he said. But he said that “the Republicans may get sidetracked by antitrade rhetoric.” President-elect Donald Trump has proposed raising tariffs on imported goods, and some Republicans in Congress have proposed changing corporate tax rules to reward exporters and punish importers. Economists generally agree that higher tariffs reduce competitiveness and drive up prices of imported goods, including parts supplied to US manufacturers. Kelly is also wary of Trump’s pledges to incre­ase government spending on infrastructure projects. “There isn’t actually any money in the budget to fulfil his agenda. Congress may decide not to worry about it and push up the debt, and we’ll end up with more debt and inflation,” he said. And we may have higher interest rates, too. The Federal Reserve raised rates in December, only the second time in a decade. Kelly expects three, possibly four, increases this year. The more forbidding rate environment may account for much of the run-up in bond yields last year. Yields on 10-year Treasury issues rose to 2.44% at the end of December from 1.36% in early July, with most of the increase occurring just after Election Day, according to Bloomberg. Bond funds lost 1% in the fourth quarter, depressed by the 11.8% plunge in portfolios that specialise in long-term government issues. For the full year, according to Morningstar, the average bond fund was up 5.9%, helped by double-digit gains in riskier categories like high-yield and emerging market debt. Laird Landmann, co-director of fixed income at the TCW fund-management company, said he saw little to recommend to investors because “asset prices are getting out of whack with the economy.” Inflation is likely to keep rising, he predicted, perhaps exceeding 2.5% this year. His advice is to play it safe and stick with Treasury bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities not issued or guaranteed by the federal government, and bonds issued by US banks. “It’s hard to buy things after eight years of a credit cycle,” Landmann said. “Wait for it to turn; that’s the discipline of being a value investor.” Worst-performing markets When considering any benefits of spending measures introduced by Trump and Congress, it’s important to remember that they wouldn’t be spread far and wide. Hope that the global recovery might at last get some legs helped the emerging stock markets last year, but they gave back about seven months’ worth of gains in the week after the election, as investors weighed the prospect of Trump’s protectionist campaign language being translated into action. The average emerging market stock fund lost 5.5% in the fourth quarter but still gained 9% for the year. International stock funds overall fell 2.8% in the quarter and rose 4.9% on the year. Some of the worst-performing stock markets were in countries on which Trump has focused. Mexico lost 8% in 2016, and the Shanghai Composite Index in China was down more than 12%, although funds concentrating on China and its surroundings rose 0.7%. The president-elect’s outlook “is clearly anti-globalisation,” said Rick Schmidt, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Fund. “Trade is going to have a bigger impact on some markets than others,” he said. Whether he can implement” his agenda “is one thing, but you have to assume he means it,” he added. “It would be dangerous not to take him at his word.” Just as Inker prefers emerging markets because the risk they entail comes at the right price, Schmidt sees some of the best opportunities this year in beaten-down markets like Mexico. Elsewhere, he finds India overpriced, and he is avoiding utilities and Chinese banks, although he likes banks in other countries. While emerging markets are appealing to many based on their valuations, Landmann warned that they may be particularly vulnerable to potential missteps in a Trump presidency. “Markets are not going to crash necessarily, but you could see crashes in more fragile areas like China,” he said.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Vinay Katiyar's controversial statement on Priyanka Gandhi...

The all-share deal is one of Europe's largest cross-border tie-ups and brings together Luxottica, the world's top spectacles maker with brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, with leading lens manufacturer Essilor. "Finally ... two products which are naturally complementary -- namely frames and lenses -- will be designed, manufactured and distributed under the same roof," Luxottica's 81-year-old founder Leonardo Del Vecchio said in a statement on Monday. Shares in Luxottica were up by 8.6 percent at 53.80 euros by 1405 GMT, with Essilor up 12.2 percent at 114.60 euros. The merger between the top players in the 95 billion eyewear market is aimed at helping the businesses to take full advantage of expected strong demand for prescription spectacles and sunglasses due to an ageing global population and increasing awareness about eye care. Jefferies analysts estimate that the market is growing at between 2 percent and 4 percent a year, while Luxottica and Essilor say that at least 2.5 billion people in the world still suffer from uncorrected vision problems. The deal also removes -- for now at least -- uncertainty over succession at Luxottica, which has lost three CEOs since 2014 because of rifts with Del Vecchio. "The strategic rationale is strong," JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said in a note, adding that the deal defuses the risk of growing competition between two groups that had been encroaching on each other's areas of expertise in recent years, with Essilor buying online retailers and Luxottica investing in lens manufacturing. ONLINE FOCUS Both companies have been grappling with slowing sales growth, hit by weakness in North America, and face rising competition from cheaper rivals and the challenge of online distribution. While Asia and Latin America are seen by the companies as potential growth markets, e-commerce will also be a top priority. Luxottica's third-quarter results had showed revenue from its online platforms grew by 18 percent, with the company stating that e-commerce had been targeted as an area for accelerated growth in 2017. The third-quarter e-commerce growth far exceeded that for overall sales, which rose by 1.4 percent at constant exchange rates. The merger is expected to boost operating profit by up to 600 million euros in the medium term, the companies said. It will also leave smaller rivals lagging even further behind. Dutch retailer GrandVision and Italy's Safilo Group had revenue of 3.2 billion euros and 1.3 billion euros respectively in 2015. Though advisers on the deal have presented it as a merger of equals, Del Vecchio will be the biggest shareholder of the combined group with a stake of between 31 percent and 38 percent through his family holding company Delfin. Voting rights will be capped at 31 percent. Analysts said that Essilor shareholders are getting a good deal because the share exchange ratio implies a 5 percent discount to Luxottica's closing price on Friday, which was down 27 percent from its 2015 peak. Delfin will contribute its 62 percent stake in Luxottica at a ratio of 1 share in the Italian group for every 0.461 Essilor shares. The French lens maker will launch a mandatory exchange offer on all remaining Luxottica shares at the same ratio, with the aim of delisting Luxottica's shares. TWIN BOSSES The merged EssilorLuxottica will have 140,000 staff and will be headquartered and listed in Paris. It will also have a complex governance structure, with Del Vecchio and Essilor Chairman and CEO Hubert Sagnieres effectively sharing the driving seat, while the 16-strong board will have an even split of Essilor and Luxottica executives. A source close to the deal said no arrangements had been made at this stage for when Del Vecchio will retire. Del Vecchio, who returned to the helm of Luxottica two years ago after taking a back seat for the previous 10 years, will be CEO and executive chairman of the merged group. Sagnieres, 61, will serve as executive vice-chairman and deputy CEO, but he and Del Vecchio will have the same powers. In a conference call with analysts, the two sought to play down concerns over the co-leadership. "We have and share the same values, we have and share the same vision, we have and share the same interest in the product ... If we really want to provide consumers with the best product, Leonardo and I will have to co-manage," Sagnieres said. Del Vecchio, who grew up as an orphan but is now Italy's second-richest person, said he had long dreamed of such a merger. "This marriage will take place and will work," he said. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year and Del Vecchio said he is confident there will be no problems gaining approval from competition authorities. Luxottica and Essilor, which have a market value of about 24 billion euros and 22 billion euros respectively, had explored a possible tie-up a few years ago. Luxottica said in September 2014 that discussions had taken place in 2013 but were dropped for a number of reasons, including shareholding governance issues. A source close to the deal said that the two companies' business models, operations and strategy have converged since then and that the merger makes more sense now, given growing competition. The source said the tie-up had been agreed in the past six weeks. Mediobanca advised Delfin on the merger, with Essilor advised by Rothschild and Citi. Delfin's shareholders are Del Vecchio's six children and his second wife.

Home Business Business Comment This Week: The ECB monetary policy decision with data from UK and US | Calamatta Cuschieri The markets will turn their attention towards Frankfurt next Thursday, when the European Central Bank announces its latest monetary policy decision Calamatta Cuschieri 16 January 2017, 11:43am Print Version On Wednesday, the European Central Bank announces its latest monetary policy decision, which will carry plenty of weight Friday recap Friday the 13th was not that bad luck after all. European markets were in the green, ahead of key bank earnings data from the United States, as global markets attempt to recover from Thursday's Trump-induced stumble. Positive news for US markets too, as Friday was the day major US banks posted their earnings.  Bank of America announced that it sees its interest net income growing further in the current quarter after it reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.40 in the quarter ending December 2016. Meanwhile, BlackRock said its Earnings per Share rose to $5.14 and its board of directors approved a 9% rise in the quarterly dividend to $2.50 from $2.29. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo also announced their earnings. This week For the euro area, the markets will turn their attention towards Frankfurt next Thursday, when the European Central Bank announces its latest monetary policy decision, which will carry plenty of weight. After last month’s decision to extend the QE timeline while cutting the monthly purchase amount, ahead of challenging political headwinds over the coming months, no major changes are expected, but keeping in mind potential changes to inflation forecasts. In England, the key event of the week will be the speech from Prime Minister Theresa May, which could have impacts for currency pairs such as GBP/USD and EUR/GBP. UK data such as Consumer Price Index, unemployment and retail sales may pale in comparison, but will still be important gauging the likelihood of a monetary policy change. The unemployment forecast in the UK seen to rise from 4.8% to 4.9% or as some analysts, forecast to hold steady. Finally, UK retailers will continue to report trading updates for the Christmas period, while further information on Rio Tinto, Burberry and Cairn Energy are also due. US earnings season moves into high gear, as other US banks report, plus Netflix, General Electric and Schlumberger. The US will release its manufacturing output for December which should likely increase with improving survey data and following a November rise by only 0.1% on an annual basis. Updates on capacity utilisation and industrial production data will also offer clues to the health of the US goods-producing sector. In China, analysts are anticipating GDP growth for the fourth quarter to remain broadly unchanged from the expansion in the previous quarter. However, the Purchasing Managers Index pointed to stronger expansions in manufacturing and services. Updated industrial output data and retail sales indicators will also give clues to the strengths of Asia’s largest economy.

Donald Trump is making volatility great again. If the reaction to the U.S. President-elect’s first press conference is anything to go by, we are in for big swings in currency markets this year. One-week implied volatility on the euro-dollar, a measure of the cost of options to protect against swings in the currency, surged the most in a month after Trump’s press conference last week. And that came on the back of no real policy news. A dollar index dropped as much as 2 percent in two days. With Trump’s policy agenda still uncertain, the theme of greater fiscal stimulus and higher inflation that have driven up the dollar and U.S. treasury yields is not a one-way bet. Divided market positioning means surprises either way on Trump’s promises will add to price swings, causing an increase in hedging costs for investors. The high degree of uncertainty about what’s in store for U.S. economic policy presents a “wider than usual range of upside and down risk factors,” IMF Chief Economist Maurice Obstfeld said in remarks prepared for delivery Monday. Many investors from banks, pension and hedge funds are still looking to add long positions on the dollar, while a few are overweight, say traders in the U.S. and Europe, who asked not to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly. Others have neutral positioning. There’s room for realized volatilities, near 10-year averages, to steepen. JPMorgan’s index of Group-of-Seven volatility stands at 10.78 percent, compared to 12.79 percent on June 14 ahead of the U.K.’s vote on EU membership. Uncertainty over Trump isn’t the only political risk factor on the horizon, with Brexit negotiations and European elections coming up this year. Volatilities in pound crosses have risen to multi-month highs ahead of U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s speech on Tuesday, where she is expected to shed light on her Brexit vision. The market has been very sensitive to news suggesting the U.K. is willing to forgo single-market access to regain immigration control, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG expecting a drop toward the $1.10 level in the spot market.  Even if negotiations through the year point to a ‘softer’ Brexit, a short-pound market may scrabble for the exit and a large short squeeze could lead to a jackpot for those looking for a move above $1.30. Investors may look to hedge against sudden swings by going long vega, a measure of an option’s sensitivity to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset. The euro area also has to deal with elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany, following a referendum in Italy last month that saw its prime minister step down. There is potential for another round of elections in Greece, since there’s an impasse in a review of the country’s bailout. Markets may be under-positioned against these risks. While euro-dollar bearish bets, as shown by six-month risk reversals, surged in November, this was because of the U.S. elections rather than European risks. The sentix Euro Break-Up Index, which reflects the probability that one of the euro area countries will leave the common currency within 12 months, stands below its five-year average.

In this morning's PIX Financial Fix, Smart Shopping Expert, Trae Bodge is helping us do the math and find out which deal is best for us. JPMorgan Chase caused a stir last year with its exciting Chase Sapphire Reserve Card   Despite a hefty $450 annual fee, you were given 100k points if you spent $4,000 or more in the first three months, equaling about $1,500 worth of travel rewards. There’s also a $300 annual credit that can be used toward travel, plus 3 pts for every dollar spent on travel and restaurants, access to luxury airport lounges, and the ability to transfer points to airline and hotel loyalty programs. Chase just announced that it's cutting the sign-up bonus in half, so now you are given 50,000 points if you spend 4k in the first 3 months. If you’re looking for cards with generous rewards but NO annual fee, check out the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card, which offers 20k bonus miles if you spend 1k in the first 90 days and 1.5 pts for purchases, or the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card, which offers 40,000 miles when you spend 3k and 2 pts for purchases. If you want one that offers balance transfers as well, the Barclaycard CashForward World MasterCard also has no annual fee, 0% on transfers for 15 months and $100 cash bonus if you spend $500 in 90 days.  Another rewards card with no annual fee that I like is the new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card. You don’t have to be a Prime member to take advantage of the benefits, but it pays if you are. Once approved, you instantly receive a $70 Amazon.com gift card. On Amazon purchases, Prime members get 5% cash back and non-prime get 3%. You can also earn cash back on non-Amazon purchases, like travel, gas and food and get additional benefits like travel accident insurance, baggage delay insurance and purchase protection.  And if you don’t feel like switching your credit card but want to earn while you shop, use a cash back site, like Splender.com!  Let’s talk about a card that isn’t worth signing up for. The MasterCard® Gold Credit Card is cool because it’s made of 24k gold, but the annual feel is $995! You do get  a $200 airfare credit each year, access to a concierge, 1 point per $1 spent on most purchases (which is average for a rewards card), and a double points on travel, there are better cards out there.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/Illustration/File PhotoMore By Nigel Stephenson LONDON (Reuters) - Investors sold sterling and stocks on Monday, seeking shelter in gold and the Japanese yen as uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union and the policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump curbed appetite for risky assets. U.S. markets were closed for the Martin Luther King Day holiday, crimping market activity and potentially exacerbating price moves. The dollar rose, except against the yen, rebounding after suffering its worst week since November last week, when it was hit by a lack of clarity over what Trump, whose inauguration is on Friday, will do once he assumes office. The price of gold, a frequently sought haven for investors in uncertain times, hit its highest level since November. "The market is taking a reality check from Trump euphoria, equity markets are moving sideways, the dollar has steadied and bond yields are down, allowing gold to recover," Julius Baer commodities analyst Carsten Menke said. Yields on low-risk German government bonds fell, but those on Italian equivalents edged up after rating agency DBRS cut Italy's credit rating late on Friday, a move that could raise borrowing costs for the country's banks. But the eye-catching mover was Britain's pound, a day before a speech by British Prime Minister Theresa May. Media reported that she would lay out an exit from the EU that would see Britain lose access to the bloc's single market. The pound fell as low as $1.1983 in thin early Asian trade, which, barring a sudden "flash crash" in October, was its weakest against the dollar in 32 years. Investors will scrutinise May's speech for clues to whether she plans to prioritise immigration controls in a "hard Brexit" that some analysts say could hurt the economy. The fall in sterling, which makes UK exports cheaper, has contributed to an unprecedented 14-day rally in the blue-chip FTSE 100 stock index. The index fell 0.2 percent on Monday but still outperformed continental European markets. The main STOXX 600 index fell 0.8 percent, as declines in autos and banks offset a rally in eyewear makers Luxottica and Essilor, who agreed a 46 billion-euro merger. German carmakers BMW, Daimler and VW fell between 1.6 and 1.8 percent after Trump warned he would impose a 35 percent border tax on vehicles imported to the U.S. market. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.6 percent, Japan's Nikkei lost 1 percent as the strong yen hit exporters. Sterling last traded at $1.2055, down 1 percent on the day. The euro was up 0.6 percent at 87.97 pence while the yen was up 0.8 percent at 137.40 to the pound. "Every time there’s hard Brexit headlines, that triggers a fresh bout of selling," MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman said. "It's almost impossible to see Europe allowing the UK to remain a full member of the single market if it wants to regain control of the border and the laws and wants to strike its own agreement," he added. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six of its peers, rose 0.4 percent. The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.0602 while the yen, another perceived safe haven investment, rose 0.5 percent to 113.99 per dollar. ITALY DOWNGRADED German 10-year bond yields fell 2 basis points to 0.25 percent. Italian 10-year yields, by contrast, rose marginally to 1.90 percent. Italy's downgrade will mean Italian banks will have to pay more to borrow money from the European Central Bank when they use the country's sovereign bonds as collateral. It may also make Italian debt less attractive for foreign buyers. Oil held steady, though doubts that large oil producers will cut output, as agreed by the Organization of the Oil Producing Countries and others, put prices under pressure Brent, the international benchmark, last traded at $55.37 a barrel, down 8 cents on the day.

Picture: PUBLIC DOMAIN IMAGE Sydney — Sterling slid to three-month lows in Asia on Monday with investors again spooked by concern over Britain’s exit from the EU, while US policy uncertainty lingered ahead of president-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Regional share markets were hesitant with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up just 0.09%. Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.3%, while Australia added 0.5%. All the early action was in currencies where the pound sank as low as $1.1983, depths not seen since the flash crash of October, having finished around $1.2175 in New York on Friday. It was last down 1.1% at $1.2044. Dealers said the market was reacting in part to a report in the Sunday Times that UK Prime Minister Theresa May would use a speech on Tuesday to signal plans for a "hard Brexit", quitting the EU’s single market to regain control of Britain’s borders. Investors have been worried such a decisive break from the single market would hurt British exports and drive foreign investment out of the country. "It is impossible to say by how much a hard Brexit could weaken [the pound], but we do not believe that a further 5%-10% depreciation should be regarded as an extreme scenario when set aside the UK’s high dependence on foreign capital," wrote analysts at JPMorgan in a note. The flight from sterling benefited the safe-haven Japanese yen, with the pound down 1.3% to ¥137.57 while the US dollar dipped to ¥114.24. Trading was erratic with currencies gyrating on very little volume. The dollar edged up 0.2% to 101.390 on a basket of currencies, while the euro pared initial losses to stand at $1.0632. Waiting on reflation The dollar index put in its worst weekly performance in more than two months last week as investors reconsidered the whole "reflation" trade — that Trump’s promises of debt-funded fiscal spending and lower taxes would stoke inflation and drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen will have an opportunity to lay out her thinking with speeches on monetary policy on both Wednesday and Thursday this week. All eyes will then be on Trump’s inauguration on Friday for any clarity on his economic plans. "The market is showing greater reluctance to push on with reflation-type trades without more details of proposed fiscal spending plans and the economic data to back it up," said analysts at ANZ in a research note. "It looks as though more than just reasonable data will be needed to see yields and the dollar push higher again. Some decent positive surprises may be necessary for the market to gain conviction." Asian markets are also waiting anxiously to see if Trump makes good on a campaign pledge to brand Beijing a currency manipulator on his first day in office, and starts to follow up on a threat to slap high tariffs on Chinese goods. Analysts fret that the spectre of deteriorating US-China trade and political ties is likely to weigh on the confidence of exporters and investors worldwide. Wall Street ended last week mixed, with the Dow off slightly but the Nasdaq at a record high. Sentiment this week could be driven by results from the major banks with Morgan Stanley, Citibank and Bank of New York Mellon among those reporting. In commodity markets, oil prices inched higher after shedding around 3% last week. Brent crude was up 9c at $55.54 a barrel, while US crude rose 7c to $52.44. Spot gold added 0.5% to $1,202.80/oz.

Regional share markets were hesitant. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.5 percent, Japan's Nikkei lost 0.6 percent and Shanghai shed 1.4 percent. Spread betters pointed to likely opening gains for UK shares, but a drop for German equities. All the early action was in currencies where the pound sank as low as $1.1983, depths not seen since the flash crash of October, having finished around $1.2175 in New York on Friday. It was last down 1.2 percent at $1.2032. Dealers said the market was reacting in part to a report in the Sunday Times that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will use a speech on Tuesday to signal plans for a "hard Brexit", quitting the EU's single market to regain control of Britain's borders. Investors have been worried such a decisive break from the single market would hurt British exports and drive foreign investment out of the country. "It is impossible to say by how much a hard Brexit could weaken GBP, but we do not believe that a further 5-10 percent depreciation should be regarded as an extreme scenario when set aside the UK's high dependence on foreign capital," wrote analysts at JPMorgan in a note. The flight from sterling benefited the safe-haven Japanese yen, with the pound down 1.5 percent to 137.34 yen while the U.S. dollar dipped to 114.17. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.3 percent at 101.510. The euro pared initial losses to stand at $1.0611. WAITING ON REFLATION The dollar index put in its worst weekly performance in more than two months last week as investors reconsidered the whole "reflation" trade - that Trump's promises of debt-funded fiscal spending and lower taxes would stoke inflation and drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster. Fed Chair Janet Yellen will have an opportunity to lay out her thinking with speeches on monetary policy scheduled for both Wednesday and Thursday this week. All eyes will then be on Trump's inauguration on Friday for any clarity on his economic plans. "The market is showing greater reluctance to push on with reflation-type trades without more details of proposed fiscal spending plans and the economic data to back it up," said analysts at ANZ in a research note. "It looks as though more than just reasonable data will be needed to see yields and the dollar push higher again. Some decent positive surprises may be necessary for the market to gain conviction." Asian markets are also waiting anxiously to see if Trump makes good on a campaign pledge to brand Beijing a currency manipulator on his first day in office, and starts to follow up on a threat to slap high tariffs on Chinese goods. Analysts fret that the spectre of deteriorating U.S.-China trade and political ties is likely to weigh on the confidence of exporters and investors worldwide. Wall Street ended last week mixed, with the Dow off slightly but the Nasdaq at a record high. Sentiment this week could be driven by results from the major banks with Morgan Stanley, Citibank and Bank of New York Mellon among those reporting.

Average spreads on Indian dollar bonds fell to 234 basis points Jan. 11, the lowest since October 2014, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes. “We see dollar issuance in 2017 being more than last year, driven by M&A activity especially from the oil and gas industry,” Wee Lee Cheng, a Singapore-based analyst at NN Investment said in an interview. “Indian bonds’ valuations are about fair but they do offer geographic diversity for investors away from large issuance from China. As long as increases in Fed rates do not result in a risk-off environment, we do expect Indian dollar issuances to continue.” Mergers and acquisitions in India totaled $81.17 billion last year versus $67.66 billion in 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show. So far this month, Indian companies have raised $1.1 billion in dollar bonds. Bharat Petroleum Corp.’s Singapore unit issued $600 million of 10-year U.S. currency notes, while Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd. sold $500 million. Dollar bond sales from local borrowers fell to $8 billion in 2016 versus $8.4 billion in 2015 and $15.1 billion in 2014. That came amid a backdrop of the Federal Reserve’s rate increase in December, the rupee’s slump and India’s demonetization policy in November.  The most important market news of the day.

Biswal, its director for finance. “We feel we can raise euro funds at cheaper rates than dollar. At this time, it is not advisable to go for dollar bonds.” “The USD bond market is off to a very strong start this year given the quantum of investor money waiting to be deployed,” said Arun Saigal, Mumbai-based head for global finance at the Indian unit of Barclays Plc. “For India specifically, the outlook continues to be very positive given the strong underlying macro fundamentals and favorable supply dynamics.” Bharat Petroleum’s sale was covered almost three times, while Adani Ports’ book was double the issue size. Indian dollar bonds returned 7.4 percent in 2016, compared with 5.8 percent for Asia, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes. “Dollar bonds should continue to be attractive for many Indian insurers because the amounts companies can raise overseas exceeds domestic markets,” said Jujhar Singh, head of capital markets for South Asia at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. The rupee’s slump and the government’s demonetization move “has not adversely impacted Indian issuance, as evident from the data points in the primary dollar bond markets – very successful new issuances by Bharat Petroleum and Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone,” he said.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File PhotoMore By Nigel Stephenson LONDON (Reuters) - Investors sold sterling and stocks on Monday, seeking shelter in gold and the Japanese yen as uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union and the policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump curbed appetite for risky assets. U.S. markets were closed for the Martin Luther King Day holiday, crimping market activity and potentially exacerbating price moves. The dollar <.DXY> rose, except against the yen, rebounding after suffering its worst week since November last week, when it was hit by a lack of clarity over what Trump, whose inauguration is on Friday, will do once he assumes office. The price of gold, a frequently sought haven for investors in uncertain times, hit its highest level since November. "The market is taking a reality check from Trump euphoria, equity markets are moving sideways, the dollar has steadied and bond yields are down, allowing gold to recover," Julius Baer commodities analyst Carsten Menke said. Yields on low-risk German government bonds fell, but those on Italian equivalents edged up after rating agency DBRS cut Italy's credit rating late on Friday, a move that could raise borrowing costs for the country's banks. But the eye-catching mover was Britain's pound, a day before a speech by British Prime Minister Theresa May. Media reported that she would lay out an exit from the EU that would see Britain lose access to the bloc's single market. The pound <GBP=D4> fell as low as $1.1983 in thin early Asian trade, which, barring a sudden "flash crash" in October, was its weakest against the dollar in 32 years. Investors will scrutinize May's speech for clues to whether she plans to prioritize immigration controls in a "hard Brexit" that some analysts say could hurt the economy. The fall in sterling, which makes UK exports cheaper, has contributed to an unprecedented 14-day rally in the blue-chip FTSE 100 stock index <.FTSE>. The index fell 0.2 percent on Monday but still outperformed continental European markets. The main STOXX 600 index <.STOXX> fell 0.8 percent, as declines in autos and banks offset a rally in eyewear makers Luxottica <LUX.MI> and Essilor <ESSI.PA>, who agreed a 46 billion-euro merger. German carmakers BMW <BMWG.DE>, Daimler <DAIG.DE> and VW <VOWG.DE> fell between 1.6 and 1.8 percent after Trump warned he would impose a 35 percent border tax on vehicles imported to the U.S. market. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> eased 0.6 percent, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> lost 1 percent as the strong yen hit exporters. Sterling last traded at $1.2055, down 1 percent on the day. The euro was up 0.6 percent at 87.97 pence <EURGBP=> while the yen was up 0.8 percent at 137.40 to the pound. "Every time there’s hard Brexit headlines, that triggers a fresh bout of selling," MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman said. "It's almost impossible to see Europe allowing the UK to remain a full member of the single market if it wants to regain control of the border and the laws and wants to strike its own agreement," he added. The dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the U.S. currency against six of its peers, rose 0.4 percent. The euro <EUR=> fell 0.4 percent to $1.0602 while the yen, another perceived safe haven investment, rose 0.5 percent to 113.99 per dollar. ITALY DOWNGRADED German 10-year bond yields fell 2 basis points to 0.25 percent <DE10YT=TWEB>. Italian 10-year yields, by contrast, rose marginally to 1.90 percent. Italy's downgrade will mean Italian banks will have to pay more to borrow money from the European Central Bank when they use the country's sovereign bonds as collateral. It may also make Italian debt less attractive for foreign buyers. Oil held steady, though doubts that large oil producers will cut output, as agreed by the Organization of the Oil Producing Countries and others, put prices under pressure Brent, the international benchmark, last traded at $55.37 a barrel, down 8 cents on the day <LCOc1>.

Sterling declined against all its major peers after the Sunday Times said May will prepare to withdraw from tariff-free trade with the region in return for the ability to curb immigration and strike commercial deals with other countries. The currency has slumped 19 per cent against the US dollar since the U.K. opted to leave the EU in June's referendum, with declines since the initial aftermath of the vote mainly sparked by concern May would pursue a so-called "hard Brexit". The Sunday Times didn't say how its obtained the information, and the prime minister's office declined to comment on the report when contacted by Bloomberg News. Government officials told the newspaper they expect May's speech on Tuesday to cause a further "market correction." "Even if the pound recovers somewhat in London, it seems as though the realities of a hard Brexit are still not fully priced in," said Sean Callow, senior strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. "It is difficult to make the case for the pound to avoid testing - probably breaking - the 'flash crash' lows in coming weeks." The pound fell as much as 1.6 per cent on Monday to US$1.1986, the weakest level since Oct 7 when it reached US$1.1841, the least since 1985. It was down 1.2 per cent at US$1.2028 as of 9:09am in Tokyo. Against the Singapore dollar, the pound tumbled to S$1.7125 at 4:58am, Singapore time, and was trading at S$1.7224 at 8:53am, down 1/3 per cent from its close on Friday. The pound trimmed some of its losses after Bloomberg News reported the UK Treasury is drawing up plans to reassure investors following May's speech on Tuesday, and as US President-elect Donald Trump told the Times that he will offer the UK a "fair" trade deal. A measure of anticipated price swings for the pound jumped when the date for May's speech was announced last week as traders sought protection against more turmoil. With details of the UK's exit strategy remaining scant less than three months before the Prime Minister's own deadline to trigger formal talks with the EU, traders have previously seen her pronouncements on Brexit as a trigger to sell the pound, even if she has mainly reiterated existing views. Sterling fell following her speech at the Conservative Party conference in October, which fanned speculation she was eyeing a clean break with the EU, and dropped to the lowest level since October last week following her first television interview of 2017. May's speech isn't the only approaching Brexit milestone. The Supreme Court is set to rule this month whether May or Parliament carries the power to invoke the exit, although few see the process being derailed either way. "The pound risks a violent rally to cover short positions if the UK Supreme Court rules to support Parliament," said Naohiro Nomoto, manager of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo. The pound has previously been prone to outsized swings during Asian trading, with the most extreme being October's flash crash, which saw the currency tumble more than 6 per cent in a matter of minutes. While an investigation by the Bank for International Settlements released last week found no single cause for the event, it highlighted that the time of day played a significant role in making the market more vulnerable. Meanwhile, regional share markets opened hesitantly on Monday with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up just 0.09 per cent. Japan's Nikkei eased 0.3 per cent, while Australia added 0.5 per cent. The flight from sterling benefited the safe-haven Japanese yen, with the pound down 1.3 per cent to 137.57 yen while the US dollar dipped to 114.24. Trading was erratic with currencies gyrating on very little volume. The US dollar edged up 0.2 per cent to 101.390 on a basket of currencies, while the euro pared initial losses to stand at US$1.0632. The dollar index put in its worst weekly performance in more than two months last week as investors reconsidered the whole "reflation" trade - that Trump's promises of debt-funded fiscal spending and lower taxes would stoke inflation and drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster. Fed chair Janet Yellen will have an opportunity to lay out her thinking with speeches on monetary policy on both Wednesday and Thursday this week. All eyes will then be on Trump's inauguration on Friday for any clarity on his economic plans. "The market is showing greater reluctance to push on with reflation-type trades without more details of proposed fiscal spending plans and the economic data to back it up," said analysts at ANZ in a research note. "It looks as though more than just reasonable data will be needed to see yields and the dollar push higher again. Some decent positive surprises may be necessary for the market to gain conviction." Asian markets are also waiting anxiously to see if Trump makes good on a campaign pledge to brand Beijing a currency manipulator on his first day in office, and starts to follow up on a threat to slap high tariffs on Chinese goods. Analysts fret that the spectre of deteriorating US-China trade and political ties is likely to weigh on the confidence of exporters and investors worldwide. Wall Street ended last week mixed, with the Dow off slightly but the Nasdaq at a record high. Sentiment this week could be driven by results from the major banks with Morgan Stanley, Citibank and Bank of New York Mellon among those reporting. In commodity markets, oil prices inched higher after shedding around 3 per cent last week. Brent crude was up 9 cents at US$55.54 a barrel, while US crude rose 7 cents to US$52.44. Spot gold added 0.5 per cent to US$1,202.80 an ounce.
