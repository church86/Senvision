up next: now reading: Glass-Steagall Reboot: A Cure That's Worse Than the Initial Disease banka Glass-Steagall Reboot: A Cure That's Worse Than the Initial Disease By Allan Golombek May 08, 2017 banka X Story Stream recent articles Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... The emerging bid to restore the Glass-Steagall law has been gathering steam largely because many see it as a way to avoid future financial meltdowns. But this is a case where the supposed cure would not prevent the disease – and might very well cause unpleasant side effects. The 1999 repeal of key sections of Glass-Steagall, which erected a wall between commercial banks and securities activities, is blamed by many for the 2008 financial collapse. But it is hard to see how. Not a single one of the biggest culprits in the financial meltdown – Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, AIG, Merrill or Bear Stearns – was the kind of financial hybrid that Glass-Steagall sought to prevent. Most of the problems that sprung up among financial institutions in 2008 were among pure-play institutions, primarily investment banks – whose bets weren’t being backed by insured deposits. J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America were already in both the commercial and investment banking business by 2008; not only did they not collapse, they were positioned to rescue others. In fact, if Glass-Steagall had still been in place in 2008, the financial collapse would probably have come earlier and its impact would have been worse. The investment bank Bear Stearns was saved from bankruptcy by J.P. Morgan Chase – a rescue that would not have been possible if the latter was still restricted from having an investment banking arm. Similarly, Glass-Steagall would have barred Bank of America from taking over Merrill. We might have seen the impact of the Lehman collapse times three. Moreover, if allowing banks to have both commercial and investment banking divisions threatens the security of the banking system, why was Canada almost the only country in the G7 to get through the 2008 crisis without losing a financial institution? Canada knocked down the walls between commercial and investment banking (and insurance) in the 1990s, and hasn’t required banks to shed any of their activities since. Americans who are concerned by the shrinking number of banks should look north, where for decades only five banks have competed across Canada. (And are increasingly able to compete outside the nation’s borders.) So what are the advantages of going backward? Separating commercial banks off doesn’t prevent them from making bad bets on mortgages; it only prevents them from making up for them through other revenue streams. Separating them doesn’t prevent them from becoming ‘too big to fail.’ If J.P. Morgan Chase was forced to split off their investment banking from commercial banking arms, both would still be huge – and the failure of either could still trigger economic turmoil. The same is true for other behemoths like Citi and Bank of America. President Trump’s biggest complaint about banking is that lenders aren’t extending enough money. (Despite the fact that commercial lending is at a record level according to the Federal Reserve). Would he be happy if splitting off investment from commercial banking caused large banks to pursue more conservative lending policies, at least during a transition period? There is a reason that the bill to eliminate the key sections of Glass-Steagall in 1999 was signed by a Democratic president, with the support of overwhelming majorities of both parties in the Senate and the House. The parties were able to work together because majorities in both recognized a need to grow financial institutions large enough to compete on the world stage, and offer a wide range of products and services, backed by the most up-to-date technology. And there was a desire for banks of all sizes and stripes to be able to offer their customers deposit, lending, brokerage and insurance services under one roof. The need is especially acute during periods characterized by low interest rates, when shrinking spreads between banks’ borrowing costs and the rates at which they can lend requires them to diversify into other areas. The decision to replace Glass-Steagall with Gramm-Leach-Bliley was simply a case of the law catching up with reality. Reality hasn’t changed – neither should the law.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted May 7, 2017 at 3:49am by iClarified · 5691 views · Translate Apple is planning to make changes to the earpiece on the next generation iPhone, according to a new research note from JPMorgan. The iPhone 8 is said to feature an 'enhanced receiver' with 'further improvements' to stereo sound and waterproofing. With the launch of the iPhone 7, the earpiece (receiver) doubles as a speaker giving you stereo sound. Presumably, the new speaker in the iPhone 8 will be louder and could be sufficiently waterproof to meet the IP68 water resistance rating rumored for the new smartphone. JPMorgan also claims that the iPhone 8 could come with AirPods instead of EarPods; however, that's quite unlikely considering there is still a 6 month shipping estimate on the wireless earphones five months after their release. (Or pay a premium on Amazon) Notably, a separate JPMorgan analyst (Rod Hall, USA), claims that Apple could preview the iPhone 8 at WWDC in June. That also seems very unlikely; however, Apple could be looking to get ahead of leaks and prepare developers for a new OS and display size.

Bower—Bloomberg/Getty Images Telecommunications Comcast and Charter to Announce Wireless Partnership, Source Says Reuters May 07, 2017 Comcast Corp (cmcsk) and Charter Communications (chtr) will announce a wireless partnership as soon as Monday, according to a source familiar with the matter. The deal will bar either company from entering into a material transaction for a year without the other company's consent, the source said, which would prevent Charter from immediately tying up with Verizon Communications (verizon.communications). The agreement will allow the companies to cut costs and share technology expertise, the source added, asking not to be named because the matter is private. The partnership is aimed at cutting the significant costs of entering the wireless market, as well as speeding up entry. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co (jpyyl) analysts wrote in January that building a wireless business could cost Comcast hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the first few years, potentially cutting as much as 5 cents to 10 cents off earnings per share in 2017. Representatives for Comcast and Charter declined to comment. A representative for Verizon could not be reached immediately for comment. Comcast in April became the first major U.S. cable provider to enter the highly competitive wireless market, announcing a wireless service with an unlimited data plan. The service will launch in coming weeks, the source said. For more on Comcast, watch Fortune's video: Comcast 's service will launch on Verizon's airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the two companies. It will allow customers to switch automatically to Comcast 's Wi-Fi hotspots from 4G LTE. Comcast is moving into wireless as cable companies seek to add more services to reduce customer churn, or attrition, as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Rival Charter has said it will introduce a mobile service in 2018. In January, Reuters reported Verizon was interested in exploring a combination with Charter as part of a long list of acquisition targets, but no proposal had been made for a tie-up between the two companies. Speculation over a combination of the companies underscores the pressure the nation's largest wireless carrier faces to make a deal in the wake of AT&T's (t) planned $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (twx), Verizon and other carriers also face a saturated smartphone market. The Wall Street Journal first reported the partnership, without giving further details.

The partnership is aimed at cutting the significant costs of entering the wireless market, as well as speeding up entry, the source said. The deal will bar either company from entering into a material transaction for a year without the other company's consent, the source said. That would prevent either company from tying up with a wireless carrier immediately on its own. In January, Reuters reported Verizon Communications Inc was interested in exploring a combination with Charter as part of a long list of acquisition targets, but no proposal had been made for a tie-up between the two companies. Analysts and investors have also speculated that Comcast could buy a U.S. carrier, such as T-Mobile US Inc or Sprint Corp, as its ambitions grow in the wireless market. At a Lions Gate Entertainment Corp investor conference in January, John Malone, whose Liberty Broadband Corp is Charter's largest stakeholder, raised the possibility that major cable companies could get together and buy T-Mobile. Monday's agreement between Comcast and Charter will allow the companies to cut costs and share technology expertise, as well as offer customers benefits such as seamless connection between their Wi-Fi hotspots, the source added, asking not to be named because the matter is private. JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts wrote in January that building a wireless business could cost Comcast hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the first few years, potentially cutting as much as 5 cents to 10 cents off earnings per share in 2017.

The partnership is aimed at cutting the significant costs of entering the wireless market, as well as speeding up entry, the source said. The deal will bar either company from entering into a material transaction for a year without the other company's consent, the source said. That would prevent either company from tying up with a wireless carrier immediately on its own. In January, Reuters reported Verizon Communications Inc was interested in exploring a combination with Charter as part of a long list of acquisition targets, but no proposal had been made for a tie-up between the two companies. Analysts and investors have also speculated that Comcast could buy a U.S. carrier, such as T-Mobile US Inc or Sprint Corp, as its ambitions grow in the wireless market. At a Lions Gate Entertainment Corp investor conference in January, John Malone, whose Liberty Broadband Corp is Charter's largest stakeholder, raised the possibility that major cable companies could get together and buy T-Mobile. Monday's agreement between Comcast and Charter will allow the companies to cut costs and share technology expertise, as well as offer customers benefits such as seamless connection between their Wi-Fi hotspots, the source added, asking not to be named because the matter is private. JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts wrote in January that building a wireless business could cost Comcast hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the first few years, potentially cutting as much as 5 cents to 10 cents off earnings per share in 2017. Representatives for Comcast and Charter declined to comment. Representatives for Verizon and T-Mobile could not be reached immediately for comment. Comcast in April gave new details about its plans for a wireless service, which will launch on Verizon's airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the two companies. The service will allow customers to switch automatically to Comcast's Wi-Fi hotspots from 4G LTE. It will launch in coming weeks, the source said. Comcast is moving into wireless as cable companies seek to add more services to reduce customer churn, or attrition, as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Rival Charter has said it will introduce a mobile service in 2018. The Wall Street Journal first reported the partnership, without giving further details.

Macron wins, China’s whopping deleveraging bill, and Gulf stocks tank. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about. Macron Beats Le Pen  Centrist Emmanuel Macron has won the French presidential runoff, projected to capture roughly 65 percent of the vote to far-right candidate Marine Le Pen's 35 percent, suggesting the populist electoral wave seen over the past year has hit a roadblock. The victor, who pledged to fight against "deepening divisions" in French society, must now deal with double-digit unemployment in one of Europe's biggest economies. The euro gained only marginally against most other currencies as the results poured in. This election wasn’t the only one that suggests populism may have hit an intermediate peak: Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats also won a state vote in northern Germany, besting the incumbent Social Democratic candidate. $453 Billion  That’s how much value Chinese stocks and bonds have lost since mid-April amid the government’s renewed efforts to crack down on financial leverage. JPMorgan Asset Management suggested that China’s leaders will only recalibrate their policies in the event that stocks retreat another 10 percent or the yuan “cracks under pressure.” The latter looks unlikely, however, with signs that capital controls continue to be effective. Foreign exchange reserves rose by more than expected to $3.03 trillion in April, their third consecutive advance.  Bloodbath in Gulf Stocks  Gulf stocks were taken to the woodshed after Brent crude broke below $50 per barrel last week and couldn’t make it back above that threshold on Friday. All major equity indexes in the oil-heavy region declined on Sunday, with the Kuwait Stock Exchange Index tumbling 2.8 percent. U.S. shale drillers’ renaissance is seen as offsetting OPEC’s production curbs. One incrementally positive sign for black gold: Iran’s oil minister said the nation will go along with whatever decision OPEC makes at its May 25 meeting in Vienna, adding that all signs point to a “renewal of the deal” to cap output. However, there’s also a big bet in markets that West Texas Intermediate falls below $39 per barrel by mid-July.  All-Time Highs for U.S. Stocks The S&P 500 Index posted its first record close since March 1 to end last week amid a bounce-back in beleaguered commodity stocks. April’s non-farm payroll reports released on Friday showed jobs growth of 211,000, surpassing the consensus estimate, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent, the lowest since May 2007. Over the weekend, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. posted quarterly profits that fell short of analysts’ estimates amid disappointing results in its insurance businesses. Indian Bank Shakeups The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced the appointment of seven new chief executive officers for the nation’s state-controlled banks, which account for the lion’s share of loans. The government also empowered the Reserve Bank of India to help resolve issues with non-performing loans at the nation’s lenders, a key prerequisite for reviving credit growth. This enhancement of authority for the RBI may give Governor Urjit Patel the necessary tools to finish the mission started by Raghuram Rajan, his predecessor. Recently, a top government adviser said there would be no need to set up a bad bank to absorb toxic assets.

Here are three things you need to know about this up and coming cryptocurrency.More The cryptocurrency ether, which hails from the open source blockchain network Ethereum, is now valued at over $100 per token for the first time since the Ethereum platform went live in the summer of 2015. Much like the fellow cryptocurrency bitcoin, the market value of ether has surged upwards over the past few weeks. Coindesk reported ether’s value skyrocketed 900 percent so far this year. The New York Department of Fiscal Services has already approved Ethereum trading and ether tokens are officially a regulated currency. Ethereum has also attracted investment from major corporations like Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase, two of the 30 companies that now make up the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Yet the new blockchain technology is still largely shrouded in mystery. Read: UN Using Blockchain Technology To Help Refugees, Fight World Hunger So International Business Times sat down with Jutta Steiner, founder and COO of Parity Technologies, a blockchain startup that developed an Ethereum network browser. Parity Technologies is one of the companies behind the United Nation’s first large-scale Ethereum test, a humanitarian aid project at refugee camps in Jordan. Together with Steiner, we’ve put together a list of three things you need to know about this up and coming cryptocurrency. 1. Ethereum is the world’s second most popular cryptocurrency. Ether tokens are the second most popular currency for blockchain transactions. According to a recent study by Cambridge University, the first two months of 2017 saw more than 47,790 daily transactions on the Ethereum network. The study revealed that Bitcoin is still king, supported by 98 percent of cryptocurrency exchange networks and vendors, compared to 33 percent that accommodate ether tokens. However, ether tokens are gaining traction at a much faster rate than bitcoin. The number of Ethereum transactions has more than doubled since last year. 2. Although Ethereum has its own coins, Bitcoin exchanges still sell ether tokens. Bitcoin exchanges like Kraken, Bitfinex, Coinbase and Gemini, all allow ether trading and some even let users trade the tokens for U.S. dollars, CoinDesk reported. These days it’s easier to go shopping with bitcoin than it is with ether tokens. But Ethereum and Bitcoin aren’t necessarily competitors. They are more like cousins. They generally use the same technology for different purposes. “Rather than competing with Bitcoin like many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum complements it,” Entrepreneur magazine explained. “While the Bitcoin blockchain network tracks ownership of its own currency...People use Ethereum to create custom [but trustworthy] crowdfunding platforms, autonomous online organizations and even their own cryptocurrencies.” 3. Ethereum has the potential to be much more than just digital money. “Ethereum has, from my perspective, much more vibrant developer community that thinks about different usages and explores them,” Steiner told IBT. For example, rather than needing Airbnb or Uber to facilitate exchanges between individuals, Ethereum could be used to disrupt the “sharing economy,” which critics see as exploitive. In the future, the ether blockchain network could connect users directly with providers. Right now, these middleman apps charge the provider a fee and collect the users’ data for their own corporate interests. Read: Bitcoin Price Reaches All-Time High, Continues Upward Trend In 2017 “Ethereum processes user's transactions on these applications,” Steiner explained. “Parity's browser can be used to explore the new generations of Uber or Airbnb networks that are 100 percent in the hand of their users, where no intermediary can extract large fees just by sitting in the center.” The Ethereum community is still relatively small. Steiner estimates user's number in the tens of thousands, compared to 2.9 to 5.8 million cryptocurrency users worldwide, according to the Cambridge study. But since the same study estimates around 1,875 people now work full-time in the cryptocurrency industry, many of which are Ethereum developers, that ratio is expected to change quite quickly. “I really believe we've reached a tipping point,” Steiner said. “Maybe not yet in day to day adoption, but definitely in awareness, which I'm sure will turn into adoption in the end.”   Related Articles Russia Announces Plan To Legalize Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency Is Coming To A Las Vegas Strip Club Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Control your Roomba with just your voice via this new Alexa integration Yahoo Tech The tiny box that gives you free home phone service for life is Amazon’s deal of the day BGR News We noshed on Nougat, and Android 7.0 is Google’s sweetest update yet Yahoo Tech Does the 2018 Mustang remind you of Darth Vader?

It’s becoming a key question for investors as the government’s stepped up campaign to rein in financial leverage ripples through markets. The clampdown has erased at least $453 billion from the value of Chinese stocks and bonds since mid-April, spurred $21 billion of canceled debt sales and compelled the People’s Bank of China to inject $48 billion into jittery money markets. Sales of asset-management products by lenders and trust companies have plunged by more than 30 percent, while domestic real estate transactions have slowed and metals prices have buckled. The upheaval hasn’t reached crisis levels yet. But as the nation’s equity crash in 2015 showed, market declines in China have a habit of snowballing. As authorities juggle the conflicting goals of curbing leverage and maintaining economic growth before a Communist Party leadership reshuffle later this year, some money managers are bracing for more turbulence. “It would take a lot for the country to move into easing mode,” said Howard Wang, the Hong Kong-based head of greater China at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees about $1.8 trillion worldwide. “They will adjust their policies if markets go down another 10 percent or the currency cracks under pressure. Only these very drastic swings will make them move the other way.” China’s banking, insurance and securities regulators have all played a part in the clampdown, focusing much of their attention on the nation’s shadow banking system. The investment products produced by that system have funneled huge sums of cash into local asset markets, but critics say they employ too much leverage, create dangerous asset-liability mismatches and reduce transparency. Shadow banking assets in China increased by 21 percent in 2016 to the equivalent of $9.3 trillion, or 87 percent of gross domestic product, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report on Monday. To learn more about the measures, read this QuickTake Q&A The tightening campaign adds to a nine-month-long effort by China’s central bank to curtail excessive borrowing by gradually raising interest rates. The nation’s key seven-day repo rate has climbed to about 3 percent from 2.3 percent in August, and would likely be higher if not for cash injections by the PBOC via daily open-market operations over the past month. The rate topped 12 percent during a brief shakeout in the shadow banking system in 2013. Overseas money managers including Franklin Templeton Investments and Fidelity International have applauded the latest clampdown as necessary to curb a $28 trillion debt pile that threatens China’s long-term economic stability. Yet the reception by local investors has been anything but sanguine. The Shanghai Composite has dropped for four straight weeks to the lowest level in more than three months, even as MSCI Inc.’s gauge of global equities rallied to all-time highs. The Chinese benchmark index fell 0.5 percent to 3,087.22 at 9:48 a.m. local time on Monday, the biggest decline among major Asian equity gauges. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch China Broad Market Index of government and corporate debt has lost 0.9 percent since the new regulations began impacting markets, while borrowing costs for the nation’s top-rated companies have climbed to the highest levels in two years. Last week, the selloff spread to commodities. Concerns over tighter credit conditions, combined with signs of excess supplies, sent iron ore futures in Dalian down more than 8 percent. Traders worry that higher borrowing costs will weigh on China’s metals-hungry real estate industry. Home sales in square meter terms dropped about 30 percent in the final week of April from the same period a year ago, according to data for 26 major Chinese cities tracked by CREIS, a research institute run by the country’s most popular property website.

The number of wealth-management products issued by Chinese lenders sank 39 percent in April from the previous month, while trust firms distributed 35 percent fewer products, according to data compilers PY Standard and Use Trust. WMPs -- popular savings vehicles that offer higher returns than deposits -- generate fees for Chinese banks while residing off their books. “What the top policy makers want is to bring lending back onto balance sheets,” said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. Shen said that while the tightening measures are likely to weigh on economic growth, now is a good time for the government to act. China’s expansion unexpectedly quickened to 6.9 percent in the first quarter, giving policy makers room to tighten without jeopardizing their growth target of around 6.5 percent this year. “It’s a balancing act,” said Kenny Wen, a strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial in Hong Kong. He said authorities are likely to keep their focus on the clampdown unless the Shanghai Composite falls below the 3,000 level, a 3.3 percent decline from Friday’s close. Investors shouldn’t assume that Chinese leaders can meet their “incompatible” objectives of maintaining an acceptable rate of economic expansion and reining in shadow banks, John-Paul Smith, a London-based emerging markets strategist at Ecstrat Ltd., wrote in an emailed report titled “The Stability Illusion” on May 3. The market reaction to tightening measures over the past month has highlighted the fragility of an economy that depends on ever-increasing amounts of debt to grow, according to Smith. “Beijing is caught between a rock and a hard place,” he wrote. “The risk is that any serious attempt to curtail the growth of financial intermediation will be the catalyst for the economy to relapse.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The government said late last month that it had reached an agreement with the city’s two duopoly power utilities over the extension of the so-called “scheme of control [SoC]” regime, under which the cap on return on net fixed assets will be slashed to 8 per cent in 2019 from the current 9.99 per cent. Although the change will result in a one-off profit drop in 2019, the companies are expected to see modest profit growth in subsequent years since their fixed assets will increase as they build more natural gas-fired generators to replace coal-fired ones to meet the government’s more stringent emission standards and environmental goals. Guaranteed earnings cut for Hong Kong power firms HK Electric, whose sole source of profit is its regulated utilities business in Hong Kong, would see profit drop just over 20 per cent in 2019, while CLP, which sources only 65 per cent of its profit from the business may see a smaller drop of 16 per cent in 2019, according to estimates by UBS head of Asian utilities research Simon Powell. Analysts expect the duo to maintain their dividend yield – payout as a percentage of share price – at levels that will maintain investors’ interest. “CLP can maintain its absolute dividend per share by raising payout to 61 per cent in 2019 [from 55.7 per cent last year],” said Elaine Wu, executive director of Hong Kong and China utilities equity research at JPMorgan in a report. “It did the same thing last time when SoC return was cut in 2009.” After its annual shareholders meeting last Friday, CLP chief executive Richard Lancaster told reporters that with stronger performance of its overseas operations and continued growth of power demand in Hong Kong, the firms aims to maintain its 50-year track record of paying stable to higher dividends. Wu projected the duo’s regulated fixed assets to grow by 1-2 per cent annually in the next five to ten years. The maximum permitted return was slashed from 13.5-15 per cent to 9.99 per cent in the previous round of regulatory regime revision in 2009, when developed economies entered an era of ultra-low interest rates. Wu’s view is shared by Citi’s head of Asia utilities equities research Pierre Lau. “We think CLP shareholders – the Kadoorie family being the largest – would rather not see a dividend cut from the company,” he wrote in a note. Hong Kong utility CLP’s profit beats forecasts, expects return regime agreement before July But HK Electric, an investment trust obliged to pay its owners all of its distributable income, would probably have to prune its dividend per share by 20 per cent, Wu said. Still, she expects its dividend yield to remain at a relatively high 4.6 per cent in 2019, compared to 5.9 per cent in 2018. The new return was at the high end of the government’s previous target and in line with estimates by analysts, who said the pruned return still compares favourably to other developed economies for regulated utilities. For example, returns of regulated power transmission and distribution firms range between 5.5 per cent to 6.8 per cent on shareholders’ equity, according to Hu Xinmin, principal at Hong Kong-based electricity industry consultancy Lantau Group. The extension of the regime’s term from 10 years previously to 15 years was a “positive surprise,” Wu told the Post, adding that Hong Kong is one of few economies that have such long “return visibility” for energy utilities, compared to between five and eight years in Britain and Australia. “Besides, the Hong Kong regime is transparent and profit is easy to estimate, given all of the fuel costs can be passed through to consumers and the five-year capital expenditure plan gives good visibility of asset bases on which returns are calculated,” she said. CLP has risen 1 per cent since the new regime was announced and closed Friday at HK$81.6, while HK Electric climbed 3.7 per cent and last traded at HK$7.06. HK Electric has gained 30 per cent since it was spun off as a separate listed firm from Power Assets in January 2014. CLP has risen 38 per cent in the same period.

Eicher Motors Brokerage: Nomura | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 25,651 The brokerage house believes that visibility of volume growth is high and expects Eicher Motors to gain share in new cities. It also raised volume target growth for Royal Enfield by over 3 percent after the start of its third unit in August. Meanwhile, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin was likely to remain steady at 7.6 percent/8.6 percent over FY18-19. However, it expects a slowdown in M&HCV cycle in FY18. Brokerage: Deutsche Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 29,000 Based on the outperformance of volume growth in motorcycles, Deutsche Bank chose to upgrade the stock. The increase in target price reflects a valuation re-rating to 27 times of FY19 estimated PE. It also lifted the earnings per share (EPS) forecast by 5-9 Having said that, a lower than expected ramp up in motorcycle volumes is a key risk to the stock. Brokerage: CLSA CLSA observed that the slight beat in the March quarter results was driven by a better CV margin, while Royal Enfield’s numbers were broadly in line. It observed that Royal Enfield will start its third plant in August and is targeting production of 8.25 lakh units for FY18. Royal Enfield will run at full utilization on expanded capacity for the next two years, it said. Volume forecast for Royal Enfield was raised by the firm, but has cut volume estimates for VECV due to the sharp slowdown in CVs. Avenue Supermarts Brokerage: Kotak | Rating: Sell| Target: Rs 580The brokerage firm observed that the retail major’s strong Q4 was led by likely sustained same store sales growth (SSSG) performance as well as new store additions. It believes that the company is looking for new clusters where it could add new stores in the future. At its current P/E, the stock is trading at 49 times FY19 estimated, which is expensive, the brokerage said. Apollo Tyres Brokerage: Deutsche Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 260 The brokerage house sees sequential improvement post Q1, driven by price hike impact, commodity weakness. Meanwhile, deceleration in volume growth, delays in pace of price hikes are key risks to the stock. ACC-Ambuja Cements Brokerage: JPMorgan | Observation: Merger a significant positive The global brokerage firm believes that the merger consideration between both the companies was a significant positive and one can expect an announcement in 12-18 months. It sees both brands continuing to co-exist under one entity. The merger would further simplify the holding structure for the parent and would also pave way for realisation of sizeable cost synergies for the combined entity. These synergies may yield margin accretion of 300-400 basis points. A 20-25 percent flow through guided synergies would make the merger EPS accretive, JPMorgan said. On the regulatory front, it sees CCI nod unlikely to be an issue, but a nod from shareholders would be the key, it said. In a broader sense, JPMorgan does not expect significant change in the industry dynamics and pricing power. Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy on Ambuja and Outperform on ACC | Target for ACC: Rs 1,925 | Target for Ambuja: Rs 311CLSA believes that in view of the structure, ACC should merge into Ambuja. Further, it said that it cannot moderate synergies at this stage, but raised estimates for both the companies by 5-11 percent. Multiples were broadly in-line with past 5-year averages and factor in better demand-pricing environment. tags #Market #Nifty #Sensex #Stocks Views Related news Business Eicher Motors gains post strong Q4 results; brokerages remain upbeat May 08, 2017 11:32 AM Business Sell Equitas Holdings, Ajanta Pharma; buy Ambuja Cements 270 Call: Mitessh Thakkar May 08, 2017 11:31 AM Business Market may be range bound; need concrete steps for NPA resolution: Udayan Mukherjee May 08, 2017 11:26 AM Business Buy Ambuja Cements, Sun TV, ICICI Bank: Ashwani Gujral May 08, 2017 11:20 AM Business Buy Ambuja Cements, sell Hindalco Industries: Sudarshan Sukhani May 08, 2017 11:11 AM Business Buy Lupin, Tata Steel, Berger Paints: Manoj Murlidharan May 08, 2017 10:48 AM Business Buy Sun TV, ICICI Bank, Ahluwalia Contracts; sell Glenmark, HPCL: Mitessh Thakkar May 08, 2017 10:43 AM Business Sell Ujjivan, Hindustan Zinc, Tata Motors DVR; buy Escorts, Tata Coffee: Gujral May 08, 2017 10:38 AM Business Auto ancillaries & logistics may see good earnings; wary of hsg fin cos: Nilesh Shah May 08, 2017 10:16 AM News Most Popular Top News Loan defaulters beware!

Holders of China UnionPay Co cards issued by banks in China must show mainland identification cards and have their identities verified through a facial recognition system for ATM cash withdrawals, according to a Macau government statement late Sunday. The technology will be eventually applied to all ATMs, focusing on ones in casinos, according to the statement. "The government spares no effort to implement anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism rules," it said in the statement. The move is Macau's latest effort to strengthen anti-money laundering rules in the territory, the only place in China where gambling is legal. Chinese authorities are seeking to halt billions of dollars worth of outflows that have pushed down the value of the currency and drained capital reserves. The ATM rules follow a ban last year that prohibits proxy betting by telephone aimed at staunching bets from gamblers in China. sentifi.com Market voices on: The ATM rules, which didn't come with a timeline for rollout, are not expected to curb demand significantly, JPMorgan Chase & Co analyst DS Kim wrote in a note Monday. It's common to see people using multiple cards to withdraw cash from Macau ATMs, with some possibly using other peoples' accounts or cards, Kim wrote. SEE ALSO: China's yuan firms as banks sell US dollars, trade data taken in stride Still, there are other channels that players and junket operators employ to get cash in Macau, he said. "We can't rule out any potential impact on "player psychology," as some players/junkets may feel reluctant to use ATM cards given increased ID checks," Mr Kim wrote. "The news could and will likely remind many investors of how vulnerable the sector is to regulatory issues, and may serve as a 'wake-up call' to the sector's inherent headline risks." The Bloomberg Intelligence index of Macau gaming shares dropped as much as 0.8 per cent Monday, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index gained as much as 0.6 per cent. NPC Chairman Visit The new rules come as National People's Congress Chairman Zhang Dejiang, the Chinese Communist Party's third-most-senior leader, arrives Monday for a three-day visit to Macau, according to the South China Morning Post. The paper reported that he's expected to make a major announcement during the trip, which comes as the party prepares for a leadership reshuffle later this year. Macau's casino revenue in April grew for a ninth straight month as high-stakes players, most from China, continued to return to the tables at casinos including the Wynn Macau Ltd and Sands China Ltd. Gross gaming receipts rose 16.3 per cent to 20.2 billion patacas (S$3.51 billion) in April.

The centrist’s emphatic victory, which also smashed the dominance of France’s mainstream parties, will bring huge relief to European allies who had feared another populist upheaval to follow Britain’s vote to quit the EU and Donald Trump’s election as US president. With virtually all votes counted, Macron had topped 66 per cent against just under 34 per cent for Le Pen - a gap wider than the 20 or so percentage points that pre-election surveys had suggested. Even so, it was a record performance for the National Front, a party whose anti-immigrant policies once made it a pariah, and underlined the scale of the divisions that Macron must now try to heal. After winning the first round two weeks ago, Macron had been accused of behaving as if he was already president; yesterday night, with victory finally sealed, he was much more solemn. “I know the divisions in our nation, which have led some to vote for the extremes. I respect them,” Macron said in an address at his campaign headquarters, shown live on television. “I know the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that very many of you have also expressed. It’s my responsibility to hear them,” he said. “I will work to recreate the link between Europe and its peoples, between Europe and citizens.” Later he strode alone almost grimly through the courtyard of the Louvre Palace in central Paris to the strains of the EU anthem, Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, not breaking into a smile until he mounted the stage of his victory rally to the cheers of his his partying supporters. His immediate challenge will be to secure a majority in next month’s parliamentary election for a political movement that is barely a year old, rebranded as La Republique En Marche (“Onward the Republic”), in order to implement his programme. Europe defended  Outgoing president Francois Hollande, who brought Macron into politics, said the result “confirms that a very large majority of our fellow citizens wanted to unite around the values of the Republic and show their attachment to the European Union”. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, told Macron: “I am delighted that the ideas you defended of a strong and progressive Europe, which protects all its citizens, will be those that you will carry into your presidency”. Macron spoke by phone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he hopes to revitalise the Franco-German axis at the heart of the EU, saying he planned to visit Berlin shortly. Trump also tweeted his congratulations on Macron’s “big win”, saying he looked forward to working with him. The euro currency, which had been rising for two weeks as the prospect receded that Francewould elect an anti-EU president, topped US$1.10 (RM4.77) in early Asian trading for the first time since the US elections. “Fading political risk in France adds to the chance that euro zone economic growth can surprise to the upside this year,” said Holger Schmieding, analyst at Berenberg Bank. The 39-year-old former investment banker, who served for two years as economy minister under Hollande but has never previously held elected office, will become France’s youngest leader since Napoleon. Le Pen, 48, said she had also offered her congratulations. But she defiantly claimed the mantle of France’s main opposition in calling on “all patriots to join us” in constituting a “new political force”. Her tally was almost double the score that her father Jean-Marie, the last far-right candidate to make the presidential runoff, achieved in 2002, when he was trounced by the conservative Jacques Chirac. Her high-spending, anti-globalisation ‘France-first’ policies may have unnerved financial markets but they appealed to many poorer members of society against a background of high unemployment, social tensions and security concerns. Reshaping the landscape  Despite having served briefly in Hollande’s deeply unpopular Socialist government, Macron managed to portray himself as the man to revive France’s fortunes by recasting a political landscape moulded by the left-right divisions of the last century. “I’ve liked his youth and his vision from the start,” said Katia Dieudonné, a 35-year-old immigrant from Haiti who brought her two children to Macron’s victory rally. “He stands for the change I’ve wanted since I arrived in France in 1985 - openness, diversity, without stigmatising anyone ... I’ve voted for the left in the past and been disappointed.” Macron’s team successfully skirted several attempts to derail his campaign - by hacking its communications and distributing purportedly leaked documents - that were reminiscent of the hacking of Democratic Party communications during Hillary Clinton’s US election campaign. Allegations by Macron’s camp that a massive computer hack had compromised emails added last-minute drama on Friday night, just as official campaigning was ending. While Macron sees France’s way forward in boosting the competitiveness of an open economy, Le Pen wanted to shield French workers by closing borders, quitting the EU’s common currency, the euro, radically loosening the bloc and scrapping trade deals. When he moves into the Elysee Palace after his inauguration next weekend, Macron will become the eighth - and youngest - president of France’s Fifth Republic. Opinion surveys taken before the second round suggest that his fledgling movement, despite being barely a year old, has a fighting chance of securing the majority he needs. He plans to blend a big reduction in public spending and a relaxation of labour laws with greater investment in training and a gradual reform of the unwieldy pension system. A European integrationist and pro-Nato, he is orthodox in foreign and defence policy and shows no sign of wishing to change France’s traditional alliances or reshape its military and peacekeeping roles in the Middle East and Africa. New generation  His election also represents a long-awaited generational change in French politics that have been dominated by the same faces for years. He will be the youngest leader in the current Group of Seven (G7) major nations and has elicited comparisons with youthful leaders past and present, from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to British ex-premier Tony Blair and even late US president John F. Kennedy. But any idea of a brave new political dawn will be tempered by an abstention rate yesterday of around 25 per cent, the highest this century, and by the blank or spoiled ballots submitted by 12 per cent of those who did vote. Many of those will have been supporters of the far-left maverick Jean-Luc Melenchon, whose high-spending, anti-EU, anti-globalisation platform had many similarities with Le Pen’s. Melenchon took 19 per cent in coming fourth in the first round of the election, and pointedly refused to endorse Macron for the runoff. France’s biggest labour union, the CFDT, welcomed Macron’s victory but said that the National Front’s score was still worryingly high. “Now, all the anxieties expressed at the ballot by a part of the electorate must be heard,” it said in a statement. “The feeling of being disenfranchised, of injustice, and even abandonment is present among a large number of our citizens.” The more radical leftist CGT union called for a demonstration on Monday against “liberal” economic policies. Like Macron, Le Pen will now have to work to try to convert her presidential result into parliamentary seats, in a two-round system that has in the past encouraged voters to vote tactically to keep her out. She has worked for years to soften the xenophobic associations that clung to the National Front under her father, going so far as to expel him from the party he founded. Last night, her deputy Florian Philippot distanced the movement even further from him by saying the new, reconstituted party would not be called “National Front”. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week France's Le Pen pledges to overhaul party after defeat (VIDEO) Accepting Kennedy award, Obama voices 'fervent hope' for healthcare (VIDEO) Singapore: Macron’s win in France election brings hope to the world (VIDEO) Macron's French election win reaches 66pc (VIDEO) Battered Europe gets reprieve with Macron victory (VIDEO) Trump, Putin discuss first meeting, Syria during ‘very good call’ Two girls arrested for misusing boarding passes to meet K-pop star at Changi Airport Two arrested for sending threatening letters, hell notes to PM Lee and other govt leaders Islamic State attacks base where US advisers stationed in Iraq Hamas eases stance on Israel with new policy document Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Sharapova remains tight-lipped over Bouchard comments Reuters Video: Macron storms to victory in French election Reuters Video: North Korea detains another American citizen, KCNA reports Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Related Articles These are the nine elections to care about after France (VIDEO) Najib congratulates Macron on French presidential election victory China’s Xi congratulates Macron on French election win (VIDEO) Macron and the revival of Europe — Roger Cohen Singapore: Macron’s win in France election brings hope to the world (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Andrew Ottoson, CC 2.0 There comes a time when what was once considered normal—be it slavery, a sweatshop, or sexual harassment—is seen to be profoundly immoral. When it comes to protecting a livable planet for our children, we have come to that moment. Climate change is already causing the deaths of over 150,000 people a year, as well as the relocation of entire nations and the collapse of ecosystems. Further, if we allow normal business to continue for much longer, we will lose forever our brief window for remaining below 1.5°C of warming, beyond which ecological instability is widespread. It is, in part, this fundamental tenet that has prompted over 100 first nations and tribes to officially oppose all expansion of tar sands, the dirtiest form of energy on the planet. It is also what caused Rosebud Sioux president Cyril Scott to call the Keystone XL pipeline an “act of war” on our planet. In April, the Seattle City Council voted in favor of avoiding banking with any financial institution that provides loans to Keystone XL. The Council’s reasons for this were clear: KXL’s impact on the climate would be disastrous. The City Council vote was an important pronouncement in light of Trump’s all-out attacks on climate progress and his greenlighting of KXL. Projects like KXL rely on large loans for their construction. (The Dakota Access pipeline, for example, was a $3.8 billion pipeline, $2.5 billion of which came from bank loans.) Between 2013 and 2015, the world’s twenty-five largest banks provided $765 billion in funding to new fossil fuel infrastructure and exploration projects. Without these loans, it becomes difficult for fossil fuel corporations to find the billions required to build new infrastructure projects. In other words: if you stop the flow of dollars, you keep the oil in the ground, where it belongs. People are waking up to the significance of the role of the banks in the climate crisis. Prompted by passionate advocates, Seattle was the first city in the country to break ties with a bank, in part, because it provided loans for the Dakota Access pipeline. Since then San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C, Philadelphia, Missoula, Davis, Santa Monica, and Providence have begun the process of severing ties with banks financing the Dakota Access pipeline, removing over $5 billion worth of City business in the process. It is against this backdrop that the same coalition of Native Americans and climate activists that packed City Hall to demand divestment from Wells Fargo, have promised to occupy and shut down branches of JPMorgan Chase across Seattle unless the banking institution publicly states that it won’t provide loans to the Keystone XL pipeline, or any other new tar sands infrastructure. Activists intend to disrupt the bank’s ability to do business on May 8th, which will inconvenience blameless bank workers and customers. This is, of course, unfortunate, but history has taught us that civil disobedience is a powerful force for change. From the suffragettes and the civil rights movement, to the anti-nuclear movement and the fight for gay rights, civil disobedience has been used again and again to spark deep and lasting change. Peaceful and widespread civil disobedience may be just what we need to persuade banks to stop financing projects that are incompatible with life on this planet as we know it. We live in a world defined by the investments we make—and a world increasingly re-defined by the impacts of climate change. The time is now for us to make it crystal clear to the banks that they will be held accountable for investments in projects like DAPL and KXL. Actions like those on May 8th are one of the most effective ways we can tell CEOs like Chase’s Jamie Dimon that we will not stand idly by as they profit from projects that threaten all life on Earth. Bold action can take many forms, whether it is civil disobedience, rallying in protest, writing to your legislators, switching to a socially and environmentally responsible bank, or finding a way to significantly decrease reliance on fossil fuels in your life. To slow the momentum of climate change and give us a chance at regaining a stable planet, we must deploy all of them—and we must be as bold as possible in doing so. Our planet depends on it. (On Monday, one of the many actions across the City is being led by Water Protectors from Standing Rock. They ask you to join them in solidarity on Monday by meeting at Westlake Park at 1130am. If you can't make it on Monday, you can call Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon, and ask that Chase does not fund any new tar sands projects. His office number is: 212-270-1111.

But there’s a clear price tag — $2.4 billion — for the amount of taxpayer money residential mortgage services and investors have made off with for cancelled HAMP modifications. At least 155,000 of those homeowners lost their homes. That’s the latest tally from watchdog SIGTARP, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which has been blasting servicers’ mismanagement, waste, and abusive practices, and urging Treasury to crack down, for years. Treasury could have turned off the money spigot for payments related to time periods when servicers “failed to perform at an acceptable level,” SIGTARP’s latest report to Congress, published last month, says. But Treasury paid $448 million, even after finding the performance of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Ocwen, CitiMortgage, and Nationstar needed “substantial improvement,” in some cases for multiple quarters, said SIGTARP, recommending a claw back of taxpayer dollars when servicers are found to violate Treasury’s contracts. There’s a lot more cash on tap for servicers and banks, and little reason to expect that Treasury, now helmed by Steven Mnuchin — who ran OneWest when it aggressively foreclosed on thousands of homes — will crack down on abuses. Treasury shells out $650 million a quarter for HAMP and other Making Home Affordable programs, with $11 billion in MHA payments slated for servicers through 2023.

By Nomi Prins / TomDispatch May 4, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Nicole S Glass / Flickr President Trump, his children and their spouses, aren’t just using the Oval Office to augment their political legacy or secure future riches. Okay, they certainly are doing that, but that’s not the most useful way to think about what’s happening at the moment. Everything will make more sense if you reimagine the White House as simply the newest branch of the Trump family business empire, its latest outpost. It turns out that the voters who cast their ballots for Donald Trump, the patriarch, got a package deal for his whole clan.  That would include, of course, first daughter Ivanka who, along with her husband, Jared Kushner, is now a key political adviser to the president of the United States. Both now have offices in the White House close to him.  They have multiple security clearances, access to high-level leaders whenever they visit the Oval Office or Mar-a-Lago, and the perfect formula for the sort of brand-enhancement that now seems to come with such eminence. President Trump may have an exceedingly “flexible” attitude toward policymaking generally, but in one area count on him to be stalwart and immobile: his urge to run the White House like a business, a family business. The ways that Jared, “senior adviser to the president,” and Ivanka, “assistant to the president,” have already benefited from their links to “Dad” in the first 100 days of his presidency stagger the imagination. Ivanka’s company, for instance, won three new trademarks for its products from China on the very day she dined with President Xi Jinping at her father’s Palm Beach club. In a similar fashion, thanks to her chance to socialize with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her company could be better positioned for deal negotiations in his country.  One of those perks of family power includes nearing a licensing agreement with Japanese apparel giant Sanei International, whose parent company’s largest stakeholder is the Development Bank of Japan -- an entity owned by the Japanese government.  We are supposed to buy the notion that the concurrent private viewing of Ivanka’s products in Tokyo was a coincidence of the scheduling fairy. Yet since her father became president, you won’t be surprised to learn that global sales of her merchandise have more or less gone through the roof. Here’s where things get tricky. We can’t pinpoint the exact gains generated from any one meeting of the next generation Trump. They rely on the idea that, because their brand was so huge to begin with, profits and deals would have come anyway. That’s why we won’t ever see their books or tax returns. Conflicts of interest? They now permeate the halls of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but none of this will affect or change one thing President Trump holds dear -- and believe it or not, it’s not the wishes of his base in the American heartland.  It’s advancing his flesh and blood, and their flesh-and-blood-once-removed spouses and relatives. Federal Regulations and Trump Family Interpretations The Trumps and Kushners will behave in ways that will benefit their global businesses. There’s just one catch.  They have to get away with it, legally speaking. So the first law of family business in the Oval Office turns out to be: get stellar legal counsel. And they’ve done that. Their lawyers have by now successfully created trusts that theoretically -- but only theoretically -- separate Ivanka from her businesses and deflect any accusations over activities that may, now or in the future, violate federal rules. And there are two of those in particular to consider. The Code of Federal Regulations is a set of rules published by the executive departments and agencies of the government. Title 18 section 208 of that code deals with “acts affecting a personal financial interest.” This criminal conflict of interest statute states “an officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States Government” can’t have a “financial interest” in the result of their duties. What that should mean, legally speaking, for a family occupying the executive office is: Ivanka could not have dinner with the president of China while her business was applying for and receiving provisional approval of pending trademarks from his country, if one of those acts might impact the other. To an outsider, the connection between those acts seems obvious enough and it’s bound to be typical of what’s to come. Meanwhile, there are real penalties for being convicted of violating this rule. These include fines or imprisonment or both as set forth in section 216 of Title 18. Certain lawyers have argued that Ivanka’s and Jared’s appointments don't violate Rule 208 or other nepotism statutes because they are not paid advisers to the president. In other words, because Ivanka doesn’t get a salary for her service to her... uh, country... conflicts automatically vanish. She’s already done her Trumptilian best to demonstrate her affinity for ethical behavior by cordoning herself off from her business responsibilities (sort of). According to the New York Times, “Ivanka has transferred her brand’s assets into a trust overseen by her brother-in-law, Josh Kushner, and sister-in-law, Nicole Meyer.” Phew, no family connections there!  Or maybe she just doesn’t care for her siblings-in-law. But not all assets, it turns out, are created equal. So the daughter-in-chief will, it seems, keep her stake in the Trump International Hotel, a 15-minute stroll from the White House, which just happens to boast "the Ivanka Trump Suite" and "The Spa by Ivanka Trump." ("The Spa by Ivanka Trump™ and Fitness Center transitions guests from the Technogym setting of the Fitness Center to the tranquil spa haven that is calming, balancing, purifying, revitalizing, and healing...") There, many a foreign diplomat or special interest mogul can "calm, energize, [and] restore" himself or herself, while angling for an "in" with the family. We don’t know precisely the nature of what the Trump family stands to gain from the hotel because its books aren’t made public, but it’s reasonable to assume that we’re not talking losses. Besides this other D.C. domain, Ivanka and Jared will remain the beneficiaries of their mutual business empires now valued at about three quarters of a billion dollars, according to White House ethics filings. But wait. There’s an even more explicit rule against using public office (like, say, the White House) for private gain: Title 5 section 2635.702. On that subject, the section states that “an employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service, or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity.” Okay, that’s wordy. And though the rule doesn’t apply to the president or vice president -- we have Nelson Rockefeller to thank for that, but more on him later -- for any other executive office position, the rule explains that “status as an employee is unaffected by pay or leave status.” That means that you can’t say someone is not an employee just because she isn’t drawing a paycheck, which means she isn’t, in fact, exempt just because she can’t show a W-2 form. The second rule of family business is undoubtedly: control the means of enforcement. And President Trump just got his man onto the Supreme Court, so even if ethical charges rose to the highest court in the land, the family has at least a little insurance. Bankers and Presidents: A Walk Through History The idea of powerful bloodlines collaborating is nothing new in either business or politics. At the turn of the twentieth century, mogul families routinely intermarried to spawn yet more powerful and profitable business empires. And when it comes to Oval Office politics, American history is littered with multi-generational public servants with blood ties to presidents.  Abraham Lincoln’s oldest son, Robert, a Republican, served as secretary of war in the administrations of Presidents James Garfield and Chester Arthur, and finally as U.S. minister to Great Britain during President Benjamin Harrison’s administration. Dwight D. Eisenhower’s son, John, became a decorated brigadier general, served as assistant staff secretary in the White House while his father was in office and was later appointed ambassador to Belgium under President Richard Nixon (once his father’s vice-president). But neither of them inflated the coffers of the family business in the process. Whether family business connections might influence prominent figures in the White House isn’t a subject new to the Trump era either. In 1974, when Gerald Ford, who took over the presidency after Richard Nixon’s impeachment, nominated Nelson Rockefeller to be his vice president, Nelson’s brother David ran the Chase Manhattan Bank (now JPMorgan Chase).  Questions naturally arose about the notorious wealth and political reach of the Rockefeller family. Nelson, the grandson of oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, had even worked at the bank and had been on the boards of multiple oil companies. That same year, the Department of Justice conveniently concluded that conflict of interest laws did not apply to the office of the vice president -- but not before Democratic Senator Robert Byrd asked, “Can't we at least agree... that the influence is there, that it is a tremendous influence, that it is more influence than any president or vice president ever had?"  And yet, as fabulously wealthy and linked in as Nelson Rockefeller was, his situation doesn’t even compare to the family business tangle in the Trump White House. There have been other family members than the Trumps and Jared Kushner in positions of significance in the White House. When, for instance, Woodrow Wilson fell gravely ill in 1919, his second wife, Edith, stepped in to act on his behalf, essentially running the government in a blanket of secrecy from his bedside. Her intention, however, was never to make hay with a family business, but to ensure that her husband’s policies prevailed.  The two Bush presidents, with a business and banking legacy that snaked back a century, were elected, not handed power.  And though Bill Clinton’s reign in the Oval Office enabled wife Hillary to garner enough public recognition (and banking connections) to successfully run for senator in New York State, become secretary of state under President Obama, and launch two ultimately unsuccessful presidential bids, the Clintons only became super-wealthy after Bill’s time in office. Though their charity foundation’s ties to foreign governments remain suspect, they never had a private business while Bill was in the White House. What can’t be found in the historical record is someone’s child, wife, or relations holding court in the West Wing while expanding a family business, no less a network of them. The present situation, in other words, is unique in the annals of American history. Only 100 days into Donald Trump’s presidency, he already has something of the look of the authoritarian kleptocrats elsewhere on the planet who siphon state wealth into their own bank accounts and businesses. And remember, the Trump empire is also the Kushner empire.  Jared's family business depends on global investors hailing from countries that just happen to be in his White House portfolio. He, for example, led the efforts to prepare for the state visit to Mar-a-Lago of the Chinese president (while the Kushner business was engaged in high-level talks with a major Chinese financial conglomerate).  A Russian state-owned bank under U.S. sanctions whose chairman met with Jared in December referred to him as the head of Kushner Companies, though he was already visibly if not yet officially a Trump adviser. He is similarly the administration’s point man for Middle East “peace,” even though his family has financial relationships with Israel. Meanwhile, in his role as head of the newly formed White House Office of American Innovation, the potential opportunities to fuse government and private business opportunities are likely to prove endless. Nepotism on Parade Faced with the dynasty-crushing possibility of selling his business or even placing it in a blind trust, Donald Trump chose instead to let his two older sons, Eric and Donald Jr., manage it. Talk about smoke and mirrors.  While speaking with Forbes in March, Eric indicated that he would provide his father with updates on the Trump Organization “quarterly” -- but who truly believes that father and sons won’t discuss the family empire far more frequently than that? The family has already racked up a laundry list of global conflicts of interest that suggest ways in which the White House is likely to become a moneymaking vehicle for the Trump line. There’s Turkey, for instance, where the Trump Organization already has a substantial investment, and where President Trump recently called President Recip Tayyip Erdogan to congratulate him on his power-grabbing, anti-democratic victory in a disputed election to change the country’s constitution.  Given Trump business interests globally, you could multiply that call by the world. Meanwhile, Ivanka’s brand isn’t just doing business as usual, it’s killing it. Since 2017, according to the Associated Press, “global sales of Ivanka Trump merchandise have surged.” As a sign of that, the brand’s imports, mostly from China, have more than doubled over the previous year. As for her husband, he remained the CEO of Kushner Companies through January, only then abdicating his management role in that real-estate outfit and 58 other businesses, though remaining the sole primary beneficiary of most of the associated family trusts. His and Ivanka’s children are secondary beneficiaries. That means any policy decision he promotes could, for better or worse, affect the family business and it doesn’t take a genius to know which of those options he’s likely to choose. Kleptocrats, Inc. Despite an already mind-boggling set of existing conflicts of interest, ranging from business affiliations with oligarchs connected to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to the Secret Service and the Pentagon leasing space in Trump Tower (for at least $3 million per year), the Trump family business is now looking to the glorious, long haul. The family is already scouting for a second hotel in Washington. Trump has reportedly used nearly $500,000 from early campaign money raised for his own 2020 presidential bid to bolster the biz. It’s evidently been poured into “Trump-owned restaurants, hotels and golf clubs,” as well as rent at Trump Tower in New York City. According to the latest polls, the majority of registered voters believe that the installation of Ivanka and Jared in the White House is inappropriate. But that could matter less to Donald Trump. Ask Stephen Bannon or Chris Christie what happens when Ivanka or Jared don’t like you.  That’s the family version of mob-style power. Ivanka noted in her book, The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life, that “in business, as in life, nothing is ever handed to you.” Except, of course, when your father is president and he hands you the keys to grow the family business on a silver platter. Four decades ago, at a Senate hearing on his potential conflicts of interest, Vice President Rockefeller was asked, “Can you separate the interests of big business from the national interest when they differ?"  It’s a question some senator should pose to Ivanka and Jared, replacing “big business” with “big family business.” Making the future yet murkier, the family may be on the precipice of major problems. The most striking of them: Kushner’s marquee building, 666 Fifth Ave (an 80-story, ultra-luxury Manhattan skyscraper) has a greater than 25% vacancy rate. It hasn’t made enough money to even cover its interest payments for several years, and in two years it will have to pay principal as well on its $1.2 billion mortgage. That’s going to hurt if foreign companies don’t step in to stanch the flow of dollars out of the firm and that, undoubtedly, could require a quid pro quo or two. In our era, it’s no secret that presidents leave office with the promise of quickly growing exponentially wealthier. But for the first family to gain such wealth while still in the White House would be a first.  Yet the process that could make that possible already seems to be well underway. All this, as Donald Trump, his children, and his son-in-law continue to carve out an unprecedented role for themselves as America’s business-managers-in-chief, presiding not so much over the country as over their own expanding imperial domains.

Bloomberg News reports that BlackRock, Pacific Investment Management Co. and hedge fund BlueCrest Capital Management are working with law firm Quinn Emanuel to recover losses they blame on the manipulation of currency benchmarks, according to two people familiar with the case, who asked not to be identified because nothing has been filed. The target banks, including Barclays, Citigroup, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS, have been fined billions of dollars for conspiring to rig FX benchmarks.

The domestic indices lost ground on Friday amid heavy selling in banking and pharma sectors. The 30-share Sensex shed 267 points to settle at 29,858.80 while NSE's benchmark Nifty50 ended 75 points lower at 9,285.30 with 37 constituents in the red. On a weekly basis (April 28- May 5), the Sensex closed 60 points or 0.20 per cent lower while broader Nifty lost 10.25 points or 0.11 per cent. The biggest development of the week was the new NPA ordinance put forth by the Finance Ministry which later got approval by President Pranab Mukherjee. The ordinance gives Reserve Bank of India more power to order banks to clean up as much as $180 billion of bad loans on their balance sheets, which has been choking credit and weighing on the economic growth. "The fact that RBI has the power will be known to people and it will make the borrowers and bankers behave more responsibly," said KVS Manian, head of corporate banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank. Sceptical of the move, the bank stocks bled on Friday, dragging the indices lower. Another sector, which was certainly not in its pink of health, was pharma, which took a major beating after US parliament passed the American Healthcare Act, to repeal major parts of Obamacare and replace it with the Republican healthcare plan. Among other events, the initial public offer (IPO) of IRB InvIT Fund, the country’s first infrastructure investment trust to hit the primary market, closed on a strong note on Friday with the issue being subscribed 8.6 times. The issue got bids for 215.11 crore units, compared with the issue size of 25.09 crore units excluding the anchor book portion. Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here are the seven key factors that are likely to dictate market direction in the coming week. French Presidential Election Outcome: This one event has the potential to make the markets across the globe oscillate between the two extremes. France heads for final round of voting on Sunday to elect its next president where centrist Emmanuel Macron will face off against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who has said she would pull the country from out of the European Union, a potentially destabilising move for markets. Opinion polls indicate voters will pick Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old ex-economy minister who wants to bridge the left-right divide, resisting an anti-establishment tide that has seen Britons vote to leave the EU and Americans choose Donald Trump as US president, said a Reuters report. However, with the recent opinion polls going wrong in US Presidential election, Brexit and back home, state assembly polls where Modi-led BJP scripted a history in UP elections, investors are keeping their fingers crossed. The market has already priced in a win for Macron. However, a Le Pen win would be a ‘shock event’ and likely send global markets stocks down on Monday, feel market analysts. US Payroll Data: In a major boost to the American economy, the US reported a joyous figure of unemployment rate dropping to 4.4 per cent, near a 10-year low. The job growth rebounded sharply in April, bolstering the Federal Reserve's stand of raising interest rates in the next policy meet. The drop of one-tenth of a percentage point in the jobless rate took it to its lowest level since May 2007 and well below the most recent Federal Reserve median forecast for full employment. "These developments should keep the Fed firmly on track to hike rates again in June and should motivate a hawkish shift in the interest rate forecasts they will release at that meeting," Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York, was quoted as saying by Reuters. Earnings: Industry heavyweights Bharti Airtel, HCL Technologies, Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints and Dr Reddy's Laboratories are slated to release their March quarter earnings in the coming week. So far, majority of companies have reported better-than-expected results for the last quarter. Investors are likely to have a keen eye on the results before taking any position during the week. Other prominent names which will announce their financial results include Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Bharti Infratel. Macroeconomic Data: The government is expected to announce industrial production data for March after market hours on Friday. The industrial output slipped to a 4-month low contracting by 1.2 per cent in February because of decline in the manufacturing sector and lower offtake of capital as well as consumer goods. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) had registered a growth of 1.99 per cent in February last year. The Consumer Price-based Inflation (CPI) for April 2017 is also scheduled to release on the same day. The retail inflation rose to a 5-month high of 3.81 per cent in March against 3.65 per cent in February. Hudco IPO to hit D-St on Monday: State-owned Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco), a 'Miniratna' firm which provides loans for housing and urban infrastructure projects, will launch the IPO on May 8 where the government is offering 204,058,747 shares for sale. It has fixed the price band of Rs 56-60 per equity share. The issue will close on May 11. Global Cues: In the US, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester is expected to speak about the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs Public Breakfast Program -- From Main Street to Wall Street: Economic Growth, Monetary Policy, and the Federal Reserve, in Chicago IL, on Monday, 8 May 2017. Also, Bank of England (BoE) will announce monetary policy decision summary and minutes of the monetary policy committee meeting held on May 10 on Thursday. It will also announce inflation report for May 2017. Technical factors: "In the coming week, Nifty is likely to oscillate between 9,200 to 9,400 band. INDIA VIX surged 10% during the week and is likely to inch higher as global events unfold," says Vijay Singhania, Founder-Director, Trade Smart Online, a leading discount brokerage firm. "Bank Nifty relatively outperformed, gaining 1.10% on weekly close. Maximum open interest has built up in 22,000-put and 23,000-call strike, which is likely to be the broader range in the coming week for Bank Nifty," Singhania adds.

The mixed-use building is set to welcome its first tenants in August. Abby Drey adrey@centredaily.com Business May 06, 2017 11:36 PM The Metropolitan announces move-in date for future tenants By Roger Van Scyoc rvanscyoc@centredaily.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The Metropolitan, one of five proposed or under-construction high-rises in downtown State College, is set to welcome about 500 students on Aug. 18. Jose Garcia, the assistant sales and marketing manager, confirmed the move-in date, adding that almost all of its 136 apartments have been leased. About three are left in the 12-story, mixed-use building, he said on Monday. “As of now we are on-time and on-schedule,” Garcia said. Construction is ongoing. But, based on the given timeline, students will be able to move before Penn State’s fall semester begins on Aug. 21. The Metropolitan boasts about 32,000 square feet of retail and commercial space on the first two floors, with apartments taking up the remaining levels. Landmark Properties, based in Athens, Ga., and local company PennTrust Properties are the developers on the project. Garcia said while there’s been interest in the retail and commercial space, nothing has been solidified contractually. For now, the focus has been on getting the interior ready for move-in day. “Since the beginning, that’s been our move-in date and that has not changed at all,” he said. Teams are moving in furniture during the next two weeks, Garcia said. On the exterior of the building, custom glass still needs to be implemented at the corner of West College Avenue and North Atherton Street. From street view, wood currently dominates that corner of the building. Garcia added there are 151 underground parking spaces associated with the property. “I think once we move everybody in, I think everyone is really going to enjoy the property,” he said. M&T Bank branch in Pleasant Gap to close Reflecting a national trend, the M&T Bank branch in Pleasant Gap, 161 W. College Ave., is scheduled to close at 2 p.m. on June 2. Philip Hosmer, M&T Bank’s vice president for corporate communications, said the branch will be consolidated with the bank’s Bellefonte location at 915 E. Bishop St. All customer accounts, meanwhile, will be transferred to the Bellefonte branch. The Pleasant Gap location’s employees will also transfer over and work at the Bellefonte branch. “When we look at our branches, we evaluate locations where we may need to build a branch or where we may need to expand or renovate a branch, and also where a branch is no longer positioned to effectively serve our customers,” Hosmer said. “In those situations we look to consolidate offices as we’re doing here.” The move follows a number of branch closings across the country. In January, Wells Fargo announced plans to close more than 400 branches by the end of 2018. Business Insider reported that Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan closed 389 branches from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016. In 2015, more than 1,600 brick-and-mortar locations were shut down, according to analysis firm SNL Financial. Banks view younger consumers as doing more of their banking online. Like with other banks, M&T customers can deposit or transfer funds electronically through the bank’s mobile apps or website, and can also manage accounts over the phone. Hosmer added that customers at the Pleasant Gap branch can bank at any of M&T’s other locations, but their primary location will be the Bellefonte branch, which is open from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturdays. The Pleasant Gap branch is not open on Saturdays. Hosmer said the bank has no plans at this time to expand or contract further in the county. The Pleasant Gap branch will be marketed for sale after it closes. “As always, M&T remains committed to this community and will continue to serve our customers through all of our channels,” he said. The move will leave M&T Bank with four Centre County locations. Besides the Bellefonte branch, the bank has a location in Philipsburg and two in State College. Nittany Mall candy store closes C&R Candies and More closed April 29 after a 13-month run in the Nittany Mall. Owner Cathy Williamson said she may bring back the sweets shop for the holiday season, but has no plans to reopen at the moment. She said there wasn’t enough traffic to keep the store afloat. “We’d like to thank everybody who did come in,” Williamson said. “We enjoyed meeting a lot of people.” Williamson and her husband, Randy, also own Auntie Anne’s in the mall. Tait Farm Foods to hold anniversary celebration Tait Farm Foods is raising a glass to 30 years making its Original Fruit Shrub. The farm’s 15 flavors of the beverage mixer, a concoction of fruit, sugar and vinegar, will be sampled from 2 to 4 p.m. on June 17 at Tait Farm, 179 Tait Road, Centre Hall. Tait Farm Foods produces more than 60 products, according to a company release. But its shrub is one of its most famous. When mixed in everything from cocktails to dressings, it punches up the brew. Customers in major markets such as Philadelphia still use the farm’s original Raspberry Shrub in its cocktails.

The bipartisan legislation would provide clear and equal protections under federal law for all Americans in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury service, and federally-funded programs. Today, in a majority of U.S. states (31), LGBTQ people remain at risk of being fired, evicted or denied services because of who they are. 'No person's fundamental rights should be determined by which side of a state line they live on,' said HRC President Chad Griffin. 'The Equality Act will once and for all end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that leaves LGBTQ people at risk. Every American should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live their lives without fear of discrimination. And at its core, that's what the Equality Act is all about.' Discrimination is a real and persistent problem for far too many LGBTQ Americans. HRC polling has found that nearly two-thirds of self-identified LGBTQ Americans report experiencing discrimination - including people like Carter Brown, a transgender man from Texas who lost his job after he was outed by his colleagues. Currently, 50 percent of LGBTQ Americans like Mr. Brown live in states where they are at risk of being fired, denied housing, or refused service because of who they are. There is no federal law explicitly protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, and 31 states still lack fully-inclusive non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. Today's announcement included unprecedented support from the business community: 92 major corporations have now joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. While the overwhelming majority of America's leading businesses have already started addressing workplace fairness for LGBTQ employees, these major employers know how important the need is for a federal standard that treats all employees the same no matter which state they live in. The slate of companies endorsing the Equality Act have combined operations in all 50 states, headquarters spanning 23 states, and collectively generate $2.6 trillion in revenue. In total, these companies employ more than 5.8 million people across the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans support full federal equality for LGBTQ people. Polling released last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that support for a bill like the Equality Act topped 70 percent nationally, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. PRRI's groundbreaking survey included 42,000 interviews in 50 states and found majority support for the Equality Act in all 50 states. The Equality Act is co-sponsored by 240 members of Congress. It was first introduced in 2015 by Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) and by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Cory Booker (D-NJ).

They even drew a diagram, which was shared with MacRumors, showing Touch ID placed below the Apple logo on the rear. Such a placement would make Touch ID easier to reach and help Apple avoid some of the criticism leveled against Galaxy S8, which has relocated its fingerprint sensor from the Home button found on the front of previous Galaxies to the back of Galaxy S8, next to its camera. Here’s an excerpt from the report: iPhone to ditch fingerprint sensor? We don’t think so. Both Samsung and Apple tried to enable in-display fingerprint sensing on full-screen OLED phones in 2017, but their optical tech seems immature and the major iPhone 8 bottleneck. Some thus speculate the fingerprint sensor will be removed and replaced by 3D sensing. Our latest supply chain checks indicate that iPhone 8 will still have the sensor given security, user-friendliness and a need for payments infrastructure, but there is a high chance it will be on the back like Samsung’s Galaxy S8. The diagram CLSA shared, seen below, suggests that iPhone 8 could be slightly larger than iPhone 7 but smaller than its Plus brethren at 144mm tall, 71mm wide and 7.69mm deep. Other features we can infer from the drawing include a vertically aligned dual-lens camera out the back and new sensors for the front-facing camera, possibly to support the previously rumored 3D sensing, facial recognition and augmented reality functionality. According to Benjamin Geskin on Twitter, his own source has dismissed CLSA’s drawing as fake and their research note as ”1000 percent false”. On the other hand, Android Police has called Geskin’s own leaks as fake, so there’s that. All that we see today, maybe it's the iPhone 7S with glass back and wireless charging. And not the #iPhone8 What do you think? — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 7, 2017 Be that as it may, CLSA’s report would definitely be in stark contrast to the recently leaked iPhone 8 manufacturing molds and technical drawings that show what appears to be a wireless charging mat on the back, but no rear Touch ID. For what it’s worth, older iPhone 8 schematics—some of which have been dismissed as possibly doctored—did depict a circular cutout on the back of the device, right below the Apple logo, that may or may not indicate a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Apple is said to be prototyping as many as ten different iPhone 8 models this year, with some of them possibly being Apple’s fallback iPhone 8 model with Touch ID on the back. JPMorgan analysts speculated this week that iPhone 8 could feature enhanced stereo sound and waterproofing via an improved earpiece. JPMorgan added that iPhone 8 could ship with Apple’s $159 AirPods, potentially replacing the wired $29 EarPods with Lightning connector that come in the box with existing iPhone models.

Prasoon Singh You know what would be cool? Have the Apple logo as the fingerprint scanner/home button. It’s really not that complicated. Abhijeet Gupta Can you please stop quoting Benjamin and his fake leaks everywhere. He’s an A grade fake, who comes up with renderings every time some news pops up. Frederic L Would be a shame. MMA Rules Put it on the power button and that’s it, it’s better than the back from usability standpoint, when is laid flat on a table and when it’s on a car mount! askep3 Yes but the new iPhones have raise to wake, almost exclusively use the power button only to turn of and lock the device Urname Do any of them explain how they think the AirPods will ship with the iPhone 8? It seems rather ridiculous economically – switching from a $29 headphone to one that costs $159. ravinigga I dont believe this anymore. The dummy show fingerprint on display or power button but back? Nah nova12 I guess I could get used to it, but I still hate that the power button was moved from the top to the side, so maybe not. Andrieux Querido Worst Change ever the power button to the side.
