Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman JPMorgan Chase’s Investment in Detroit to Reach $150 Million Pace of Detroit’s progress allowed firm to accelerate initial $100 million investment and make valuable impact on the city’s recovery SOURCE: JPMorgan Chase & Co. DESCRIPTION: DETROIT, May 10, 2017 /3BL Media/– JPMorgan Chase & Co. today announced that it will expand the firm’s commitment to Detroit’s economic recovery, expecting it to reach $150 million by 2019. The announcement comes as the firm exceeded its initial $100 million, five-year investment two years ahead of schedule. The firm has been able to accelerate its investment to support Detroit’s recovery due to strong collaboration between civic, business, and nonprofit leadership, as well as improving economic conditions in the city. „Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “This collaboration allowed us to speed up our investment and extend our commitment over the next two years. Going forward, I hope business, government and nonprofit leaders will see Detroit’s comeback as a shining example of how to put aside differences and work to find meaningful and innovative solutions to our most pressing economic problems.” “JPMorgan Chase has been a true partner in our work to restore economic growth and opportunity in Detroit,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. „The firm’s investments have enabled thousands of Detroiters to receive training, created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and revitalized neighborhoods. There is more work to do, and I hope our continued partnership will build a thriving economy for all Detroiters.” Since 2014, JPMorgan Chase has invested $107 million in loans and grants in Detroit’s economic recovery, including $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small business expansion, and $6.9 million in additional transformative investments. The firm’s extended commitment over the next two years will keep pace and build upon the city’s progress, continuing to make coordinated investments of about $30 million focused on creating livable, inclusive and sustainable neighborhoods, arming residents with the skills needed for high-quality, well-paying careers and providing small businesses with the capital they need to succeed. Approximately $13 million in additional resources will be reinvested from loans paid back into two community development investment funds that JPMorgan Chase helped create with Invest Detroit and Capital Impact Partners. “Our commitment to Detroit has truly been a firmwide effort that goes well beyond our financial investment,” said Peter Scher, Head of Corporate Responsibility, JPMorgan Chase. “We’ve utilized our firm’s data, experience and the expertise of over 100 colleagues from 10 countries who have put their skills to work helping the city tackle some of its biggest economic challenges. As Detroit recovers, I hope our work continues to make an impact and yields lessons that are instructive for others looking to invest in Detroit and create more economic opportunity in their communities.” JPMorgan Chase is combining its philanthropy and business expertise to address some of Detroit’s biggest economic challenges. The firm is using the same attributes that drive business success – innovation, ingenuity, data and the ability to efficiently marshal human and financial capital –to help solve the city’s pressing economic challenges. More than half of JPMorgan Chase’s investment supports a market-based approach to creating sustainable loan programs for residential and commercial development, small business access to capital and home rehabilitation. Other elements of the investment continue to strengthen underlying organizations and create system-wide changes such as an improved citywide workforce development strategy. Investment Highlights Community Development—$50 Million Investments have led to financing being provided for 21 projects, with an additional $147 million leveraged from other investors. To date, $274 million in projects are completed or underway with the help of JPMorgan Chase’s financing, creating or preserving more than 800 jobs, over 800 housing units and 176,000 square feet of commercial space. Details include: Launching the Detroit Neighborhoods Fund and Chase Invest Detroit Fund through two Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)—Capital Impact Partners and Invest Detroit. These funds have helped finance rehabilitation and new construction of mixed-use real estate development, affordable multi-family housing and high-quality residential, commercial and retail developments, as well as provide flexible capital for small and medium-sized businesses in Detroit’s neighborhoods, Midtown and downtown. Projects include: Global Titanium Inc., Granada Apartments, Hope of Detroit Academy Charter School, Rainer Court Apartments, Sakthi Automotive facility, Shoppes at Woodward, The Plaza, The Scott at Brush Park, The Whitney, a West Village project, and Willy’s Overland Lofts.      Small Business Development—$9.5 Million Investments are helping more than 1,800 small businesses receive technical assistance, $7.2 million in loan and grant capital to 100 small businesses and 700 jobs created or maintained. Details include: Establishing the $6.5 million Entrepreneurs of Color Fund to provide Detroit minority-owned small businesses with access to financing and technical assistance. Expanding the Detroit Kitchen Connect program to provide food entrepreneurs with shared-use kitchens in neighborhoods. Investing $1.7 million in Eastern Market’s Shed 5 to help create a new space with a commercial-grade kitchen for food entrepreneurs. Providing support for business accelerator and incubator TechTown Detroit to create jobs and build storefronts. Partnering with Macomb Community College to launch a $2.7 million Innovation Fund to provide financing to start-up and next-stage companies. Sponsoring Detroit Startup Week to connect thousands of entrepreneurs with programming, education and networking resources. These small business investments are informed by data collected and analyzed by the JPMorgan Chase’s Institute, having shown that consumers are spending more in Detroit’s small businesses than in other U.S. cities. Workforce Readiness—$15 Million Investments are helping to develop a data-driven city workforce investment strategy and allowing nearly 15,000 Detroit adults and young people to participate in job skills training programs and receive career and technical education aligned with high-demand industries. Details include: Initiating research to empower the Mayor’s Workforce Investment Board to better align workforce investments and programs to prepare more Detroiters for good jobs. Partnering to develop the first ever Detroit Workforce System Leadership Development Academy to allow 22 Detroit workforce leaders to develop practical solutions for Detroit’s workforce challenges. Supporting Focus: HOPE, Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation, Goodwill’s Flip the Script and Center for Working Families programs, Ecowork’s Reclaim Detroit and Greening of Detroit to help train adults and young people for jobs in a variety of industries, including healthcare, informational technology and agriculture. Neighborhood Revitalization—$25.8 Million Investments have led to 700 mixed-income housing units created or preserved, financing and counseling to homeowners and 380,000 property parcels surveyed. Details include: Supporting Motor City Mapping and People’s Property Dashboard to digitize the city’s property information and return blighted properties to productive use. Supporting community lender Liberty Bank to extend affordable rehabilitation loans to qualified buyers and existing homeowners. Enabling Southwest Economic Solutions and U-SNAP-BAC to offer financial coaching and homeownership counseling. Partnering to establish the Strategic Neighborhood Fund to provide capital to underserved neighborhoods with a $5 million commitment. Seeding Develop Detroit, the first citywide nonprofit focused on providing housing to low- and moderate-income Detroiters through a $4 million, four-year commitment. Economic Growth—$6.9 Million Investments have boosted Detroit’s transportation capabilities and helped build the capacity of Detroit nonprofits. Investments include: Providing $1.5 million, in addition to over $13.5 million in New Market Tax Credit allocations, to facilitate the construction of the M-1 streetcar connecting Midtown and Downtown. Mitigating the temporary impact of the M-1 construction on local businesses and helping them remain healthy and vibrant during the construction period. Launching the Detroit Service Corps which, since 2014, has sent 68 JPMorgan Chase employees from 10 countries to work with 16 Detroit nonprofits for three intensive weeks, helping them analyze organizational challenges, solve problems and improve their overall chance for success. Lessons Learned JPMorgan Chase’s investment has enabled the firm to test solutions, adapt programs and find models that can be applied to other cities. Specifically: Detroit’s Motor City Mapping project has provided significant insights into how blight mapping can be applied in other cities to bring community partners together to fight blight. JPMorgan Chase has already shared the mapping technology in three Ohio cities: Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Detroit’s Entrepreneurs of Color Fund serves as a proof point for investing in minority entrepreneurs and it has informed similar programs in Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. What’s Next JPMorgan Chase’s investment will reach $150 million by 2019. Future investments will focus on further revitalizing Detroit’s neighborhoods, strengthening the city’s workforce system and helping minority-owned small businesses grow. Additional resources paid back to Invest Detroit and Capital Impact Partners’ community development loan programs, which were started with financing from JPMorgan Chase, will be reinvested.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 10, 2017 1:36pm   Comments Share: Related PCLN 20 Biggest Mid-Day Losers For Wednesday Priceline On The Decline After Q1 Report Market Down, But These 2 IBD 50 Stocks Are Up More Than 10% (Investor's Business Daily) Following the release of first-quarter results by Priceline Group Inc (NASDAQ: PCLN), JPMorgan stated its four key takeaways from the results. Analysts Doug Anmuth, Dae Lee, Cory Carpenter, Lina Rudashevski and Neeraj Kookada termed Priceline's first-quarter results as solid, with room nights and FXN gross booking both growing 27 percent year-over-year, including tougher Leap Day comps. The analysts, however, believe the second-quarter guidance at the high end, implying a further deceleration to 21 percent room night and 20 percent FXN gross bookings growth, is light. The analysts think the guidance reflects Priceline's typical conservatism. Continue To Expect Deleverage In Performance Marketing Spend JPMorgan continues to expect deleverage in performance marketing spend. However, the firm thinks Priceline is benefiting from better conversion, scale, and new marketing channels, as advertising efficiency continued to exceed management forecast. Management reiterated its expectation for first half margin pressure from performance marketing to be less than what it saw in the second half of 2016, the firm noted. Growth in Vacation Rental Properties While noting that instantly bookable vacation rental properties grew 51 percent year-over-year, analysts said Priceline continues to effectively compete with other vacation services through scaled, instantly bookable properties. Long-Time Executive Finnegan Retiring JPMorgan noted that Dan Finnegan, who is into his 14th year at the company, is retiring, although he will remain as CFO until a smooth transition is complete. As a pointer towards how long it would take for a new CFO to be identified, the firm said Priceline's recently completed CEO search lasted about eight months. Analyst Actions JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on shares of Priceline and said the company remains its favorite idea in the online travel space. The firm raised its year-end 2017 price target to $2,125 from $1,940, based on 25 times its 2018 GAAP earnings per share estimate of $84.48. At the time of writing, shares of Priceline were down 4.84 percent at $1,818.61.

In fact, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) is up 12.3% so far this year, and a stunning 60% over the past year. One group of stocks that also has benefited from the huge chip growth is the semiconductor capital equipment companies, which make the gear that makes the chips. In a new research report, JPMorgan remains Overweight the semi-cap equipment group and is reasonably bullish on the landscape for the top companies to Buy going forward. The firm noted this in the report: While we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variance in capital spending owing to a more concentrated semiconductor manufacturing customer base, when observing spending patterns over years, data suggests since coming out of the 2008/2009 downturn, capital spending has been more stable than any other time over the past 30 years. Four top semiconductor capital equipment companies are rated Overweight at JPMorgan. Applied Materials Some on Wall Street feel this semiconductor capital equipment leader has the broadest range of exposure to 3D NAND and foundry display. Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) is the global leader in precision materials engineering solutions for the semiconductor, flat panel display and solar photovoltaic industries. Applied Material’s technologies help make innovations like smartphones, flat screen TVs and solar panels more affordable and accessible to consumers and businesses around the world. The analysts are very positive on the stock and see Applied Materials benefiting not only the semiconductor side of the business, but also from larger, higher resolution and flexible screens on the display side of the business. The stock may still be one of the best technology values available for investors today. Some Wall Street analysts see continued FinFET capacity expansion (10nm/14nm/16nm) and transition to 3D NAND, with DRAM spending remaining strong this year. Semiconductor and Display markets are strong. Many feel there are five top reasons to own the shares: semiconductor capital equipment strength, OLED, investments from China, valuation, and $4 in earnings per share in two years. Applied Materials investors receive a 0.95% dividend. The JPMorgan price target for the stock is $42. The Wall Street consensus target is $41.16. Shares closed Tuesday at $42.04. Lam Research This remains one of the top chip equipment picks across Wall Street. Lam Research Corp. (NASDAQ: LRCX) designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The company offers plasma etch products that remove materials from the wafer to create the features and patterns of a device. Many Wall Street analysts have highlighted the company and its peers as having a significant equipment opportunity from the NAND evolution as well. Lam Research also appears well positioned to gain share in the wafer fab equipment market, driven by a strong focus on technology inflection spending over the next few years. Despite so-so foundry and logic spending over the past year, many on Wall Street think that Lam will also continue to benefit from technology transitions such as FinFET, 3D NAND, multi patterning and advanced packaging in 2016 and beyond. Many analysts believe it is the “cleanest” semi-cap story benefiting from cyclical tailwind, SAM expansion and share gains. Lam Research reported solid results and an impressive shipment outlook. The posted third-quarter fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings blew past the consensus estimate. Earnings were up 16% sequentially and 130.9% year over year. Shareholders receive a 1.2% dividend. JPMorgan has a $155 price target, which compares with a consensus price objective of $154.55. The shares closed Tuesday at $150.54.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Extraordinary Medical Expenses Widen Gender Wealth Gap, JPMorgan Chase Institute Data Shows WASHINGTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Today the JPMorgan Chase Institute released new research comparing the financial activities of men and women to shed new light on the financial challenges of women faced with extraordinary medical payments. The Institute found a gender gap in how women fared financially even before they tackled an extraordinary payment — women had roughly 20 percent lower levels of income, spending, and liquid assets, as well as slightly higher credit card debt burdens than men. When confronted with an extraordinary medical expense, the financial gap between men and women grew even wider. “These findings demonstrate the importance of designing and providing more solutions that improve women’s ability to weather and rebound from financial shocks,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO, JPMorgan Chase Institute. “They also point to a critical need to understand the impact that medical expenses have on women. Should out-of-pocket healthcare costs increase for women, they may have to shoulder more of the economic burden of receiving care than men do.” The Institute assembled a de-identified sample of more than 210,000 core Chase checking account customers between 2013 and 2015, for whom the Institute could infer the gender of the primary account holder and categorize at least 80 percent of expenses. Following include key findings from the new release. Finding One: While most primary account holders were men, low-income primary account holders were more likely to be women. Sixty-two percent of account holders in the lowest income quintile were women, compared to just 30 percent of account holders in the highest income quintile. Finding Two: There was a gender gap in financial outcomes – women exhibited roughly 20 percent lower levels of income, spending, and liquid assets, and slightly higher credit card debt burden than men. Women’s accounts exhibited 23 percent lower take-home incomes, 21 percent lower spending, and 20 percent lower liquid assets than men’s accounts. Although women had on average 5 percent less revolving credit card debt in absolute terms, women were more likely than men to have a positive revolving credit balance than men: 76 percent of women had a revolving credit card balance compared to 70 percent of men. Women had the equivalent of 0.9 months of income in revolving credit card debt compared to 0.7 months for men, implying a higher monthly debt burden for women in relation to their income. Finding Three: Extraordinary medical payments represented a higher fraction of monthly take-home income for women than for men. Women were in a weaker financial position than men to withstand an extraordinary medical payment. The magnitude of extraordinary medical payments was larger for women, representing 52 percent of a month’s take-home pay for women compared to 48 percent for men. Women’s incomes and liquid assets were more than 20 percent lower prior to the extraordinary medical payment compared to men’s. Finding Four: Immediately before making an extraordinary medical payment, women exhibited a larger increase in liquid assets relative to men, suggesting that they were more likely than men to delay a medical payment until they were able to pay. Women garnered a 7 percent ($1,076) increase in liquid assets compared to a 5 percent ($858) increase in liquid assets for men immediately prior to making the medical payment. The difference in these magnitudes is surprising, especially in light of the fact that the amount of medical payment was 18 percent lower for women. Finding Five: A year after the extraordinary medical payment, the gender gap in financial outcomes had widened, leaving women with 9 percent more revolving credit card debt than men. Among those who made the extraordinary medical payments, more women (35 percent) increased their revolving credit card balance than men (29 percent). Before the large medical payment, women had the equivalent of 0.8 months of income in credit card debt compared to 0.6 for men. After the medical payment, women had 0.9 months’ worth of income in credit card debt compared to still 0.6 for men.

DETROIT - JPMorgan Chase is expanding its financial commitment to Detroit's economic recovery. The bank will announce Wednesday at Focus: HOPE's conference Center in Detroit that an initial five-year investment of $100 million is expected to reach $150 million. Since 2014, JPMorgan Chase has invested -- through loans and grants -- $50 million in community development financing, nearly $30 million to revitalize Detroit neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, more than $9 million for small business expansion and close to $7 million in other efforts. The bank says it reached the initial investment two years ahead of schedule due to strong collaboration between civic, business and nonprofit leadership. Improving economic conditions in the city also helped. Mayor Mike Duggan, JPMorgan Chase Head of Corporate Responsibility Peter Scher will be among Wednesday's speakers.

McIntyre May 10, 2017 6:25 am EDT Print Email Tweet JPMorgan had planned to invest $100 million in the troubled city of Detroit. It has spent that entire investment, meant to aid a turnaround of the city. The big bank says it will now increase its commitment to $150 million. JPMorgan management announced: We have been doing business in Detroit for more than 80 years and believe in its future. Three years ago, JPMorgan Chase made a $100 million, five-year investment in its economic recovery. The collaboration and the pace of progress throughout the city have allowed us to accelerate our initial investment and deploy resources more quickly than expected. We have exceeded our $100 million investment in just three years. And now we expect to invest $150 million in Detroit by 2019. We know there is much work to be done, but we’re as committed as ever to Detroit’s success. The money has been distributed among several initiatives. One portion has gone toward a $7 million infusion in Small Business Forward, which provides rent-free space and training to small businesses. Another $50 million has gone to Capital Impact Partners and Invest Detroit, which have been established to rebuild some of Detroit’s neighborhoods. One of the major efforts includes the creation of maps of 380,000 properties that might be “rehabilitated or removed.” Some of the investment has been made in side-by-side money from other financial firms and businesses. JPMorgan also has helped some organizations in Detroit to provide data on work forces to more efficiently use local labor. A portion of this effort has also gone to aid people to improve skills as they prepare to find new jobs. The leader of the bank’s efforts, Peter Scher, summarized JPMorgan’s goals for Detroit: We have too often seen well-intentioned money — both public and private — fail to result in long-term impact. So a critical and deliberate part of our strategy is strengthening the underlying organizations and systems that are needed to empower communities to deliver and sustain change. The open question about the JPMorgan effort, along with any other set of financial and consulting operations meant to revive the Motor City, is whether they are too little, too late. The city had a population of over 1.8 million in 1950, when American car companies still completely dominated the domestic industry. The figure has steadily fallen to just 677,116, according to a 2015 Census estimate. A third of the families in the city have income that puts them below the poverty line. Median household income is just over $26,000, less than half the national average. One of the by-products of an impoverished population, added to the flight of employers from the city, is that its tax base has been decimated. This makes it harder for Detroit’s government to provide city services, which further damages its turnaround effort. Much of Detroit’s 142 square miles contains blighted neighborhoods, some of which are barely inhibited. Others have houses that need to be torn down. The logistics of destruction or repair of these neighborhoods, paired with the cost, makes the effort virtually impossible. Detroit’s challenges may be too great for a $150 million investment to cure many of them. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman JPMorgan Chase’s Investment in Detroit to Reach $150 Million DETROIT–(BUSINESS WIRE)–JPMorgan Chase & Co. today announced that it will expand the firm’s commitment to Detroit’s economic recovery, expecting it to reach $150 million by 2019. The announcement comes as the firm exceeded its initial $100 million, five-year investment two years ahead of schedule. The firm has been able to accelerate its investment to support Detroit’s recovery due to strong collaboration between civic, business, and nonprofit leadership, as well as improving economic conditions in the city. „Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “This collaboration allowed us to speed up our investment and extend our commitment over the next two years. Going forward, I hope business, government and nonprofit leaders will see Detroit’s comeback as a shining example of how to put aside differences and work to find meaningful and innovative solutions to our most pressing economic problems.” “JPMorgan Chase has been a true partner in our work to restore economic growth and opportunity in Detroit,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. „The firm’s investments have enabled thousands of Detroiters to receive training, created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and revitalized neighborhoods. There is more work to do, and I hope our continued partnership will build a thriving economy for all Detroiters.” Since 2014, JPMorgan Chase has invested $107 million in loans and grants in Detroit’s economic recovery, including $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small business expansion, and $6.9 million in additional transformative investments. The firm’s extended commitment over the next two years will keep pace and build upon the city’s progress, continuing to make coordinated investments of about $30 million focused on creating livable, inclusive and sustainable neighborhoods, arming residents with the skills needed for high-quality, well-paying careers and providing small businesses with the capital they need to succeed. Approximately $13 million in additional resources will be reinvested from loans paid back into two community development investment funds that JPMorgan Chase helped create with Invest Detroit and Capital Impact Partners. “Our commitment to Detroit has truly been a firmwide effort that goes well beyond our financial investment,” said Peter Scher, Head of Corporate Responsibility, JPMorgan Chase. “We’ve utilized our firm’s data, experience and the expertise of over 100 colleagues from 10 countries who have put their skills to work helping the city tackle some of its biggest economic challenges. As Detroit recovers, I hope our work continues to make an impact and yields lessons that are instructive for others looking to invest in Detroit and create more economic opportunity in their communities.” JPMorgan Chase is combining its philanthropy and business expertise to address some of Detroit’s biggest economic challenges. The firm is using the same attributes that drive business success – innovation, ingenuity, data and the ability to efficiently marshal human and financial capital –to help solve the city’s pressing economic challenges. More than half of JPMorgan Chase’s investment supports a market-based approach to creating sustainable loan programs for residential and commercial development, small business access to capital and home rehabilitation. Other elements of the investment continue to strengthen underlying organizations and create system-wide changes such as an improved citywide workforce development strategy. Investment Highlights Community Development—$50 Million Investments have led to financing being provided for 21 projects, with an additional $147 million leveraged from other investors. To date, $274 million in projects are completed or underway with the help of JPMorgan Chase’s financing, creating or preserving more than 800 jobs, over 800 housing units and 176,000 square feet of commercial space. Details include: Launching the Detroit Neighborhoods Fund and Chase Invest Detroit Fund through two Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)—Capital Impact Partners and Invest Detroit. These funds have helped finance rehabilitation and new construction of mixed-use real estate development, affordable multi-family housing and high-quality residential, commercial and retail developments, as well as provide flexible capital for small and medium-sized businesses in Detroit’s neighborhoods, Midtown and downtown. Projects include: Global Titanium Inc., Granada Apartments, Hope of Detroit Academy Charter School, Rainer Court Apartments, Sakthi Automotive facility, Shoppes at Woodward, The Plaza, The Scott at Brush Park, The Whitney, a West Village project, and Willy’s Overland Lofts. Small Business Development—$9.5 Million Investments are helping more than 1,800 small businesses receive technical assistance, $7.2 million in loan and grant capital to 100 small businesses and 700 jobs created or maintained. Details include: Establishing the $6.5 million Entrepreneurs of Color Fund to provide Detroit minority-owned small businesses with access to financing and technical assistance. Expanding the Detroit Kitchen Connect program to provide food entrepreneurs with shared-use kitchens in neighborhoods. Investing $1.7 million in Eastern Market’s Shed 5 to help create a new space with a commercial-grade kitchen for food entrepreneurs. Providing support for business accelerator and incubator TechTown Detroit to create jobs and build storefronts. Partnering with Macomb Community College to launch a $2.7 million Innovation Fund to provide financing to start-up and next-stage companies. Sponsoring Detroit Startup Week to connect thousands of entrepreneurs with programming, education and networking resources. These small business investments are informed by data collected and analyzed by the JPMorgan Chase’s Institute, having shown that consumers are spending more in Detroit’s small businesses than in other U.S. cities. Workforce Readiness—$15 Million Investments are helping to develop a data-driven city workforce investment strategy and allowing nearly 15,000 Detroit adults and young people to participate in job skills training programs and receive career and technical education aligned with high-demand industries. Details include: Initiating research to empower the Mayor’s Workforce Investment Board to better align workforce investments and programs to prepare more Detroiters for good jobs. Partnering to develop the first ever Detroit Workforce System Leadership Development Academy to allow 22 Detroit workforce leaders to develop practical solutions for Detroit’s workforce challenges. Supporting Focus: HOPE, Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation, Goodwill’s Flip the Script and Center for Working Families programs, Ecowork’s Reclaim Detroit and Greening of Detroit to help train adults and young people for jobs in a variety of industries, including healthcare, informational technology and agriculture. Neighborhood Revitalization—$25.8 Million Investments have led to 700 mixed-income housing units created or preserved, financing and counseling to homeowners and 380,000 property parcels surveyed. Details include: Supporting Motor City Mapping and People’s Property Dashboard to digitize the city’s property information and return blighted properties to productive use. Supporting community lender Liberty Bank to extend affordable rehabilitation loans to qualified buyers and existing homeowners. Enabling Southwest Economic Solutions and U-SNAP-BAC to offer financial coaching and homeownership counseling. Partnering to establish the Strategic Neighborhood Fund to provide capital to underserved neighborhoods with a $5 million commitment. Seeding Develop Detroit, the first citywide nonprofit focused on providing housing to low- and moderate-income Detroiters through a $4 million, four-year commitment. Economic Growth—$6.9 Million Investments have boosted Detroit’s transportation capabilities and helped build the capacity of Detroit nonprofits. Investments include: Providing $1.5 million, in addition to over $13.5 million in New Market Tax Credit allocations, to facilitate the construction of the M-1 streetcar connecting Midtown and Downtown. Mitigating the temporary impact of the M-1 construction on local businesses and helping them remain healthy and vibrant during the construction period. Launching the Detroit Service Corps which, since 2014, has sent 68 JPMorgan Chase employees from 10 countries to work with 16 Detroit nonprofits for three intensive weeks, helping them analyze organizational challenges, solve problems and improve their overall chance for success. Lessons Learned JPMorgan Chase’s investment has enabled the firm to test solutions, adapt programs and find models that can be applied to other cities. Specifically: Detroit’s Motor City Mapping project has provided significant insights into how blight mapping can be applied in other cities to bring community partners together to fight blight. JPMorgan Chase has already shared the mapping technology in three Ohio cities: Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. Detroit’s Entrepreneurs of Color Fund serves as a proof point for investing in minority entrepreneurs and it has informed similar programs in Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. What’s Next JPMorgan Chase’s investment will reach $150 million by 2019. Future investments will focus on further revitalizing Detroit’s neighborhoods, strengthening the city’s workforce system and helping minority-owned small businesses grow. Additional resources paid back to Invest Detroit and Capital Impact Partners’ community development loan programs, which were started with financing from JPMorgan Chase, will be reinvested.

Today, the bank will announce that it is expanding that commitment to $150 million by 2019. Chase’s dollars have helped build real estate projects, power small businesses off the ground, train unemployed workers for new jobs, and – perhaps most important – demonstrate a model of urban revitalization that could transfer to cities everywhere. That model requires more than cash from a major bank like Chase. The bank partnered with a cadre of local partners that includes political leaders, local investment funds and philanthropic foundations. Peter Scher, Chase’s head of Corporate Responsibility, said a coordinated effort by all those local partners proved key.

In Detroit “the city came together and said we’ve got to focus on our priorities. Certainly the model we think is something that can be replicated in other places.” Chase initially said its $100-million investment would be spread over five years. In practice, it deployed fully $107 million in just three years, and results were better than expected. Chase so far has suffered no defaults on loans it made through the effort, and Scher said $7 million of the money loaned out has been repaid quicker than expected, allowing Chase to re-deploy those funds elsewhere in the city. Those investments included $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small-business expansion, and $6.9 million in other investments. Chase deployed its cash mostly through a series of Detroit-based funds, including Invest Detroit, the Detroit Development Fund, and the local office of Capital Impact Partners. The relationships worked because each brought needed strengths. Chase had the deep pockets, expertise and data; the local funds had the eyes on the street that could identify worthwhile entrepreneurs and projects. Just one example: The Entrepreneurs of Color Fund created about 18 months ago. As of the end of 2016, the fund had awarded nearly 30 minority-owned small businesses some $2.75 million in loans through the Detroit Development Fund. Chase put $3.5 million into the Entrepreneurs of Color fund, joined by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation that put in a similar amount.

Trevino, Detroit Free Press) “This loan has helped us expand to a second location to better serve our customers,” said Kirsten Ussery, owner of the Detroit Vegan Soul restaurant in Detroit's West Village district. “We're grateful to the Detroit Development Fund for helping us to grow our business.” The second Detroit Vegan Soul will open on Grand River in northwest Detroit this summer. Many important projects in the city either wouldn’t have happened without Chase’s involvement or would have been delayed. Among those: The Auburn, a mixed-use retail and residential project on Cass Avenue in Midtown, cost $11.3 million to build. Chase put in $2 million of that, purchasing New Market Tax Credits issued to help fund the project. It was an important piece to close the gap in what developers were able to finance. Then, too, the Rainer Court project at 711 Alexandrine, a renovation of a dilapidated apartment building, cost a little over $7 million, of which Chase funneled $5.3 million through Invest Detroit and Capital Impact Partners. Not far away, Chase contributed $8 million to the $65-million development of the Scott, an upscale apartment project on Woodward in Midtown. Some of the developers in those projects, like PK Housing & Management of Okemos that developed the Rainer Court building, have now moved on to other projects in the Midtown neighborhood. “Success begets success. You’ve got more investors coming to the market because of (Chase's) participation,” said Dave Blaszkiewicz, CEO of the Invest Detroit fund. In the end, it was the combination of a major outside bank like Chase and the cadre of local partners that made these efforts possible. “I think there is a growing recognition this is the only way you can move the needle,” Scher said. Mayor Mike Duggan called Chase “a true partner” in Detroit’s revitalization efforts. And Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of the bank, said in a prepared statement: "Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity.” Duggan and Dimon will discuss Chase's expanded commitment at a media event today.

Executives with JPMorgan, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and nearly two dozen local partner organizations gathered Wednesday at Focus: HOPE in Detroit where they held a roundtable discussion on the last three years of work and heard by phone from Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Dimon has said the firm exceeded its initial 2014 investment in Detroit two years ahead of schedule and credited the progress to strong collaboration between civic, business, and nonprofit leadership, as well as improving economic conditions in the city. On Wednesday, Dimon told Duggan the mayor was the company’s inspiration to invest. “We couldn’t have done this without you. It’s leadership, leadership, leadership. The man is devoted to fixing the city,” Dimon said. Since 2014, JPMorgan Chase has invested more than $107 million in loans and grants to further Detroit’s economic recovery, including $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small business expansion and $6.9 million in additional investments. More than half of JPMorgan’s investment supports a market-based approach to create loan programs for residential and commercial development, small business capital and home rehabilitation. Nearly all of the partners in the program said JPMorgan’s investment the last three years has allowed them to build capacity in their programs. Ray Waters, president of the Detroit Development Fund and a partner in the program, said on Wednesday that his company has given out 44 loans for $3.5 million dollars. Ned Staebler, CEO of Techtown Detroit, said there is tremendous interest in business in the neighborhoods and he held retail boot camps to get people toward their goals. Nicole Sherard-Freeman with Detroit Employment Solutions Corp. said one key difference in the last three years is that employers are seeing workforce training as an investment. “The only thing to make it work long term is for folks to see it an investment and not charity,” Sherard-Freeman said. Future investments will focus on further revitalizing Detroit’s neighborhoods, strengthening the city’s workforce system and helping minority-owned small businesses grow, Dimon said in a statement. The firm’s investment in Detroit has allowed it to test solutions, adapt programs and find models that can be applied to other cities, Peter Scher, head of corporate responsibility for JPMorgan said on Wednesday. Specifically, Detroit’s Motor City Mapping project has provided the company with insight into how blight mapping can be applied in other cities to bring community partners together to fight blight. JPMorgan has already shared the mapping technology in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. “I get asked a lot: why did it work in Detroit?” Scher said on Wednesday at the roundtable. “If you get the right people around the table, you have the data....and focus on solutions. It’s not brain surgery...It’s the type of leadership to make the tough decisions.” The firm’s extended commitment will include continuing to make investments of about $30 million focused on creating livable, inclusive and sustainable neighborhoods; preparing residents with the skills needed for high-paying careers and providing small businesses with capital, officials said. About $13 million will be reinvested from loans paid back into two community development investment funds that JPMorgan Chase helped create with Invest Detroit and Capital Impact Partners. “We can’t stop and put ourselves on the back. We are in it for the long haul,” Scher said.

What is likely to capture the market's imagination is whether more than one person among those voting calls for a rate increase, they say. The BOE is scheduled to announce its policy decision at 12pm in London on Thursday, followed by a press conference by Carney 30 minutes later. The central bank will leave its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.25 per cent, according to all 55 economists in a Bloomberg survey. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Mark Carney is bound to talk down expectations for a rate increase anytime soon, analysts say ahead of this week's monetary-policy review. Photo: Simon Dawson The BOE will also release its Quarterly Inflation Report, where it will raise its 2017 inflation forecasts and lower its economists growth projections, according to analysts. Markets have wiped out the prospects of a rate increase at least until November 2018, MPC-dated Sonia show. This is in contrast to March when there was a near-50 per cent chance of a 25 basis point rate increase by mid-2018. Given the current level of market pricing, strategists suggest risk-reward favours positioning for an increase in front-end rates, and a steeper term structure. JPMorgan recommends owning options targeting a rise in 2019 money-market rates and hold position targeting steepening between one- and two-year Sonia forward rates. Deutsche Bank recommends short February 2018 MPC-dated Sonia. With the UK snap elections on June 8, the BOE will likely refrain from any market surprises, analysts say. Below is a compilation of investors' and analysts' expectations for the meeting, and the outlook for gilts and the pound: JPMorgan Asset Management Advertisement "We expect the BOE to look past the rise in inflation" and be more concerned with how slowing growth will affect prices in the longer term, says David Tan, head of rates at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees $US1.8 trillion. Looking for slight outperformance in gilts "because we do not expect BOE to raise rates. We are slightly positive on gilts, but there's not a lot on that as bond yields have been range-bound globally". "The Article 50 process has barely begun and it will have an impact on confidence, investors intention. So the BOE might talk tough but might act quite dovishly and stay put." Toronto-Dominion Bank It will be hard for the pound to go much higher than $US1.30, according to TD Bank analysts led by head of global strategy, Richard Kelly. "2017 growth will be revised down and inflation up, but 2018-19 will remain broadly unchanged as a lower yield curve/ oil prices and a stronger currency help offset recent data surprises," they wrote in a client note. "Markets may respond to this hawkishly initially, but governor Carney will likely steer things back to neutral during the presser." "A lone Forbes dissent could also mitigate any hawkish undertones which leaves GBP vulnerable to a pullback given the shift in market positioning and recent repricing of risk," TD analysts said, adding that they would like to "fade GBP-USD on rallies into $US1.30". "With blackout rules in place during the election campaign, the BOE is unlikely to rock the policy boat too much." Citigroup "The gilt market feels a little lost for direction," write analysts at Citi, including Jamie Searle. The Inflation Report "is the kind of event which might kick it into life". The risk-reward certainly looks "asymmetric as it approaches", they say, with it being "hard to imagine the MPC being more dovish than market pricing. And the MPC may want to add some two-way risk into the front end and remind the market that there are scenarios in which hikes become probable". This week "may not be the right time to do this. The proximity of the general election is one reason not to rock the boat". Also, recent strength of sterling and softer data on the consumer side "are further reasons why this may not be the right time to sound overly hawkish. That leaves gilts stuck in the range, for now". Deutsche Bank UK data are yet to "show signs of a deterioration beyond the slowdown already projected by the BOE" and inflation is set to rise, analysts including Francis Yared write in a client note. "With the BOE therefore unlikely to shift its underlying judgment of the outlook at the May meeting, front-end pricing looks rich and we add a paid 1Y1Y Sonia vs. USD." "We maintain the UKT 5s10s steepener given the slope remains excessively flat to models. And the current richness of the UK points to the market pricing an excessive probability of further QE from the BOE." Morgan Stanley Suggests 2s10s gilt curve flatteners and likes them more than the outright long because "there is significantly less priced in for MPC rate hikes than there was in late January, i.e., around 10bp over the next year and 20bp by March 19", analysts including Anton Heese write in a note. Even though the bank's economists don't expect the BOE to raise rates any time soon "there is potential for more speculation on the issue, especially if more than one MPC member decides to vote in favor of a rate hike" at this week's meeting. A short position at the front end of the curve "provides us with some protection against an MPC-induced sell-off in UK yields", they say.

As South African political risks mount and commodity prices retreat, banks from JPMorgan Chase to Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are telling clients to short the rand against other major emerging-market currencies, including Turkey’s lira and Mexico’s peso. They’re predicting the selloff that began in late March when President Jacob Zuma sacked his Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is about to repeat itself. Only this time the trigger may come if Zuma survives a possible parliamentary vote of no confidence and his former wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, is named head of the ruling African National Congress in December. “It’ll be difficult for the rand to regain the bullish momentum that dominated throughout the second half of 2016 and earlier this year,” said Piotr Matys, a currency strategist at Rabobank in London who sees the currency weakening beyond R14 per dollar in the next few months. “The rally is more than likely over.” The currency is down from the beginning of the week, trading at R13.52 to the dollar at 07:40. Until the end of March, the rand was the biggest beneficiary of an emerging-market rally partly fuelled by speculation that the US Federal Reserve would enact a slower pace of interest-rate increases. The currency at one point gained as much as 12% in 2017, the most in the world, to trade at its strongest level since 2015. And until the week before Gordhan was fired on March 30, the dollar-rand carry trade handed investors the highest returns among developing nations this year. Gordhan’s dismissal, though, was a reminder of the risks brewing in Africa’s most industrialised nation. It sparked a slide in the rand that trimmed its advance this year to 1.9%. And as the currency retreated, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings cut South Africa’s debt to junk. Moody’s Investors Service put the nation on review for downgrade last month. Adding to the negative backdrop is the slide in prices for metals and other commodities that account for more than one-third of South Africa’s export revenue. An index of raw materials dropped this week to the lowest level in a year. Not attractive The rand is “uncompelling at current levels given risks of further political noise in the months ahead and a pending Moody’s rating review, and headwinds from falling iron ore prices,” JPMorgan London-based analysts Saad Siddiqui and Michael Harrison said in a note May 5. “We have been shifting our portfolio by rotating out of long positions in commodity currencies, preferring commodity importers.” JPMorgan said clients should target a level of R3.9 versus the Turkish lira. BofA recommended last month buying the lira when it traded at R3.64 and targeting a 12% gain to R4.1. So far, the trade would have made investors about 3%. Not everyone is convinced the rand’s heading for losses. Pacific Investment Management says it’s “no longer so fragile” given South Africa’s reduced current account deficit, which it mostly funds through portfolio inflows. Rand versus peso Morgan Stanley prefers shorting the rand against the Mexican peso, which has risen since January as President Donald Trump’s administration tones down talk of scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canceling NAFTA would be a blow to the peso, because Mexico’s total trade with the US. is about double the value of its exports and imports with other countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley recommends targeting a move to R1.33 peso against the rand from R1.41. The New York-based lender is also bearish on South Africa’s benchmark local-currency government bonds due in December 2026 and expects the rand to head toward R15.4 per dollar by the end of 2017. It assumes Dlamini-Zuma will succeed Zuma as ANC leader this year, defeating Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, most investors’ preferred choice. That would mean a “continuation of current policy drift,” it said in a May 4 note. “Investors remain too optimistic about South Africa’s fundamentals and politics,” Min Dai, a Morgan Stanley fixed-income strategist, said in the note. “In the first three months of the year, investors had good reason to be bullish on South Africa. However, recent political uncertainty has led to a worsening macro outlook.” WHAT TO READ NEXT {{item.title}} Read more about:    rand  |  dollar  |  currencies NEXT ON FIN24X Rally in gold stocks boosts JSE 2017-05-10 18:37 Share this page Yahoo!

(Corrects JPMorgan expectation of user growth in paragraph 8) By Anya George Tharakan and David Ingram May 10 (Reuters) - Snap Inc shares plunged on Wednesday after the owner of Snapchat reported slowing user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a public company, missing some of Wall Street's estimates as it competes with copycat messaging apps. Its shares tumbled 23 percent in after-hours trading to wipe some $6 billion from Snap's market value, a humbling reversal for the company after its red-hot March initial public offering, which was the biggest for a U.S. tech company since Facebook Inc in 2012. The stock fell to $17.66, only just above its IPO price of $17. Some investors were hoping Snap would surprise them with big numbers in its first quarterly report, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. "The fact that they failed to live up to expectations, let alone exceed them, disappointed people," he said. The performance echoed slides in Facebook and Twitter after they posted debut scorecards following their IPOs. Twitter shares cratered 24 percent the next day, while Facebook's tumbled 11 percent, still the biggest-ever one-day losses for both. Snap said its daily active users (DAUs) rose 36.1 percent to 166 million in the first quarter from a year earlier, marking a slowdown from the 47.7 percent rise for the fourth quarter and 62.8 percent jump for the third quarter that the company reported in its IPO filing. The slowing rate of growth was in line with an estimate from JPMorgan, which accurately expected 166 million DAUs for the first quarter. Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc had pegged them even higher at 173 million. Snap's March IPO priced above the company's target range as investors put aside concerns about a lack of profits and voting rights to get a piece of the action. The IPO raised $3.4 billion and gave the company a market valuation of roughly $24 billion, and shares surged 44 percent in their first day of trading. Facebook, which made a $3 billion bid for Snapchat in 2013, has upped the ante by offering camera-related features similar to Snap on its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp. The company said in April that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel, who received a stock-based bonus worth nearly $600 million for taking the company public, shrugged off imitations when asked about Facebook by an analyst on a conference call to discuss earnings. "If you want to be a creative company, you've got to get comfortable with and enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your product if you make great stuff," he said. Making a comparison to the search industry, Spiegel added: "Just because Yahoo has a search box doesn't mean they're Google." Snapchat's growth was faster than Facebook, however, which said its overall daily user base grew 18 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, as well as Twitter, which reported growth of 14 percent in DAUs from a year earlier. REVENUE DISAPPOINTMENT Snap's revenue jumped nearly four-fold year-over-year to $149.6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of $158 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016, a seasonally stronger period for ad sales, when it was $166 million. Revenue was "a relatively disappointing number," Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. "To their credit," he added, "they did guide towards a number that would be lower, which it was." Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter, Snap said, up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the $1.05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. Snap's net loss widened to $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, in the first quarter, from $104.6 million, or 14 cents per share, due to stock-based compensation related to the IPO. Although the figure of $2 billion in total stock-based compensation was known ahead of time, investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time, said Eric Kim, managing partner at Goodwater Capital. "It is an eye-popping number for sure," he said. Snapchat launched in 2012 as a mobile app that allows users to send photos, known as snaps, that vanish within seconds. The company rebranded as Snap Inc last year, and moved into the hardware space with Spectacles, its colorful sunglasses that record short videos to post on Snapchat. Users created more than 3 billion snaps daily on average during the first quarter, up from more than 2.5 billion during the third quarter of 2016, the company said. Snap receives some revenue from branded or sponsored filters and lenses, but depends on advertising dollars for the bulk of its overall revenue. Digital marketing firm eMarketer in March had trimmed its 2017 U.S. advertising revenue forecast for Snap by $30 million to $770 million, citing higher-than-expected revenue sharing with the company's partners. The total U.S. digital advertising market is meanwhile expected to reach $83 billion, according to eMarketer, up nearly 16 percent from last year.

Developing economies are being bolstered by a remarkable calm in global markets. The Vix index, Wall St’s so-called ‘fear gauge’ has fallen to its lowest level since December 1993 PUBLISHED : Thursday, 11 May, 2017, 8:33am UPDATED : Thursday, 11 May, 2017, 8:32am Comments:   Nicholas Spiro Share PrintEmail Related topics Macroscope Investing Related Articles Global Economy With financial curbs in full swing, risks need be managed 10 May 2017 Global Economy US workforce seems on a roll but the wider economy labouring 9 May 2017 Global Economy Macron toasts win, but hefty fiscal pressures still weigh on Europe 8 May 2017 Jeffrey Gundlach, an influential bond investor, has proved prescient in his predictions of late. Exactly a year ago, the head of DoubleLine Capital told attendees at the annual Sohn Investment Conference in New York, the premier event for the hedge fund industry, that they should prepare for a Donald Trump presidency. Last month, Gundlach warned that the so-called “reflation trade” – a repositioning of investors’ portfolios based on expectations of faster growth and inflation – would continue to lose momentum as the US economy slows. Disappointing first-quarter gross domestic product data and a marked decline in inflation expectations suggest he may once again be proved right. Over the past year emerging-market equities have risen a whopping 24pc rise in US dollar terms, while, net inflows into emerging-market bond and equity funds this year have surged to nearly US$60b, exceeding the US$44b for the whole of 2016 Gundlach’s latest recommendation, presented on Monday at this year’s Sohn conference, is to buy a popular emerging-market exchange-traded fund – index-tracking funds that can be traded on exchanges just like a stock – called the iShares Emerging Markets ETF, which has already returned 15 per cent this year. Yet what is striking is that he is taking a bullish bet on emerging markets – Gundlach also advises investors to buy the debt of developing economies – while also anticipating a further fall in oil prices, usually a reason to steer clear from the asset class. Gundlach’s evident enthusiasm for emerging markets in the face of significant risks confronting developing nations – the uncertain fallout from China’s efforts to tame its credit boom, the strain that the clampdown is already exerting on commodity markets and, just as importantly, the threats posed by both US trade and monetary policy – is indicative of both the resilience of the asset class and the appeal of higher-yielding assets in what is likely to remain a low-interest-rate environment for a considerable period of time. Over the past year, which has seen Britain vote to leave the European Union and Trump elected US president, emerging-market equities have risen a whopping 24 per cent rise in US dollar terms. Meanwhile, net inflows into emerging-market bond and equity funds since the start of this year have surged to nearly US$60 billion, exceeding the US$44 billion for the whole of 2016, according to JPMorgan. Moreover, the average yield on JPMorgan’s benchmark index of local-currency emerging-market bonds currently stands at nearly 6.5 per cent, compared with a 10-year US Treasury yield of 2.4 per cent and equivalent borrowing costs in Japan and Germany that are barely in positive territory. Make no mistake, money is being driven to higher-yielding emerging markets. Sentiment towards developing economies is being bolstered by the remarkable calm in global markets. On Monday, the Vix index, Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge” that measures the anticipated short-term volatility of the S&P 500 Index, fell to its lowest level since December 1993, pushed down by the favourable outcome of France’s presidential election. With China trying to rein in its shadow banking sector, commodity markets are under strain and the Federal Reserve appears determined to continue tightening monetary policy, emerging-market investors would still be unwise to throw caution to the wind Even the recent sell-off in commodity markets – Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, has dropped 12.5 per cent over the past month to below US$50 a barrel – is having a muted impact on emerging-market asset prices. JPMorgan notes that emerging-market debt markets “have recently become a lot less sensitive to moves in oil”. This is partly due to the weakness of the dollar. Last time oil prices were falling sharply, in the final quarter of last year, the dollar index, a gauge of the greenback’s performance against a basket of its peers, was surging, fuelled by expectations of stronger growth and inflation in the US. Yet after reaching a 14-year high in early January, the index has since fallen 3.6 per cent, buoying emerging-market assets. Yet it is not just the technicals that are working in developing economies’ favour. Economic fundamentals are also improving, with the International Monetary Fund expecting growth in emerging markets to pick up from an average rate of 4.1 per cent last year to 4.5 per cent and 4.8 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Even recession-plagued Russia and Brazil are expected to post growth. With China trying to rein in its shadow banking sector, commodity markets are under strain and the Federal Reserve appears determined to continue tightening monetary policy, emerging-market investors would still be unwise to throw caution to the wind. Valuations, moreover, are becoming a major concern. Spreads on emerging-market corporate bonds are currently at their tightest level since the global financial crisis, particularly in the Asian high-yield, or non-investment-grade, segment of the market. With markets already priced for perfection, the scope for further gains is limited. Emerging-market asset prices may have already peaked.

Investors delivered a stern message of disappointment to Facebook and Twitter when they posted debut quarterly scorecards following their IPOs. Twitter shares cratered 24 percent the following day, while Facebook's tumbled 11 percent, drops that stand to this day as the biggest one-day losses for both. The options market is already positioned for a double-digit swing in Snap shares by the end of this week. One key to Snap, the owner of the wildly popular Snapchat messaging app, dodging a similar reception from the market rests on whether its user growth and engagement measures meet investors' expectations as Facebook aggressively copies its most successful features. The earnings report and subsequent conference call after the bell "will be make it or break it" for Snap, said Eric Kim, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital. The stock, which started trading in March in the largest tech IPO since Facebook's in 2012, jumped 44 percent on its debut, but has since fallen 5.5 percent from that day's closing price. FOCUS ON USER GROWTH Wall Street expects Snap to post a quarterly loss of 19 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts expect revenue of close to $158 million, roughly four times the $38.8 million figure from a year earlier, but down about 5 percent from $165.7 million for the fourth quarter of last year. But investors will focus on Snapchat's user numbers and how the service is holding up against encroachments by rivals. In recent months, Facebook has launched Facebook Stories, a near-identical clone of Snapchat's most popular feature, also called Stories. The feature lets users post a string of videos and photos that disappear after 24 hours and is also available on other Facebook services, including Instagram and WhatsApp. "Much of the call should be around Stories as it represents the bulk of Snap's future value given the importance of video advertising to the company's relatively nascent business model," Goodwater's Kim said. Facebook recently announced that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users (DAU), eclipsing Snapchat's year-end overall DAU count of around 161 million. JPMorgan expects Snap's first-quarter DAU to grow to 166 million, while Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc is targeting 173 million. Snap still may have an edge over Facebook with its active user base aged between 18 and 34, many of whom visit more than 18 times a day and are a highly coveted group for advertisers. "Our favorable outlook on Snap stems not only from the company's ability to innovate and cater to millennials in high value markets, but also capture publisher content and consumer mindshare as video consumption grows on digital," said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi. A POPULAR SHORT Despite a modest rally in Snap shares in recent weeks, short sellers - who aim to make a profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back at a lower price later - have not let up in placing bearish bets, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at financial analytics firm S3 Partners. "We saw $100 million worth of short selling in this past week, ahead of the earnings and Snap short interest stands at $946 million, which is the highest level since the IPO," he said. Meanwhile, options market activity suggests a swing of about 13.5 percent in either direction by Friday, based on the price of certain options expiring this week. "Snap's option activity was bullish last week, but the bears came out in greater force just two days before earnings," said David Russell, senior manager at online broker E*Trade in Chicago.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Are Banks Getting Ready for a ‘Deposit Drain’? Posted on May 10, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann A deposit drain is coming. So, merge while you can. That’s the advice JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) has for regional banks, as reported this week in Bloomberg. The story outlines the investment bank’s prescription to smaller banks on how to survive what it sees as a crunch that’s coming in December. A crunch that’s coming thanks to the Fed’s bond-buying program. The Bloomberg piece cited a confidential presentation obtained by Bloomberg News, and subsequently confirmed by a JPMorgan spokesman. Here’s the thesis, pulled directly from the Bloomberg article: JPMorgan argues that some midsize U.S. banks — those with $50 billion in assets or less — could face a funding problem in coming years as the Fed goes about shrinking its massive balance sheet, according to the 19-page report the New York-based bank has begun sharing with clients. The Fed’s bond-buying spree from 2009 to 2014, dubbed quantitative easing, inadvertently left the industry flush with deposits. Investors took money they got selling mortgage-backed bonds and Treasury securities to the Fed and parked it in U.S. retail and commercial bank accounts. But now that the Fed has announced it would cease its bond-buying activity as part of the "normalization" of monetary policy, that could mean this deposit drain is heading toward midsize banks. Now, if I were running a midsize bank, I know I would heed JPMorgan’s warning. After all, as the Bloomberg story goes on to explain, the Fed’s bond-buying created about $2.5 trillion in excess bank deposits. JPMorgan now estimates that about 60%, or $1.5 trillion, of that money will likely come out of those regional banks in the next four to five years … particularly "if the Fed follows through with recent guidance and begins reversing quantitative easing in December." So, how will this process work? JPMorgan explained the situation in their presentation titled, "Core Deposits Strike Back." A clever title, I might add. The presentation, according to Bloomberg: …  illustrates how this process will sap bank deposits using the example of a couple who pays off a mortgage that was bundled with other mortgages and sold to the Fed. Right now, when that couple takes that money out of their bank account for that payment, the Fed uses that cash to buy another mortgage bond, recycling it back into the banking system. A "deposit is destroyed" if the "Fed does not reinvest," the presentation states. JPMorgan estimates that a quantitative easing-related deposit-drain could result in loan growth lagging deposit growth by $200 billion to $300 billion a year. It’s the conclusion here that should worry not only those who operate and/or work for regional banks, but also those investors who own regional bank stocks such as those in the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE). Interestingly, both of these bank Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are down year-to-date. (KBE -1.1%, KRE -1.9%) However, over the past 12 months, both are up substantially. (KBE +37.9%, KRE +40.6%). Could the recent downtrend in regional bank stocks be signaling the looming deposit drain JPMorgan has warned about? While any deposit drain might be premature, it’s definitely something to consider if you plan on owning regional bank stocks for the long haul. It’s also something to consider if you own a regional bank that you hear might be looking to partner with another bank in the similar deposit-drain situation. As history has shown, mergers can be good for some stocks, and bad for others. So, choose your regionals wisely. *** If you’d like to comment, or if you have a question about today’s Afternoon Edition topic, or any of the topics we cover, just leave a comment on our website or send us an e-mail. *** Tuesday saw Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general, testify on Capitol Hill about the shortest-serving national security adviser (Michael Flynn, 24 days). It also saw President Trump fire the shortest-serving FBI director post-J. Edgar Hoover (James Comey, 3.7 years). With all this news coming out of Washington, markets started off Wednesday’s session a bit shakily. But the Nasdaq rallied to post its fifth record close in a row at 6,129. • Energy led stocks higher, thanks to WTI crude’s 3.2% gain that came after the EIA reported a bigger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. supplies. • Meanwhile the Dow dropped, dragged down by mixed earnings from Disney (DIS) and suspended flight tests of Boeing’s (BA) new 737 jetliner. • Americans less-optimistic about the economy: For the week ended May 7, Gallup’s U.S. Economic Confidence Index fell to a six-month low of +3.

(NYSE: JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon raised eyebrows last week during an interview with Business Insider, where he discussed a variety of topics like education, the economy, and President Trump. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, 2013 But perhaps the most shocking portion of the interview was when Dimon began to discuss America's crumbling infrastructure system. The business executive called America's infrastructure system "bureaucratic, stifling, and corrupt." Here's what else he had to say… Why U.S. Infrastructure Is Corrupt, According to Dimon According to Dimon, regulations and permit processes are keeping U.S. infrastructure from making progress. "We've become this bureaucratic, stifling environment," Dimon said. "I'm not talking about violating environmental things – I'm talking about building a bridge, getting things going, and getting people to work together." "What happened to the good ol' can-do America? Where is 'we get it done, we work together?'" And he's not the first one to bring this issue to light… In fact, inefficient regulations in America were a cornerstone of President Trump's campaign — and one of his first fulfilled promises as POTUS. On Feb. 24, Trump signed an executive order aimed at scaling back regulations that are deemed burdensome to the U.S. economy. "Excessive regulation is killing jobs, driving companies out of our country like never before," Trump said before signing the order. "Every regulation should have to pass a simple test; does it make life better or safer for American workers or consumers?" Trump also said the United States does not need "75% of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs." And Dimon seems to agree. "It takes 10 years to get all the permits to build a bridge today," said Dimon. "Ten years?! What happened to the good ol' can-do America? Where is 'we get it done, we work together?'" America's Infrastructure Is Long Overdue for an Overhaul "We simply do not need Jurassic Park-like infrastructure in the U.S.," said Money Morning Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald to readers on April 12. Keith used Amtrak – America's long-distance travel rail service – as an example of infrastructure failure at its finest. You see, Amtrak's system is outdated, inefficient, and unsafe. Special Report: Cannabis Is the Gold Rush of the 21st Century – 30 Stocks to Invest in Now There have been over 2,000 accidents since 2000 – resulting in at least 224 deaths and 2,228 injuries, according to RT America. According to Keith, it's time for America to step up and do something about its run-down infrastructure. "This nation desperately needs high-speed rail, not more tradition unimpeded by progress," said Keith. And a complete overhaul may be closer than we think… Could This Man Be the Answer to America's Infrastructure Crisis? Tesla Inc.'s (Nasdaq: TSLA) Elon Musk could be the answer America is looking for. "The markets love an underdog with vision, and I can't think of an executive today with more vision than Elon Musk," said Keith last year. You see, Musk has been trying to improve U.S. infrastructure as far back as 2013, when he revealed a concept for high-speed transportation, dubbed the "Hyperloop," as a way to cut long-distance travel times and help reduce congestion in many cities. And just last week, Musk unveiled his latest project – one that could completely revolutionize modern infrastructure as we know it. Here's what Musk has planned… Follow Money Morning on Twitter @moneymorning, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Join the conversation.

The largest U.S. bank by assets took the top prize in this year’s rankings, followed by Citigroup Inc., UBS Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG, according to a global survey of currency users by Greenwich Associates. Last year, Citigroup and UBS tied for first, while Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan tied for third. “It’s further evidence that our investments in technology and the client experience are paying off,” Troy Rohrbaugh, global head of macro markets at JPMorgan, said in a statement. Dealers in the $5.1-trillion-a-day currency market are adapting as regulations enacted since the financial crisis have prompted some banks to cut staff and risk-taking in areas such as foreign exchange. To gain market share, they’ve taken steps such as narrowing coverage and focusing on specific foreign-exchange products, targeting particular types of clients or becoming more selective about the venues in which they compete, according to Greenwich Associates, a financial-services consulting firm based in Stamford, Connecticut. “Banks have become much more judicious in doling out coverage and resources and much more focused on the bottom-line returns that customer relationships generate,” James Borger, managing director at the consultancy, wrote in the report. When analyzing clients, dealers ask, “What products do you use, how often do you trade, how much do you trade, and where do you trade?” Citigroup and UBS didn’t have an immediate comment on the survey. Troy Gravitt, a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York, declined to comment. The league table is based on interviews conducted from September through November with 2,393 users of foreign exchange. It precedes separate rankings by Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc, scheduled for release later this month. Greenwich Associates’ rankings for “Global Top-Tier Foreign Exchange Market Share” are as follows: Rank Dealer 1 JPMorgan 2 Citigroup 3 UBS 4 Deutsche Bank 5 (Tie) Bank of America  5 (Tie) Barclays 5 (Tie) HSBC 5 (Tie) Goldman Sachs Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Make Save Borrow Grow Live More Deals Chase Offers Some Cardholders 100,000 Rewards Points for New Mortgage Krystal Steinmetz May 10, 2017 Photo by Andy Dean Photography / Shutterstock.com Chase Offers Some Cardholders 100,000 Rewards Points for New Mortgage 0 JPMorgan Chase is going after millennials with a new mortgage-credit card cross promotion. From now through Aug. 6, Chase will award 100,000 Ultimate Rewards points to existing Chase Sapphire, Sapphire Preferred and Sapphire Reserve cardholders who finance a home with the bank. According to Chase, half of its Sapphire customers are millennials. Chase says it’s hoping the new offer will convince more of those millennial cardholders to take the plunge and purchase a home. The bank says customers under age 35 made up 36 percent of its mortgage originations last year — a 20 percent hike over 2015. Chase hopes to see another uptick in millennial homebuyers in 2017. According to ThePointsGuy, the rewards-points bonus is worth up to $1,500 when redeemed for travel through Chase’s Ultimate Rewards, but that’s just its baseline value. If you sign up for automatic mortgage payments from a Chase checking account and agree to paperless statements, you’ll earn an additional $595 cash back. To qualify for the offer, you need to have been a cardholder as of May 7. But you’ll need to act quickly if you want to cash in on it. You must be approved for a mortgage by Aug. 6 to be eligible, although your loan may close after that date, says CNN Money. But before you start house hunting, remember that purchasing a home is a huge commitment. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, tells CNBC: “The 100,000 points is one of the most generous — and perhaps tops — that we’ve seen for financial products. But it doesn’t negate the need to shop around for the best deal or justify settling for an inferior loan that could cost far more in the long run.” Chase rolled out the Sapphire Reserve card in 2016. CNN Money says the card was a hit with consumers, even though it has an annual fee of $450. The original card offer came with a 100,000-point signup bonus. That number has since been cut by half to 50,000 points. What do you think of Chase’s offer? Sound off below or on Facebook.

By: Reuters | Published:May 10, 2017 9:35 pm JPMorgan expects Snap’s first-quarter DAU to grow to 169 million, while Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc is targeting 173 million.(Snapchat Snap Inc has many similarities with archrivals Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc , but shareholders are eager to avoid one in particular when the social media company reports earnings on Wednesday for the first time since its initial public offering: a plunging stock price. Investors delivered a stern message of disappointment to Facebook and Twitter when they posted debut quarterly scorecards following their IPOs. Twitter shares cratered 24 percent the following day, while Facebook’s tumbled 11 percent, drops that stand to this day as the biggest one-day losses for both. While Facebook’s shares recovered from the drubbing within two quarters and trade at nearly four times their $38 IPO price, Twitter’s shares never completely regained lost ground and currently trade down nearly a third from their $26 IPO price. The options market is already positioned for a double-digit swing in Snap shares by the end of this week. Also Read: Snapchat has nothing to offer India, not the other way round One key to Snap, the owner of the wildly popular Snapchat messaging app, dodging a similar reception from the market rests on whether its user growth and engagement measures meet investors’ expectations as Facebook aggressively copies its most successful features. The earnings report and subsequent conference call after the bell “will be make it or break it” for Snap, said Eric Kim, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital. The stock, which started trading in March in the largest tech IPO since Facebook’s in 2012, jumped 44 percent on its debut, but has since fallen 5.5 percent from that day’s closing price. On Wednesday, the shares were down 1.11 percent to $23.06. FOCUS ON USER GROWTH Wall Street expects Snap to post a quarterly loss of 19 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts expect revenue of close to $158 million, roughly four times the $38.8 million figure from a year earlier, but down about 5 percent from $165.7 million for the fourth quarter of last year. But investors will focus on Snapchat’s user numbers and how the service is holding up against encroachments by rivals. Also Read: Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel’s comment on ‘Poor India’: Did he even say this? In recent months, Facebook has launched Facebook Stories, a near-identical clone of Snapchat’s most popular feature, also called Stories. The feature lets users post a string of videos and photos that disappear after 24 hours and is also available on other Facebook services, including Instagram and WhatsApp. “Much of the call should be around Stories as it represents the bulk of Snap’s future value given the importance of video advertising to the company’s relatively nascent business model,” Goodwater’s Kim said. Facebook recently announced that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users (DAU), eclipsing Snapchat’s year-end overall DAU count of around 161 million. JPMorgan expects Snap’s first-quarter DAU to grow to 169 million, while Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc is targeting 173 million. Snap still may have an edge over Facebook with its active user base aged between 18 and 34, many of whom visit more than 18 times a day and are a highly coveted group for advertisers.”Our favorable outlook on Snap stems not only from the company’s ability to innovate and cater to millennials in high value markets, but also capture publisher content and consumer mindshare as video consumption grows on digital,” said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi. A POPULAR SHORT Despite a modest rally in Snap shares in recent weeks, short sellers – who aim to make a profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back at a lower price later – have not let up in placing bearish bets, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Also Read: Snapchat does work better on iOS, has over 158 million daily users “We saw $100 million worth of short selling in this past week, ahead of the earnings and Snap short interest stands at $946 million, which is the highest level since the IPO,” he said. Meanwhile, options market activity suggests a swing of about 13.5 percent in either direction by Friday, based on the price of certain options expiring this week. “Snap’s option activity was bullish last week, but the bears came out in greater force just two days before earnings,” said David Russell, senior manager at online broker E*Trade in Chicago.

The investments have been used for projects such as real estate, small business aide, and unemployment job training. Peter Scher, Chase’s head of Corporate Responsibility, said that the revitalization effort, which could be a model for other cities, was due in large part to the coordination and partnership between the bank and local leaders. “We visit cities all over the world and you see the political leadership, the business leadership all doing good things but moving in a hundred different directions,” Scher said. In Detroit “the city came together and said we’ve got to focus on our priorities. Certainly the model we think is something that can be replicated in other places.” Originally, Chase’s $100 million investment was meant to be spread over five years, but in the past three, it has already spent $107. None of the loans that it has put forward have defaulted. In fact, according to Scher, $7 million of what was spent was returned quicker than expected, allowing Chase to reinvest the money elsewhere. In all, the project turned out far better than expected, and those involved are ready to continue to see their investments grow. “I think there is a growing recognition this is the only way you can move the needle,” Scher said. “Success begets success. You’ve got more investors coming to the market because of (Chase’s) participation,” said Dave Blaszkiewicz, CEO of the Invest Detroit fund.   Related Posts Website facing boycott after selling “Black Women Are Trash” T-shirts White cop discovers African ancestry, sues city over racism IHOP waitress arrested for pulling a knife on family who complained about ‘really bad’ service Airport brawl breaks out after Spirit Airlines cancels flights Graduates boo, turn in protest of DeVos during HBCU commencement Chase to commit $50 million dollars to Detroit Post navigation Previous Previous post: Morris Chestnut’s ‘Rosewood’ canceled after two seasons Next Next post: Queen Latifah says someone should be jailed for Flint water crisis Get news in your inbox TheGrio Favorites Worst NFL players who won the Heisman Trophy 15 richest NBA players of all time The 25 Most Influential Black American Leaders of All Time The top 10 greatest black quarterbacks of all time Infamous celebrity mugshots 15 films that hurt black America Website facing boycott after selling “Black Women Are Trash” T-shirts ‘Girls Trip’ drops new trailer White cop discovers African ancestry, sues city over racism IHOP waitress arrested for pulling a knife on family who complained about ‘really bad’ service Patti Labelle talks new jazz album and musical longevity Airport brawl breaks out after Spirit Airlines cancels flights Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Terms of Service Privacy Policy About Intern with theGrio Advertise with TheGrio How to pitch to theGrio Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Politics Living Video Inspire Health Entertainment News Terms of Service Privacy Policy About Intern with theGrio Advertise with TheGrio How to pitch to theGrio ©2017 Entertainment Studios LLC Powered by PressHarbor.com theGrio Proudly powered by WordPress Theme: TheGrio Theme Prod (nbcthegrio).

Morgan’s ongoing effort to boost the economic rejuvenation of Detroit is showing dividends.  Scott Legato Getty Images JP Morgan Chase J.P. Morgan’s Big Bet on Detroit Is Paying Off Matthew Heimer May 10, 2017 Give a man a fish and he’ll eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and then lend him money at competitive rates to build a fish ‘n’ chips joint in a marginal neighborhood, and you’ve put an intriguing twist on corporate philanthropy. That’s one takeaway from Invested in Detroit, J.P. Morgan Chase’s ongoing, multi-pronged effort to boost the economic rejuvenation of the famously economically challenged city. The initiative was originally launched in 2014 as a $100 million program, focusing on neighborhood revitalization, small-business development, and job training. It reached a new milestone on Wednesday, when J.P. Morgan announced that Invested in Detroit would increase its financial commitment to $150 million through 2019. The program has made a small, but measurable, impact so far in a city that spent decades as a symbol of urban blight and political paralysis. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan praised the initiative at a roundtable discussion Wednesday at the headquarters of Focus: Hope, one of the workforce-training nonprofits supported by Invested in Detroit. “We don’t want charity,” Duggan told the crowd, recalling the program’s origins. “We want a plan, where you can come in and make money, and other people can notice and follow suit.” J.P. Morgan’s decision to up its investment “sends a signal to businesses around the country and around the world.” J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, calling in briefly to the roundtable, praised Duggan, saying the most important factors in community revitalization were "leadership, leadership, leadership, and leadership." The Detroit initiative is the banking giant's proof of concept for a broader pivot. J.P. Morgan devotes about $250 million a year to philanthropy, and it’s increasingly focusing its spending on strengthening the private sector. (That approach aligns Invested in Detroit with the growing effort among corporate leaders to align profitmaking with social needs, something Fortune has been devoting attention to with its Change The World list and its recently launched CEO Initiative.) In 2012, about 40% of the bank’s philanthropy was devoted to small-business development, job training, and other community-oriented investments, says Peter Scher, Head of Corporate Responsibility; today, it’s 95%.

Morgan Is Opening a Vineyard Vines Pop-Up Shop Big BanksRegulators Set to Reject ‘Living Wills’ of Many Big U.S. Banks 1MDBMalaysia Parliament Group Slams State Fund Board for 1MDB Scandal Wednesday's setting was resonant with that theme. Focus: Hope runs job-training services in two renovated buildings in a neighborhood pocketed with the kinds of overgrown lots and hollowed-out buildings that are more likely to fit outsiders’ Detroit stereotypes. Noise from the factory floor of Focus: Hope's machinist training program periodically intruded on the roundtable. Strikingly enough, J.P.Morgan fully expects to earn money from its good works. Much of the Detroit initiative involves loans, not grants. The bank’s corporate responsibility reports use the word “investment” quite often and “charity” much less. Scher told Fortune that 50% to 55% of the $107 million J.P. Morgan has invested in its Detroit campaign has taken the form of lending. The difference maker is that lending is often going to small-business borrowers who would struggle to get approved for a traditional loan. J.P. Morgan’s involvement, in turn, is helping such projects attract other financing. As an example, the bank says, the roughly $50 million it has invested so far for commercial and residential construction has attracted $147 million in additional money to a total of 21 real estate projects. “There were people at J.P. Morgan in New York who didn’t expect any of this back,” Scher told the crowd. Instead, he said, the loans have earned about $7 million through April, which J.P. Morgan is now reinvesting in the initiative. Much of Detroit’s recent real estate investment has taken the form of higher-end housing downtown for millennial professionals—think glass-clad condos for the artisanal-donut set. But one consequence of that imbalance is that rents in Detroit are actually rising faster for working-class renters than for “lifestyle” renters who could afford to buy, according to commercial real-estate research firm Yardi-Matrix. Some of J.P. Morgan’s funding has supported similar housing stock, but the company took pains Wednesday to stress that Invested in Detroit focuses heavily on middle- and lower-income groups. The program has created or preserved some 700 units of mixed-income housing, and provided loans and financial advice to Detroit's existing homeowners. J.P. Morgan has also rotated hundreds of its own staffers through Detroit on three-week stints to provide counseling, technical assistance, and data analysis to local nonprofits. The idea is to let the local partners lead, while the bank provides the financial expertise and infrastructure. The company used Wednesday’s announcement to showcase Invested in Detroit’s other results to date. The score sheet includes: 800 new housing units and 176,000 square feet of commercial space either built or under construction, with about 800 jobs created. Partnerships with the city’s government and local nonprofits on jobs-skills programs that have reached 15,000 adults and adolescents. A total of $7.2 million in loans and grants to 100 small businesses, with about 700 jobs “created or maintained.” Technical and financial support provided to several local business incubators. Mayor Duggan cited a few recent hopeful data points for the city overall: There are more Detroiters working than at any time since 2009, according to the most recent job report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and local utility DTE Energy reports 3,000 more homes using electricity than there were a year earlier.

X Pret A Manger studying options for New York IPO this year Banks JPMorgan and Jefferies believed to have been appointed to lead IPO of Pret about 16 hours ago Founded in London in 1986, Pret A Manger mainly operates in the UK, but is expanding overseas. Photograph: Getty Images         Bridgepoint, a UK-based private equity firm, is working with bankers to prepare a US listing of Pret A Manger, a fast-growing food and coffee shop chain beloved by London office workers. According to sources JPMorgan and Jefferies have recently been appointed to lead an initial public offering (IPO) of Pret, which could take place before the end of the year in New York. Credit Suisse, Barclays and Piper Jaffray are also working on the deal. Details of the appointment of bankers running the IPO were first reported by Bloomberg. The appointments took place recently, and terms between Bridgepoint, Pret and the banks are under negotiation, one source said. “Nothing has been decided on anything, there is now a lot of research and prep work to be done.” JPMorgan declined to comment. Bridgepoint said: “As a committed shareholder in Pret we are always exploring appropriate opportunities to ensure the future growth of the company. If such opportunities materialise, we will update the market.” New stores Pret recently reported that total sales rose 15 per cent to £776 million (€923.7m) in 2016, and 50 new stores were opened, taking the total number of shops to 444. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 11 per cent to £93 million (€110m). Founded in London in 1986, Pret mainly operates in the UK, but is expanding overseas – earlier this year it said half of its new stores would be outside the UK. It has become almost ubiquitous in central London, and is now focusing its UK expansion efforts beyond the city centre and in other cities. It has also said it will expand in transport hubs and hospitals. Last year it opened shops in the US, France, Hong Kong, China and Dubai. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: A Barclays Bloomberg Credit Suisse Jefferies Group Jpmorgan Piper Jaffray China Dubai France Hong Kong London(GB) New York City United Kingdom United States Read More Paddy Power buys US sports company for up to $48m William Hill hit by slowdown in wagers at its betting shops Late Easter blamed for slow growth in consumer spending Handbag maker Coach buys millennials’ favourite Kate Spade Paddy Power Betfair’s biggest backer increases stake Who will get what in the Mercantile divorce?

(Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) 1 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Three years ago, JPMorgan Chase pledged to invest $100 million over five years in Detroit’s revitalization. On Wednesday the bank said it would expand that commitment to $150 million by 2019. Chase’s dollars have helped build real estate projects, power small businesses off the ground, train unemployed workers for new jobs, and – perhaps most important – demonstrate a model of urban revitalization that could transfer to cities everywhere. That model requires more than cash from a major bank like Chase. The bank partnered with a cadre of local partners that includes political leaders, local investment funds and philanthropic foundations. Peter Scher, Chase’s head of corporate responsibility, said a coordinated effort by all those local partners proved key. The bank says the investment reflects how innovative finance can play a role in revitalizing distressed urban areas. "We visit cities all over the world and you see the political leadership, the business leadership all doing good things but moving in a hundred different directions,” Scher said. In Detroit “the city came together and said we’ve got to focus on our priorities. Certainly the model we think is something that can be replicated in other places.” Chase initially said its $100 million investment would be spread over five years. In practice, it deployed fully $107 million in just three years, and results were better than expected. Chase so far has suffered no defaults on loans it made through the effort, and Scher said $7 million of the money loaned out has been repaid quicker than expected, allowing Chase to re-deploy those funds elsewhere in the city. Those investments included $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small-business expansion, and $6.9 million in other investments. Chase deployed its cash mostly through a series of Detroit-based funds, including Invest Detroit, the Detroit Development Fund, and the local office of Capital Impact Partners. The relationships worked because each brought needed strengths. Chase had the deep pockets, expertise and data; the local funds had the eyes on the street that could identify worthwhile entrepreneurs and projects. Just one example: The Entrepreneurs of Color Fund created about 18 months ago. As of the end of 2016, the fund had awarded nearly 30 minority-owned small businesses some $2.75 million in loans through the Detroit Development Fund. Chase put $3.5 million into the Entrepreneurs of Color fund, joined by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation that put in a similar amount. "This loan has helped us expand to a second location to better serve our customers,” said Kirsten Ussery, owner of the Detroit Vegan Soul restaurant in Detroit's West Village district. “We're grateful to the Detroit Development Fund for helping us to grow our business.” The second Detroit Vegan Soul will open on Grand River in northwest Detroit this summer. Many important projects in the city either wouldn’t have happened without Chase’s involvement or would have been delayed. Among those: The Auburn, a mixed-use retail and residential project on Cass Avenue in Midtown, cost $11.3 million to build. Chase put in $2 million of that, purchasing New Market Tax Credits issued to help fund the project. It was an important piece to close the gap in what developers were able to finance. Then, too, the Rainer Court project at 711 Alexandrine, a renovation of a dilapidated apartment building, cost a little over $7 million, of which Chase funneled $5.3 million through Invest Detroit and Capital Impact Partners. Not far away, Chase contributed $8 million to the $65-million development of the Scott, an upscale apartment project on Woodward Avenue in Midtown. Some of the developers in those projects, like PK Housing & Management of Okemos that developed the Rainer Court building, have now moved on to other projects in the Midtown neighborhood. “Success begets success. You’ve got more investors coming to the market because of (Chase's) participation,” said Dave Blaszkiewicz, CEO of the Invest Detroit fund. In the end, it was the combination of a major outside bank like Chase and the cadre of local partners that made these efforts possible. “I think there is a growing recognition this is the only way you can move the needle,” Scher said. Mayor Mike Duggan called Chase “a true partner” in Detroit’s revitalization efforts. And Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of the bank, said in a prepared statement: "Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity.” 1 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2q398st

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Comey’s legacy on cyber By Tim Starks 05/10/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Cory Bennett, Eric Geller and Martin Matishak COMEY LEAVES MARK ON CYBER POLICY — And just when you thought you couldn’t be surprised anymore, the Trump administration went and fired FBI Director James Comey Tuesday night. Comey’s tenure — which began in the fall of 2013 — coincided with a dramatic shift in how the country viewed cyber crime and cybersecurity. He started a few months after NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed the expansive underbelly of the government’s surveillance apparatus, and just months before a spate of massive data breaches at companies like Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase brought digital crime into the national spotlight for the first time. Story Continued Below Comey’s response to the changing times earned him many fans, but no shortage of critics. Backers, which included many law enforcement colleagues and a number of lawmakers, “praised the FBI chief for his dogged focus on tackling the rapid proliferation of digital crime,” the Pro Cyber team reported. “Comey’s tenure included investigations that led to the first charges ever brought against alleged government-backed hackers in China, Russia and Iran, as well as the capture of numerous elusive foreign hackers that some assumed were forever out of the reach of U.S. authorities.” “Comey's leadership and advocacy on any topic about which he is passionate have been unmatched,” Anthony J. Ferrante, a former chief of staff in the FBI’s cyber division and later a cyber official at the White House, told MC. “He has worked tirelessly on behalf of the ideals of justice for nearly 20 years,” added Ferrante, now head of cybersecurity at FTI Consulting. But the tech and privacy community have a much different take on Comey’s cyber legacy. “Comey’s insistence that investigators needed guaranteed access to encrypted communications — and his defense of certain government surveillance programs — left a bitter taste in the mouths of many in the tech and privacy community,” the cyber team reported. Pros can get the full rundown on Comey’s cyber legacy here. Over at POLITICO Magazine, Garrett Graff also has some good insight on Comey’s broader legacy. POLITICO's Josh Dawsey also had a look at how the firing went down. — COMEY’S CAPITOL HILL FALLOUT: Comey’s dismissal is sure to dominate discussions on Capitol Hill this week, and the fallout has already begun. Despite misgivings about Comey’s tenure from both the left and the right, he had earned the trust of Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and top panel Democrat Mark Warner, both of whom said Comey was forthcoming with them and helpful to their own Russia probe. Both said they were troubled by Comey’s unceremonious axing. One Intel panel member, though, Sen. Joe Manchin, said he expected the firing wouldn’t have a big impact and that Comey could testify before the committee just as other former officials have. But some Democrats, foremost among them Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have now revived calls for a special prosecutor or independent investigation to look into the issue, an idea Republicans again dismissed.

LAMAR SMITH Q&A — House Science Chairman Lamar Smith has transformed his panel into an “unexpected hub of cybersecurity activity,” Eric and Tim write for Pros in a story out this morning based on an interview with the Texas Republican last week. Smith talked about some of his panel’s legislative efforts, like a pair of bills giving new directives to technical standards agency NIST to audit federal agencies and aid small businesses. Below are a couple more highlights. Pros can get the full interview here. On whether he’ll investigate Trump’s oft-criticized personal device security: “No. I haven’t seen any evidence that anybody has taken advantage of that, or that there were any leaks or anything like that.” On his overall perspective on cybersecurity: “Cybersecurity is a subject that is growing in importance by the hour. Cybersecurity — or, I should say, cyber insecurity — cyberattacks are a threat to our country, our economy and to the privacy of individuals. And that’s why everybody needs to appreciate that Congress is trying to prevent cyberattacks, trying to come up with ways to make our agencies more secure and come up with ways to help small businesses as far as that goes.” TODAY: HSGAC PREPS CYBER FOUNDATION — The Senate Homeland Security Committee is holding its first major cybersecurity hearing of the year, with Chairman Ron Johnson saying in his prepared opening remarks that the session is meant to lay the groundwork for the panel’s work this Congress. “Before we can begin to discuss solutions, we must first understand the threats and trends associated with these threats,” Johnson is expected to say. He’ll offer a hint of his focus, too: “Emerging trends include the rise of ransomware and botnets as easy-to-use tactics that offer big rewards for cybercriminals.” Johnson’s committee will hear from a number of cybersecurity experts. One of them, former top FBI cyber official Steve Chabinsky, will argue that the United States needs to get more proactive. “The U.S. should lead international efforts that find higher-level solutions that solve problems before they get to everyone,” Chabinsky, a partner at White & Case, told MC via email in advance of his testimony. “This would include going after the hackers, having more secure products and protocols, and cleaning things up at the Internet ecosystem level before the problems reach millions of victims.” An official from Symantec will revisit some of the conclusions in the company’s recent annual threat report. But Jeff Greene, Symantec’s senior director for global government affairs and policy, will also recommend a range of protective measures, according to his written testimony, many of them technological, like using encryption and multiple factors to verify users’ identities. KASPERSKY KASPER-SPY? — Long-simmering tensions over Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab burst into the open this week, as current and former U.S. officials voiced concerns that Kaspersky’s security software could let the Kremlin hack into government networks. ABC News reported Tuesday that the FBI was investigating the company, that the Department of Homeland Security had issued a secret report about its products and that the Senate Intelligence Committee had asked senior Trump administration officials to address what it called this “important national security issue.” Federal, state and local government agencies across the country use Kaspersky products, as do some American embassies. But officials are worried about a Russian security law that lets the Kremlin “monitor and record all data that traverses Russia’s networks” — in the words of a State Department memo — which could include Kaspersky customer data sent to the company’s headquarters. In its response to the concerns — which first resurfaced in a BuzzFeed story on Monday — Kaspersky said it “has no ties to any government” and “has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts.” The company also noted that customers can disable the transmission of sensitive data back to Moscow. “In addition, business and government users may choose to install a local and private Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) center on their premises to make sure the data never leaves their facility,” the company added. Eugene Kaspersky, the company’s founder, on Twitter accused a U.S. journalist of trying to “cook [up] a new BIG conspiracy story.” He also announced that he’d answer Reddit questions on Thursday as part of the site’s “Ask Me Anything” series. In its statement, Kaspersky said it was “available to assist all concerned government organizations with any ongoing investigations” and that it “ardently believes a deeper examination of Kaspersky Lab will confirm that these allegations are unfounded.” LOOKING OUT FOR THE LITTLE GUY — The FTC on Tuesday launched a new resource for small businesses seeking information about cyber threats. The FTC’s new small-business portal collects existing material, including “plain language guidance” on responding to data breaches and protecting customer information, as well as commission blog posts on cyber topics like the NIST framework. “Small businesses are critical to our economic strength, building America's future, and helping the United States compete in today's global marketplace,” said acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen in a statement. “This innovative new website is a one-stop shop where small businesses can find information to protect themselves from scammers and hackers, as well as resources they can use if they are hit with a cyberattack.” THE CYBER GORDIAN KNOT — U.S. Cyber Command last year successfully hacked the Islamic State’s propaganda machine and promptly set off a debate about the authorities the military enjoys in cyberspace and what role, if any, allies should play in such digital operations, The Washington Post reports. The article comes as the Trump administration continues to review, and potentially revise, how the entire federal government, not just the Pentagon, handles cyber. The new structure was supposed to be spelled out in a plan the administration vowed to release within its first 90 days in office, but that self-imposed deadline came and went without any explanation from the White House — a fact not lost on Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain. In a Tuesday hearing with Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers, McCain called the lack of action “disheartening.” Rogers admitted the plan hasn’t been rolled out yet “but the new team is working on that. … I want to make sure we all understand that.” McCain replied: “And the check's in the mail?” LOGGING CYBER VISITS — POLITICO’s cyber watchers will find visits and calls of interest in POLITICO’s unofficial White House visitor logs, from world leaders (Chinese President Xi Jinping warrants several mentions) to top Cabinet officials (Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stops by plenty). It doesn’t feature very many visitors explicitly focused on the cybersecurity business, other than perhaps Keith Alexander, the former NSA chief who now runs IronNet Cybersecurity. But the logs show a good many leaders of companies with at least some cyber biz: Accenture, Boeing, Dell, Deloitte, General Dynamics, IBM, Infor, Intel and Lockheed Martin. See the whole list here. TWEET OF THE DAY — [awkward grimace emoji] RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY — The White House maintains that it fired former national security adviser Michael Flynn at the right time. … “Sens. Brian Schatz and Ron Wyden wrote to the FCC today asking for more information on what the agency said was a distributed denial-of-service attack on its website where the public can comment on the commission's net neutrality proceeding.” … Activist group Fight for the Future said the FCC’s servers struggled again after HBO re-aired John Oliver’s calls to comment on net neutrality. … Sen. Dick Durbin wants the Trump administration to say whether it believes Russia is behind the cyberattacks on French President-elect Emmanuel Macron, and condemn Moscow if so. … Sen. Angus King suggested to appropriators that they allocate $160 million for election result audits to counter hackers. REPORT WATCH — Pandalabs, a division of Panda Security, says it detected more than 350,000 new cyberattacks daily in the first quarter 2017. Digital criminals also raked in more than $1 billion through ransomware last year, the firm concludes in a new study out today.

As South African political risks mount and commodity prices retreat, banks from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. are telling clients to short the rand against other major emerging-market currencies, including Turkey’s lira and Mexico’s peso. They’re predicting the selloff that began in late March when President Jacob Zuma sacked his Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is about to repeat itself. Only this time the trigger may come if Zuma survives a possible parliamentary vote of no confidence and his former wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, is named head of the ruling African National Congress in December. “It’ll be difficult for the rand to regain the bullish momentum that dominated throughout the second half of 2016 and earlier this year,” said Piotr Matys, a currency strategist at Rabobank in London who sees the currency weakening beyond 14 per dollar in the next few months. “The rally is more than likely over.” While the currency added 0.1 percent to 13.47 per dollar as of 8:19 a.m. in Johannesburg, it’s still down 0.4 percent since the start of the week. Until the end of March, the rand was the biggest beneficiary of an emerging-market rally partly fueled by speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve would enact a slower pace of interest-rate increases. The currency at one point gained as much as 12 percent in 2017, the most in the world, to trade at its strongest level since 2015. And until the week before Gordhan was fired on March 30, the dollar-rand carry trade handed investors the highest returns among developing nations this year. Gordhan’s dismissal, though, was a reminder of the risks brewing in Africa’s most industrialized nation. It sparked a slide in the rand that trimmed its advance this year to 2.2 percent. And as the currency retreated, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings cut South Africa’s debt to junk. Moody’s Investors Service put the nation on review for downgrade last month. Adding to the negative backdrop is the slide in prices for metals and other commodities that account for more than one-third of South Africa’s export revenue. An index of raw materials dropped this week to the lowest level in a year. Not Attractive The rand is “uncompelling at current levels given risks of further political noise in the months ahead and a pending Moody’s rating review, and headwinds from falling iron ore prices,” JPMorgan London-based analysts Saad Siddiqui and Michael Harrison said in a note May 5. “We have been shifting our portfolio by rotating out of long positions in commodity currencies, preferring commodity importers.” JPMorgan said clients should target a level of 3.9 rand versus the Turkish lira. BofA recommended last month buying the lira when it traded at 3.64 rand and targeting a 12 percent gain to 4.1 rand. So far, the trade would have made investors about 3 percent. Not everyone is convinced the rand’s heading for losses. Pacific Investment Management Co. says it’s “no longer so fragile” given South Africa’s reduced current account deficit, which it mostly funds through portfolio inflows. Rand Versus Peso Morgan Stanley prefers shorting the rand against the Mexican peso, which has risen since January as President Donald Trump’s administration tones down talk of scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canceling NAFTA would be a blow to the peso, because Mexico’s total trade with the U.S. is about double the value of its exports and imports with other countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley recommends targeting a move to 1.33 peso against the rand from 1.41. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The New York-based lender is also bearish on South Africa’s benchmark local-currency government bonds due in December 2026 and expects the rand to head toward 15.4 per dollar by the end of 2017. It assumes Dlamini-Zuma will succeed Zuma as ANC leader this year, defeating Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, most investors’ preferred choice. That would mean a “continuation of current policy drift,” it said in a May 4 note. “Investors remain too optimistic about South Africa’s fundamentals and politics,” Min Dai, a Morgan Stanley fixed-income strategist, said in the note. “In the first three months of the year, investors had good reason to be bullish on South Africa. However, recent political uncertainty has led to a worsening macro outlook.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

JPMorgan's latest investment, which it plans to announce today, comes on top of a US$100 million, five-year commitment the largest US bank made to Detroit in 2014. At the time, the city was bankrupt due to the near-collapse of the US auto industry and six decades of economic decline and population exodus. The bank has put up US$107 million so far, funding blight removal, commercial and residential redevelopment, job skills training and loans to small businesses. Now it plans to reinvest US$13 million from early loan repayments, and commit an additional US$30 million, Peter Scher, the bank's head of corporate responsibility, said in an interview. “There's been a much more vibrant comeback in the small business sector in Detroit than anyone expected,” he said. The US$150 million commitment is tiny compared with the bank's US$2.5 trillion balance sheet, but JPMorgan is the biggest bank in Detroit, aligning its interests with the city's. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has made it a personal mission to improve Detroit, visiting at least six times to check on the initiative. Dimon has met with contractors who needed working capital to repair homes and with food entrepreneurs who needed shared commercial kitchens for bread baking and sausage-making. The bank has worked with Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan to focus its efforts on neighborhoods with the most promise and city support. “Detroit's resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” Dimon said in a statement provided to Reuters. JPMorgan has followed other private investors. Billionaire Dan Gilbert, founder of Quicken Loans Inc, and his companies control more than 90 properties downtown in a redevelopment push. Detroit was once the fifth largest US city with 1.85 million people. It now ranks below the top 20 and has its smallest population since 1850. But in July 2015, by the most recent Census Bureau estimate, Detroit's 677,116 residents were just 0.5 per cent fewer than the year before, the smallest drop in decades. The bureau will release 2016 figures later this month. Local officials hope to see gains. “It will validate all the work that is going on here,” said Carmine Palombo, deputy executive director of the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments. Still, the city's unemployment rate was 10.9 per cent in 2016, the highest among the 50 largest US cities. Nearly 40 per cent of residents live in poverty and Detroit had the second-highest violent crime rate in 2016 among major US cities. ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysia Airports said to plan stake sale in Sabiha Istanbul Oil prices rise on falling US crude stocks, Saudi supply cut to Asia Fitch unit predicts ECRL, upgraded Kuantan port to boost East Coast economy Malaysia March factory output up 4.6pc y-o-y, meets forecast Global stocks shrug off Trump’s sacking of FBI chief High debt, stagnant wages to hobble Malaysia’s growth in 2017, says economist Zcash, the virtual money making its mark Bursa to trend higher towards 1,770 points level next week Najib urges oil and gas companies to promote use of natural gas IJM Perennial unveils its RM4.5b Penang waterfront development Most Watched Now Week Innovative globe chess board NYT Video: How Danny DeVito eats an egg (and still says his lines) on Broadway Reuters Video: Australia's shock bank levy — who'll pay?

JPMorgan's latest investment, which it plans to announce on Wednesday, comes on top of a $100 million, five-year commitment the largest U.S. bank made to Detroit in 2014. At the time, the city was bankrupt due to the near-collapse of the U.S. auto industry and six decades of economic decline and population exodus. The bank has put up $107 million so far, funding blight removal, commercial and residential redevelopment, job skills training and loans to small businesses. Now it plans to reinvest $13 million from early loan repayments, and commit an additional $30 million, Peter Scher, the bank's head of corporate responsibility, said in an interview. "There's been a much more vibrant comeback in the small business sector in Detroit than anyone expected," he said. The $150 million commitment is tiny compared with the bank's $2.5 trillion balance sheet, but JPMorgan is the biggest bank in Detroit, aligning its interests with the city's. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has made it a personal mission to improve Detroit, visiting at least six times to check on the initiative. Dimon has met with contractors who needed working capital to repair homes and with food entrepreneurs who needed shared commercial kitchens for bread baking and sausage-making. The bank has worked with Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan to focus its efforts on neighborhoods with the most promise and city support. "Detroit's resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” Dimon said in a statement provided to Reuters. JPMorgan has followed other private investors. Billionaire Dan Gilbert, founder of Quicken Loans Inc, and his companies control more than 90 properties downtown in a redevelopment push. Detroit was once the fifth largest U.S. city with 1.85 million people. It now ranks below the top 20 and has its smallest population since 1850. But in July 2015, by the most recent Census Bureau estimate, Detroit's 677,116 residents were just 0.5 percent fewer than the year before, the smallest drop in decades. The bureau will release 2016 figures later this month. Local officials hope to see gains. "It will validate all the work that is going on here," said Carmine Palombo, deputy executive director of the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments. Still, the city's unemployment rate was 10.9 percent in 2016, the highest among the 50 largest U.S. cities. Nearly 40 percent of residents live in poverty and Detroit had the second-highest violent crime rate in 2016 among major U.S. cities.

The bank announced Wednesday that an initial five-year investment of $100 million is expected to reach $150 million. Since 2014, JPMorgan Chase has invested — through loans and grants — $50 million in community development financing, nearly $30 million to revitalize Detroit neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, more than $9 million for small business expansion and close to $7 million in other efforts. The bank says it reached the initial investment two years ahead of schedule due to strong collaboration between civic, business and nonprofit leadership. Improving economic conditions in the city also helped.

Its shares tumbled 23 percent in after-hours trading to wipe some $6 billion from Snap's market value, a humbling reversal for the company after its red-hot March initial public offering, which was the biggest for a U.S. tech company since Facebook Inc in 2012. The stock fell to $17.66, only just above its IPO price of $17. Some investors were hoping Snap would surprise them with big numbers in its first quarterly report, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. "The fact that they failed to live up to expectations, let alone exceed them, disappointed people," he said. The performance echoed slides in Facebook and Twitter after they posted debut scorecards following their IPOs. Twitter shares cratered 24 percent the next day, while Facebook's tumbled 11 percent, still the biggest-ever one-day losses for both. Snap said its daily active users (DAUs) rose 36.1 percent to 166 million in the first quarter from a year earlier, marking a slowdown from the 47.7 percent rise for the fourth quarter and 62.8 percent jump for the third quarter that the company reported in its IPO filing. JPMorgan had expected Snap's DAUs to hit 169 million in the first quarter, while Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc pegged them even higher at 173 million. Snap's March IPO priced above the company's target range as investors put aside concerns about a lack of profits and voting rights to get a piece of the action. The IPO raised $3.4 billion and gave the company a market valuation of roughly $24 billion, and shares surged 44 percent in their first day of trading. Facebook, which made a $3 billion bid for Snapchat in 2013, has upped the ante by offering camera-related features similar to Snap on its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp. The company said in April that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel, who received a stock-based bonus worth nearly $600 million for taking the company public, shrugged off imitations when asked about Facebook by an analyst on a conference call to discuss earnings. "If you want to be a creative company, you've got to get comfortable with and enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your product if you make great stuff," he said. Making a comparison to the search industry, Spiegel added: "Just because Yahoo has a search box doesn't mean they're Google." Snapchat's growth was faster than Facebook, however, which said its overall daily user base grew 18 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, as well as Twitter, which reported growth of 14 percent in DAUs from a year earlier. REVENUE DISAPPOINTMENT Snap's revenue jumped nearly four-fold year-over-year to $149.6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of $158 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016, a seasonally stronger period for ad sales, when it was $166 million. Revenue was "a relatively disappointing number," Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. "To their credit," he added, "they did guide towards a number that would be lower, which it was." Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter, Snap said, up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the $1.05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. Snap's net loss widened to $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, in the first quarter, from $104.6 million, or 14 cents per share, due to stock-based compensation related to the IPO. Although the figure of $2 billion in total stock-based compensation was known ahead of time, investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time, said Eric Kim, managing partner at Goodwater Capital. "It is an eye-popping number for sure," he said. Snapchat launched in 2012 as a mobile app that allows users to send photos, known as snaps, that vanish within seconds. The company rebranded as Snap Inc last year, and moved into the hardware space with Spectacles, its colorful sunglasses that record short videos to post on Snapchat. Users created more than 3 billion snaps daily on average during the first quarter, up from more than 2.5 billion during the third quarter of 2016, the company said. Snap receives some revenue from branded or sponsored filters and lenses, but depends on advertising dollars for the bulk of its overall revenue. Digital marketing firm eMarketer in March had trimmed its 2017 U.S. advertising revenue forecast for Snap by $30 million to $770 million, citing higher-than-expected revenue sharing with the company's partners. The total U.S. digital advertising market is meanwhile expected to reach $83 billion, according to eMarketer, up nearly 16 percent from last year.

The stock fell to $17.66, only just above its IPO price of $17. May 10:   Snap Inc shares plunged on Wednesday after the owner of Snapchat reported slowing user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a public company, missing some of Wall Street's estimates as it competes with copycat messaging apps. Its shares tumbled 23 per cent in after-hours trading to wipe some $6 billion from Snap's market value, a humbling reversal for the company after its red-hot March initial public offering, which was the biggest for a US tech company since Facebook Inc in 2012. The stock fell to $17.66, only just above its IPO price of $17. Some investors were hoping Snap would surprise them with big numbers in its first quarterly report, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. “The fact that they failed to live up to expectations, let alone exceed them, disappointed people,” he said. The performance echoed slides in Facebook and Twitter after they posted debut scorecards following their IPOs. Twitter shares cratered 24 per cent the next day, while Facebook's tumbled 11 per cent, still the biggest-ever one-day losses for both. Snap said its daily active users (DAUs) rose 36.1 per cent to 166 million in the first quarter from a year earlier, marking a slowdown from the 47.7 per cent rise for the fourth quarter and 62.8 per cent jump for the third quarter that the company reported in its IPO filing. The slowing rate of growth was in line with an estimate from JPMorgan, which accurately expected 166 million DAUs for the first quarter. Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc had pegged them even higher at 173 million. Snap's March IPO priced above the company's target range as investors put aside concerns about a lack of profits and voting rights to get a piece of the action. The IPO raised $3.4 billion and gave the company a market valuation of roughly $24 billion, and shares surged 44 per cent in their first day of trading. Facebook, which made a $3 billion bid for Snapchat in 2013, has upped the ante by offering camera-related features similar to Snap on its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp. The company said in April that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel, who received a stock-based bonus worth nearly $600 million for taking the company public, shrugged off imitations when asked about Facebook by an analyst on a conference call to discuss earnings. “If you want to be a creative company, you've got to get comfortable with and enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your product if you make great stuff,” he said. Making a comparison to the search industry, Spiegel added: "Just because Yahoo has a search box doesn't mean they're Google.” Snapchat's growth was faster than Facebook, however, which said its overall daily user base grew 18 per cent year-over-year in the first quarter, as well as Twitter, which reported growth of 14 per cent in DAUs from a year earlier. Revenue disappointment Snap's revenue jumped nearly four-fold year-over-year to $149.6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of $158 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016, a seasonally stronger period for ad sales, when it was $166 million. Revenue was “a relatively disappointing number,” Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. “To their credit,” he added, "they did guide towards a number that would be lower, which it was.” Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter, Snap said, up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the $1.05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. Snap's net loss widened to $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, in the first quarter, from $104.6 million, or 14 cents per share, due to stock-based compensation related to the IPO. Although the figure of $2 billion in total stock-based compensation was known ahead of time, investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time, said Eric Kim, managing partner at Goodwater Capital. “It is an eye-popping number for sure,” he said. Snapchat launched in 2012 as a mobile app that allows users to send photos, known as snaps, that vanish within seconds. The company rebranded as Snap Inc last year, and moved into the hardware space with Spectacles, its colorful sunglasses that record short videos to post on Snapchat. Users created more than 3 billion snaps daily on average during the first quarter, up from more than 2.5 billion during the third quarter of 2016, the company said. Snap receives some revenue from branded or sponsored filters and lenses, but depends on advertising dollars for the bulk of its overall revenue. Digital marketing firm eMarketer in March had trimmed its 2017 US advertising revenue forecast for Snap by $30 million to $770 million, citing higher-than-expected revenue sharing with the company's partners. The total US digital advertising market is meanwhile expected to reach $83 billion, according to eMarketer, up nearly 16 per cent from last year.

"It is an eye-popping number for sure," he said. Snapchat launched in 2012 as a mobile app that allows users to send photos, known as snaps, that vanish within seconds. The company rebranded as Snap Inc last year, and moved into the hardware space with Spectacles, its colorful sunglasses that record short videos to post on Snapchat. Users created more than 3 billion snaps daily on average during the first quarter, up from more than 2.5 billion during the third quarter of 2016, the company said. Snap receives some revenue from branded or sponsored filters and lenses, but depends on advertising dollars for the bulk of its overall revenue. Digital marketing firm eMarketer in March had trimmed its 2017 U.S. advertising revenue forecast for Snap by $30 million to $770 million, citing higher-than-expected revenue sharing with the company's partners. The total U.S. digital advertising market is meanwhile expected to reach $83 billion, according to eMarketer, up nearly 16 percent from last year.

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Snap shares plummet as investors mark down first earnings report By Anya George Tharakan and David Ingram (Reuters) - Snap Inc shares plunged on Wednesday after the owner of Snapchat reported slowing user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a public company, missing Wall Street's estimates as it competes with copycat messaging apps. Its shares tumbled 23 percent in after-hours trading to wipe some $6 billion from Snap's market value, a humbling reversal for the company after its red-hot March initial public offering, which was the biggest for a U.S. tech company since Facebook Inc in 2012. The stock fell to $17.66, only just above its IPO price of $17. Some investors were hoping Snap would surprise them with big numbers in its first quarterly report, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. "The fact that they failed to live up to expectations, let alone exceed them, disappointed people," he said. The performance echoed slides in Facebook and Twitter after they posted debut scorecards following their IPOs. Twitter shares cratered 24 percent the next day, while Facebook's tumbled 11 percent, still the biggest-ever one-day losses for both. Snap said its daily active users (DAUs) rose 36.1 percent to 166 million in the first quarter from a year earlier, marking a slowdown from the 47.7 percent rise for the fourth quarter and 62.8 percent jump for the third quarter that the company reported in its IPO filing. JPMorgan had expected Snap's DAUs to hit 169 million in the first quarter, while Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc pegged them even higher at 173 million. Snap's March IPO priced above the company's target range as investors put aside concerns about a lack of profits and voting rights to get a piece of the action. The IPO raised $3.4 billion and gave the company a market valuation of roughly $24 billion, and shares surged 44 percent in their first day of trading. Facebook, which made a $3 billion bid for Snapchat in 2013, has upped the ante by offering camera-related features similar to Snap on its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp. The company said in April that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel, who received a stock-based bonus worth nearly $600 million for taking the company public, shrugged off imitations when asked about Facebook by an analyst on a conference call to discuss earnings. "If you want to be a creative company, you've got to get comfortable with and enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your product if you make great stuff," he said. Making a comparison to the search industry, Spiegel added: "Just because Yahoo has a search box doesn't mean they're Google." Snapchat's growth was faster than Facebook, however, which said its overall daily user base grew 18 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, as well as Twitter, which reported growth of 14 percent in DAUs from a year earlier. REVENUE DISAPPOINTMENT Snap's revenue jumped nearly four-fold year-over-year to $149.6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of $158 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016, a seasonally stronger period for ad sales, when it was $166 million. Revenue was "a relatively disappointing number," Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. "To their credit," he added, "they did guide towards a number that would be lower, which it was." Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter, Snap said, up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the $1.05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. Snap's net loss widened to $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, in the first quarter, from $104.6 million, or 14 cents per share, due to stock-based compensation related to the IPO. Although the figure of $2 billion in total stock-based compensation was known ahead of time, investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time, said Eric Kim, managing partner at Goodwater Capital.

Pursuant to the offerings, BD has granted the underwriters an option to purchase from BD up to an additional $225 million of common stock and up to an additional $225 million of depositary shares, in each case at the public offering price per share.   BD intends to use the proceeds from the offerings to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with BD's previously announced acquisition of C.

Dividends on the mandatory convertible preferred stock will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by BD's board of directors, at an annual rate of 6.125% on the initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of mandatory convertible preferred stock (equivalent to $61.25 per year per share), on the first business day of each of February, May, August and November of each year, commencing on August 1, 2017 and ending on, and including, May 1, 2020.

By: Reuters | New York | Updated: May 11, 2017 8:08 am Some investors were hoping Snap would surprise them with big numbers in its first quarterly report, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. (File photo) Snap Inc shares plunged on Wednesday after the owner of Snapchat reported slowing user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a public company, missing some of Wall Street’s estimates as it competes with copycat messaging apps. Its shares tumbled 23 per cent in after-hours trading to wipe some $6 billion from Snap’s market value, a humbling reversal for the company after its red-hot March initial public offering, which was the biggest for a US tech company since Facebook Inc in 2012. The stock fell to $17.66, only just above its IPO price of $17. Some investors were hoping Snap would surprise them with big numbers in its first quarterly report, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. “The fact that they failed to live up to expectations, let alone exceed them, disappointed people,” he said. The performance echoed slides in Facebook and Twitter after they posted debut scorecards following their IPOs. Twitter shares cratered 24 percent the next day, while Facebook’s tumbled 11 percent, still the biggest-ever one-day losses for both. Snap said its daily active users (DAUs) rose 36.1 percent to 166 million in the first quarter from a year earlier, marking a slowdown from the 47.7 percent rise for the fourth quarter and 62.8 percent jump for the third quarter that the company reported in its IPO filing. The slowing rate of growth was in line with an estimate from JPMorgan, which accurately expected 166 million DAUs for the first quarter. Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc had pegged them even higher at 173 million. Snap’s March IPO priced above the company’s target range as investors put aside concerns about a lack of profits and voting rights to get a piece of the action. The IPO raised $3.4 billion and gave the company a market valuation of roughly $24 billion, and shares surged 44 percent in their first day of trading. Facebook, which made a $3 billion bid for Snapchat in 2013, has upped the ante by offering camera-related features similar to Snap on its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp. The company said in April that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel, who received a stock-based bonus worth nearly $600 million for taking the company public, shrugged off imitations when asked about Facebook by an analyst on a conference call to discuss earnings. “If you want to be a creative company, you’ve got to get comfortable with and enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your product if you make great stuff,” he said. Making a comparison to the search industry, Spiegel added: “Just because Yahoo has a search box doesn’t mean they’re Google.” Snapchat’s growth was faster than Facebook, however, which said its overall daily user base grew 18 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, as well as Twitter, which reported growth of 14 percent in DAUs from a year earlier. Revenue disappointment Snap’s revenue jumped nearly four-fold year-over-year to $149.6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of $158 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016, a seasonally stronger period for ad sales, when it was $166 million. Revenue was “a relatively disappointing number,” Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. “To their credit,” he added, “they did guide towards a number that would be lower, which it was.” Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter, Snap said, up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the $1.05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. Snap’s net loss widened to $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, in the first quarter, from $104.6 million, or 14 cents per share, due to stock-based compensation related to the IPO. Although the figure of $2 billion in total stock-based compensation was known ahead of time, investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time, said Eric Kim, managing partner at Goodwater Capital. “It is an eye-popping number for sure,” he said. Snapchat launched in 2012 as a mobile app that allows users to send photos, known as snaps, that vanish within seconds. The company rebranded as Snap Inc last year, and moved into the hardware space with Spectacles, its colorful sunglasses that record short videos to post on Snapchat. Users created more than 3 billion snaps daily on average during the first quarter, up from more than 2.5 billion during the third quarter of 2016, the company said. Snap receives some revenue from branded or sponsored filters and lenses, but depends on advertising dollars for the bulk of its overall revenue. Digital marketing firm eMarketer in March had trimmed its 2017 US advertising revenue forecast for Snap by $30 million to $770 million, citing higher-than-expected revenue sharing with the company’s partners. The total US digital advertising market is meanwhile expected to reach $83 billion, according to eMarketer, up nearly 16 percent from last year.

Pursuant to the offerings, BD has granted the underwriters an option to purchase from BD up to an additional $225 million of common stock and up to an additional $225 million of depositary shares, in each case at the public offering price per share.   BD intends to use the proceeds from the offerings to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with BD’s previously announced acquisition of C.

Its shares tumbled 23 percent in after-hours trading to wipe some $6 billion from Snap's market value, a humbling reversal for the company after its red-hot March initial public offering, which was the biggest for a U.S. tech company since Facebook Inc in 2012. The stock fell to $17.66, only just above its IPO price of $17. Some investors were hoping Snap would surprise them with big numbers in its first quarterly report, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. "The fact that they failed to live up to expectations, let alone exceed them, disappointed people," he said. The performance echoed slides in Facebook and Twitter after they posted debut scorecards following their IPOs. Twitter shares cratered 24 percent the next day, while Facebook's tumbled 11 percent, still the biggest-ever one-day losses for both. Snap said its daily active users (DAUs) rose 36.1 percent to 166 million in the first quarter from a year earlier, marking a slowdown from the 47.7 percent rise for the fourth quarter and 62.8 percent jump for the third quarter that the company reported in its IPO filing. JPMorgan had expected Snap's DAUs to hit 169 million in the first quarter, while Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc pegged them even higher at 173 million. Snap's March IPO priced above the company's target range as investors put aside concerns about a lack of profits and voting rights to get a piece of the action. The IPO raised $3.4 billion and gave the company a market valuation of roughly $24 billion, and shares surged 44 percent in their first day of trading. Facebook, which made a $3 billion bid for Snapchat in 2013, has upped the ante by offering camera-related features similar to Snap on its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp. The company said in April that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel, who received a stock-based bonus worth nearly $600 million for taking the company public, shrugged off imitations when asked about Facebook by an analyst on a conference call to discuss earnings. "If you want to be a creative company, you've got to get comfortable with and enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your product if you make great stuff," he said. Making a comparison to the search industry, Spiegel added: "Just because Yahoo has a search box doesn't mean they're Google." Snapchat's growth was faster than Facebook, however, which said its overall daily user base grew 18 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, as well as Twitter, which reported growth of 14 percent in DAUs from a year earlier. REVENUE DISAPPOINTMENT Snap's revenue jumped nearly four-fold year-over-year to $149.6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of $158 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016, a seasonally stronger period for ad sales, when it was $166 million. Revenue was "a relatively disappointing number," Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. "To their credit," he added, "they did guide towards a number that would be lower, which it was." Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter, Snap said, up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the $1.05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. Snap's net loss widened to $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, in the first quarter, from $104.6 million, or 14 cents per share, due to stock-based compensation related to the IPO. Although the figure of $2 billion in total stock-based compensation was known ahead of time, investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time, said Eric Kim, managing partner at Goodwater Capital. "It is an eye-popping number for sure," he said. Snapchat launched in 2012 as a mobile app that allows users to send photos, known as snaps, that vanish within seconds. The company rebranded as Snap Inc last year, and moved into the hardware space with Spectacles, its colorful sunglasses that record short videos to post on Snapchat. Users created more than 3 billion snaps daily on average during the first quarter, up from more than 2.5 billion during the third quarter of 2016, the company said. Snap receives some revenue from branded or sponsored filters and lenses, but depends on advertising dollars for the bulk of its overall revenue. Digital marketing firm eMarketer in March had trimmed its 2017 U.S. advertising revenue forecast for Snap by $30 million to $770 million, citing higher-than-expected revenue sharing with the company's partners. The total U.S. digital advertising market is meanwhile expected to reach $83 billion, according to eMarketer, up nearly 16 percent from last year.

Spiegel, who received a stock-based bonus worth nearly US$600 million for taking the company public, is 26, and co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Bobby Murphy is 28. The company, though, has brought on others with more experience, including Chairman Michael Lynton, former chief executive of Sony Corp's movie and music businesses. A lot is riding on Spiegel to build products that delight people, said analyst Greenfield. "The future of Snapchat is on Evan Spiegel and his team to out-innovate everyone else. Time will tell whether that's possible," he added. Snap's revenue jumped nearly four-fold year-over-year to US$149.6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of US$158 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016, a seasonally stronger period for ad sales, when it was US$166 million. Revenue was "a relatively disappointing number," Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. "To their credit," he added, "they did guide towards a number that would be lower, which it was." Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter, Snap said, up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the US$1.05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. Snap's net loss widened to US$2.21 billion, or US$2.31 per share, in the first quarter, from US$104.6 million, or 14 cents per share, due to stock-based compensation related to the IPO. Although the figure of US$2 billion in total stock-based compensation was known ahead of time, investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time, said Eric Kim, managing partner at Goodwater Capital. "It is an eye-popping number for sure," he said. Snapchat launched in 2012 as a mobile app that allows users to send photos, known as snaps, that vanish within seconds. The company rebranded as Snap Inc last year, and moved into the hardware space with Spectacles, its colorful sunglasses that record short videos to post on Snapchat. Users created more than 3 billion snaps daily on average during the first quarter, up from more than 2.5 billion during the third quarter of 2016, the company said. Snap receives some revenue from branded or sponsored filters and lenses, but depends on advertising dollars for the bulk of its overall revenue. Digital marketing firm eMarketer in March had trimmed its 2017 U.S. advertising revenue forecast for Snap by US$30 million to US$770 million, citing higher-than-expected revenue sharing with the company's partners. The total U.S. digital advertising market is meanwhile expected to reach US$83 billion, according to eMarketer, up nearly 16 percent from last year.

Predeep Nambiar Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Snap shares plummet as investors mark down first earnings report Reuters | May 11, 2017 The performance echoed slides in Facebook and Twitter after they posted debut scorecards following their IPOs. NEW YORK: Snap Inc shares plunged on Wednesday after the owner of Snapchat reported slowing user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a public company, missing Wall Street’s estimates as it competes with copycat messaging apps. Its shares tumbled 23% in after-hours trading to wipe some US$6 billion from Snap’s market value, a humbling reversal for the company after its red-hot March initial public offering, which was the biggest for a US tech company since Facebook Inc in 2012. The stock fell to US$17.66, only just above its IPO price of US$17. Some investors were hoping Snap would surprise them with big numbers in its first quarterly report, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. “The fact that they failed to live up to expectations, let alone exceed them, disappointed people,” he said. The performance echoed slides in Facebook and Twitter after they posted debut scorecards following their IPOs. Twitter shares cratered 24% the next day, while Facebook’s tumbled 11%, still the biggest-ever one-day losses for both. Snap said its daily active users (DAUs) rose 36.1% to 166 million in the first quarter from a year earlier, marking a slowdown from the 47.7% rise for the fourth quarter and 62.8% jump for the third quarter that the company reported in its IPO filing. JPMorgan had expected Snap’s DAUs to hit 169 million in the first quarter, while Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc pegged them even higher at 173 million. Snap’s March IPO priced above the company’s target range as investors put aside concerns about a lack of profits and voting rights to get a piece of the action. The IPO raised US$3.4 billion and gave the company a market valuation of roughly US$24 billion, and shares surged 44% in their first day of trading. Facebook, which made a US$3 billion bid for Snapchat in 2013, has upped the ante by offering camera-related features similar to Snap on its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp. The company said in April that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel, who received a stock-based bonus worth nearly US$600 million for taking the company public, shrugged off imitations when asked about Facebook by an analyst on a conference call to discuss earnings. “If you want to be a creative company, you’ve got to get comfortable with and enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your product if you make great stuff,” he said. Making a comparison to the search industry, Spiegel added: “Just because Yahoo has a search box doesn’t mean they’re Google.” Snapchat’s growth was faster than Facebook, however, which said its overall daily user base grew 18% year-over-year in the first quarter, as well as Twitter, which reported growth of 14 percent in DAUs from a year earlier. Revenue disappointment Snap’s revenue jumped nearly four-fold year-over-year to US$149.6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of US$158 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

 These 3 firms own corporate America Jan Fichtner, Eelke Heemskerk, The Conversation May 10, 2017, 7:22 PM 6,018 facebook linkedin twitter email print Lucas Jackson/Reuters A fundamental change is underway in stock market investing, and the spin-off effects are poised to dramatically impact corporate America. In the past, individuals and large institutions mostly invested in actively managed mutual funds, such as Fidelity, in which fund managers pick stocks with the aim of beating the market. But since the financial crisis of 2008, investors have shifted to index funds, which replicate established stock indices, such as the S&P 500. The magnitude of the change is astounding: from 2007 to 2016, actively managed funds have recorded outflows of roughly $1,200 billion, while index funds had inflows of over $1,400 billion. In the first quarter of 2017, index funds brought in more than $200 billion – the highest quarterly value on record. Democratizing the market? This shift, arguably the biggest investment swing in history, is due in large part to index funds’ much lower costs. Actively managed funds analyze the market, and their managers are well paid for their labor. But the vast majority are not able to consistently beat the index. So why pay 1% to 2% in fees every year for active funds when index funds cost a tenth of that and deliver the same performance? Some observers have lauded this development as the "democratization of investing," because it has significantly lowered investor expenses. But other impacts of this seismic shift are far from democratizing. One crucial difference between the active fund and the index fund industries is that the former is fragmented, consisting of hundreds of different asset managers both small and large. Henny Ray Abrams/AP The fast-growing index sector, on the other hand, is highly concentrated. It is dominated by just three giant American asset managers: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street – what we call the Big Three. Lower fees aside, the rise of index funds has entailed a massive concentration of corporate ownership. Together, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have nearly $11 trillion in assets under management. That’s more than all sovereign wealth funds combined and over three times the global hedge fund industry. In a recently published paper, our CORPNET research project comprehensively mapped the ownership of the Big Three. We found that the Big Three, taken together, have become the largest shareholder in 40% of all publicly listed firms in the United States. In 2015, these 1,600 American firms had combined revenues of about $9.1 trillion, a market capitalization of more than $17 trillion, and employed more than 23.5 million people. In the S&P 500 – the benchmark index of America’s largest corporations – the situation is even more extreme. Together, the Big Three are the largest single shareholder in almost 90% of S&P 500 firms, including Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, General Electric and Coca-Cola. This is the index in which most people invest. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock. Thomson Reuters The power of passive investors With corporate ownership comes shareholder power. BlackRock recently argued that legally it was not the "owner" of the shares it holds but rather acts as a kind of custodian for their investors. That’s a technicality for lawyers to sort. What is undeniable is that the Big Three do exert the voting rights attached to these shares. Therefore, they have to be perceived as de facto owners by corporate executives. These companies have, in fact, publicly declared that they seek to exert influence. William McNabb, chairman and CEO of Vanguard, said in 2015 that, "In the past, some have mistakenly assumed that our predominantly passive management style suggests a passive attitude with respect to corporate governance. Nothing could be further from the truth." When we analyzed the voting behavior of the Big Three, we found that they coordinate it through centralized corporate governance departments. This requires significant efforts because technically the shares are held by many different individual funds. Hence, just three companies wield an enormous potential power over corporate America. Interestingly, though, we found that the Big Three vote for management in about 90% of all votes at annual general meetings, while mostly voting against proposals sponsored by shareholders (such as calls for independent board chairmen). One interpretation is that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are reluctant to exert their power over corporate America. Others question whether the Big Three really want this voting power, as they primarily seek to minimize costs. Getty Images / Kiyoshi Ota Corporate American monopoly What are the future consequences of the Big Three’s unprecedented common ownership position? Research is still nascent, but some economists are already arguing that this concentration of shareholder power could have negative effects on competition. Over the past decade, numerous US industries have become dominated by only a handful of companies, from aviation to banking. The Big Three – seen together – are virtually always the largest shareholder in the few competitors that remain in these sectors. This is the case for American Airlines, Delta, and United Continental, as it is for the banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup. All of these corporations are part of the S&P 500, the index in which most people invest. Their CEOs are likely well aware that the Big Three are their firm’s dominant shareholder and would take that into account when making decisions. So, arguably, airlines have less incentive to lower prices because doing so would reduce overall returns for the Big Three, their common owner. In this way, the Big Three may be exerting a kind of emergent "structural power" over much of corporate America. Whether or not they sought to, the Big Three have accumulated extraordinary shareholder power, and they continue to do so. Index funds are a business of scale, which means that at this point competitors will find it very difficult to gain market shares. In many respects, the index fund boom is turning BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street into something resembling low-cost public utilities with a quasi-monopolistic position. Facing such a concentration of ownership and thus potential power, we can expect demands for increased regulatory scrutiny of corporate America’s new "de facto permanent governing board" to increase in coming years.

These are appointments that will undermine the health of American families. His latest consideration, according to The New York Times: Replacing experts on a federal science advisory board “with representatives from industries whose pollution the agency is supposed to regulate” – again raising the issue of his administration’s serious conflicts of interest when it comes to enforcing clean air and water laws. Even if some of Trump’s appointees are undoubtedly nice people, it matters a great deal who is running federal agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and what drives their interests and motivations. Here are a few of the most conflicted people with power over health and environmental policies in his administration, including, at the top, the president himself: 1. Nancy Beck: Worked for chemical industry group Beck has just been hired as the highest political appointee at the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, the office writing the rules for the nation’s new chemical safety law. She last worked for the chemical industry’s trade group pushing the EPA to write those rules in a way that set the loosest standards for companies, and provided the least protection for families. Beck is now in a position to undermine the bipartisan law that has the potential to bring sanity to our chemical safety system. Toxic chemicals, as you know, are linked to cancer, diabetes and death.  EDF Action: Tell your senators to protect our health 2. Justin Schwab: Represented coal utility Now a top lawyer at the EPA, Schwab was previously the attorney for a utility and other major industrial companies that likely have a financial interest in EPA decisions. While at the law firm BakerHostetler, he represented, among others, Southern Company, one of the country’s largest coal-burning utilities. Fun fact: Schwab also represented the “London Whale,” the financial trader who was behind JPMorgan’s monstrous trading losses in 2012. Undermining limits on pollution from power plants will result in more asthma attacks and other health problems. 3. Andrew Wheeler: Lobbied for coal mining giant Wheeler, a lobbyist for Murray Energy, has reportedly been tapped to become deputy administrator, the second-highest official at the EPA. Murray, the country’s largest coal mining conglomerate – which has been fined for safety violations and repeatedly sued to block pollution limits – just called on the EPA to drop the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule. The rule is already reducing the amount of mercury, a neurotoxin that damages children’s brains, and other harmful pollutants in our environment. As deputy administrator, Wheeler would be in a position to influence a decision about whether or not to try to repeal this rule. 4. Carl Icahn: Oil refinery investor, billionaire Icahn has been advising Trump on a range of issues, including important rules and environmental safeguards. He’s been accused of promoting “policy proposals that benefit his own investments,” that include stakes in an oil refinery. He also interviewed Pruitt for the EPA job, asking him about issues that had a direct impact on his business interests. Icahn is in a position to potentially influence regulatory issues in which he has a business stake. 5. Christian Palich: Lobbied for coal industry group Palich recently got a senior position in the EPA’s Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations. Before that he was head of the Ohio Coal Association and a registered lobbyist. In that position, Palich praised President Trump for honoring his pledge to stand up to “radical environmentalists” by targeting clean air and climate safeguards.  6. Doug Matheney: Ran Ohio’s “Count on Coal” Recently hired as Secretary Rick Perry’s assistant at the U.S. Department of Energy, Matheney is very familiar with industry players. He has worked for both Americans for Prosperity, the Koch Brothers-backed political organization, and as the Ohio director of Count on Coal, a public relations campaign funded by the coal industry.  7. Scott Pruitt: Sued the EPA 14 times As has been well documented, the companies that Pruitt now regulates have contributed millions of dollars to his political campaigns and causes. Pruitt sued in court to block 14 EPA safeguards – protections he’s now in charge of implementing and enforcing. Pruitt recently made a big show of recusing himself from litigation over these safeguards. But he’s made no similar assurance that he will not let his conflicts of interest skew his approach to rolling back and undercutting these important protections. As he gets under way with targeting regulations that benefit his industry allies, 125 million Americans who already live in areas with polluted air can expect even more asthma attacks and other lung diseases.  Commander in Chief: Where the problem begins With his appointments, Trump will ultimately be responsible if pollution increases and we see a rise in asthma attacks among children, more premature deaths from lung disease, and more communities suffering from unhealthy air pollution. Of course, his own conflicts are the most powerful and disturbing of them all. Many of the president’s family’s business interests are overseen by the federal government, including important health and environmental programs. There are many others in the administration, not all of whom are presidential appointees, with close ties to regulated, polluting industries. All of this in spite of the fact that President Trump signed a new “ethics” order when he first took office. In reality, the order weakens protections against improper influence. Philosophical differences are one thing, but having a government run by those with self-interests that run counter to the public good is another. Unless we have a cleaner government, we’re unlikely to have a cleaner world. This post originally appeared on EDF Voices.

About Future Resources Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / JPMorgan Chase’s Investment in Detroit to Reach $150 Million JPMorgan Chase’s Investment in Detroit to Reach $150 Million Posted on May 10, 2017 by CSRwire Press Releases, Events and Reports in Press Releases Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition. JPMorgan Chase & Co. today announced that it will expand the firm’s commitment to Detroit’s economic recovery, expecting it to reach $150 million by 2019. The announcement comes as the firm exceeded its initial $100 million, five-year investment two years ahead of schedule. The firm has been able to accelerate its investment to support Detroit’s recovery due to strong collaboration between civic, business, and nonprofit leadership, as well as improving economic conditions in the city. “Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “This collaboration allowed us to speed up our investment and extend our commitment over the next two years. Going forward, I hope business, government and nonprofit leaders will see Detroit’s comeback as a shining example of how to put aside differences and work to find meaningful and innovative solutions to our most pressing economic problems.” “JPMorgan Chase has been a true partner in our work to restore economic growth and opportunity in Detroit,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. “The firm’s investments have enabled thousands of Detroiters to receive training, created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and revitalized neighborhoods. There is more work to do, and I hope our continued partnership will build a thriving economy for all Detroiters.” Since 2014, JPMorgan Chase has invested $107 million in loans and grants in Detroit’s economic recovery, including $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small business expansion, and $6.9 million in additional transformative investments. The firm’s extended commitment over the next two years will keep pace and build upon the city’s progress, continuing to make coordinated investments of about $30 million focused on creating livable, inclusive and sustainable neighborhoods, arming residents with the skills needed for high-quality, well-paying careers and providing small businesses with the capital they need to succeed. Approximately $13 million in additional resources will be reinvested from loans paid back into two community development investment funds that JPMorgan Chase helped create with Invest Detroit and Capital Impact Partners. “Our commitment to Detroit has truly been a firmwide effort that goes well beyond our financial investment,” said Peter Scher, Head of Corporate Responsibility, JPMorgan Chase. “We’ve utilized our firm’s data, experience and the expertise of over 100 colleagues from 10 countries who have put their skills to work helping the city tackle some of its biggest economic challenges. As Detroit recovers, I hope our work continues to make an impact and yields lessons that are instructive for others looking to invest in Detroit and create more economic opportunity in their communities.” JPMorgan Chase is combining its philanthropy and business expertise to address some of Detroit’s biggest economic challenges. The firm is using the same attributes that drive business success – innovation, ingenuity, data and the ability to efficiently marshal human and financial capital –to help solve the city’s pressing economic challenges. More than half of JPMorgan Chase’s investment supports a market-based approach to creating sustainable loan programs for residential and commercial development, small business access to capital and home rehabilitation. Other elements of the investment continue to strengthen underlying organizations and create system-wide changes such as an improved citywide workforce development strategy. Investment Highlights Community Development—$50 Million Investments have led to financing being provided for 21 projects, with an additional $147 million leveraged from other investors. To date, $274 million in projects are completed or underway with the help of JPMorgan Chase’s financing, creating or preserving more than 800 jobs, over 800 housing units and 176,000 square feet of commercial space. Details include: Launching the Detroit Neighborhoods Fund and Chase Invest Detroit Fund through two Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)—Capital Impact Partners and Invest Detroit. These funds have helped finance rehabilitation and new construction of mixed-use real estate development, affordable multi-family housing and high-quality residential, commercial and retail developments, as well as provide flexible capital for small and medium-sized businesses in Detroit’s neighborhoods, Midtown and downtown. Projects include: Global Titanium Inc., Granada Apartments, Hope of Detroit Academy Charter School, Rainer Court Apartments, Sakthi Automotive facility, Shoppes at Woodward, The Plaza, The Scott at Brush Park, The Whitney, a West Village project, and Willy’s Overland Lofts.      Small Business Development—$9.5 Million Investments are helping more than 1,800 small businesses receive technical assistance, $7.2 million in loan and grant capital to 100 small businesses and 700 jobs created or maintained. Details include: Establishing the $6.5 million Entrepreneurs of Color Fund to provide Detroit minority-owned small businesses with access to financing and technical assistance. Expanding the Detroit Kitchen Connect program to provide food entrepreneurs with shared-use kitchens in neighborhoods. Investing $1.7 million in Eastern Market’s Shed 5 to help create a new space with a commercial-grade kitchen for food entrepreneurs. Providing support for business accelerator and incubator TechTown Detroit to create jobs and build storefronts. Partnering with Macomb Community College to launch a $2.7 million Innovation Fund to provide financing to start-up and next-stage companies. Sponsoring Detroit Startup Week to connect thousands of entrepreneurs with programming, education and networking resources. These small business investments are informed by data collected and analyzed by the JPMorgan Chase’s Institute, having shown that consumers are spending more in Detroit’s small businesses than in other U.S. cities. Workforce Readiness—$15 Million Investments are helping to develop a data-driven city workforce investment strategy and allowing nearly 15,000 Detroit adults and young people to participate in job skills training programs and receive career and technical education aligned with high-demand industries. Details include: Initiating research to empower the Mayor’s Workforce Investment Board to better align workforce investments and programs to prepare more Detroiters for good jobs. Partnering to develop the first ever Detroit Workforce System Leadership Development Academy to allow 22 Detroit workforce leaders to develop practical solutions for Detroit’s workforce challenges. Supporting Focus: HOPE, Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation, Goodwill’s Flip the Script and Center for Working Families programs, Ecowork’s Reclaim Detroit and Greening of Detroit to help train adults and young people for jobs in a variety of industries, including healthcare, informational technology and agriculture. Neighborhood Revitalization—$25.8 Million Investments have led to 700 mixed-income housing units created or preserved, financing and counseling to homeowners and 380,000 property parcels surveyed. Details include: Supporting Motor City Mapping and People’s Property Dashboard to digitize the city’s property information and return blighted properties to productive use. Supporting community lender Liberty Bank to extend affordable rehabilitation loans to qualified buyers and existing homeowners. Enabling Southwest Economic Solutions and U-SNAP-BAC to offer financial coaching and homeownership counseling. Partnering to establish the Strategic Neighborhood Fund to provide capital to underserved neighborhoods with a $5 million commitment. Seeding Develop Detroit, the first citywide nonprofit focused on providing housing to low- and moderate-income Detroiters through a $4 million, four-year commitment. Economic Growth—$6.9 Million Investments have boosted Detroit’s transportation capabilities and helped build the capacity of Detroit nonprofits. Investments include: Providing $1.5 million, in addition to over $13.5 million in New Market Tax Credit allocations, to facilitate the construction of the M-1 streetcar connecting Midtown and Downtown. Mitigating the temporary impact of the M-1 construction on local businesses and helping them remain healthy and vibrant during the construction period. Launching the Detroit Service Corps which, since 2014, has sent 68 JPMorgan Chase employees from 10 countries to work with 16 Detroit nonprofits for three intensive weeks, helping them analyze organizational challenges, solve problems and improve their overall chance for success. Lessons Learned JPMorgan Chase’s investment has enabled the firm to test solutions, adapt programs and find models that can be applied to other cities. Specifically: Detroit’s Motor City Mapping project has provided significant insights into how blight mapping can be applied in other cities to bring community partners together to fight blight. JPMorgan Chase has already shared the mapping technology in three Ohio cities: Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Detroit’s Entrepreneurs of Color Fund serves as a proof point for investing in minority entrepreneurs and it has informed similar programs in Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. What’s Next JPMorgan Chase’s investment will reach $150 million by 2019. Future investments will focus on further revitalizing Detroit’s neighborhoods, strengthening the city’s workforce system and helping minority-owned small businesses grow. Additional resources paid back to Invest Detroit and Capital Impact Partners’ community development loan programs, which were started with financing from JPMorgan Chase, will be reinvested.

By Crystal Kim May 10, 2017 5:08 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large The biggest flops in the exchange-traded fund universe were a mixed bag. The iShares MSCI Philippines ETF (EPHE) declined 1.5%. The VanEck Vectors Coal (KOL) and Biotech (BBH) ETFs fell 1.3% apiece and the iShares MSCI South Korea Capped ETF (EWY) was down 1.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 also finished in the red on Wednesday. JPMorgan's Aditya Srinath in a note published yesterday said that consumption growth in the Philippines has continued, which should lift the consumer sector. He wrote: We returned from a visit to the Philippines, comfortable that the 8-9% consumption growth clip has continued into FY17. This sets the stage for a healthy 13-16% FY17E-18E median EPS growth for the sector. Risks to profitability accrue more from cost pressures and competition than demand we think. Policy risks from Personal Tax rate cuts (upside) and excise hikes (downside) bear watching. Coal took a hit likely because investors are starting to realize that even regulatory action can't reverse its fate. Morgan Stanley's Stephen Byrd wrote: We doubt that regulatory action can change the trend toward coal-fired plant closures, because the economics increasingly point heavily toward natural gas-fired, wind and solar plants — see our in-depth analysis of the changing US power fuel mix. On the other hand, given the degree of state-level support for specific nuclear plants in a handful of states, we believe it is possible that the tide of future nuclear power plant shutdowns could be turned, and in many cases the federal government need only support state-level actions that are underway. Not all biotechnology ETFs took a hit as bad as BBH. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) only fell 0.36%. BBH's concentrated basket of 25 stocks did not help. Top holdings such as Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Allergan (AGN), and Biogen (BIIB), which constituted almost 50% of assets, all were in the red. Korean stocks gave back some gains after flying high in the lead-up to the country's presidential election. My colleague Robert Guy says there's more upside.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman HFZ Capital Closes Construction Financing for The Eleventh NEW YORK, May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — HFZ Capital Group, a leading Manhattan-based real estate development and investment company, announced today the closing of its construction financing for The Eleventh, a new luxury mixed-use development on the High Line located at 76 11th Avenue between 17th and 18th streets. A U.K. financial institution has provided HFZ Capital with the construction financing for this distinctive development. HFZ principal and chief investment officer John Shannon directed the firm’s negotiations to secure this financing with the institution. Situated on the Far West Side of Chelsea, The Eleventh – which is slated to open in 2019 – features two soaring towers between the High Line and the Hudson River designed by award-winning architecture firm, Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG). In addition to residences, Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas will open its flagship North American urban hotel at HFZ’s visionary full-block mixed-use development project. Six Senses is a Bangkok-based operator of a celebrated collection of five-star hospitality properties in some of the world’s most idyllic locations. HFZ originally secured $870 million in acquisition and pre-development financing in May 2015 from a consortium of lenders, including JPMorgan, BlackRock and SL Green Realty. Construction of The Eleventh has commenced, with completion expected in 2019. Sales of condominium residences will begin later this year. „We’re pleased that our lender shares our vision for The Eleventh and the unique role it will play in contributing to the transformation and elevation of Manhattan’s far west side,” said Chairman and Founder of HFZ Capital, Ziel Feldman. „This project captures the modern age and Bjarke Ingles helps to showcase the era in the skyline for all to enjoy. This remarkable work of art signifies the continued appeal of the High Line and its place as an iconic destination.” The Eleventh draws inspiration from New York City’s classic Modernist structures and cultural institutions, while skewing traditional skyscraper geometry with their rotating forms that maximize views from both towers. The stone and metal facades will add a dynamic yet harmonious twist to a vibrant West Chelsea neighborhood that has become known around the world for its groundbreaking contemporary architecture. The punched window openings, meanwhile, are an important nod to the past, a reference to the historic industrial buildings of the neighborhood and nearby Meatpacking District.  The towers will be the tallest buildings in West Chelsea at approximately 300 and 400 feet tall, creating 360-degree expansive vistas of the High Line, Hudson River and Downtown and Midtown Manhattan skylines. In addition to bringing a rare new five-star hotel to downtown Manhattan, The Eleventh will ascend to a new stratum of elite development in New York, with an unprecedented combination of location, architecture, interior design, views, services and lifestyle offerings within a downtown address. HFZ expects this truly comprehensive luxury lifestyle to resonate domestically and abroad, with five-star hotel, spa and revolutionary wellness services and significant views from every home being the hallmarks of The Eleventh’s approximately 240 residences, spread throughout the two towers. Additionally, one of the project’s most exciting aspects is a partnership with Friends of the High Line, which is collaborating with HFZ on a public open-air pedestrian promenade on the site that will run adjacent to the High Line. Six Senses currently operates 10 resorts and 28 spas within a portfolio of inspiring destinations informed by the brand’s dedication to marrying wellness and sustainability with uncompromised high-end facilities and services. Pegasus Capital Advisors L.P., the New York-based private equity fund that acquired Six Senses Hotels Reports Spas in 2012, is also a partner in the development project with HFZ. ABOUT HFZ CAPITAL GROUP HFZ Capital Group is a Manhattan-based real estate investment and development firm with expertise in a broad range of real estate disciplines including underwriting analytics, structured finance, investment, development, construction and asset management. HFZ capitalizes on development and investment opportunities both in the U.S. and abroad and has acquired, owned, developed and operated properties across many asset classes, including residential, office, hotel, retail, sports and entertainment.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The Biggest Downside to Big Bank Stocks The three biggest banks in the country are legally prohibited from acquiring other banks. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) May 10, 2017 at 2:44PM Although big bank stocks have gotten a bad name over the past decade, they still provide investors with the safest and most secure way to invest in the sector. Not only can the nation's biggest banks afford to invest heavily in technology, helping them to build the digital delivery channels expected by bank customers today, but they're also watched more closely by regulators. This reduces the risk that they'll suffer existential losses the next time the credit cycle takes a turn for the worse. Yet there are downsides to big bank stocks that investors should be aware of, too. The first, which I've addressed in the past, is that as global systemically important banks, they have to hold more capital than smaller banks. This is known as the G-SIB surcharge. JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) is 3.5% Citigroup's (NYSE: C) is 3% Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) is 2.5% These percentages aren't huge, but every bit of leverage a bank can't employ translates into lost revenue and earnings, neither of which is easy to come by in an industry as competitive as banking. Image source: Getty Images. Additionally, none of the three biggest banks in the country -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, or Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) -- can grow through acquisitions. Or, more specifically, they can't acquire other depository institutions. More than anything, this is the biggest downside to big bank stocks going forward. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan addressed this issue in an interview earlier this year. In response to a journalist's question about whether Bank of America will once again be a buyer of other banks, Moynihan noted: "It is actually illegal for us to buy another depository institution in the United States. Not a lot of people know that." The prohibition Moynihan is referring to is contained in the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. The Act was passed to deregulate the bank industry by allowing nationally chartered banks to branch across interstate lines. Before, a bank could have branches in multiple states only if the various states' laws permitted it to do so. The Act stipulated that a bank couldn't continue to acquire other banks if it held more than 10% of domestic deposits in the United States. This wasn't a constraint at the time, as no bank was even close to the 10% cap more than two decades ago. But it is a constraint now for JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. Data source: FDIC's Statistics on Depository Institutions. Chart by author. As you can see in the chart above, all three of these banks have a more than 10% share of domestic deposits. Bank of America had grown its share in the years before the financial crisis. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo both went over the threshold as a result of acquisitions made during the crisis, with JPMorgan Chase buying Washington Mutual's massive deposit franchise and Wells Fargo more than doubling in size following its purchase of Wachovia. Consequently, any type of acquisition-based growth strategy is -- for the time being -- off the table for these three megabanks. This doesn't mean that investors shouldn't own these stocks. But it does mean that the underlying banks aren't likely to grow as quickly as they did in the past. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

Under pending healthcare legislation, the divide could get worse. by Peter Coy @petercoy More stories by Peter Coy May 10, 2017, 1:13 PM EDT From Subscribe Reprints Credit card debt jumps for women—but not for men—in the year after an extraordinary medical expense, according to a new study. The finding, from an analysis of more than 200,000 core checking account customers of Chase Bank, has implications for current efforts by the Republican Congress and President Donald Trump to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The bill passed by the House, which gives states flexibility in deciding what insurance must cover (including maternity expenses), is likely to drive up out-of-pocket expenses for many women and men. According to this new report, women are already operating at a distinct disadvantage. The JPMorgan Chase Institute didn’t quite connect the dots between its research and the current health-care debate. But in a statement, Diana Farrell, its president and chief executive officer, said, “Should out-of-pocket healthcare costs increase for women, they may have to shoulder more of the economic burden of receiving care than men do.” In an interview, Farrell said, “We’re trying to just expand the ways in which people think about this issue,” taking into account the financial consequences of health-care reform along with the medical ones. Women start out behind men even before there’s an extraordinary medical expense, having, on average, 20 percent lower income, spending, and liquid assets, the study found. Women with families had credit card debt equal to about 0.8 months of income, vs. 0.6 months for men with families. A year after an extraordinary medical payment, women’s credit card debt was up to 0.9 months of income, while men’s debt was unchanged at 0.6 months. One in six families makes an extraordinary medical payment in any given year, the study found. “Extraordinary” is defined as at least $400, at least 1 percent of annual income, and at least two standard deviations away from the norm, which means in the top 2.5 percent of expenses in the category. The research compared checking accounts in which the primary account holder was a woman to ones in which the primary holder was a man. Researchers looked at accounts in which they were able to categorize at least 80 percent of expenses. Identifying details were stripped away so the researchers couldn’t tell whom the accounts belonged to. Chase Bank and the institute are both part of JPMorgan Chase & Co. A spokeswoman for the institute said that the research was released “just in time for 50/50 Day,” which is May 10. Filmmaker Tiffany Shlain, founder of the Webby Awards, created 50/50 Day, held for the first time this year, to “get to a more gender-balanced world.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman HFZ Capital Closes Construction Financing for The Eleventh A U.K. financial institution finances full block West Chelsea project featuring Bjarke Ingles-designed luxury condominiums and the first U.S. Six Senses Hotel NEW YORK, May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- HFZ Capital Group, a leading Manhattan-based real estate development and investment company, announced today the closing of its construction financing for The Eleventh, a new luxury mixed-use development on the High Line located at 76 11th Avenue between 17th and 18th streets. A U.K. financial institution has provided HFZ Capital with the construction financing for this distinctive development. HFZ principal and chief investment officer John Shannon directed the firm's negotiations to secure this financing with the institution. Situated on the Far West Side of Chelsea, The Eleventh – which is slated to open in 2019 - features two soaring towers between the High Line and the Hudson River designed by award-winning architecture firm, Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG). In addition to residences, Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas will open its flagship North American urban hotel at HFZ's visionary full-block mixed-use development project. Six Senses is a Bangkok-based operator of a celebrated collection of five-star hospitality properties in some of the world's most idyllic locations. HFZ originally secured $870 million in acquisition and pre-development financing in May 2015 from a consortium of lenders, including JPMorgan, BlackRock and SL Green Realty. Construction of The Eleventh has commenced, with completion expected in 2019. Sales of condominium residences will begin later this year. "We're pleased that our lender shares our vision for The Eleventh and the unique role it will play in contributing to the transformation and elevation of Manhattan's far west side," said Chairman and Founder of HFZ Capital, Ziel Feldman. "This project captures the modern age and Bjarke Ingles helps to showcase the era in the skyline for all to enjoy. This remarkable work of art signifies the continued appeal of the High Line and its place as an iconic destination." The Eleventh draws inspiration from New York City's classic Modernist structures and cultural institutions, while skewing traditional skyscraper geometry with their rotating forms that maximize views from both towers. The stone and metal facades will add a dynamic yet harmonious twist to a vibrant West Chelsea neighborhood that has become known around the world for its groundbreaking contemporary architecture. The punched window openings, meanwhile, are an important nod to the past, a reference to the historic industrial buildings of the neighborhood and nearby Meatpacking District.  The towers will be the tallest buildings in West Chelsea at approximately 300 and 400 feet tall, creating 360-degree expansive vistas of the High Line, Hudson River and Downtown and Midtown Manhattan skylines. In addition to bringing a rare new five-star hotel to downtown Manhattan, The Eleventh will ascend to a new stratum of elite development in New York, with an unprecedented combination of location, architecture, interior design, views, services and lifestyle offerings within a downtown address. HFZ expects this truly comprehensive luxury lifestyle to resonate domestically and abroad, with five-star hotel, spa and revolutionary wellness services and significant views from every home being the hallmarks of The Eleventh's approximately 240 residences, spread throughout the two towers. Additionally, one of the project's most exciting aspects is a partnership with Friends of the High Line, which is collaborating with HFZ on a public open-air pedestrian promenade on the site that will run adjacent to the High Line. Six Senses currently operates 10 resorts and 28 spas within a portfolio of inspiring destinations informed by the brand's dedication to marrying wellness and sustainability with uncompromised high-end facilities and services. Pegasus Capital Advisors L.P., the New York-based private equity fund that acquired Six Senses Hotels Reports Spas in 2012, is also a partner in the development project with HFZ.

Capital One Financial and Xero have announced a data-exchange agreement that is expected to simplify data sharing for small-business customers. Through the bank’s new application programming interface, small-business customers can feed their bank data into Xero’s cloud accounting technology. Many bankers object to screen scraping as a security risk, so financial institutions have been forming fintech partnerships that employ other methods of data sharing. Silicon Valley Bank and City National Bank have similar deals with Xero. Wells Fargo has a data deal with Xero in addition to arrangements with Intuit and the data aggregator Finicity. JPMorgan Chase also has a data deal with Intuit. "The growth of the financial Web, where a network of organizations connect and share financial data in order to drive their business, is transforming the way the economy operates," says Keri Gohman, the Americas president of Xero and a former Capital One executive. The partnerships are forming as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau continues to study the myriad policy issues posed by data aggregation. Capital One's API uses oAuth capabilities to provide Xero with tokenized authorization to access account data that customers request — without the requirement that customers directly provide Xero with their login credentials (as required in screen scraping). “As technology brings new waves of financial tools into the market, we believe that it’s important for all consumers and small businesses to have the ability to safely, securely and transparently share their transaction data with third parties that they trust,” Becky Heironimus, vice president of enterprise digital products and data connections at Capital One, said in a news release. The Americas president of Xero, Keri Gohman, is a former executive vice president and general manager of Capital One’s small-business banking division. "The growth of the financial Web, where a network of organizations connect and share financial data in order to drive their business, is transforming the way the economy operates," Gohman said in the release. This is Capital One's third such partnership this year. In February it signed with Expensify, a platform that imports credit card transaction data directly to expense reports, as a service to small businesses and consumers. Last month it struck a similar data-sharing partnership with the expense reporting software firm Abacus. Mary Wisniewski Mary is the deputy editor of the BankThink blog.

When President Donald Trump took office, his opponents begrudgingly conceded that he might be a net positive for the economy. After all, he ran on a message of restoring this country’s industrial infrastructure. However, that hasn’t helped Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) as of late. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr The confusing part is that BAC stock enjoyed a stellar run last year. It posted more than 36% gains for long-embattled shareholders. Bank of America finally compared favorably to the rest of the “big four” banks — JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC). Against its primary competition, BofA beat out everybody except JPM, which posted nearly 38% in 2016. Still, it was a bigly win for the perennial laggard. Unfortunately, Bank of America looks like its reverting back to its old ways. Although BAC stock is up more than 9% year-to-date, it technically hasn’t moved anywhere since Valentine’s Day. Granted, at this time last year, BofA was down nearly 15% against the January opener. But markets aren’t self-congratulatory, and investors will want to see forward progress. Adding to the perplexity is the fact that a majority of analysts covering BAC stock are bullish. Furthermore, as of May 2 according to InvestorPlace’s Joseph Hargett, no analysts had a “sell” rating. In the markets, short interest is completely absent. That’s just plain weird. Major Obstacles Ahead for BAC Stock I don’t care how great an investment appears — you simply cannot have a healthy market without bulls and bears. Plus, the exclusively bullish sentiment towards BAC stock sets up a perfect contrarian play. As Mr. Hargett states, “From a contrarian perspective, optimism on a strong performing stock is to be expected. Excessive optimism, however, can be a sign of a reversal in the shares.” Anytime banks are discussed, you cannot leave out key interest rates from the equation. Frankly, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is the reason why investors were excited about bank stocks under President Trump. When the outspoken real estate mogul was elected, the benchmark soared all the way to the end of the year. The yield ultimately gained more than 30% between Nov. 8 and Dec. 30. But from the beginning of 2017, the Treasury yield has fallen into a bearish trend channel. Occasional upside spikes have occurred but technical resistance is evident.

STRATEGY The World's Best Business Model Isn't the One You Think It Is Multi-level marketing gets a bad reputation because the model is abused by companies that sell terrible products. But with the right product, which is to say one that the end customer actually wants, it is a brilliant model. By Quora Quora is a website where you can post any question and get real answers from people with firsthand experience. WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement In your opinion, what are the best business models? originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world. Answer by Peter Lynch, VP Private Equity; formerly at JPMorgan and Rabobank; founded ASimpleModel.com, on Quora: In 2013, I had the opportunity to meet with Hil Davis, the co-founder of what was then the largest manufacturer of custom men's shirts in the world. His company, J. Hilburn, had been inspired by a passage he had read about Warren Buffett's best dollar-for-dollar investment. I stumbled upon the story in an Inc. article doing some light due diligence ahead of our meeting: Hil Davis was reading The Warren Buffett Way on a plane about six years ago when he came upon a passage in which the legendary investor said that his best investment ever, dollar for dollar, was not Coca-Cola or American Express or Geico but the direct-sales kitchen-equipment company The Pampered Chef. In fact, Davis learned, Buffett owns several other direct-sales companies, under the umbrella group Scott Fetzer Companies. "My first thought was, That makes no sense. Direct sales? That's a dirty word," Davis remembers. But Buffett was his hero, and Davis found himself preoccupied with figuring out what he had missed about the model. Davis, who talks in a high-speed mashup of business jargon and good-ol'-boy charm, was 33 at the time and working in investment banking as an equity researcher, a job that paid him the very handsome salary of $1.4 million. "I loved equity research," he says. "I loved the chess game, the math behind it." Partly, his deciding to examine direct sales in depth was just a way to channel his excess business geekery. It was a puzzle that demanded solving. But he was also restless. [1] In our meeting, Hil explained that the search for a perfect product to apply to this model became an obsession. He evaluated many ideas, but it was a failed shopping trip with his wife (if I recall correctly) that focused him on men's shirts. Frustrated with the selection available at a department store, he had a light bulb moment and left to redefine how custom men's shirts were sold. As J. Hilburn grew, he quickly began to realize the benefits of direct sales. By empowering commission-driven employees geography and more importantly, brick and mortar locations, became less relevant. He started to realize that secondary and tertiary cities lacking large department stores could be incredible markets so long as the only infrastructure required to penetrate those markets was a couple self-employed salespeople. Per the article: Five years later, J.Hilburn is the single largest seller of men's custom dress shirts in the world. Shirts start at $89, and they're made from the same fabric as shirts from the Zegnas and Armanis of the world. Last year, Esquire named J.Hilburn the best custom shirtmaker. Since the company officially launched in 2007, it has expanded from dress shirts to custom men's suiting; ready-to-wear casual clothes; belts, ties, cufflinks, and other accessories; outerwear; and now formalwear. [1] Multi-level marketing gets a bad reputation because the model is abused by companies that sell terrible products and promise distributor's and salespeople riches if they take on the inventory risk themselves. [2] But with the right product, which is to say one that the end customer actually wants, it is a brilliant model. As anyone that has attempted to start a business knows, a brilliant sales and marketing strategy facilitates success. In college I learned of another similar story. An individual I knew had inherited a manufacturer of corrugated boxes with approximately $8 million in sales. They sold through typical channels, but the new owner decided to take a different approach. He encouraged salespeople to move to new cities and hire additional salespeople. They did not have to take any inventory risk, but they would be paid a reduced salary until the new location was cash-flow positive. They would also earn a percentage of sales generated by salespeople they had hired. The business paid favorable commissions that went on in perpetuity so long as the relationship was maintained. Encouraged to be creative, the product offered became a service: custom packaging of all kinds. And the business took off. Today the company generates north of $600 million in sales. If anything is a testament to this model, it is that you can build immensely successful companies around average or even terrible products (anyone ever actually enjoyed consuming Herbalife supplements?). Fortunately, with the right product, it can also be used to build brilliant companies that provide goods and services appreciated by customers (coincidentally, like the great-fitting shirt I am wearing as I write this answer). [1] http://www.inc.com/magazine/2013... (Note: this article is no longer available on the Inc. website. I saved excerpts here: From Wall Street to the Largest Seller of Custom Shirts) [2] An incredible story on this topic: Financiers Fight Over the American Dream This question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. More questions: Sales: Could we be entering into a new phase where we don't need sales people? Career Advice: How do you become a better salesperson? Marketing: What was the biggest mistake you made in marketing?

Staley, 60, reiterated at the bank’s annual general meeting in London Wednesday that he made a mistake in becoming personally involved with a compliance issue, while saying he was limited in what he could disclose given an ongoing regulatory probe. He was re-elected to the board with 84 percent of shareholders’ votes, with 14 percent abstaining and 2 percent voting against him. Staley on growth, Brexit, whistle-blower case (Source: Bloomberg) Chairman John McFarlane said it wouldn’t have been “just” to fire Staley over the issue, and cited his inexperience in a CEO role as a factor in the board’s thinking. Staley, the former head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s investment bank, became Barclays’s CEO in December 2015. “The punishment for going through a red light is not to lose your license,” McFarlane said. However, “we will address his compensation” appropriately, he said. Barclays publicly reprimanded the CEO last month after discovering he’d continued to try to identify a whistle-blower after he was told it was inappropriate. Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., a proxy adviser, said last month that investors should abstain from a vote on Staley’s re-election to the bank’s board while regulators investigate his behavior. “You know me -- if I believed a chief executive should go, he would go, but I do not believe that is what should happen,” McFarlane said. A few months after starting at Barclays in 2015, McFarlane fired Staley’s predecessor Antony Jenkins and took over as CEO himself for a period. The CEO has said he has the full support of the board and shareholders have been “quite positive” about him staying on as chief of the London-based firm. Staley may have to forfeit his entire 1.3 million-pound ($1.7 million) 2016 bonus over the incident. Jes Staley. Photographer: Nicky Loh/Bloomberg An executive at one large U.K. investment fund said it has sold some of its stake in Barclays because of the incident. The potential for more developments in the matter make Barclays a riskier investment proposition, said the fund manager, who requested anonymity. The investor is waiting for the outcome of the Financial Conduct Authority’s investigation before deciding what to do with the rest of its stake, and said the breach in corporate governance was serious enough to justify the potential firing of the CEO. Serious Discontent “For now it seems that he’s safe, but there has obviously been some serious discontent registered,” Andrew Gebelin, senior director of research at proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co., said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. While shareholders back Staley’s strategy, “their concerns are really more about his judgment and whether he breached some rather serious governance norms in the whistle-blowing affair.” Staley has said he was trying to protect one of his top investment bankers from what he felt were unfair accusations made in an anonymous letter. That banker was Tim Main, a former colleague of Staley’s at JPMorgan, people familiar with the matter have said. Main joined as chairman of Barclays’s global financial institutions group last June. “I don’t think I’m vindictive, no,” Staley said in an interview on Bloomberg Television when asked whether the incident indicated he was vengeful in character. “I care deeply about the bank and I care deeply about the people who work at the bank.” Staley had misunderstood whether he was cleared to pursue the issue, McFarlane said at the AGM. The board acted within days of receiving a report on the incident, holding a three-hour meeting on a Sunday to decide Staley’s fate, the chairman said. While it can be appropriate to try to identify a whistle-blower if the information provided is untrue and malicious, it should be done by the bank’s compliance department, he said. “All he wanted to do was phone them up and ask them to stop sending the letters,” McFarlane said. Outside Tipster Barclays believes with “high confidence” that the anonymous letter came from outside the bank in the U.S., not from an employee, McFarlane said at the shareholder meeting. While the bank is “incredibly supportive” of its whistle-blower program, most tips aren’t found to be valid, he said. “We have a very robust whistle-blowing program and we are going to do everything we can to maintain the scale and depth of that program,” the CEO said. “All signs are that there’s been no change” in the eagerness of employees to use the anonymous-complaint system, he said.

Sign Up The Bank of England’s FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority will take several months to probe the incident, and the consequences could range from a verbal warning to Staley losing his status as an approved person and therefore his ability to run the bank. The events are also under scrutiny by the Department of Financial Services in New York and the U.S. Department of Justice, according to people with knowledge of the matter. “Executives should be held accountable,” Staley said. “I respect the regulatory framework here and let’s just see how this all plays out.” At the shareholder meeting the CEO also defended the bank’s first-quarter performance after the shares fell the most in six months on a surprise drop in trading revenue, a business Staley has made a key part of his strategy for the firm’s future. The bank’s execution on its strategy is “going well,” he said. The stock has declined about 6 percent this year, making it the only bank among the 25 biggest in Western Europe to drop in 2017. The shares rose 2.3 percent to 209.95 pence in London on Wednesday. Staley made completing a “cultural transformation” at Barclays the centerpiece of his tenure after numerous high-profile misconduct charges wiped out more than 20 billion pounds of earnings over six years.

Hackers have been able to steal credit card and personal information from major companies like JPMorgan and Home Depot. As a result, cybersecurity has become more necessary, and instead of developing a dedicated department within a company, most opt to hire a third-party cybersecurity firm. What is interesting here is that many investors think cybersecurity is the next area in technology that needs real consolidation. The April 28 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest moves in the selected cybersecurity stocks was mixed. FireEye Inc. (NASDAQ: FEYE) saw its short interest decrease slightly to 33.40 million shares from the previous reading of 33.75 million. Shares were last seen at $14.67, in a 52-week trading range of $10.35 to $18.42. The short interest at CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CYBR) increased to 1.98 million shares from the previous level of 1.64. Shares were trading at $55.32, within a 52-week range of $39.40 to $59.28. Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.’s (NASDAQ: CHKP) short interest decreased to 5.18 million shares from with the previous reading of 6.44 million. Shares were trading at $106.08, in a 52-week range of $74.34 to $106.38. The number of Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE: PANW) shares short rose to 7.82 million, compared with the previous level of 7.58 million. Shares were trading at $115.97, within a 52-week range of $107.31 to $165.69. Fortinet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: FTNT) short interest decreased to 5.64 million shares from its previous reading of 6.15 million. Shares were trading at $39.23, in a 52-week trading range of $28.51 to $40.64.

US President Donald Trump’s abrupt dismissal of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey prompted some unwinding of risky bets in early Asian trading but strategists said investors were cheered by a strong slate of corporate earnings, reflecting the cyclical rebound in the first quarter of 2017 was still in place. European stocks are set to follow Asia’s example, with major indices set for a broadly flat start according to index futures. “Markets are setting aside the many policy changes seen from the Trump administration and focusing on the improvement in corporate performance and that should support sentiment,” said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. With results in for the majority of the companies on the S&P 500, estimated Q1 earnings growth is now at 14.5 per cent, highest since Q3 of 2011, Thomson Reuters data shows with roughly 75 pc of companies are beating analysts’ expectations. That has helped Asia as well, with 12-month forward earnings per share for the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising to its highest level in more than three years. “Strong corporate earnings are supporting risk sentiment in the Asian equity markets, said Fan Cheuk Wan, head of investment strategy and advisory at HSBC Private Banking. MSCI’s Asia ex Japan index rose 0.3 per cent after posting modest gains in the previous session. It hit a two-year high last week. South Korean stocks led losers as investors took profits after liberal leader Moon Jae-In was elected president, while losses in Australia’s big banks weighed on the broader market after the government levied taxes on the lenders to help balance the budget. Chinese stocks edged higher, shrugging off news that showed April’s producer price inflation cooled more than expected, with investors stepping into the market to scoop up bargains after a recent fall. Markets were also relieved when US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross signalled the Trump administration would attempt to use existing tools to aggressively enforce trade rules and insist on fairer treatment for US goods, rather than adopt the slash-and-burn approach Trump promoted on the campaign trail in 2016. In currencies, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was flat at 99.435, moving away from a three-week high of 99.688. Rising US yields propped up the dollar to its strongest level against the Japanese yen in two months at 114.32 in the previous session but it gave back some of those gains after Trump fired FBI Director Comey in a move that shocked Washington. It was last changing hands at 113.76 per dollar, while yields on benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes were lurking near their highest levels since end-March at 2.39 per cent. But some market analysts pointed out with market volatility indicators hitting record lows — the VIX indicator fell overnight to 9.56, its lowest since late 2006 — the likelihood of a large move in financial markets has grown. “Geopolitics and the divergence of policy have not gone away,” Marc Chandler, global head of FX strategy wrote in a daily note. “It is a reminder that we are often lulled into complacency just before being shocked by how treacherous things really are.” Fed funds futures pricing showed investors almost universally expect the Federal Reserve to raise US overnight interest rates at its next meeting, with close to a 90 per cent perceived chance of an increase next month. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← China factory gate inflation slows as product prices drop Bank Muscat hosts school students on financial literacy programme → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent ROYAL DECREE:Oman-Jordan deal ratified His Majesty invited for Riyadh summit Sayyid Fahd receives Turkish Deputy PM Sultanate, Turkey sign amendment to transport pact Read More ...

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is best positioned if the Glass-Steagall Act returns, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein told CNBC. U.S. President Donald Trump has been actively considering breaking up big banks, which could push efforts for revival of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separated commercial lending from investment banking. Bringing back Glass-Steagall would likely have a significant impact on banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup that have large highly intertwined commercial lending and investment banking operations, say analysts. It would impact Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to a lesser degree although, they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding. During the CNBC interview on Tuesday, Blankfein also commented on the less volatile markets, calling it "worrisome." "I don't know what brings us out of the doldrums, but I do know this is not a normal resting state," he added. The VIX index of implied volatility on the S&P 500 - the so-called Wall Street "fear gauge" - fell to its lowest intraday level since December 2006 on Tuesday. The U.S. economy could grow at a faster rate than it is growing now, Blankfein told CNBC in response to a question on whether the Trump administration's 3 percent growth target is achievable.  © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Sarah Whitten | @sarahwhit10 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Newscast | UIG | Getty Images Pret a Manger cafe. As Panera Bread aims to go private, British sandwich chain Pret A Manger could be making a push into the American stock market. Private equity firm Bridgeport Advisers, which owns the restaurant, is considering an initial public offering in the United States, according to Bloomberg, which cited sources close to the matter. Bloomberg reports that the firm is working with several banks, including Credit Suisse, Barclays, JPMorgan & Chase, Piper Jaffray and Jefferies. "As a committed shareholder in Pret, we are always exploring appropriate opportunities to ensure the future growth of the company," Bridgeport told CNBC. "If such opportunities materialize, we will update the market." Representatives from Pret A Manger declined to comment. Pret, which opened its first shop in London in 1986, reported in April a 15 percent increase in total sales for 2016 as well as a 4.8 percent rise in same-store sales. In the U.S., sales rose 14 percent to $200 million. The company said that this growth was driven by breakfast, an increase in coffee sales and menu innovation.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren is eager to pursue legislation that would break up Wall Street megabanks and has pushed the issue with members of the Trump administration. “We’re certainly reaching out to the administration," Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television airing Wednesday. “‘So far we’ve had some good conversations and that’s what I want to see happen. I’m ready. Because you know, this is one of those basic things-- folks on Wall Street may resist it. But most of the American people get it." At issue is the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law repealed in 1999 that had separated investment and commercial banking. Warren says reviving the law would make the financial system safer, while protecting consumers from Wall Street’s risky market bets. President Donald Trump and other administration officials, including top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, have also spoken favorably of reinstating some version of the law. Warren has repeatedly introduced a bill that would prohibit big banks from having a retail and an investment business, which would probably force firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. to split apart. In the Bloomberg interview, she said her legislation would help smaller banks and investment firms compete with bigger rivals, while simplifying financial regulations. Bankers’ Gambling “Your grandma’s checking account and banking account, that kind of banking should never be put at risk by the kind of high stakes gambling that goes on on Wall Street," Warren said. “Separate the two, build a wall." But the prospect of a politically divided Congress approving any major financial services bill is slim, particularly one that would force banks to dramatically revamp their business models. Only one Republican in the Senate, John McCain of Arizona, has endorsed Warren’s reinstatement of Glass-Steagall. While Trump has asserted that he might support breaking up lenders, his administration hasn’t laid out a specific plan. The lack of clarity, along with mixed messages from the president, have perplexed bankers. They have cheered Trump’s pledge to roll back financial rules, but been put off by the populist anti-Wall Street rhetoric that helped get him elected. In the Bloomberg interview, Warren also weighed in on the nation’s housing-finance system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which back about 40 percent of U.S. home loans, have been under the government’s grip since the 2008 financial crisis. An overhaul is needed before that can change, she said. ‘Wrong Way’ “I think that’s looking at it the wrong way,” Warren said when asked whether it’s viable to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac build up capital and then free them from government control. “We’ve got to rethink how we do housing financing.” On tax policy, Warren said giant corporations have “plenty of tax breaks as it is” and don’t need to see a rate reduction. Everybody, including corporations, should pay their “fair share” so the government has enough revenue to invest in “America’s families,” she said. © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Michael J. DeMarco, chief executive officer, commented “We continue on our steady progress of driving our results and creating and growing our NAV. Our multi-family transformation is largely complete and producing higher than expected results.” FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS * All per share amounts presented below are on a diluted basis. Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 amounted to $19.9 million, or $0.11 per share, as compared to $62.2 million, or $0.69 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Funds from operations (FFO) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 amounted to $55.9 million, or $0.56 per share, as compared to $48.2 million, or $0.48 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. For the first quarter 2017, Core FFO was $0.56 per share after adjusting for certain items. The quarter’s Core FFO per share of $0.56 increased 14 percent from the same quarter last year primarily due to increased base rents in 2017 and interest expense savings from refinancing of high rate debt. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) increased by $20.2 million to $38.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $18.1 million for the comparable period in 2016. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS Mack-Cali’s consolidated Core, Waterfront and Flex properties were 90.4 percent leased at March 31, 2017, as compared to 90.6 percent leased at December 31, 2016 and 89.1 percent leased at December 31, 2015. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company executed 54 leases at its consolidated in-service commercial portfolio totaling 362,075 square feet. Of these totals, 15 percent were for new leases and 85 percent were for lease renewals and other tenant retention transactions.  Rental rate roll up for first quarter 2017 transactions in the Company’s Core, Waterfront and Flex properties was 1.2 percent on a cash basis and 11.4 percent on a GAAP basis. RECENT TRANSACTIONS In March, the Company purchased a prominent office portfolio for $367 million. This included three buildings comprising 581,000 square feet in the high-demand market of Short Hills, New Jersey and three buildings totaling 532,000 square feet in the prestigious Giralda Farms campus in Madison, New Jersey. With the expected completion of this acquisition, Mack-Cali will own virtually 100 percent of the class A office market in Short Hills, which has the highest rents in the state. The Giralda Farms properties present a value-add opportunity to reposition high-quality assets to meet the demands of today’s significant corporate users.  The Morris County office market has been consistently the first choice for corporate users establishing new state-of-the-art headquarters facilities and has attracted large, multi-national pharmaceutical and other Fortune 500 companies. In February, Mack-Cali’s multi-family subsidiary Roseland Residential Trust acquired all of the joint venture partner interests in a development site known as Plaza 8/9 in Jersey City, New Jersey, and converted its ownership on the valuable development site from 50 to 100 percent. The purchase price was $57,100,000.  The site is planned for future residential development and is directly adjacent to Harborside on the Hudson River waterfront. In April, Roseland acquired all joint venture partner interests in Monaco, Jersey City, New Jersey, the 523-apartment, two-tower, stabilized community completed in 2011. The transaction converted Roseland’s non-cash flowing 15 percent subordinate interest to 100 percent.  The Monaco transaction, valued at $315 million or $602,000/unit, represents a capitalization rate of 4.66 percent on a trailing 12-month basis. BALANCE SHEET/CAPITAL MARKETS As of March 31, 2017, the Company had a debt-to-undepreciated assets ratio of 43.8 percent compared to 41.6 percent at December 31, 2016 and 40.4 percent at March 31, 2016.   Net debt to EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was 8.5 times compared to 7.5 times for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.  The Company had an interest coverage ratio of 3.8 times for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to 3.5 times for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 3.0 times for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. In January 2017, the Company closed on senior unsecured credit facilities totaling $925 million with a group of 13 lenders, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC; J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners; and Capital One, National Association and U.S. Bank National Association as joint lead arrangers. The credit facilities are comprised of a renewal and extension of the Company’s existing $600 million unsecured revolving facility and a new $325 million unsecured delayed-draw term loan. The $600 million credit facility carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 120 basis points and a facility fee of 25 basis points.  The facility has a term of four years with two six-month extension options.  The new $325 million term loan was drawn in full by March 31, 2017 and carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 140 basis points and a ticking fee of 25 basis points on any undrawn balance during the first 12 months after closing.  On March 29, 2017, the Company executed interest rate swap arrangements to fix LIBOR with an aggregate average rate of 1.6473% for the swaps and a current aggregate fixed rate of 3.0473% on borrowings under the term loan.  The term loan matures in three years with two one-year extension options.  The interest rate on the revolving credit facility and new term loan and the facility fee on the revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment, on a sliding scale, based upon the Company’s unsecured debt ratings, or at the Company’s option, based on a defined leverage ratio. The credit facilities also contain accordion features providing for expansion of the facilities up to a total of $1.275 billion. On February 27, 2017, Roseland announced the signing of the Rockpoint transaction – a $300 million equity investment that will provide capital to further execute on the objectives of Roseland’s residential business plan. Highlights of the Rockpoint transaction include: Rockpoint committed to fund $300 million of equity into RRT over the next two years, of which $150 million was funded at the closing on March 10, 2017. Mack-Cali will have the option to fund up to $200 million of equity into RRT after Rockpoint’s commitment is fully funded. RRT received a deemed funded existing equity value at closing of $1.23 billion. Upon full Rockpoint and Mack-Cali funding, pro forma ownership would be approximately 83 percent Mack-Cali and 17 percent Rockpoint. Alterra at Overlook Ridge, Malden and Revere, Massachusetts: In January, the Company placed a seven-year, $100 million mortgage on the community at an interest-only rate of 3.75 percent. DIVIDENDS In March 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share (indicating an annual rate of $0.60 per common share) for the first quarter 2017, which was paid on April 13, 2017 to shareholders of record as of April 5, 2017. The Company’s Core FFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 26.9 percent. GUIDANCE/OUTLOOK The Company expressed comfort with net income and FFO per diluted share for the full year 2017, as follows: Full Year 2017 Range Net income available to common shareholders $ 0.36 – $ 0.51 Add (deduct): Real estate-related depreciation and amortization on continuing operations 1.95 Redemption value adjustment to redeemable noncontrolling interests 0.11 Realized (gains) losses and unrealized losses on disposition of rental property, net (0.05) Gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint ventures (0.12) Funds from operations $ 2.25 – $ 2.40 These estimates reflect management’s view of current market conditions and certain assumptions with regard to rental rates, occupancy levels and other assumptions/projections. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The Company believes that FFO per share is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. The Company further believes that as FFO per share excludes the effect of depreciation, gains (or losses) from sales of properties and impairments related to depreciable rental property (all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance), FFO per share can facilitate comparison of operating performance between equity REITs. FFO per share should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders per share as an indication of the Company’s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  FFO per share presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO per share presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. However, the Company’s FFO per share is comparable to the FFO per share of real estate companies that use the current definition of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). A reconciliation of net income per share to FFO per share is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release. Core FFO is defined as FFO, as adjusted for certain items to facilitate comparative measurement of the Company’s performance over time.  Core FFO is presented solely as supplemental disclosure that the Company’s management believes provides useful information to investors and analysts of its results, after adjusting for certain items to facilitate comparability of its performance from period to period. Core FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not intended to represent cash flow and is not indicative of cash flows provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP.  As there is not a generally accepted definition established for Core FFO, the Company’s measures of Core FFO may not be comparable to the Core FFO reported by other REITs.  A reconciliation of net income per share to Core FFO in dollars and per share is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release. ABOUT THE COMPANY Mack-Cali Realty Corporation is a fully integrated, self-administered, self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) providing management, leasing, development, and other tenant-related services for its two-platform operations of waterfront and transit-based office and luxury multi-family assets.  Mack-Cali provides its tenants and residents with the most innovative communities that empower them to re-imagine the way they work and live.

FIRST QUARTER 2017 HIGHLIGHTS Net income of $0.11 per diluted share for the quarter; Funds from Operations per diluted share of $0.56 and Core Funds from Operations growth of 14% to $0.56 for the quarter; Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) increased by $20.2 million, or 112%, to $38.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $18.1 million for the comparable period in 2016; Increased rental rates by 11.4% on a GAAP basis and 1.2% on a cash basis at its Core/Waterfront/Flex properties; Core/Waterfront/Flex properties 90.4% leased; Leased 362,075 square feet; Signed $300 million equity transaction for Roseland multi-family subsidiary; Increased Roseland occupancy to 97.5%, up 1.5% over fourth quarter; Urby achieved 36% occupancy in two months of leasing at average rent of $55 per square foot; Declared $0.15 per share quarterly common stock dividend; and Reaffirmed 2017 FFO guidance of $2.25 to $2.40 per diluted share. Michael J. DeMarco, chief executive officer, commented “We continue on our steady progress of driving our results and creating and growing our NAV. Our multi-family transformation is largely complete and producing higher than expected results.” FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS * All per share amounts presented below are on a diluted basis. Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 amounted to $19.9 million, or $0.11 per share, as compared to $62.2 million, or $0.69 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Funds from operations (FFO) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 amounted to $55.9 million, or $0.56 per share, as compared to $48.2 million, or $0.48 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. For the first quarter 2017, Core FFO was $0.56 per share after adjusting for certain items. The quarter’s Core FFO per share of $0.56 increased 14 percent from the same quarter last year primarily due to increased base rents in 2017 and interest expense savings from refinancing of high rate debt. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) increased by $20.2 million to $38.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $18.1 million for the comparable period in 2016. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS Mack-Cali’s consolidated Core, Waterfront and Flex properties were 90.4 percent leased at March 31, 2017, as compared to 90.6 percent leased at December 31, 2016 and 89.1 percent leased at December 31, 2015. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company executed 54 leases at its consolidated in-service commercial portfolio totaling 362,075 square feet. Of these totals, 15 percent were for new leases and 85 percent were for lease renewals and other tenant retention transactions.  Rental rate roll up for first quarter 2017 transactions in the Company’s Core, Waterfront and Flex properties was 1.2 percent on a cash basis and 11.4 percent on a GAAP basis. RECENT TRANSACTIONS In March, the Company purchased a prominent office portfolio for $367 million. This included three buildings comprising 581,000 square feet in the high-demand market of Short Hills, New Jersey and three buildings totaling 532,000 square feet in the prestigious Giralda Farms campus in Madison, New Jersey. With the expected completion of this acquisition, Mack-Cali will own virtually 100 percent of the class A office market in Short Hills, which has the highest rents in the state. The Giralda Farms properties present a value-add opportunity to reposition high-quality assets to meet the demands of today’s significant corporate users.  The Morris County office market has been consistently the first choice for corporate users establishing new state-of-the-art headquarters facilities and has attracted large, multi-national pharmaceutical and other Fortune 500 companies. In February, Mack-Cali’s multi-family subsidiary Roseland Residential Trust acquired all of the joint venture partner interests in a development site known as Plaza 8/9 in Jersey City, New Jersey, and converted its ownership on the valuable development site from 50 to 100 percent. The purchase price was $57,100,000.  The site is planned for future residential development and is directly adjacent to Harborside on the Hudson River waterfront. In April, Roseland acquired all joint venture partner interests in Monaco, Jersey City, New Jersey, the 523-apartment, two-tower, stabilized community completed in 2011. The transaction converted Roseland’s non-cash flowing 15 percent subordinate interest to 100 percent.  The Monaco transaction, valued at $315 million or $602,000/unit, represents a capitalization rate of 4.66 percent on a trailing 12-month basis. BALANCE SHEET/CAPITAL MARKETS As of March 31, 2017, the Company had a debt-to-undepreciated assets ratio of 43.8 percent compared to 41.6 percent at December 31, 2016 and 40.4 percent at March 31, 2016.   Net debt to EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was 8.5 times compared to 7.5 times for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.  The Company had an interest coverage ratio of 3.8 times for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to 3.5 times for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 3.0 times for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. In January 2017, the Company closed on senior unsecured credit facilities totaling $925 million with a group of 13 lenders, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC; J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners; and Capital One, National Association and U.S. Bank National Association as joint lead arrangers. The credit facilities are comprised of a renewal and extension of the Company’s existing $600 million unsecured revolving facility and a new $325 million unsecured delayed-draw term loan. The $600 million credit facility carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 120 basis points and a facility fee of 25 basis points.  The facility has a term of four years with two six-month extension options.  The new $325 million term loan was drawn in full by March 31, 2017 and carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 140 basis points and a ticking fee of 25 basis points on any undrawn balance during the first 12 months after closing.  On March 29, 2017, the Company executed interest rate swap arrangements to fix LIBOR with an aggregate average rate of 1.6473% for the swaps and a current aggregate fixed rate of 3.0473% on borrowings under the term loan.  The term loan matures in three years with two one-year extension options.  The interest rate on the revolving credit facility and new term loan and the facility fee on the revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment, on a sliding scale, based upon the Company’s unsecured debt ratings, or at the Company’s option, based on a defined leverage ratio. The credit facilities also contain accordion features providing for expansion of the facilities up to a total of $1.275 billion. On February 27, 2017, Roseland announced the signing of the Rockpoint transaction – a $300 million equity investment that will provide capital to further execute on the objectives of Roseland’s residential business plan. Highlights of the Rockpoint transaction include: Rockpoint committed to fund $300 million of equity into RRT over the next two years, of which $150 million was funded at the closing on March 10, 2017. Mack-Cali will have the option to fund up to $200 million of equity into RRT after Rockpoint’s commitment is fully funded. RRT received a deemed funded existing equity value at closing of $1.23 billion. Upon full Rockpoint and Mack-Cali funding, pro forma ownership would be approximately 83 percent Mack-Cali and 17 percent Rockpoint. Alterra at Overlook Ridge, Malden and Revere, Massachusetts: In January, the Company placed a seven-year, $100 million mortgage on the community at an interest-only rate of 3.75 percent. DIVIDENDS In March 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share (indicating an annual rate of $0.60 per common share) for the first quarter 2017, which was paid on April 13, 2017 to shareholders of record as of April 5, 2017. The Company’s Core FFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 26.9 percent. GUIDANCE/OUTLOOK The Company expressed comfort with net income and FFO per diluted share for the full year 2017, as follows: Full Year 2017 Range Net income available to common shareholders $ 0.36 – $ 0.51 Add (deduct): Real estate-related depreciation and amortization on continuing operations 1.95 Redemption value adjustment to redeemable noncontrolling interests 0.11 Realized (gains) losses and unrealized losses on disposition of rental property, net (0.05) Gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint ventures (0.12) Funds from operations $ 2.25 – $ 2.40 These estimates reflect management’s view of current market conditions and certain assumptions with regard to rental rates, occupancy levels and other assumptions/projections. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Copies of Mack-Cali’s Form 10-Q and Supplemental Operating and Financial Data are available on Mack-Cali’s website, as follows: First Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q: https://www.mack-cali.com/media/1028960/1stquarter10q17.pdf First Quarter 2017 Supplemental Operating and Financial Data: https://www.mack-cali.com/media/1028954/1stquartersp17.pdf First Quarter 2017 Supplemental Operating and Financial Data for Roseland Residential Platform:  https://www.mack-cali.com/media/1028957/1stquartersp17Roseland.pdf In addition, these items are available upon request from: Mack-Cali Investor Relations Department – Deidre Crockett Harborside 3, 210 Hudson St., Ste. 400, Jersey City, New Jersey 07311 (732) 590-1025 INFORMATION ABOUT FFO Funds from operations (“FFO”) is defined as net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests of unitholders, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), excluding gains or losses from depreciable rental property transactions, and impairments related to depreciable rental property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that FFO per share is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. The Company further believes that as FFO per share excludes the effect of depreciation, gains (or losses) from sales of properties and impairments related to depreciable rental property (all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance), FFO per share can facilitate comparison of operating performance between equity REITs. FFO per share should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders per share as an indication of the Company’s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  FFO per share presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO per share presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. However, the Company’s FFO per share is comparable to the FFO per share of real estate companies that use the current definition of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). A reconciliation of net income per share to FFO per share is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release. Core FFO is defined as FFO, as adjusted for certain items to facilitate comparative measurement of the Company’s performance over time.  Core FFO is presented solely as supplemental disclosure that the Company’s management believes provides useful information to investors and analysts of its results, after adjusting for certain items to facilitate comparability of its performance from period to period. Core FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not intended to represent cash flow and is not indicative of cash flows provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP.  As there is not a generally accepted definition established for Core FFO, the Company’s measures of Core FFO may not be comparable to the Core FFO reported by other REITs.  A reconciliation of net income per share to Core FFO in dollars and per share is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.

It has also sought the expertise of Credit Suisse, Barclays and Piper Jaffray, said Bloomberg, which first reported news of the upcoming flotation. It is understood that Bridgepoint is only looking to sell a stake in the company rather than cash out completely as it looks to take advantage of further international growth prospects.  The company recorded a 15pc rise in sales to £776m in the year to December 29 with its US sales exceeding $200m for the first time. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose by 11pc to £93.2m. Based on the recent US flotation of burger chain Shake Shack, which floated at 41 times earnings, Pret could reach a valuation of as much as £3.9bn as the British company has significantly more stores and a greater geographic reach than Shake Shack. However, City sources suggested a comparison with Starbucks' multiples, on around 15 times earnings, which would imply a £1.4bn valuation, was more fitting. “As a committed shareholder in Pret we are always exploring appropriate opportunities to ensure the future growth of the company”, a Bridepoint spokesman said. “If such opportunities materialise, we will update the market.” Pret chief executive Clive Schlee recently highlighted the potential for growth in the US by highlighting New York’s Penn station as an example of how the company had started to grow rapidly in transport hubs such as train stations and airports. Clive Schlee, boss of the sandwich and coffee chain The chain, which opened its first shop in London in 1986, now has 444 shops globally - 74 of which were in the US - and said it was actively targeting 500 sites. It opened 50 new shops in 2016, including 31 in the UK and 9 in the US. The company also started selling baguettes to the French in 2011 and has recently launched vegetarian-only shops. The company has recently set out to lure more British workers to attract more British workers as it faces up to potential staff shortages after Brexit. It has also scrapped plans to offer sandwiches to teenagers in exchange for their time on an unpaid internship.

They presently have a $24.00 price target on the financial services provider’s stock. National Securities’ price objective points to a potential upside of 11.78% from the company’s previous close. The analysts wrote, “• NII/share fell a penny short of the $0.40/share quarterly dividend and our estimate of $0.42. However, we note that the quarter was negatively impacted by a $536,000 ($0.01/share) expense related to the issuance of the 2022 unsecured notes. Despite the lackluster earnings, balance sheet leverage remains significantly under SLRC’s target of 0.75x (at 0.41x as of 3/31/17) and that the joint ventures (JV) are not fully ramped. We expect the increased balance sheet leverage, full utilization of JVs, and the different strategies of cash flow middle market lending, ABL (asset-based lending) through Crystal Financial, and the life sciences lending platform have the ability to drive significant portfolio growth the next two years. • SLRC’s asset quality remains very strong and we expect this will continue. Solar has proven that they are a credit investor, not asset gatherer, and have been very disciplined with not putting capital to work for the sake of growing the portfolio. This conservative credit approach is evident in the very strong asset quality at Solar, with the company having a single loan on non-accrual representing 64 bps of the portfolio at amortized cost. • We are revising out 2017 NII/share estimate to $1.71 from $1.75 and our 2018 NII/share estimate to $1.83 from $1.85. “ Other analysts have also recently issued research reports about the stock.

From lending and investing to deposits and customer service, fintech companies are built with an agile infrastructure designed to reinvent the financial system. These companies can operate quickly and efficiently, something banks have struggled to do in the digital era. However, big banks are resilient. The big players have survived numerous disruptions, most recently the invention of the internet and the dot-com boom. At the end of 2015, the US banking system had $15.967 trillion in assets. It supports the world’s largest economy with the greatest diversity in banking institutions and concentration of private credit. For comparison, VB Profiles found the fintech industry to be worth just $870 billion in current value. As more startups emerge and veteran fintech firms become more sophisticated, the conflict between fintech and traditional banking grows. Advantages of Banks Banks have a vast rolodex of loyal customers, while fintech offers convenience and efficiency, both of which are required to enjoy success in the finance world. “Instead of continuing to build a divide, fintech and banks must leverage their strengths and work to collaborate, creating an infrastructure that is advantageous for consumers,” said Patrick Koeck, COO of Creamfinance, an online finance company. Brick-and-mortar banks may seem old school, but they are far from obsolete. Banks like JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo are some of the biggest financial institutions in the world and are staples of the economy. Wells Fargo, for example, has nearly 9,000 branches and over 13,000 ATMs across the country. Banks are deeply rooted in our economy; they hold a monopoly on credit issuance and are a primary repository for deposits. Even more uniquely, banks are trusted by consumers at a level fintech companies are aiming for. Advantages of FinTech Given the propensity of consumers to demand ease of use, convenience, and 24-7 access, the growth of the fintech market should come as no surprise. According to McKinsey, nearly $23 billion of venture capital and growth equity has been deployed to fintech companies over the past five years, and this number is growing quickly: $12.2 billion was deployed in 2014 alone. Fintech companies came to fruition to fill the void and serve the financially disadvantaged. Now, younger, more digitally savvy consumers demand such services that are personalized, emphasize seamless, or on-demand access to an added layer of service separate from the underlying platform. And it doesn’t stop with person-to-person payments or online banking. Augmented reality, virtual chats, and big data are all going to be crucial when it comes to communicating with customers. The Blended Financial Economy The challenge for fintech startups and big bank incumbents is whether to continue to work in silos or consolidate their strengths for near term and long term prosperity. “Fintech companies have garnered a reputation for trying to unbundle the traditional banking infrastructure, but that is not always the case,” says Koeck. “Due to the better and speedier access to data Fintech companies happen to be more nimble. Smart data provides us with up-to-date knowledge about our consumers, and therefore we’re able to react quickly to their expectations. By pairing modern analytics with traditional banking, we have the potential to advance the global economy.” While it is unlikely that fintech companies will capture all financial services, such as person-to-person payments, international transfers, money management, etc., it is undeniable that they can offer traditional banking an array of valuable partnership opportunities. “The speed of financial technological innovation means that big companies and banks have to collaborate with entrepreneurs and academics to keep up with the pace of change,” said Katherine Manuel, SVP of Innovation at Thomson Reuters. “At the same time, startups and academics need the business input to scale, fund and provide relevance in highly regulated markets.” Read more about fintech growth here on Tech.Co Tags: banks, Business, Finance, finances, fintech, fintech startups, Money, Startups Did you like this article?

U.S. President Donald Trump's abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey prompted some unwinding of risky bets in early Asian trading but strategists said investors were cheered by a strong slate of corporate earnings, reflecting the cyclical rebound in the first quarter of 2017 was still in place. European stocks are set to follow Asia's example, with major indices set for a broadly flat start according to index futures. "Markets are setting aside the many policy changes seen from the Trump administration and focusing on the improvement in corporate performance and that should support sentiment," said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. With results in for the majority of the companies on the S&P 500, estimated Q1 earnings growth is now at 14.5 percent, highest since Q3 of 2011, Thomson Reuters data shows with roughly 75 pct of companies are beating analysts' expectations. Advertisement Advertisement That has helped Asia as well, with 12-month forward earnings per share for the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising to its highest level in more than three years. "Strong corporate earnings are supporting risk sentiment in the Asian equity markets, said Fan Cheuk Wan, head of investment strategy and advisory at HSBC Private Banking. MSCI's Asia ex Japan index rose 0.3 percent after posting modest gains in the previous session. It hit a two-year high last week. South Korean stocks led losers as investors took profits after liberal leader Moon Jae-in was elected president, while losses in Australia's big banks weighed on the broader market after the government levied taxes on the lenders to help balance the budget. and Chinese stocks edged higher, shrugging off news that showed April's producer price inflation cooled more than expected, with investors stepping into the market to scoop up bargains after a recent fall. Markets were also relieved when U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross signaled the Trump administration would attempt to use existing tools to aggressively enforce trade rules and insist on fairer treatment for U.S. goods, rather than adopt the slash-and-burn approach Trump promoted on the campaign trail in 2016. In currencies, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was flat at 99.435, moving away from a three-week high of 99.688. Rising U.S. yields propped up the dollar to its strongest level against the Japanese yen in two months at 114.32 in the previous session but it gave back some of those gains after Trump fired FBI Director Comey in a move that shocked Washington. It was last changing hands at 113.76 per dollar, while yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were lurking near their highest levels since end-March at 2.39 percent. But some market analysts pointed out with market volatility indicators hitting record lows - the VIX indicator fell overnight to 9.56, its lowest since late 2006 - the likelihood of a large move in financial markets has grown. "Geopolitics and the divergence of policy have not gone away," Marc Chandler, global head of FX strategy wrote in a daily note. "It is a reminder that we are often lulled into complacency just before being shocked by how treacherous things really are." Fed funds futures pricing showed investors almost universally expect the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. overnight interest rates at its next meeting, with close to a 90 percent perceived chance of an increase next month. Brent crude futures rose more than 0.5 percent to US$49.03 per barrel after Reuters reported Saudi Arabia would cut supplies to the Asia region to maintain supply to meet rising domestic demand for power during the summer months. OPEC is battling against rising U.S. output that is threatening to derail its attempts to end a sustained global glut of crude. Gold advanced modestly to US$1221.90 ounce, breaking a two-week long losing streak.

U.S. President Donald Trump's abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey prompted some unwinding of risky bets in early Asian trading but strategists said investors were cheered by a strong slate of corporate earnings, reflecting the cyclical rebound in the first quarter of 2017 was still in place. "Markets are setting aside the many policy changes seen from the Trump administration and focusing on the improvement in corporate performance and that should support sentiment," said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. With results in for the majority of the companies on the S&P 500, estimated Q1 earnings growth is now at 14.5 percent, highest since Q3 of 2011, Thomson Reuters data shows with roughly 75 pct of companies are beating analysts' expectations. That has helped Asia as well, with 12-month forward earnings per share for the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising to its highest level in more than three years. "Strong corporate earnings are supporting risk sentiment in the Asian equity markets," said Fan Cheuk Wan, head of investment strategy and advisory at HSBC Private Banking. MSCI's Asia ex Japan index was flat after posting modest gains in the previous session. It hit a two-year high last week. Korean stocks led losers as investors took profits after South Korea's liberal leader Moon Jae-in was elected president while losses in Australia's big banks weighed on the broader market after the government levied taxes on the lenders to help balance the budget. and Markets were also relieved when U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross signalled the Trump administration would attempt to use existing tools to aggressively enforce trade rules and insist on fairer treatment for U.S. goods, rather than adopt the slash-and-burn approach Trump promoted on the campaign trail in 2016. In currencies, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.2 percent to 99.424, moving away from a three-week high of 99.688. Rising U.S. yields propped up the dollar to its strongest level against the Japanese yen in two months at 114.32 in the previous session but it gave back some of those gains after Trump fired FBI Director Comey in a move that shocked Washington. It was last changing hands at 113.76 per dollar, while yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were lurking near their highest levels since end-March at 2.39 percent. But some market analysts pointed out with market volatility indicators hitting record lows -- the VIX indicator fell overnight to 9.56, its lowest since late 2006 -- the likelihood of a large move in financial markets has grown. "Geopolitics and the divergence of policy have not gone away," Marc Chandler, global head of FX strategy wrote in a daily note. "It is a reminder that we are often lulled into complacency just before being shocked by how treacherous things really are." Fed funds futures pricing showed investors almost universally expect the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. overnight interest rates at its next meeting, with close to a 90 percent perceived chance of an increase next month. Brent crude futures rose more than 0.5 percent to $49.03 per barrel after Reuters reported Saudi Arabia would cut supplies to the Asia region to maintain supply to meet rising domestic demand for power during the summer months. OPEC is battling against rising U.S. output that is threatening to derail its attempts to end a sustained global glut in crude.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Market Asia stocks rise for third day on earnings; dollar stalls on Comey sacking Asia stocks rise for third day on earnings; dollar stalls on Comey sacking Asian stocks edged higher for a third consecutive day on Wednesday as investors focused on strong corporate earnings and the dollar gave back some of its recent gains. By: Reuters | Published: May 10, 2017 11:43 AM Markets are setting aside the many policy changes seen from the Trump administration and focusing on the improvement in corporate performance and that should support sentiment. Asian stocks edged higher for a third consecutive day on Wednesday as investors focused on strong corporate earnings and the dollar gave back some of its recent gains. US President Donald Trump’s abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey prompted some unwinding of risky bets in early Asian trading but strategists said investors were cheered by a strong slate of corporate earnings, reflecting the cyclical rebound in the first quarter of 2017 was still in place. European stocks are set to follow Asia’s example, with major indices set for a broadly flat start according to index futures. “Markets are setting aside the many policy changes seen from the Trump administration and focusing on the improvement in corporate performance and that should support sentiment,” said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. With results in for the majority of the companies on the S&P 500, estimated Q1 earnings growth is now at 14.5 percent, highest since Q3 of 2011, Thomson Reuters data shows with roughly 75 pct of companies are beating analysts’ expectations. That has helped Asia as well, with 12-month forward earnings per share for the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising to its highest level in more than three years. “Strong corporate earnings are supporting risk sentiment in the Asian equity markets, said Fan Cheuk Wan, head of investment strategy and advisory at HSBC Private Banking. MSCI’s Asia ex Japan index rose 0.3 percent after posting modest gains in the previous session. It hit a two-year high last week. South Korean stocks led losers as investors took profits after liberal leader Moon Jae-in was elected president, while losses in Australia’s big banks weighed on the broader market after the government levied taxes on the lenders to help balance the budget. You may like to watch: Chinese stocks edged higher, shrugging off news that showed April’s producer price inflation cooled more than expected, with investors stepping into the market to scoop up bargains after a recent fall. Markets were also relieved when U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross signalled the Trump administration would attempt to use existing tools to aggressively enforce trade rules and insist on fairer treatment for U.S. goods, rather than adopt the slash-and-burn approach Trump promoted on the campaign trail in 2016. In currencies, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was flat at 99.435 , moving away from a three-week high of 99.688. Rising U.S. yields propped up the dollar to its strongest level against the Japanese yen in two months at 114.32 in the previous session but it gave back some of those gains after Trump fired FBI Director Comey in a move that shocked Washington. It was last changing hands at 113.76 per dollar, while yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were lurking near their highest levels since end-March at 2.39 percent. But some market analysts pointed out with market volatility indicators hitting record lows — the VIX indicator fell overnight to 9.56, its lowest since late 2006 — the likelihood of a large move in financial markets has grown. “Geopolitics and the divergence of policy have not gone away,” Marc Chandler, global head of FX strategy wrote in a daily note. “It is a reminder that we are often lulled into complacency just before being shocked by how treacherous things really are.” Fed funds futures pricing showed investors almost universally expect the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. overnight interest rates at its next meeting, with close to a 90 percent perceived chance of an increase next month. Brent crude futures rose more than 0.5 percent to $49.03 per barrel after Reuters reported Saudi Arabia would cut supplies to the Asia region to maintain supply to meet rising domestic demand for power during the summer months. OPEC is battling against rising U.S. output that is threatening to derail its attempts to end a sustained global glut of crude. Gold advanced modestly to $1221.90 ounce, breaking a two-week long losing streak. (Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Eric Meijer) No Comments.

U.S. President Donald Trump's abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey prompted some unwinding of risky bets in early Asian trading but strategists said investors were cheered by a strong slate of corporate earnings, reflecting the cyclical rebound in the first quarter of 2017 was still in place. "Markets are setting aside the many policy changes seen from the Trump administration and focusing on the improvement in corporate performance and that should support sentiment," said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. With results in for the majority of the companies on the S&P 500, estimated Q1 earnings growth is now at 14.5 percent, highest since Q3 of 2011, Thomson Reuters data shows with roughly 75 pct of companies are beating analysts' expectations. That has helped Asia as well, with 12-month forward earnings per share for the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising to its highest level in more than three years. "Strong corporate earnings are supporting risk sentiment in the Asian equity markets," said Fan Cheuk Wan, head of investment strategy and advisory at HSBC Private Banking. MSCI's Asia ex Japan index was flat after posting modest gains in the previous session. It hit a two-year high last week. Korean stocks led losers as investors took profits after South Korea's liberal leader Moon Jae-in was elected president while losses in Australia's big banks weighed on the broader market after the government levied taxes on the lenders to help balance the budget. and Markets were also relieved when U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross signalled the Trump administration would attempt to use existing tools to aggressively enforce trade rules and insist on fairer treatment for U.S. goods, rather than adopt the slash-and-burn approach Trump promoted on the campaign trail in 2016. In currencies, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.2 percent to 99.424, moving away from a three-week high of 99.688. Rising U.S. yields propped up the dollar to its strongest level against the Japanese yen in two months at 114.32 in the previous session but it gave back some of those gains after Trump fired FBI Director Comey in a move that shocked Washington. It was last changing hands at 113.76 per dollar, while yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were lurking near their highest levels since end-March at 2.39 percent. But some market analysts pointed out with market volatility indicators hitting record lows -- the VIX indicator fell overnight to 9.56, its lowest since late 2006 -- the likelihood of a large move in financial markets has grown. "Geopolitics and the divergence of policy have not gone away," Marc Chandler, global head of FX strategy wrote in a daily note. "It is a reminder that we are often lulled into complacency just before being shocked by how treacherous things really are." Fed funds futures pricing showed investors almost universally expect the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. overnight interest rates at its next meeting, with close to a 90 percent perceived chance of an increase next month. Brent crude futures rose more than 0.5 percent to $49.03 per barrel after Reuters reported Saudi Arabia would cut supplies to the Asia region to maintain supply to meet rising domestic demand for power during the summer months. OPEC is battling against rising U.S. output that is threatening to derail its attempts to end a sustained global glut in crude. Gold advanced modestly to $1221.90 ounce, breaking a two-week long losing streak.

U.S. stocks were pulled higher by energy shares, with the S&P energy index gaining 1.06 percent. Oil prices rose after Iraq and Algeria joined Saudi Arabia in supporting an extension to OPEC supply cuts and U.S. inventories fell more than expected. U.S. crude rose 3.2 percent to $47.35 per barrel and Brent was last at $50.22, up 3.06 percent on the day. Disappointing results from Dow component Walt Disney dragged on the index of 30 securities, and President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey gave equities some pause in early trading, but stocks broadly inched higher. Trump said he fired Comey, who had been leading an investigation into allegations Trump's 2016 election campaign may have colluded with Russia, over his handling of the email scandal. "The market has been unusually stable for a long period; we’ve had a long stretch of not many big moves up or down," said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. "The market has been able to absorb a lot of geopolitical news, but one of these days we’ll have a big geopolitical event and we’ll have a big reaction to that." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 32.67 points, or 0.16 percent, to end at 20,943.11, the S&P 500 gained 2.71 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,399.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.56 points, or 0.14 percent, to 6,129.14. Traders said Comey's firing could lead to serious complications for the administration, but without a "smoking gun" the fallout would likely be limited. The worry, they said, was that the issue could add yet another obstacle to Trump's promised reflationary tax reform and stimulus plans. "We were not expecting to see a quick succession of moving towards the administration's agenda, and this certainly is not reducing that contentious environment," said Eric Wiegand, a New York-based senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom. The U.S. VIX index was just a hair above its lowest since 2006 touched on Tuesday. A weak 10-year note auction sank demand for U.S. Treasuries, offsetting concerns about Comey's ouster from the FBI to leave yields little moved on the day. Investors also took note of Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren's comments that the Fed should hike U.S. overnight interest rates three more times this year and start reducing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The dollar benefited from Treasury yields paring losses and reversed an early fall against safe-haven currencies JPY=. The dollar was last 0.25 percent higher against the Japanese yen, touching an eight-week high. The greenback also erased losses against the safe-haven Swiss franc, and was last up 0.2 percent. Gold fell 0.15 percent to $1,219 an ounce. European full-year earnings forecasts, set to be their best since 2010, and centrist Emmanuel Macron's victory in France's presidential election over the weekend have steadied European bourses so far this week. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.19 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.14 percent. Greek 10-year yields on Wednesday fell to their lowest since the country's debt was restructured in 2012. Greek stocks rose for a 12th straight session, the longest streak since 1991, as Athens looked set to clinch vital bailout loans.

U.S. President Donald Trump's abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey prompted some unwinding of risky bets in early Asian trading but strategists said investors were cheered by a strong slate of corporate earnings, reflecting the cyclical rebound in the first quarter of 2017 was still in place. "Markets are setting aside the many policy changes seen from the Trump administration and focusing on the improvement in corporate performance and that should support sentiment," said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. With results in for the majority of the companies on the S&P 500, estimated Q1 earnings growth is now at 14.5 percent, highest since Q3 of 2011, Thomson Reuters data shows with roughly 75 pct of companies are beating analysts' expectations. That has helped Asia as well, with 12-month forward earnings per share for the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising to its highest level in more than three years. "Strong corporate earnings are supporting risk sentiment in the Asian equity markets," said Fan Cheuk Wan, head of investment strategy and advisory at HSBC Private Banking. MSCI's Asia ex Japan index was flat after posting modest gains in the previous session. It hit a two-year high last week. Korean stocks led losers as investors took profits after South Korea's liberal leader Moon Jae-in was elected president while losses in Australia's big banks weighed on the broader market after the government levied taxes on the lenders to help balance the budget. and Markets were also relieved when U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross signalled the Trump administration would attempt to use existing tools to aggressively enforce trade rules and insist on fairer treatment for U.S. goods, rather than adopt the slash-and-burn approach Trump promoted on the campaign trail in 2016. In currencies, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.2 percent to 99.424, moving away from a three-week high of 99.688. Rising U.S. yields propped up the dollar to its strongest level against the Japanese yen in two months at 114.32 in the previous session but it gave back some of those gains after Trump fired FBI Director Comey in a move that shocked Washington. It was last changing hands at 113.76 per dollar, while yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were lurking near their highest levels since end-March at 2.39 percent. But some market analysts pointed out with market volatility indicators hitting record lows -- the VIX indicator fell overnight to 9.56, its lowest since late 2006 -- the likelihood of a large move in financial markets has grown. "Geopolitics and the divergence of policy have not gone away," Marc Chandler, global head of FX strategy wrote in a daily note. "It is a reminder that we are often lulled into complacency just before being shocked by how treacherous things really are." Fed funds futures pricing showed investors almost universally expect the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. overnight interest rates at its next meeting, with close to a 90 percent perceived chance of an increase next month. Brent crude futures rose more than 0.5 percent to $49.03 per barrel after Reuters reported Saudi Arabia would cut supplies to the Asia region to maintain supply to meet rising domestic demand for power during the summer months. OPEC is battling against rising U.S. output that is threatening to derail its attempts to end a sustained global glut in crude. Gold advanced modestly to $1221.90 ounce, breaking a two-week long losing streak. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

Rodger Mallison Star-Telegram archives Business May 08, 2017 5:18 PM Want to work at Lockheed? Center offers training to prepare workers By Max B. Baker maxbaker@star-telegram.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story FORT WORTH Kinsey Williams can’t wait to start his new job, which he hopes will morph into a career. Just a few months ago, the 16-year Army National Guard sergeant who served in Iraq and Kuwait was struggling to get the kind of job he wanted with only a high school diploma. Then Williams discovered the Community Learning Center. After six weeks of training, and graduating at the top of his class, he’ll begin working at Lockheed Martin next week applying stealth coating to F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. “It means the world to me,” Williams, 33, said about the training he received. He said the instructors and staff “changed his life forever.” Williams’ success story was celebrated Monday as J.P. Morgan Chase announced a $500,000 donation to help the learning center expand its efforts to provide local industry with the technically-savvy workforce it needs. The funds will support skills training in high-growth, high-demand occupations, especially aerospace and advanced manufacturing, Chase officials said during a presentation at the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers hall near the gates of Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth plant. “This partnership gives us an opportunity to help more people seize the opportunities available for a good-paying job,” said Todd Ritterbusch, managing director and market executive for Chase in Tarrant County, in a statement. “Together we can help close the opportunity gap in our region.” The grant is part of $2 million that the bank will spend on workforce development in Tarrant County, a company spokesman said. That’s part of Chase’s $250 million New Skills at Work commitment to address the global skills gap. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:19 A peek at American Airlines new headquarters Pause 1:57 First F-35 for Japan 0:30 Shake Shack's Mark Rosati talks up Ode to Texas barbecue 18:34 Take a tour of the Main St. Arts Festival 3:02 An awesome Christmas light show from Euless Fire Department 0:31 Tarrant County's 10 Most Wanted Criminals, May 10 0:26 Driver dead after crashing into traffic signal pole 0:43 Thieves posing as water dept. employees trick an elderly woman and steal from her 1:09 Dallas to Houston in 90 minutes?

(Star-Telegram/Rodger Mallison) rmallison@star-telegram.com The donation will have a huge impact in the community, helping many people get high-paying, higher-skilled jobs, said Pat Lane, president and chair of the learning center, a nonprofit that works with major employers like Lockheed, Bell Helicopter and others. U.S. Reps. Kay Granger and Marc Veasey and Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price were on hand Monday to sing the praises of the learning center and its crucial role in ensuring that the area has a local workforce that’s prepared for the future. For example, Lockheed Martin plans to hire 1,800 additional employees in Fort Worth as it boosts production of the F-35. The Fort Worth plant employs 14,000 workers, including about 8,800 on the F-35, and hiring is expected to begin later this year and stretch through 2020. Veasey said the days when you could find a good-paying job “working the line” with limited technical knowledge are long gone and that workers need to be able to operate complex manufacturing systems and trouble-shoot robotic parts. The Fort Worth Democrat said that while nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs will need to be filled over the next decade, the “skills gap” is expected to leave 2 million of those jobs unfilled. “While we have made strides in helping match the technical knowledge of workers with the needs of employers, we still have a long way to go,” Veasey said. Related stories from the Star-Telegram Toyota, TCC partner on training program for car service technicians Since opening its doors in 2000, the learning center has provided academic remediation and workforce training to more than 5,000 workers. The center has two facilities, one outside the gates of Lockheed Martin on Clifford Street focused on aerospace-industry needs and a second in Forest Hill on Anglin Drive that concentrates on machining, welding, and construction building trades. The learning center is in the midst of an $882,000 capital campaign to renovate the Forest Hill structure and has already raised about 60 percent of its goal, said Angela Traiforos, the executive director. Williams said he’s always been good at fixing things. But his sharpened skills helped him earn the Lockheed Martin job, an entry-level position that pays $20.68 an hour, or about $43,000 a year. “Eventually, I want to be an aerospace engineer and I would be hard-pressed to do it — if not impossible — without the program,” Williams said.

Premier Li Keqiang told a meeting of more than 100 top executives in Beijing last month the government was rethinking a 2015 policy capping their pay at a fraction of their overseas peers, said the person, who asked not to be named because the meeting was private. Li promised a system with more competitive rates, probably tied to performance, the person said, in an effort to hold onto their managers. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day.

Sign Up The discussions show the challenges facing President Xi Jinping as he pushes China’s almost $20 trillion state sector to embrace structural reform while cracking down on perceived excesses that have fueled public anger at the Communist Party. While the cap saw the earnings of China Construction Bank Corp. Chairman Wang Hongzhang halve to 600,000 yuan ($87,000) in 2015, the salaries of some overseas executives have stayed high: JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon received  $28 million last year. The stakes are high as Xi seeks to prove his stewardship of the economy ahead of a midterm party leadership reshuffle later this year, which will determine the strength of his influence going forward. The party has sought to reorganize the state sector without so many layoffs it leads to unrest. ‘Uneven’ Reforms China is set to kick off another round of state-enterprise reform, with as many as 10 companies preparing proposals to sell stakes in their units, people with knowledge of the plans have separately said. Still, while China quickly reined in executive pay under Xi, efforts to force consolidation and increase profitability among state companies have progressed slowly. International Monetary Fund First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton last year recommended China establish a special to group to oversee “uneven” state-enterprise reforms. “The depressing pace of the state-sector reform process reflects a wider belief that the current SOE-compensation system is unsustainable,” said Zhu Weiqun, an administration professor at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. “It is obvious to even the most cursory observer that the pay cut was a hasty decision and it’s good to fix it earlier than never.” Neither the State Council, which is led by Li, nor the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission immediately responded to faxed requests for comment. Although executives at state companies, who ultimately answer to Xi’s party, have publicly supported the compensation caps, there have been signs of strain. For instance, Chim Wai Kin, the former chief credit officer of Bank of China Ltd., left his job in 2015 amid pay cuts being imposed on senior managers at Chinese lenders. Such departures risk draining companies of the talent Xi needs to enact a 2015 plan that aims to group similar state-owned companies under asset managers. That plan calls for selling shares of some and consolidating others, reforming unproductive “zombie enterprises” and introducing private capital. Less Efficient SOEs still account for about 30 percent of China’s industrial output and investment and remain the dominant borrowers in the country’s financial markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists including M.K. Tang in Hong Kong wrote in August. Better access to state funds helps them crowd out competitors, while returning an average of just 4 percent on assets, or less than half their private peers. Andrew Batson, China research director for Gavekal Dragonomics, said he was skeptical of the government’s commitment to reform because its goals differ from what most Western investors have in mind. “Reform of state enterprises has been slow in China because the current government is not fundamentally interested in market-oriented reforms to the state sector,” said Batson, who authored a March report on the state-sector overhaul. “Instead, the government is interested in making state-owned enterprises more effective instruments of state policy and projectors of Chinese influence abroad.” ‘Special Phase’ Former China Petrochemical Corp. Chairman Fu Chengyu told Bloomberg News in March that centralized leadership was needed to steer the country through the reform effort. “China is in a special phase,” said Fu, who led an effort to reform Asia’s largest oil refiner, better known as Sinopec, from 2011 to 2015. “If we don’t have a strong effort like the current government of President Xi Jinping, I think eventually we will break up politically and economically.” While China’s state media covered Li’s April 27 meeting promoting innovation by SOEs, reports made no mention of compensation. Executives from companies including China Mobile Ltd., China Merchants Bank Co. and Potevio Group attended with Li, who also toured the offices of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp., according to the official Xinhua News Agency.   The party congress provides Xi’s next big chance to underscore reform goals. Fu -- now a member of the government’s top advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference -- proposed in March giving SOE executives more leeway to make mistakes while experimenting with reform. China must develop a “system that accepts failure,” he said. “The real enemy to reform is here," Fu said, tapping at his head. “It’s our culture, our mindset.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Dimon told in NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “Of course, regulators should look at something like this. It’s their job. We are totally open kimono with regulators. And they will come to their own conclusion and we intend to fix it, learn from it and be a better company when it’s done.” I am interested in the phrase, “We are totally open kimono with regulators” as I understand ‘Kimono’ is Japanese equivalent to dress. Is “Open kimono with somebody” a popular English (or American) idiom or phrase? Can I say “open dress with somebody” instead of using “Kimono”? If not, what are alternative idioms meaning “open up one’s mind”? idioms share|improve this question edited May 15 '12 at 12:01 JLG 20.3k12973 asked May 15 '12 at 4:52 Yoichi Oishi♦ 32.9k80300647 3   Two things: 1. I would more likely translate kimono as robe not dress. 2. The meaning is not "to open one's mind" it is to "bare all"- keep no secrets. A more popular expression might be "we are an open book" – Jim May 15 '12 at 5:08      @Jim. Kenkyusha’s English Japanese Dictionary, the most popular English Japanese dictionary in Japan defines ‘kimono’ as clothes, dress, and clothing in old style expression. Precisely, kimono is classic Japanese costume worn by people roughly before mid-20 century. We distinguish ‘Kimono - 着物’ from ‘Yohuku - 洋服’ literally meaning western clothes and dress. Today Kimono is worn at special occasions of celebration like wedding, and Adult Day and sorrow like funeral, or at home for a relaxation purpose. – Yoichi Oishi♦ May 15 '12 at 6:41 3   I see, you are using dress not as 'a piece of women's clothing' but as 'a manner/style of clothing' I also expect that when westerners say "open kimono" they are not making the subtle distinctions that you are. They merely mean an article of clothing that typically is wrapped around the body and held with a sash or tie such that it can fall open if the sash is removed- much like a robe- because they want to conjure the image of someone standing with their robe open. – Jim May 15 '12 at 6:53 4   Never heard such a thing in my life. – tchrist♦ May 15 '12 at 12:04 3   It's an inappropriate and sexist expression that some businessmen like. I wouldn't copy it! – Lembik Jul 9 '15 at 6:02  |  show 1 more comment 6 Answers 6 active oldest votes up vote 5 down vote accepted To open the kimono to someone is a bit of business argot. It is figurative, meaning to give away or be open about a few secrets to entice the buyer and encourage a deal to go forward. In a pitch to an possible investor, the inventor doesn't want to give a way the 'secret sauce' (the important idea behind the invention because the investor might still the idea. But the inventor has to show -something- that will entice them to prove that there is something there that is worthwhile. So the inventor will give some few details that will be convincing. The metaphor is in reference to a geisha flashing open her robe to a client to engage his interest. Americans (where the phrase presumably originated) are only familiar with the kimono as something worn by geishas and have no idea of the associations (or lack thereof) it has natively. 'Open kimono' is a derivative of this and has come to mean 'to show the innerworkings', less a sneak peak but rather full access. In the OP phrase we are totally open kimono with regulators, the speaker was just trying to get across that they won't be hiding anything from the regulators. The grammar of 'open kimono' is a bit informal by converting a 'verb noun' pattern to an 'adj-noun' (essentially nouning a verb). Using it as an adjective is even more familiar: we are X with you where X is an adjective is not formal or standard English, but is very colloquial (that is, not good for writing, but works in speech). It is not common in general but is recognized in the business world. share|improve this answer edited May 15 '12 at 20:57 James Waldby - jwpat7 60.6k1081169 answered May 15 '12 at 13:20 Mitch 40.8k1378174      Does your answer imply that they are only trying to create the impression that they are "open" with regulators? Because if you only flash open your robe, it'll be closed again in no time... – Raku May 15 '12 at 14:45      The original phrase, not what Jamie Dimon used, is about giving a sneak peek, opening and closing quickly, of something good. I think that what Jamie Dimon said is misused and trying to give the impression that they are totally open with the regulators, unfettered access. – Mitch May 15 '12 at 15:17      True. ‘Verb (be) + adjective + objective (noun)’ construction of “We are open kimono with regulators” looked ungrammatical to me. So I deleted ‘are’ from my question. However, I’m not sure if ‘open kimono to sb.’ like ‘the inventer fully opened kimono to investors’ passes as a financial business jargon or not. – Yoichi Oishi♦ May 15 '12 at 20:10      @YoichiOishi: To get the pattern, it would be: ‘the inventor fully opened the kimono to investors’. And that would work as business speak. – Mitch May 15 '12 at 21:52 add a comment |  up vote 10 down vote Open the kimono or flash the kimono is reasonably common in US financial use – meaning to show everything. To Americans and most westerners, a kimono is a robe (BE dressing gown) so the assumption is that you are naked underneath. I don't think it's very common among 'normal' people. share|improve this answer edited May 15 '12 at 21:59 answered May 15 '12 at 4:55 mgb 20.6k23280      I don't know too many Americans who use dressing gown- we usually just say robe. – Jim May 15 '12 at 5:13      @jim - thanks added the translation – mgb May 15 '12 at 15:12      I first heard this expression perhaps 1980-1985, from a middle-level manager where I worked (IBM). At that time the implied meaning was "bare all", and there was no implication of, say, being less than honest with regard to this act. Heard the expression only occasionally after that -- it never was common in our circles -- but I have not heard it at all since maybe 2000. – Hot Licks yesterday add a comment |  up vote 3 down vote I think it is a widely-understood phrase in business, but perhaps a little pretentious. You certainly wouldn't translate 'kimono' into its English equivalent. share|improve this answer answered May 15 '12 at 8:48 Philip Jones 19814 2   I wouldn't call it pretentious but rather vulgar. – H Stephen Straight May 16 '12 at 2:11 2   @HStephenStraight I'd probably call it pretentious, vulgar, and probably sexist and racist, and quite a few other unprintable things! – Andrew Grimm Jun 19 '12 at 2:40 add a comment |  up vote 2 down vote When trying to understand what a word means in English, using a Japanese/English dictionary may not be the best approach. Instead, use an English/English dictionary. For example, "sake" in English means rice wine (nihonshu), whereas in Japanese it can mean alcoholic beverages in general. As mentioned by Jim, "kimono" seems to have a different meaning from Japanese's "kimono" (which would literally translate as ki + mono, "wearing thing"). Some westerners believe that women don't wear any underwear underneath a kimono. For example, the author of TV Tropes' page on kimono fanservice. I don't know if this was believed by the users of this idiom, though. share|improve this answer answered Jun 18 '12 at 8:41 Andrew Grimm 9,0581463117 1   If some westerners believe women in kimono don’t wear underwear underneath kimono, it’s a great misunderstanding. Even in Meiji (1968 -1912) era when Japanese started to wear洋服(western style clothes), women wore腰巻 (literally, waist wrapper), which is bottomless, as an underwear. Off course today’s women wear pantie underneath kimono. In Japanese, we have the phrase, 前をはだけるmeaning “open the front part of kimono (by loosening Obi – belt).” But it means simply slovenly dressed appearance, and has no sense of disclosure. – Yoichi Oishi♦ Jun 19 '12 at 2:30 add a comment |  up vote 1 down vote It's quite common in my industry, software development. Companies, especially US based ones such as Microsoft, like to use it to state that they are now being very open about their processes, software and internal systems. share|improve this answer answered Jun 18 '12 at 9:49 Joe Fawcett 48126 add a comment |  up vote 0 down vote The alternative is "fully disclose". Today on a meeting I heard: We can be open kimono with XYZ consulting company. In this sentence it meant that we will fully disclose the situation including all the identified issues and potential problems since XYZ has shown a predisposition to work with us and is somewhat sympathetic to us. However, we will ask them not to disclose all this to our client since we wish to package (not reveal all) to the client. As an American, I understood immediately what this meant although I never heard it before. I immediately found it shocking and sexist because I (incorrectly) associate kimono with prostitution and I pictured our company as a prostitute revealing her nude self to the consulting company. Just not good! I mentioned this phrase to my wife, who is from a South American country and she also immediately understood it and found it fascinatingly in bad taste. share|improve this answer edited yesterday answered yesterday user235347 11 add a comment |  Your Answer   draft saved draft discarded Sign up or log in Sign up using Google Sign up using Facebook Sign up using Email and Password Post as a guest Name Email Post as a guest Name Email discard By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.
