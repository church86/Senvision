But the company's ability to do high volume, value-added manufacturing at a reasonable cost may cushion it from any potential slowdown in demand for iPhones in the long term, a JPMorgan analyst told CNBC. It is expected to assemble the bulk of Apple's newest smartphones due later this year, and may benefit from a supercycle. "Hon Hai, at the end of the day, is a process company," said Gokul Hariharan, Asia tech analyst and head of Taiwan equity research at JPMorgan. "If you look at the history of Hon Hai over the last 20 years, product cycle has not really mattered as much." Sean Gallup | Getty Images He explained the company has always tried to run a vertically integrated business model, where it started with connectors and other components business before going into assembly in mid-to-late 90s. First Hon Hai assembled desktops when they were still the main tech product; then it moved into game consoles, feature phones with Motorola and Nokia, and music players for Apple before moving onto smartphones. "So all along, the skill set they're providing is high volume manufacturing at a very reasonable cost and very strong execution," Hariharan said, adding the manufacturer also brings in a fair bit of technology elements into its offering. "Which is why it feels like it may not be very directly linked to product cycles in the long term." Along the way, Hon Hai added some components businesses to their operations in an attempt to maximize the value, in terms of dollar content, within any product they assemble, according to Hariharan. Last year's acquisition of troubled Japanese electronics maker Sharp meant Hon Hai now had access to two major components of a smartphone: camera modules and display. These two functionalities are usually expected to be upgraded by smartphone vendors, even when other features of handsets may remain the same. "If you look at most tech products, display is typically one of the largest cost items in terms of components," Hariharan said. Japanese business daily Nikkei reported in January that Hon Hai and Sharp were mulling over building a factory in China — where the iPhones are assembled — to make OLED display panels. The proximity could theoretically reduce components cost for making the iPhone. The next generation of iPhones are expected to come with OLED display and currently Samsung Display will provide the bulk of these panels for Apple. show chapters Cramer: iPhone 8 cycle will be a big one    Monday, 22 May 2017 | 9:16 AM ET | 01:49 Reuters reported that Hon Hai and Sharp have teamed up to bid for Toshiba's prized memory chip business. Hariharan said a potential move into the semiconductor business was underpinned by the fact that Hon Hai made close to 20 to 25 percent in revenue from enterprise and cloud; the company assembles servers, storage elements and switches for tech companies and enterprise is a big driver for NAND flash, he added. The other two major contract electronics manufacturers that assemble iPhones — Pegatron and Wistron — also remain exposed to Apple, at least in the short term. Wistron is a latecomer to the assembly equation and handles mostly the older iPhones. Hariharan said JPMorgan has a conservative view on Wistron because the company is still making the transition from producing lower-end handsets to the most advanced; it needs to build up capacity to handle the high volume seen in the first quarter of new iPhone launches, where Apple can sell more than 10 million units on the opening weekend. "If you're not a vendor who is able to support that volume ramp in that period, then you never get peak volume for your capacity," he said. Meanwhile, some of Apple's more specialized suppliers — who provide components such as camera modules — remain well-hedged in their business because they serve the global smartphone market — meaning, they were also selling into other smartphone brands. For example Samsung or SK Hynix supply memory to majority of the smartphone brands. "They don't have the same level of cyclicality," said Hariharan, but they don't enjoy the same benefits from a surge in demand for iPhones. "They won't have the same upside when you have a very strong iPhone cycle, in terms of their revenues and profits." show chapters Apple, Samsung lose market share to Chinese phone makers    Tuesday, 23 May 2017 | 4:25 PM ET | 01:03 For the moment, Hariharan expects the dynamics between Apple and its suppliers to remain in the short term: this means iPhone assemblers like Hon Hai, Pegatron and Wistron will stay exposed to the iPhone product cycle and their revenues will swing accordingly. But in the longer term, if smartphones are replaced by something bigger, Hariharan said a company with a vertically integrated business model such as Hon Hai could be the partner of choice to assemble it. JPMorgan's price target for Hon Hai by year-end is NT$112 ($3.72). On Wednesday morning at 10:40 a.m. HK/SIN, Hon Hai shares traded at NT$104.

But his view that not all is well on the ASX is not. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link In April average cash holdings overtook consumer discretionary stocks as the largest active position held by fund managers across any ASX sector. Photo: AFR While none have so far followed his lead in publicly quitting the market, many in Australia's professional investment community appear to be quietly preparing for a downturn.  According to the JPMorgan Fund Manager Radar, which assesses the public disclosures of major fund managers to deduce common themes, average cash holdings surged to 370 basis points in April, overtaking consumer discretionary stocks as the largest active position held by fund managers across any ASX sector. This follows several months of increasing cash allocations. "We do see the appeal [of cash] in a market where opportunities look increasingly constrained due to extended valuations (healthcare, industrials), structural concerns (banks, resources, retail) and style/franking limitations (REITS)," wrote JPMorgan equity strategist Jason Steed, adding he believed cash allocations could rise further. Advertisement Mr Parker, a 30-year veteran of funds management, said he was cashing out and returning "hundreds of millions" in client money because he believed the overheated east-coast property market, a Chinese debt bubble and overvalued equity markets would combine to spell "calamity" for Australian equity investors. "We think that there is too much risk in this market at the moment, we think it's crazy," he said. "Giving up management and performance fees and handing back cash from investments managed by us is a seminal decision, however, preserving clients' assets is what all fund managers should always put before their own interests." Veteran fund manager Geoff Wilson, of Wilson's Asset Management, didn't quibble with Mr Parker's assessment that the market was heading for some kind of downturn.  On the ASX – which has suffered a bad month, with the S&P/ASX 200 down more than 4 per cent and the big four banks on track for the worst May in 44 years – Wilson said: "It's going to be a tough period. And that's with the backdrop of the biggest global market in the very mature stages of a bull market," he added, referring to Wall Street's record-breaking run. Bennelong Australian Equity Partners' investment director Julian Beaumont was more sanguine, saying while the increasing allocation to cash holdings shows concern is building among fund managers, the level of systemic risk is being overstated. "The risks aren't that bad," he said. "We've always had these risks. [Mr Parker] talks to getting out of equities from the point of view that property looks over-bought. But what's the real relevance of that? A company like Woolworths, or CSL, or Telstra, isn't reliant on the property market. You should still be able to find opportunities. "Since the GFC, the worse the economy has looked, the more quantitative easing was required, the more the market has gone up ... it's not always the case that stockmarket returns will correlate with the economic picture. "We do believe there are some real risks in a large part of the economy, and we're positioning to avoid them." Defensive stance But both fund managers, assessments of risk aside, believed a falling market was no reason to give up on making returns for their investors.  BAEP is favouring sectors that are growing defensively, such as healthcare or everyday consumer products, plus Australian companies whose products are doing well overseas.  As for May's underperformance, "it's the top end that's really suffered", Mr Beaumont said, with the ASX 20 by far the worst performer. "We're certainly not throwing our hands up. We're actually finding some good opportunities. In fact, valuations look quite attractive in certain parts of the market, especially outside the large caps." Mr Wilson, whose main large-cap equity fund is holding 30 per cent cash, believed even if things did worsen as drastically as Mr Parker expected, any downturn would provide an "exciting" opportunity to make some serious money. "People deciding to get their money back, well, that's their choice. But as a professional fund manager, everyone at Wilson spends all day trying to make money. That's the case in cheap markets and in expensive markets."  Mr Wilson added it was his belief that times when equities looked stretched were the best for fund managers to raise money. That's because a crash, when it comes, offers fantastic opportunities to buy companies trading at steep discounts. "Significant market adjustments – whether it's the 1987 crash, the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 or the global financial crisis – they create phenomenal opportunities for astute investors. "Those three events were to me once-in-a-lifetime events where we could buy companies at, say, 50 per cent discounts to their cash backing." Anyway, he added, if you're going to sell out, knowing when to do so is a fraught business. "The thing is, you can never pick the top or the bottom of the market," he said, before wryly noting the market's tendency to confound expectations. "The fact that everyone's negative means it'll probably keep going up in the short term." Advertisement HuffPost Australia Drug Testing Of Welfare Clients Found ...

However, with innovative entrepreneurs making moves and an economy that is ready to reclaim its former glory, the Motor City is poised for an impressive resurgence. And if you need some convincing, JPMorgan Chase as 150 million reasons to believe in this Michigan gem. In tandem with Detroit Startup Week powered by Chase for Business, JPMorgan Chase has announced they will be increasing their initial investment in the economic recovery of Detroit to $150 million by 2019. This announcement comes after the original $100 million, five-year investment turned out to be two years ahead of schedule. Pretty impressive for a place once known as the largest US city to ever declare of bankruptcy. “Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase, in a press release. “This collaboration allowed us to speed up our investment and extend our commitment over the next two years. Going forward, I hope business, government and nonprofit leaders will see Detroit’s comeback as a shining example of how to put aside differences and work to find meaningful and innovative solutions to our most pressing economic problems.” The goal of this investment is to build upon the city’s progress, create livable, inclusive, and sustainable neighborhoods, arm residents with the skills needed for high-quality, well-paying careers, and provide small businesses with the capital they need to succeed. JPMorgan Chase has invested $107 million in loans and grants in Detroit’s economic recovery, including $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small business expansion, and $6.9 million in additional transformative investments. “JPMorgan Chase has been a true partner in our work to restore economic growth and opportunity in Detroit,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. “The firm’s investments have enabled thousands of Detroiters to receive training, created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and revitalized neighborhoods. There is more work to do, and I hope our continued partnership will build a thriving economy for all Detroiters.” Economic challenges are no stranger to Detroit. But this investment, along with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Motor City, is another step in the right direction. It will utilize everything in Chase’s arsenal to strengthen underlying organizations and create system-wide changes that will improve citywide workforce development strategy. Before you know it, this Michigan city will be the thriving economy we all know and love.

Big Bank Stocks Could Be Heading Higher. Despite the recent pain, Credit Suisse analysts continue to see double-digit returns universal bank stocks. By Ben Levisohn May 30, 2017 3:37 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Bank stocks like Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Bank of America (BAC) entered 2017 on a rather remarkable run, but since then they have underperformed: The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) has dropped 4.9% so far this year. Illustration: Getty Images A combination of factors, including a still slow growing U.S. economy, the failure of the Trump administration to pass its growth-boosting measures, and the flattening of the yield curve have caused banks to underperform in 2017. Still, Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke and team remain bullish on so-called "universal banks," particularly Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. They explain why: ~10-15% upside in recommended names; expect volatility. Given the speed and magnitude of the post-election outperformance, it’s fair to anticipate a good bit of volatility in the stocks—typical at this point in the economic cycle, but also reflective of heightened policy uncertainty (tax reform, regulatory reform, fiscal stimulus plans). We will continue to assess valuations cognizant of the economic cycle, but equally as willing to embrace the changed/changing operating environment. All in, our base case estimates translate to 11% year to year EPS growth and a 13% ROTCE, on average in 2017, with substantial variance around the averages. Our blue sky estimates are ~25% above base case, with near equal incremental upside in the stocks. Looking at a weighted average of our blue sky, base case and gray sky scenarios translates to ~10-15% total return in our recommended names—BAC, JPM, C and GS. We strongly favor the universal banking model, with its multiple levers for growth and greater potential for realization of scale economies. Shares of Bank of America have fallen 1.4% to $22.90 at 3:30 p.m. today, while JPMorgan Chase has dropped 1.6% to $83.96, Citigroup has declined 0.6% to $61.72, and Goldman Sachs has tumbled 2% to $218.3.7 Text Size Regular Medium Large Stocks Ben Levisohn ben.levisohn@barrons.com • @Ben_levisohn PREVIOUS No, Electric Cars Won't Kill Oil Stocks...At Least Not All of Them NEXT Signet Jewelers: Pricing in 'Draconian' Downside?

But JPMorgan global equity strategists said they expect UK stocks to claw back some of their underperformance against eurozone and global peers and recommended investors buy into blue-chip, dividend-paying exporters that stand to benefit the most from a weak sterling. "We think UK is becoming interesting in the regional allocation again," JPMorgan's strategists said, adding that signs that investors have turned less risk-averse since early May also bodes well for London-listed stocks. "(The) UK is a defensive market with high dividend yield. It should perform better in the backdrop of potential softening in activity indicators, lower inflation prints and continued range-bound bond yields," JPMorgan said. In Ireland, the ISEQ Overall Index ended the session in positive territory, unlike many of its European peers. It closed up 0.34pc at 6.995.83. Shares in Ryanair surged 3.7pc to €18.42 as the airline reported full-year results and CEO Michael O'Leary said the carrier will extend leases and buy a handful of extra planes from Boeing to meet demand next summer. The carrier also launched a €600m share buyback. Shares in food group Aryzta tumbled nearly 9pc as it reported third quarter results that showed its margins remain under pressure. Bank of Ireland was 2.5pc lower at 24 cent, while betting group Paddy Power Betfair also fell 2.5pc, to €93.02. The UK's FTSE-100 edged 0.28pc lower. France's CAC-40 was down 0.5pc and Germany's DAX retreated 0.2pc.

Sun-Sentinel A stranded traveler checks flight information May 9 at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport, where Spirit had canceled flights due to a labor dispute. Repeated cancellations by Spirit led to a melee among travelers this month. JOE CAVARETTA (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) Sun-Sentinel Business May 29, 2017 9:55 PM The route to air-travel discomfort starts on Wall Street By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When an unlucky passenger was violently dragged off a full United Airlines flight in Chicago in April, setting off a public-relations nightmare for the company, the blame naturally fell on the cabin crew, police and eventually airline executives. But ultimately, the episode was set in motion elsewhere – on Wall Street. Relentless pressure on corporate America is creating an increasingly Dickensian experience for many consumers as companies focus on maximizing profit. And nowhere is the trend as stark as in the airline industry, whose service is delivered in an aluminum tube packed with up to four different classes, cheek by jowl, 35,000 feet in the air. “There’s always been pressure from Wall Street,” said Robert L. Dilenschneider, a veteran public relations executive who advises companies and chief executives on strategic communications. “But I’ve been watching this for 30 years, and it’s never been as intense as it is today.” Rich bonus packages for top executives are now largely tied to short-term income targets and fatter profit margins instead of customer service. Of course, bolstering profits – and in turn, stock prices – has always been a big part of management’s responsibility to shareholders, but making it virtually the only criterion for executive pay is new. Five years ago, American Airlines factored in on-time arrivals, lost baggage and consumer complaints to help calculate annual incentive payments for top management. Today, these bonuses are based exclusively on the company’s pretax income and cost savings. United has also scaled back bonuses linked to reliability and customer satisfaction for senior executives in recent years. But in the wake of what happened in April, bonuses “will be made more comprehensively subject to progress in 2017 on significant improvement in the customer experience,” the company said in a financial filing. “Fifteen years ago, airlines competed with each other over who could buy the most planes or have the most routes,” said Jamie Baker, a top airline industry analyst at JPMorgan Chase. “Executives are just as competitive today, but it’s about who can achieve an investment-grade rating first, who can be a component in the S&P 500, and who has better returns for investors.” These new incentives also partly explain why airlines are packing seats more densely and squeezing more passengers into the back of the plane. “Densification is driven by the desire to sweat the assets and generate revenues without having to commit capital to building new planes,” Baker said. Such a shift isn’t unique to the airline industry. “As in other industries, like manufacturing or consumer goods, the focus is on more traditional financial metrics like pretax income, margins, return on capital and total shareholder return,” said Andrew Goldstein, head of the executive compensation practice in North America for Willis Towers Watson. “Airlines haven’t abandoned operational and customer-service metrics, but they are putting less emphasis on those factors.” With the economy growing at a rate of only 2 percent while the stock market rallies on promises of soaring earnings, something must give so profit margins can grow. In the case of United or Spirit Airlines, whose repeated cancellations led to a melee among travelers this month at a terminal in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, it was customer service. At other companies, like Ford and Alcoa, it was the head of the chief executive that was served up when profits failed to meet expectations. Mature industries – where double-digit annual profit growth is a reach in the best of times – are especially vulnerable to activist investors’ demands for board seats, bigger stock repurchases and other short-term financial rewards. The pressure is especially brutal in the airline industry because the key expense, fuel, is for the most part beyond management control. Yet airline executives have largely convinced Wall Street that the bad old days of bankruptcies and fare wars are over, replaced by the kind of predictable annual profits more common among industrial companies. That’s among the reasons fees have popped up in recent years for everything from checking bags to securing an assigned seat before boarding. Known on Wall Street as ancillary revenue, this stream of income is especially favored by investors because it doesn’t swing sharply the way fares do. And so far, despite occasional bouts of air rage and frequent consumer complaints, Wall Street has been getting what it wants. United’s stock has surged to more than $80 per share from $25 per share five years ago, with profit margins rising to 13.6 percent from 3.7 percent over the same period. Overall industry margins hit 16.3 percent, up from 5.2 percent in 2012. Spirit’s operating margins are among the highest in the industry, topping 20 percent in 2015 and 2016. But Paul Berry, a company spokesman, said Spirit had pivoted to focus more on customer service in the last year, even as some larger rivals keep cutting costs to compete. Despite rewarding top executives strictly according to financial targets, American said it, too, was committed to improving the passenger experience. “Every single person at American knows we succeed or fail based on how well we serve customers,” said Joshua Freed, a company spokesman. “We will only meet those financial goals if we keep our customers happy.” Still, the promise of steady profit growth has prompted even Warren E. Buffett to take a fresh look at airline stocks. He once famously called the industry a money-losing “death trap,” but reversed course late last year, with his company, Berkshire Hathaway, acquiring stakes in several airlines. “In the past, airline stocks were seen as hazardous to one’s wealth,” said Baker, the JPMorgan analyst. “They were trading vehicles, and potential destroyers of capital.” To be sure, some industry veterans insist it is a mistake to simply blame investors or hedge-fund managers for fostering a race to the bottom in customer service. “The response isn’t to Wall Street. It’s to customer behavior,” said Alex Dichter, a senior partner at McKinsey who works with major airlines. “About 35 percent of customers are choosing on price, and price alone, and another 35 percent choose mostly on price.” Dichter noted that when American added 2-4 inches of legroom in coach in the early 2000s, “as far as I know, the airline didn’t see one bit of improvement in market share or pricing.” “The great irony is that most CEOs would love to compete on product and experience,” he added. “It’s much more fun. The problem is that customers aren’t paying attention to that.” LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 8 days ago Growing Fresca Mexican Foods to expand with Caldwell plant 0:35 8 days ago Growing Fresca Mexican Foods to expand with Caldwell plant 2:37 11 days ago 'I didn't want to ever have to report bad news to somebody's family' 1:29 11 days ago Construction workers lack safety gear while building Boise townhomes View More Video Business Trump's use of private cellphone raises security concerns The Latest: Kansas Senate advances plan to boost school aid Police: Man with fake gun in custody at Orlando airport The Latest: Police: Gunman was attempting 'suicide by cop' Unease about white supremacy grows after Portland stabbings Business Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-Edition (Digital Replica) Home Delivery Vacation Hold Newsletters Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store Archive Search Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Instagram Advertising Information Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping Place an Obituary Today's Circulars More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Using data analytics platform Kensho, CNBC looked at how sterling performed before and after a U.K. general election and it concluded that the average return tends to be negative. Buying sterling on the trading day after the election result and selling it 30 days after gave an average return of only 0.32 percent. Buying sterling one trading day before and selling it three days after gave an average return of -0.56 percent. Similarly, if someone bought sterling five days before the election day and sold it five trading days after, the average return was -1.05 percent. "Due to the volatility that can be caused by major political events such as elections, I think it is the case that many investors avoid currency trading close to such an event with only speculators choosing to be involved close to the date of a ballot," Jane Foley, Rabobank's strategist responsible for the G-10 currencies, told CNBC via email. She noted that each election has a different backdrop which influences trading. Perhaps the main influencing factor this June 8 is the U.K.'s departure from the European Union. Meanwhile, Roger Hallam, currency chief information officer at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC: "We believe that the upcoming U.K. general election will allow the prime minister to consolidate and grow her majority, while providing better scope for transitional arrangements so that the probability of a 'cliff' exit becomes lower –which reduces the severe tail-risks for sterling." "But assuming the U.K. pursues a reasonably hard Brexit approach, (which means that most current links with the EU would be lost) the period will certainly be challenging from an economic and capital flows perspective. Our shorter-term view of a bounce in GBP/USD towards 1.30, based on the general election triggering a short-covering move in sterling, has now largely been realized," he added. On Tuesday GBP/USD was trading at around 1.2870 against the dollar. As Jane Foley from Rabobank noted, "this time the market is unusually short of GBP ahead of this election. This suggests scope for a relief rally in GBP after the election. That said, the fact that opinion polls are fairly sure of the result this time suggests that volatility on the election result should be limited." Recent polls continue showing an election victory for the Conservatives but the Labour Party has been narrowing the gap. A poll by Survation for ITV on Tuesday gave Labour 37 percent of the voting intention, up three points on a week ago and six points behind the Tories. The Conservatives received 43 percent in the same poll. The Liberal Democrats came third with 8 percent of votes and UKIP (The U.K. Independence Party) obtained 4 percent. The SNP (Scottish National Party) got 2 percent and the Greens 1 percent. "The markets were taken by surprise in mid-April when Theresa May called a snap general election, but aside from an initial flurry of excitement, FX investors had shown little interest in what the opinion polls indicated was a one-horse race," JP Morgan said last week on a research note. "In our judgement the election will not affect the modal outcome for Brexit or GBP assuming that the Conservatives win – Brexit is still likely to feel rather hard insofar as it is liable to circumscribe the UK's single market access, even if the change in the electoral timetable should temper the tail risk of an outright disorderly Brexit in 2019."

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Wall Street slips as energy, financials lose ground Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet May 31, 2017:   US stocks inched lower on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 retreating slightly from a record, as weakness in the energy and financial sectors outweighed gains in technology shares. Oil prices fell to keep US crude below the $50 a barrel mark on concerns output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be sufficient to lessen a global glut and signs of resurgent output in Libya. The energy sector's 1.31 per cent fall made it the worst performer among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon was down 0.6 per cent. Financial stocks, down 0.8 per cent, also supplied some downward pressure. JPMorgan fell 1.7 per cent and Bank of America lost 1.4 per cent as the two biggest drags on the S&P 500. US consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. “The markets are susceptible to geopolitical and to purely political risk, but in terms of the economy and in terms of earnings, we are where investors are comfortable,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. “There isnt a huge rush to put more money into equities, there isnt a huge rush to put more money into Treasuries - the market is treading water.” Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said a hike is probably coming soon, though the central bank may want to delay if inflation remains soft. Traders currently see an 86.6-per cent chance of a quarter-point rate hike by the Fed at its June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.81 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 21,029.47, the S&P 500 lost 2.91 points, or 0.12 per cent, to 2,412.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.01 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 6,203.19. The technology sector rose 0.31 per cent, boosted by gains in Apple and Microsoft, both up 0.6 per cent. Amazon was up 0.1 per cent at $996.70, after briefly crossing the $1,000 mark. Alphabet's Class A shares were close behind, hitting a record of $997.62 before ending the session up 0.3 per cent at $996.17. Telecoms jumped, up 1.4 per cent, after MoffettNathanson upgraded the sector to “neutral” from "underweight,” citing a lack of negative near-term catalysts. CardConnect's shares jumped 10.3 per cent to $15.05 after First Data agreed to buy the payment processor for $750 million. First Data closed up 1.1 per cent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 5.68 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, below the 6.69 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Energy companies also sank. Investors snapped up government bonds and high-yield stocks including phone companies and utilities. As bond prices rose, yields and interest rates fell. That reduced the profits financial institutions can make from mortgages and other types of loans. Energy companies fell to their lowest prices in a year. Technology companies continued to soar while airlines slumped as investors worried that the government could expand a ban on laptops in passenger cabins during international flights, which could affect business travel. Still, stocks remain close to their record highs. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said he thinks stocks will stay at high levels until more details about the Trump administration's tax proposals become public. "Barring unforeseen events, it's really going to come down to progress and details about the tax plan," he said. "We've had this run up primarily on the fact that earnings have been good." However Kinahan said he thinks it's likely Wall Street will be disappointed with any tax cut package that does pass, since the administration's proposals will likely be scaled back in Congress. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks tumbled 11.05 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,371.19. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.21 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. With interest rates falling, JPMorgan Chase declined $1.46, or 1.7 percent, to $83.90. Smaller banks fell harder, as Hope Bancorp dropped 67 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $17.48 and First Financial Bancorp sank 75 cents, or 2.9 percent to $25.05. Oil prices recovered from an early stumble and finished only slightly lower, but energy companies continued to fall. Hess dropped $1.47, or 3.1 percent, to $46.67 and Schlumberger shed 85 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $68.74. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 45 cents to $51.84 a barrel in London. Technology companies continued to lead the way. Security software maker Symantec advanced 45 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $30.71. Chipmaker Nvidia gained $3.03, or 2.1 percent, to $144.87 and Micron Technology rose 95 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $30.71. International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, had to check all devices larger than a smartphone. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. Delta Air Lines lost $1.74, or 3.4 percent, to $49.06 and United Continental slid $2, or 2.5 percent, to $79.25. American Airlines retreated 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.96. Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, but didn't stay there. The stock peaked at $1,001.20 shortly after the market opened and wound up with a gain of 92 cents to close at $996.70. The only other S&P 500 company valued at more than $1,000 a share is travel booking site Priceline, which slipped to $1,857.45 Tuesday. Investors value Amazon at about $476 billion and Priceline at $91 billion. E-commerce and payment services company First Data said it will buy payment processing company CardConnect for $15 a share in cash, or about $468 million. CardConnect's stock climbed $1.40, or 10.3 percent, to $15.05 and First Data picked up 18 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $16.82. Offshore drilling contractor Atwood Oceanics jumped after it agreed to be bought by Ensco PLC for $10.72 a share in stock, or $863 million. Atwood rose $1.96, or 24.3 percent, to $10.04 while U.K.-based Ensco lost 34 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $6.36.

Oil prices fell to keep US crude below the US$50 (RM214.13) a barrel mark on concerns output cuts by the world’s big exporters may not be sufficient to lessen a global glut and signs of resurgent output in Libya. The energy sector’s 1.31 per cent fall made it the worst performer among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon was down 0.6 per cent. Financial stocks, down 0.8 per cent, also supplied some downward pressure. JPMorgan fell 1.7 per cent and Bank of America lost 1.4 per cent as the two biggest drags on the S&P 500. US consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. “The markets are susceptible to geopolitical and to purely political risk, but in terms of the economy and in terms of earnings, we are where investors are comfortable,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. “There isn’t a huge rush to put more money into equities, there isn’t a huge rush to put more money into Treasuries — the market is treading water.” Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said a hike is probably coming soon, though the central bank may want to delay if inflation remains soft. Traders currently see an 86.6-per cent chance of a quarter-point rate hike by the Fed at its June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.81 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 21,029.47, the S&P 500 lost 2.91 points, or 0.12 per cent, to 2,412.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.01 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 6,203.19. The technology sector rose 0.31 per cent, boosted by gains in Apple and Microsoft, both up 0.6 per cent. Amazon was up 0.1 per cent at US$996.70, after briefly crossing the US$1,000 mark. Alphabet’s Class A shares were close behind, hitting a record of US$997.62 before ending the session up 0.3 per cent at US$996.17. Telecoms jumped, up 1.4 per cent, after MoffettNathanson upgraded the sector to “neutral” from “underweight,” citing a lack of negative near-term catalysts. CardConnect’s shares jumped 10.3 per cent to US$15.05 after First Data agreed to buy the payment processor for US$750 million. First Data closed up 1.1 per cent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 5.68 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, below the 6.69 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Uber fires engineer at centre of trade secret suit Ringgit strengthens against US dollar in early trade KL shares open higher but sentiment remains repid Wall Street slips as energy, financials lose ground Short-term rates to remain stable on BNM intervention Singapore court fines ex-broker for corruption in 1MDB probe Chinese automaker Geely takes 49.9pc stake in Proton Ringgit jumps on Opec, yuan at three-month high, other Asian currencies drift Meet Li Shufu, the man who dared buy Proton EPF investment income jumps 73.9pc to RM11.79b in 2017 first quarter Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: Olivia Newton-John reveals cancer return Novice pilots take this insane flying ATV out for a spin Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Oil prices dip as supplies remain ample despite production cuts US stocks fall most since election as Trump woes mount Wall Street slides as investors fret about retail Oil prices fall to 2017 low as US petroleum supply surges Oil dips below US$53 after API said to report rising US supplies Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

The Conservatives’ lead has shrunk in some opinion polls to as low as 5 percentage points from close to 20 points a month ago, driving the pound lower in the past week. That has seemed to be in line with traditional financial market logic, which has usually favoured right-leaning parties who keep a tighter rein on public spending over those such as Britain’s left- leaning Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, who want to tax more and spend more. But the US bank — the world’s second biggest trader of currencies, according to industry surveys — said the prospect of a softer Brexit from Europe under a Labour-led administration meant sterling might react positively to a defeat for Ms May. “A hung parliament would in more normal circumstances be viewed as quite negative for sterling,” Paul Meggyesi said in a note distributed to media and sent to clients at the end of last week. “But, in the post-referendum world, all political developments need to be viewed through a Brexit prism and an argument can be made a hung parliament which delivered or held out the prospect of a softer-Brexit coalition of the left-of-centre parties ... might actually be GBP positive.” However, a shrinking lead in the polls for Ms May is “bad news for the pound and clearly markets have been trading it that way in the last couple of weeks”, according to Peter Kinsella, a senior foreign- exchange and rates strategist at CBA Europe. “It should be stated, however, the Conservatives still maintain a very healthy 10 or 11 point lead in the polls and it would be hard to see that compress much further,” said Mr Kinsella. Following its sharp losses late last week, sterling rose for a second day, trading at 86.8 pence. JP Morgan also raised UK stocks to ‘neutral’, saying they were at the cheapest-ever levels on a price-to-book basis relative to the rest of the region. “We think UK is becoming interesting in the regional allocation again,” JPMorgan’s strategists, led by Mislav Matejka, said in a note to clients.

China manufacturing and services PMI allay fears of slowing economic momentum CS upgrades Myer and Super Retail, but consumer spending slump expected to continue British pound drops as polls indicate Labour is trimming gains of Conservatives Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:38pm That's all for today - thanks everyone for reading this blog and posting your comments. We'll be back tomorrow from 9am. Have a good evening. 4:26pm Shares have closed slightly higher, thanks to some buying in oversold sectors such as banks and retail, but overall it was a dismal month for equity investors. The ASX ended the session up 0.1 per cent at 5724.6 but was down 3.4 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market meltdown of January 2016 and biggest May drop since 2013. NAB's 1.3 per cent gain was the standout among the big four today, which otherwise just edged higher. Aristocrat Leisure was another big winner of the day, rising 3.8 per cent. CSL was the biggest drag on the benchmark index, falling 1.8 per cent, followed by a 2.9 per cent drop in Origin Energy. A dip in iron ore prices this week and headlines regarding the stockpiles of ore waiting in Chinese ports weighed on the big miners. Resource giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto slumped 0.4 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. With the iron ore price trading flat at $US58.50 a tonne, Fortescue Metals bucked the trend and closed up 1.3 per cent.  Retail stocks Myer and Super Retail Group received some buying support, after Credit Suisse announced the un-loved sector might be oversold in those instances. The bank upgraded both stocks to "neutral" and the stocks jumped 2.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively.  Weighing heaviest on the market over the month was a steep 9.2 per cent fall in the financials sector, due to heavy selling in the big banks. 3:59pm Bitcoin's rollercoaster ride over the past week has cryptocurrency sceptics feeling vindicated. Bitcoin is down 1.5 per cent at $2216 in Asian trade, nearly 20 per cent below its record high of $US2798.97 hit last week. The digital currency's more than 100 per cent surge in the past two months looks eerily familiar, argue the bears, pointing to November 2013, when the price quintupled in short order to top $US1000 for the first time. By Valentine's Day it was worth around half that, and spent the better part of the next two years languishing below $US500. Then it absolutely exploded, jumping more than $US1400 in two months. At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Its champions touted the arrival into the mainstream of blockchain, the coin's underlying technology which they say can lift the poor out of poverty and make transactions more secure, inexpensive and efficient. But signs of a top have emerged, detractors warn. On May 25, bitcoin surged more than $US300 to a record only to turn tail and close little changed. The $US600 round trip was the biggest daily swing in its history. It then slumped 8 per cent the next day. 3:35pm Hong Kong's private home prices hit a record high for the sixth month in a row in April, reflecting a market fervour that the authorities are eager to tame. The Asian financial hub is one of the least affordable places on earth, where a nano-apartment of less than 20 square metres can cost as much as $US500,000. The dearth of supply, low interest rates, and the flow of capital from mainland China pushed prices up over 137 per cent since the financial crisis in 2008. In April, home prices rose 2.12 per cent from the previous month, according to an index compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department. The figure, at 327.4, surged nearly 20 per cent year-on-year. The latest index does not reflect the latest mortgage tightening measures announced by the city's de facto central bank earlier in May. "If property prices keep breaking records in the next month or two, I expect the government to introduce new cooling measures," said property consultancy Knight Frank's Senior Director Thomas Lam. He expects prices to rise 5 to 10 per cent this year. Some of the least affordable property in the world.  3:15pm Domino's audit of its Australian stores in response to allegations of widespread staff underpayments has slipped six months behind schedule. The pizza maker said today that the audit of more than 700 franchised and corporate stores is taking longer than anticipated and that it won't be able to meet its June deadline. The company now expects the audit to be finished within six months. The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is also investigating a number of Domino's stores after media reports this year of widespread underpaying of staff and a visa scam at one franchisee-owned store. Shares in Domino's are down 1.4 per cent at $57.57, taking this week's losses to more than 6 per cent. Domino's shares have dropped more than 6 per cent this week.  Back to top 2:49pm Investors hoping for a quick rebound in June after May's ASX declines may be disappointed, with history suggesting they shouldn't count on a June recovery. The old adage to 'sell in May and go away' proved prescient in 2017, with the S&P/ASX200 down 3.4 per cent as concern over Australia's housing boom and weak retail spending combined with falling commodity prices to lead to a nasty coordinated sell-off in the big banks, miners and big-name retailers. And for now, perhaps investors looking for quick gains would do well to heed the last part of the saying. In the nine times the ASX has fallen in May since 2000 it has gone even further into the red in June for five of those years, and recovered some ground in only four years. And the trend has grown more negative of late - in the last seven years, five have seen the market trade in the red in June, with an average drop of 4.2 per cent. Tax-selling can keep stocks suppressed in June, said Argonaut executive director of corporate stockbroking James McGlew. This is particularly the case with illiquid small-caps. But this can also be a fantastic buying opportunity for investors willing to bear some short-term turbulence, he said. "This is the time of year when the herd mentality does start to show," McGlew said. You've got to be aware of that, and of which sectors benefit from that." Here's more Where to in June? Some traders are tipping a rebound. Photo: Louie Douvis 2:17pm Seek shares have dropped 1.6 per cent after Citi downgraded the stock from neutral to sell and cut its price target from $16.20 to $15.30 because of the impact the end of the housing boom would have on job listing volumes. It also cited weakness in Seek's Asian divisions and overexposure locally as reasons for the ratings cut.  The shares have declined 3.6 per cent over the last three days, falling to $16.89.  Citi says there has been rapid growth in ads for construction, trade, manufacturing and related jobs since 2014 even as the unemployment rate remained flat, but that those jobs are set to fall away following the peak of the housing market. Moves by regulators to tighten lending standards appear to have successfully cooled the runaway housing market, with property prices falling 1.1 per cent in May and apartment building approvals down 26 per cent over the past 12 months.  Citi predicts housing construction starts will fall by a quarter over the next two years and that job ad growth will fall to 1.5 per cent a year in 2018 and 2019, after growing at 10 per cent between 2014 and 2017.  While job ad numbers are usually connected to the unemployment rate, Citi told clients in a research note that half the outperformance of Seek was because of the housing construction boom and employee turnover in that industry.  "Even just a modest pullback in churn rates could lead to a large decline in the number of job ads, even if the change in the total number of people employed in the industry is negligible," analysts wrote.  1:53pm Shares in iron ore miners have turned south as Chinese futures in the bulk commodity resume their selloff following a two-day holiday. Fortescue is now down 0.6 per cent after earlier trading more than 1 per cent higher, while Rio Tinto has dropped 1.3 per cent. Dalian iron ore futures have slid 3.3 per cent to 436.5 yuan ($US64), on track for a fifth session in the red. Spot iron ore is at $US58.50 a tonne, close to its lowest since October. Analysts have been noting that while iron ore prices are falling, steel is trading close to five-year highs. This comes as Platts reports that Chinese gross steel margins for exported steel rebar has touched a 2017 high – nearly 80 per cent higher than lows touched on April 13. "The rise in steel mill profitability, which mostly reflects weaker iron ore and coking coal prices, should give way to stronger steel output and iron ore demand in coming weeks," says CBA analyst Vivek Dhar. 1:31pm The slump in consumer spending is expected to continue throughout the year as a major headwind for retailers across the country. In a note - 'What is going on in Australia's retail sector? - CBA blames weak wages growth as the single biggest factor weighing on the sector as households devote a greater portion of their wallet to health, utilities and education. "Consumers have a fine amount of disposable income and even with the assistance of a falling savings rate, record low wages growth has weighed significantly on the discretionary parts of retail trade," senior economist Gareth Aird said. "Soft total retail trade growth is largely down to a lack of spending growth on consumer durables and clothing." Demand for clothing and other discretionary goods has been weak for the past two years, as seen in falling department store sales and the collapse of a string of apparel retailers. Herringbone, Marcs and David Lawrence, Pumpkin Patch, Rhodes and Beckett are among a recent spate of largely high-end clothing retailers to have fallen into voluntary administration. Department store chain Myer has been warning "challenging trading conditions" continue to hurt its sales. The market value of retailers on the ASX have also come under pressure as investors sell down retail stocks following sales warnings and profit downgrades. Online giant Amazon's impending arrival in Australia will also put more pressure on retailers to sacrifice more profits for lower prices. Myer shares are at 86 cents, very close to all-time lows hit earlier this week, while JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman have suffered sell-downs largely linked to the Amazon threat. CBA also warned that the effectiveness of lower interest rates is close to being exhausted and only a lift in wages' growth will lead to an increase in retail spending. "Given the significant amount of slack in the labour market we don't see that happening in 2017 and we therefore conclude that the retail trade sector, in particular the discretionary parts of retail trade, will continue to be under pressure throughout the year," Aird said.  1:04pm When auction clearance rates fall to around 65 per cent in Sydney, a housing downturn will be official, property analyst SQM Research managing director Louis Christopher says. Christopher, who correctly called the start of the current housing boom in 2012, said that when Sydney auction clearance rates - one of the key measures of housing market performance - hit the mid-60 per cent level and clearances in Melbourne fall to the high 60 per cent level, then "a new downturn can be called." The preliminary auction clearance rate for Sydney last week was 76.2 per cent while Melbourne was on 77.3 per cent, according to Corelogic. Both were higher than the same period a year ago. "We do believe we are getting close to a top and perhaps the major banks passing on the bank levy might just be the point which creates a trigger for a slowdown. We will wait and see," Christopher said. He also said a downturn could be closer after observing a rise in unreported auctions in 2017 against the bumper level of 2015. Keep an eye on auction clearance rates.  Back to top 12:39pm The reactions to Altiar Asset Management's shock decision, taken by chairman and investment officer Philip Parker, to sell its equities fund an return the money to investors continues to be a key topic of discussion among Australia's investment professionals. The warning issued by Parker, which in large part rested on his concerns about the overheated property market, has been largely dismissed by senior property industry executives.

Joe Aston writes in Rear Window on "what has to have been the greatest money pit in Australian corporate history": In good news for investors in Network Ten, the free-to-air broadcaster is having a good week so far, closing at 19¢, off its Friday low of 17¢. Everything's relative, right? Remember this is after the 1-for-10 consolidation of Ten shares in January 2016. So when WIN proprietor Bruce Gordon was buying millions of these last decade for $2.58 a pop, he was effectively paying nearly $26 in a like-for-like comparison to the scrip you could pick up today for less than a silver coin. According to an ASX filing of July 2006, Gordon-related entities owned 48.8 million Ten shares, worth $126.2 million. If he'd done nothing since, he'd now own 4.88 million shares worth a princely $927,200. But instead he kept buying and buying and buying, including newly-issued capital. Gordon now owns 55.5 million post-consolidation Ten shares, worth $10.4 million. Yep, that's $9.5 million for, in effect, half a billion of shares. No wonder he catches the bus to Wollongong.  Chairman of archrival Seven, Kerry Stokes, quietly amassed a stake in late 2012 worth around $40 million. According to Ten's 2016 annual report, Stokes' Network Investments had 11.5 million shares as at October, now worth $2.2 million, which wouldn't buy you a bedsit in Darling Point.  Foxtel's $77 million placement just 18 months ago is now worth $9.75 million – which isn't inconsistent with the direction of Foxtel's own value to News Corp and Telstra. News co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch and then Consolidated Media chair James Packer paid around $130 million each (before the multiple raisings) at $1.50 (or, in effect, $15) in 2010 for a combined 14.9 per cent position now worth just $10.6 million And having sunk near enough to $200 million into Ten since 2011, Gina Rinehart's 8.2 per cent stake is now worth $5.8 million.  Read the full piece on the AFR. The biggest shareholder of Ten Network is Bruce Gordon, with 15 per cent of shares. He also owns regional broadcaster WIN.  Photo: Sylvia Liber 11:41am One of the nation's biggest mutual lenders has cut interest-only loans in half and hiked interest rates by 40 basis points, heralding a tough new phase in attempts to cut back on risky borrowing. It means borrowers will have to take out two loans for a single property – a minimum principal and interest loan and a maximum interest-only. Teachers Mutual Bank, which includes UniBank and Firefighters Mutual Bank, is requiring a minimum of 50 per cent principal and interest for all home loans, which means the maximum interest-only is also 50 per cent. A new borrower seeking $300,000 will have two loans – a minimum of $150,000 on principal and interest and a maximum of $150,000 on interest-only. In addition, borrowers cannot draw down any cash from any loan where part of the total borrowing is interest-only and scrutiny of ability to pay has been toughened. It comes as latest APRA numbers reveal that interest-only loans still account for more than 36 per cent of total home loans by value in the March quarter, down from 37.5 per cent previously. APRA issued an order at the end of March requiring banks to cut interest-only loans to 30 per cent of new residential lending. Since then most lenders have increased minimum deposits to at least 20 per cent, raised interest rates, toughened scrutiny of borrowers' ability to pay and banned overseas' lenders. Here's more at the AFR Banks are cracking down on interest-only loans. Photo: Supplied. 11:11am Growth in China's manufacturing sector in May kept pace with the previous month, an official survey shows, beating expectations in a reassuring sign the world's second-biggest economy is not losing too much steam after a solid first quarter performance. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.2 in May, compared with the previous month's 51.2 and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Continuing momentum gives policy makers room to rein in increased leverage and financial risks. Analysts last month upgraded forecasts for China's economic growth this year after an unexpected pick-up to 6.9 per cent in the first quarter. The data has put a bit of a spring into the Australian market, with both shares and the Aussie rising to the day's highs (albeit not a huge gain). 10:50am Australia's yield advantage over the US is shrinking fast, which has stirred the Aussie dollar bears, but ANZ head of FX exchange Daniel Been notes that rate differentials are only one driver of the currency. The 10-year yield spread has narrowed to just 18 basis points, and last week even fell to just 16 basis points, the lowest in 16 years. The last time the yield gap was at these levels, the Aussie was fetching less than US50¢, but Been doesn't believe that the currency will fall below even US70¢, pointing out that when the spread was negative in 1998 the Aussie was 10¢ higher than in 2001. "This suggests that the absolute level of yield was not the only important factor for the AUD, even when it was very narrow," Been says, adding that even when you include changes in the terms of trade it doesn't tell the whole story. Instead, forex traders should include risk factors and the US dollar index to explain the performance of currencies such as the Aussie. As examples of risk driving market performance in 2001, Been cites the tech bubble bursting and the Enron scandal The subsequent rally in the US dollar was on its own worth about 5 cents of underperformance in the Aussie, he has calculated. So what does that mean for today? Been says it's much more helpful to look at the Aussie through this broader frame, which makes the situation for the currency look far less dire on a number of fronts. Here are a few reasons why he believes the Aussie isn't headed for 2001 levels: The terms of trade are significantly stronger than it was in 2000. In fact China was not even a part of the WTO last time the spread was at this level; The risk premium is already negative, implying the negative effect of a tighter spread is already integrated into the markets expectations for the AUD; The probability of a significant deterioration in risk appetite remains lower than it did in 2001, at least in the near term As such, Been doesn't believe that the fall in the interest rate spread is about to drive a slump in the AUD, or that the AUD at current levels is fundamentally misaligned with the level of rates given the broader environment. Quite the contrary, Been says the recent improvement in the current account should dampen the negative impact of the narrow rate differential, as the Australian economy's funding need has shrunk significantly.  "We think that the biggest risk to the AUD is ultimately going to be a sharp deterioration in risk appetite, rather than the narrowing in spreads, however we continue to think that, at least over the next 12 months, this remains a tail risk," Been says. "Until this kind of risk event can become integrated into a central scenario rather than a tail, we think that the AUD will remain stable above US70¢." Back to top 10:37am Shares have opened fairly flat, with some buying in the oversold retail sector offset by drops in energy stocks. The ASX is down 0.1 per cent at 5714.2, putting it on track for a loss of 3.5 per cent in May, its worst monthly performance since the market mayhem of January last year. "Sentiment on Australian markets today could be influenced by how China's steel and iron ore markets perform when trading gets under way after a two-day holiday," CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner says. "Prices were sliding at the end of last week and sentiment will not be helped if strong downward momentum continues today." Spooner added that investors will be hoping that today's release of China's manufacturing PMI can also hold the line after a softer read in April, which showed a decline in employment conditions. Blue chips are all over the shop, with the big banks trading flat to slightly higher, BHP down 0.2 per cent but Rio up 0.1 per cent and Fortescue gaining 1.25 per cent. One of the biggest winners is Aristocrat Leisure, up another 3.1 per cent as the pokies maker moves from strength to strength. Market dogs in the retail sector are catching some relief, with Myer gaining 1.8 per cent and Super Retail up 1.3 per cent after Credit Suisse upgraded both stocks to 'neutral'. 9:53am on 31 May 2017 SPONSORED POST The ASX's worst month since January 2016 will soon be in the rearview mirrow, and IG strategist Chris Weston wonders whether June has anything better in store: For some the idea of turning the page and closing what has been a fairly bleak month to be long the Aussie equity market will be welcomed. That being said, being long certain industrial and telco names has seen strong outperformance in the portfolio. What won't be welcomed is the idea that June is actually the worst month to be long or tracking the Aussie equity market, with the average loss over the past decade at 2.2%. We have seen the past four months of June down by an average of 3.1% and while past performance obvious doesn't predict future returns it is a consideration. Certainly, something to think about and the technical set-up on the ASX 200 is interesting, with the bulls happy to defend the 5775/77 level yesterday which we can see from the daily chart seems a quite pivotal support level representing swing lows in March and May. A break of this level and we should be talking sub-5600, but for now, we are watching to see if the bulls can build on the platform set yesterday. Turning to Asia and it will be interesting to watch China come back on line today after its two-day holiday. Of course, while the spot iron ore market has been open (as price is fixed in Singapore), we get the re-open of the Dalian iron ore and steel futures exchanges today and who knows where that will trade. The market will keep a beady eye on official manufacturing and services PMI data (at 11:00 AEST) for further signs of an economic downturn and we should expect a very modest slowdown in the pace of expansion here, with the manufacturing PMI data expected in at 51. Whether we are talking copper or AUD, the market hasn't been overly sensitive to this print of late, but that could change if the data comes in far lower or higher than forecast. Again, the prospect of the latter materialising seems very low.

"New Zealand's financial system remains sound and the risks facing the system have reduced in the past six months," Reserve Bank governor Graeme Wheeler said in the bank's semi-annual Financial Stability Report on Wednesday in Wellington. Still, he warned that global uncertainty remains elevated and that New Zealand would be vulnerable if a sharp reversal in risk sentiment drove up borrowing costs for banks. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly. Wheeler has cut his benchmark interest rate to a record low of 1.75 per cent to spur weak general inflation, requiring him to introduce lending restrictions in an attempt to curb housing demand. He said today that those restrictions have caused house-price growth to slow over the past eight months. However, "house prices remain elevated relative to incomes and rents, and any resurgence would be of concern", Wheeler said. A recovery in dairy prices over the past year had reduced risks faced by the dairy sector, though some parts of carry excessive debt and remain vulnerable, the RBNZ said. New Zealand's banking system "maintains strong capital and funding buffers, and profitability remains robust", the central bank said. Still, banks had increased reliance on offshore funding for credit growth and remain exposed to a shift in global sentiment. "A sharp reversal in risk sentiment could lead to higher funding costs for New Zealand banks and an increase in domestic borrowing costs," the RBNZ said. New Zealand home-owners have built up record amounts of debt in recent years as house prices soared, which may leave many stretched if borrowing costs were to rise quickly.  9:44am on 31 May 2017 Here are the overnight market highlights: SPI futures down 4 points to 5718 AUD +0.4% to 74.66 US cents (Overnight range: 74.16-74.69) On Wall St, Dow -0.2%, S&P 500 -0.1%, Nasdaq -0.1% In New York, BHP +0.4%, Rio +0.8% In Europe, Stoxx 50 -0.5%, FTSE -0.3%, CAC -0.5%, DAX -0.2% Spot gold -0.4% to $US1262.95 an ounce Brent crude -0.9% to $US51.82 a barrel Iron ore unchanged at $US58.50 a tonne Dalian exchange closed LME aluminium -1.3% to $US1926 a tonne LME copper little changed at $US5656 a tonne 10-year bond yield: US 2.21%, Germany 0.29%, Australia 2.39% Plus a few analyst recommendation changes: Henderson Group (HGGDA): New buy at UBS, PT $35.25; New market perform at KBW, PT $32 Myer Holdings (MYR): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $0.82 Seek (SEK): Cut to sell at Citi Super Retail (SUL): Raised to neutral at Credit Suisse, PT $7.56 What to watch today: April private sector credit; China May manufacturing PMI, non manufacturing PMI; Japan April industrial production, housing starts; Euro zone April unemployment rate; Fed Beige Book And not to forget, Orica is trading ex-dividend. 9:37am on 31 May 2017 The British pound came under pressure overnight after a new poll found that PM Theresa May's Conservative Party risks falling short of an overall majority in next month's national election. The pound fell to $US1.2791, near a one-month low of $US1.2775 touched on Friday. The pound also slipped to 0.8738 pound per euro, near Friday's eight-week low of 0.8750, while the Aussie strengthened about 0.5 per cent to 58.3 pence. New constituency-by-constituency modelling by YouGov showed the Conservative Party might lose 20 of the 330 seats it holds while the opposition Labour Party could gain nearly 30 seats. Breaking: Latest YouGov Poll points to a hung parliament as @Conservatives could be 16 seats short of a majority. #GE2017 #gbpusd #UK #GBP pic.twitter.com/WLmcEzNn37— WealthFX (@WealthFXnet) May 30, 2017 The news came after a string of opinion polls show a narrowing lead for May's Conservatives, shaking the confidence among investors that May would easily win a majority in a national election on June 8. The US dollar fell to two-week lows against the safe-haven yen as investors turned cautious amid political worries in Europe as well as weaker stock and commodity markets after a long US holiday weekend. Worries that US political stalemate due to investigations into President Donald Trump's ties with Russia could hamper progress on tax cuts and other stimulus measures from Washington has been undermining the dollar. The dollar fell to near two-week low of 110.665 yen and last traded at 110.85 yen, while the Aussie lifted to US74.61¢. The US dollar index dipped to 97.396, around the levels it was trading at before Trump was elected in November.

U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Updated 6 hours ago NEW YORK — A seven-day winning streak for stocks came to a quiet end Tuesday as banks, especially smaller ones, dropped along with bond yields and interest rates. Energy companies also sank. Investors snapped up government bonds and high-yield stocks including phone companies and utilities. As bond prices rose, yields and interest rates fell. That reduced the profits financial institutions can make from mortgages and other types of loans. Energy companies fell to their lowest prices in a year. Technology companies continued to soar while airlines slumped as investors worried that the government could expand a ban on laptops in passenger cabins during international flights, which could affect business travel. Still, stocks remain close to their record highs. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said he thinks stocks will stay at high levels until more details about the Trump administration's tax proposals become public. “Barring unforeseen events, it's really going to come down to progress and details about the tax plan,” he said. “We've had this run up primarily on the fact that earnings have been good.” However Kinahan said he thinks it's likely Wall Street will be disappointed with any tax cut package that does pass, since the administration's proposals will likely be scaled back in Congress. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks tumbled 11.05 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,371.19. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.21 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. With interest rates falling, JPMorgan Chase declined $1.46, or 1.7 percent, to $83.90. Smaller banks fell harder, as Hope Bancorp dropped 67 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $17.48 and First Financial Bancorp sank 75 cents, or 2.9 percent to $25.05. “The markets are susceptible to geopolitical and to purely political risk, but in terms of the economy and in terms of earnings, we are where investors are comfortable,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. Oil prices recovered from an early stumble and finished only slightly lower, but energy companies continued to fall. Hess dropped $1.47, or 3.1 percent, to $46.67 and Schlumberger shed 85 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $68.74. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 45 cents to $51.84 a barrel in London. Technology companies continued to lead the way. Security software maker Symantec advanced 45 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $30.71. Chipmaker Nvidia gained $3.03, or 2.1 percent, to $144.87 and Micron Technology rose 95 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $30.71. International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, had to check all devices larger than a smartphone. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the United States. Delta Air Lines lost $1.74, or 3.4 percent, to $49.06 and United Continental slid $2, or 2.5 percent, to $79.25. American Airlines retreated 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.96. Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, but didn't stay there. The stock peaked at $1,001.20 shortly after the market opened and wound up with a gain of 92 cents to close at $996.70. The only other S&P 500 company valued at more than $1,000 a share is travel booking site Priceline, which slipped to $1,857.45 Tuesday. Investors value Amazon at about $476 billion and Priceline at $91 billion. E-commerce and payment services company First Data said it will buy payment processing company CardConnect for $15 a share in cash, or about $468 million. CardConnect's stock climbed $1.40, or 10.3 percent, to $15.05 and First Data picked up 18 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $16.82. Offshore drilling contractor Atwood Oceanics jumped after it agreed to be bought by Ensco PLC for $10.72 a share in stock, or $863 million. Atwood rose $1.96, or 24.3 percent, to $10.04 while U.K.-based Ensco lost 34 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $6.36. Cloud-based incentives company Xactly agreed to be taken private by Vista Equity Partners in a deal that values it at $15.65 a share, or $499 million. Its stock added $2.15, or 16 percent, to $15.55. The dollar declined to 110.78 yen from 111.19 yen. The euro rose to $1.1188 from $1.1176. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline remained at $1.64 a gallon. Heating oil dipped 1 cent to $1.55 a gallon. Natural gas tumbled 17 cents, or 5 percent, to $3.15 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold lost $5.70 to $1,265.70 an ounce. Silver added 10 cents to $17.43 an ounce. Copper held still at $2.56 a pound. The FTSE 100 index in Britain fell 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 sank 0.6 percent. Germany's DAX dipped 0.2 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 finished nearly flat and South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.4 percent. Markets in Hong Kong were closed for a holiday.

"Investors believe the reform agenda will go forward, no matter the outcome of the political crisis", José Olympio Pereira, chief executive officer of Credit Suisse AG's Brazilian unit, said at an investment conference. "The reform agenda belongs to the country, not to a president", José Berenguer, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's Brazilian unit, said at the same conference. Temer must respond within 24 hours to federal police questions about allegations of his involvement in a sprawling political graft probe, a Supreme Court judge ruled on Tuesday, a source with direct knowledge of the investigation told Reuters. The billionaire owners of the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS SA said in plea-bargain testimony to police that Temer condoned bribing a potential witness in the "Car Wash" corruption case and took bribes himself. Temer strongly denies the allegations. Over the last week, market prices recovered from the rout triggered after word of the plea deal became public on May 17. Since then, the benchmark Bovespa stock index has accumulated a 5.3 percent loss. Credit Suisse's Pereira said another good sign is the growing number of Brazil-based companies filing for initial public offerings of shares. Three companies, healthcare services provider NotreDame Intermédica Saúde SA, reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA and the Brazilian unit of French retailer Carrefour SA filed with Brazilian securities industry regulator CVM for authorization for IPOs in the last two weeks. State lender Banco do Brasil SA Chief Executive Officer Paulo Caffarelli said the new framework for infrastructure investments should attract capital market investors. Caffarelli said the bank has increased loan disbursements to so far this year by 20 percent to companies and 25 percent to households, compared to the same period a year earlier.

Funded by Macomb Community College's Strategic Fund and part of J.P. Morgan Chase's $150 million commitment to Detroit's economic recovery, the award is designed to advance progress of larger scale funding for startup companies with high growth potential. Munetrix, based in Auburn Hills, will receive $100,000, which it must match. The company is a data science and advisory firm that provides analytics, planning, transparency and compliance tools for state and local governments, according to a news release from the college. Rochester-based Skypersonic was awarded $25,000 in support of its introduction to the market. The company develops drone technology for indoor applications for commercial, industrial, agricultural and civil purposes, the release said. "Investing in small businesses is essential for creating a vibrant local economy in Detroit," Chauncy Lennon, head of workforce initiatives for Chase, said in the release. The two companies were selected from a pool of 17 applicants. Companies in Genesee, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, Shiawassee, St. Clair, Washtenaw and Wayne counties are eligible to apply. The innovation fund has awarded about $1.5 million to 30 companies since it started mentoring and providing financial help to young businesses in 2015.

Oil prices fell to keep U.S. crude below the $50 a barrel mark on concerns output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be sufficient to lessen a global glut and signs of resurgent output in Libya. The energy sector's 1.31 percent fall made it the worst performer among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon was down 0.6 percent. Financial stocks, down 0.8 percent, also supplied some downward pressure. JPMorgan fell 1.7 percent and Bank of America lost 1.4 percent as the two biggest drags on the S&P 500. U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. "The markets are susceptible to geopolitical and to purely political risk, but in terms of the economy and in terms of earnings, we are where investors are comfortable," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. "There isn’t a huge rush to put more money into equities, there isn’t a huge rush to put more money into Treasuries - the market is treading water." Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said a hike is probably coming soon, though the central bank may want to delay if inflation remains soft. Traders currently see an 86.6-percent chance of a quarter-point rate hike by the Fed at its June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.81 points, or 0.24 percent, to 21,029.47, the S&P 500 lost 2.91 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,412.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.01 points, or 0.11 percent, to 6,203.19. The technology sector rose 0.31 percent, boosted by gains in Apple and Microsoft, both up 0.6 percent. Amazon was up 0.1 percent at $996.70, after briefly crossing the $1,000 mark. Alphabet's Class A shares were close behind, hitting a record of $997.62 before ending the session up 0.3 percent at $996.17. Telecoms jumped, up 1.4 percent, after MoffettNathanson upgraded the sector to "neutral" from "underweight," citing a lack of negative near-term catalysts. CardConnect's shares jumped 10.3 percent to $15.05 after First Data agreed to buy the payment processor for $750 million. First Data closed up 1.1 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 5.68 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.69 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Energy companies also sank. Investors snapped up government bonds and high-yield stocks including phone companies and utilities. As bond prices rose, yields and interest rates fell. That reduced the profits financial institutions can make from mortgages and other types of loans. Energy companies fell to their lowest prices in a year. Technology companies continued to soar while airlines slumped as investors worried that the government could expand a ban on laptops in passenger cabins during international flights, which could affect business travel. Still, stocks remain close to their record highs. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said he thinks stocks will stay at high levels until more details about the Trump administration’s tax proposals become public. “Barring unforeseen events, it’s really going to come down to progress and details about the tax plan,” he said. “We’ve had this run up primarily on the fact that earnings have been good.” However Kinahan said he thinks it’s likely Wall Street will be disappointed with any tax cut package that does pass, since the administration’s proposals will likely be scaled back in Congress. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47.

Hess dropped $1.47, or 3.1 percent, to $46.67 and Schlumberger shed 85 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $68.74. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year.

Chipmaker Nvidia gained $3.03, or 2.1 percent, to $144.87 and Micron Technology rose 95 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $30.71. International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, had to check all devices larger than a smartphone. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. Delta Air Lines lost $1.74, or 3.4 percent, to $49.06 and United Continental slid $2, or 2.5 percent, to $79.25. American Airlines retreated 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.96. Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, but didn’t stay there.

(RJF) PCM (PCMI) Receiving Somewhat Positive Press Coverage, Analysis Shows Sanmina Corp (SANM) Receiving Somewhat Favorable News Coverage, Report Finds Research Analysts’ Weekly Ratings Updates for Gap (GPS) May 30th, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Trevor Kearing Filed Under: Analyst Articles - Company Sum - Finance Tweet A number of research firms have changed their ratings and price targets for Gap (NYSE: GPS): 5/22/2017 – Gap had its “underperform” rating reaffirmed by analysts at Morgan Stanley. They now have a $20.00 price target on the stock. 5/22/2017 – Gap was given a new $24.00 price target on by analysts at Oppenheimer Holdings Inc.. They now have a “hold” rating on the stock. 5/19/2017 – Gap was given a new $28.00 price target on by analysts at FBR & Co. They now have a “hold” rating on the stock. They wrote, “GPS reported 1Q17 adjusted EPS of $0.36, versus FBR/consensus of $0.29, on SSS of +2% (versus FBR/consensus of 0.4%/–0.1%), GM expansion of +271 bps (versus FBR/consensus +50 bps/+30 bps), and SGA de-leverage of –179 bps (versus FBR/ consensus –100 bps/–80 bps). Management reiterated 2017 EPS guidance of $1.95 to $2.05 (versus FBR/consensus of $2.00/$1.99) on SSS of flat/slightly up, though EPS for 1H17 should be –MSD, versus –HSD previously. AUR was positive across all brands in 1Q, and we believe GPS has been able to pull back on promos to help drive AUR/margins. 1H17 inventory guidance shifted to flat from –LSD previously, mainly driven by timing. We like the strong ON performance, which we believe can continue, but we remain on the sidelines until we see consistent SSS improvement at Gap and sustained gross margin improvement or a more attractive entry point.”” 5/19/2017 – Gap was given a new $35.00 price target on by analysts at Jefferies Group LLC.

Asian stocks mixed amid US political uncertainty, China data Associated Press | TOKYO (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday as worries lingered over political uncertainty in Washington and shares drooped overnight in the U.S. while China was boosted by manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent in morning trading to 19,657.76 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent to 5,736.30. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent to 2,351.21. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.2 percent to 25,759.49, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.5 percent at 3,124.12. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China's factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world's No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing' managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 30 cents to $49.36 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose slightly to 110.09 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro was little changed at $1.1188 from $1.1181. ___ Yuri Kageyama can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Oil prices fell to keep U.S. crude below the $50 a barrel mark on concerns output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be sufficient to lessen a global glut and signs of resurgent output in Libya. The energy sector's 1.31 percent fall made it the worst performer among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon was down 0.6 percent. Financial stocks, down 0.8 percent, also supplied some downward pressure. JPMorgan fell 1.7 percent and Bank of America lost 1.4 percent as the two biggest drags on the S&P 500. U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. "The markets are susceptible to geopolitical and to purely political risk, but in terms of the economy and in terms of earnings, we are where investors are comfortable," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. "There isn't a huge rush to put more money into equities, there isn't a huge rush to put more money into Treasuries - the market is treading water." Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said a hike is probably coming soon, though the central bank may want to delay if inflation remains soft. Traders currently see an 86.6-percent chance of a quarter-point rate hike by the Fed at its June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.81 points, or 0.24 percent, to 21,029.47, the S&P 500 lost 2.91 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,412.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.01 points, or 0.11 percent, to 6,203.19. The technology sector rose 0.31 percent, boosted by gains in Apple and Microsoft, both up 0.6 percent. Amazon was up 0.1 percent at $996.70, after briefly crossing the $1,000 mark. Alphabet's Class A shares were close behind, hitting a record of $997.62 before ending the session up 0.3 percent at $996.17. Telecoms jumped, up 1.4 percent, after MoffettNathanson upgraded the sector to "neutral" from "underweight," citing a lack of negative near-term catalysts. CardConnect's shares jumped 10.3 percent to $15.05 after First Data agreed to buy the payment processor for $750 million. First Data closed up 1.1 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — A seven-day winning streak for stocks came to a quiet end Tuesday as banks, especially smaller ones, dropped along with bond yields and interest rates. Energy companies also sank. Investors snapped up government bonds and high-yield stocks including phone companies and utilities. As bond prices rose, yields and interest rates fell. That reduced the profits financial institutions can make from mortgages and other types of loans. Energy companies fell to their lowest prices in a year. Technology companies continued to soar while airlines slumped as investors worried that the government could expand a ban on laptops in passenger cabins during international flights, which could affect business travel. Still, stocks remain close to their record highs. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said he thinks stocks will stay at high levels until more details about the Trump administration's tax proposals become public. "Barring unforeseen events, it's really going to come down to progress and details about the tax plan," he said. "We've had this run up primarily on the fact that earnings have been good." However Kinahan said he thinks it's likely Wall Street will be disappointed with any tax cut package that does pass, since the administration's proposals will likely be scaled back in Congress. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks tumbled 11.05 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,371.19. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.21 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. With interest rates falling, JPMorgan Chase declined $1.46, or 1.7 percent, to $83.90. Smaller banks fell harder, as Hope Bancorp dropped 67 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $17.48 and First Financial Bancorp sank 75 cents, or 2.9 percent to $25.05. Oil prices recovered from an early stumble and finished only slightly lower, but energy companies continued to fall. Hess dropped $1.47, or 3.1 percent, to $46.67 and Schlumberger shed 85 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $68.74. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 45 cents to $51.84 a barrel in London. Technology companies continued to lead the way. Security software maker Symantec advanced 45 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $30.71. Chipmaker Nvidia gained $3.03, or 2.1 percent, to $144.87 and Micron Technology rose 95 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $30.71. International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, had to check all devices larger than a smartphone. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. Delta Air Lines lost $1.74, or 3.4 percent, to $49.06 and United Continental slid $2, or 2.5 percent, to $79.25. American Airlines retreated 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.96. Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, but didn't stay there. The stock peaked at $1,001.20 shortly after the market opened and wound up with a gain of 92 cents to close at $996.70. The only other S&P 500 company valued at more than $1,000 a share is travel booking site Priceline, which slipped to $1,857.45 Tuesday. Investors value Amazon at about $476 billion and Priceline at $91 billion.

L.P. (NYSE: AMGP) closed its initial public offering earlier this month, and now its quiet period has come to an end. Analysts are taking this opportunity to make calls on this midstream oil company. Here, 24/7 Wall St. has included some of the company’s recent highlights, as well as what analysts are saying. The underwriters for this offering included Morgan Stanley; Barclays; JPMorgan; Baird; Citigroup; Goldman Sachs; Wells Fargo Securities; Credit Suisse; Scotia Howard Weil; Tudor, Pickering, Holt; Evercore ISI; Raymond James; D.A.

(NYSE: AR) that was formed to own, operate and develop midstream energy infrastructure primarily to service Antero Resources’ rapidly increasing production and completion activity in the Appalachian Basin’s Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale located in West Virginia and Ohio. Credit Suisse said in its report: AMGP is the general partner of AM (OP), a northeast powerhouse, and derives 100% of its cash flow from incentive distribution rights (IDR) payments from AM. We forecast a 3-year distribution growth CAGR at AM of 30% which in turn drives a 70% dividend CAGR at AMGP over the same period. Our $28 TP suggests a 30% total return which is above the median of our coverage universe and is supportive of our OP rating.

FILE - This Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014, file photo, shows the facade of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slid... By YURI KAGEYAMA AP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday as worries lingered over political uncertainty in Washington and shares drooped overnight in the U.S. while China was boosted by manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent in morning trading to 19,657.76 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent to 5,736.30. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent to 2,351.21. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.2 percent to 25,759.49, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.5 percent at 3,124.12. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China's factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world's No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing' managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 30 cents to $49.36 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose slightly to 110.09 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro was little changed at $1.1188 from $1.1181. ___ Yuri Kageyama can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Life Buy/Sell Business Banks pull stocks away from records as 7-day streak ends By Marley Jay • AP Markets Writer 10 hrs ago (…) Updated at 3:40 p.m. NEW YORK • A seven-day winning streak for stocks came to a quiet end Tuesday as banks, especially smaller ones, dropped along with bond yields and interest rates. Energy companies also sank. Investors snapped up government bonds and high-yield stocks including phone companies and utilities. As bond prices rose, yields and interest rates fell. That reduced the profits financial institutions can make from mortgages and other types of loans. Energy companies fell to their lowest prices in a year. Technology companies continued to soar while airlines slumped as investors worried that the government could expand a ban on laptops in passenger cabins during international flights, which could affect business travel. Still, stocks remain close to their record highs. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said he thinks stocks will stay at high levels until more details about the Trump administration's tax proposals become public. "Barring unforeseen events, it's really going to come down to progress and details about the tax plan," he said. "We've had this run up primarily on the fact that earnings have been good." However Kinahan said he thinks it's likely Wall Street will be disappointed with any tax cut package that does pass, since the administration's proposals will likely be scaled back in Congress. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks tumbled 11.05 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,371.19. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.21 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. With interest rates falling, JPMorgan Chase declined $1.46, or 1.7 percent, to $83.90. Smaller banks fell harder, as Hope Bancorp dropped 67 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $17.48 and First Financial Bancorp sank 75 cents, or 2.9 percent to $25.05. Oil prices recovered from an early stumble and finished only slightly lower, but energy companies continued to fall. Hess dropped $1.47, or 3.1 percent, to $46.67 and Schlumberger shed 85 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $68.74. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 45 cents to $51.84 a barrel in London. Technology companies continued to lead the way. Security software maker Symantec advanced 45 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $30.71. Chipmaker Nvidia gained $3.03, or 2.1 percent, to $144.87 and Micron Technology rose 95 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $30.71. International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, had to check all devices larger than a smartphone. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. Delta Air Lines lost $1.74, or 3.4 percent, to $49.06 and United Continental slid $2, or 2.5 percent, to $79.25. American Airlines retreated 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.96. Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, but didn't stay there. The stock peaked at $1,001.20 shortly after the market opened and wound up with a gain of 92 cents to close at $996.70. The only other S&P 500 company valued at more than $1,000 a share is travel booking site Priceline, which slipped to $1,857.45 Tuesday. Investors value Amazon at about $476 billion and Priceline at $91 billion. E-commerce and payment services company First Data said it will buy payment processing company CardConnect for $15 a share in cash, or about $468 million. CardConnect's stock climbed $1.40, or 10.3 percent, to $15.05 and First Data picked up 18 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $16.82.

May 30, 2017 North America Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote In its quest to save the U.S. economy during the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve went where it had rarely — or even never — gone before. The central bank slashed the target for its key short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate, to nearly zero and pumped a record $2 trillion into the economy by buying troubled mortgage-backed securities and other assets, ballooning its balance sheet more than four-fold. Now, as the economy seems to be finding solid footing, the Fed is looking to resume historically normal, pre-Great Recession operations. But can it do so, or is this a new normal? “The Fed has, post-2008, become a vastly more complicated place,” notes Wharton professor Peter Conti-Brown, author of The Power and Independence of the Federal Reserve. “This means that the Fed is much more than a monetary policymaker, but is also sitting in the big chair for all systemic risk and financial stability regulation and supervision, both before and after financial crises. In that sense, the central bank world before 2008 no longer exists and will never be restored. The [financial] crisis has made sure that the Fed will be a prominent player in economic policymaking for the indefinite future.” The Fed’s plan to return to normal consists of raising interest rates to pre-Great Recession levels and whittling down its balance sheet, with the pace dependent on U.S. economic performance. But Conti-Brown says “the full extent of the Fed’s normalization plan is pretty sketchy. All we know is that most members of the [Fed’s] FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) are eager to see interest rates return to higher levels, but they’ve been similarly eager for several years. There is no general consensus on how the Fed should unwind its balance sheet, although several members of the FOMC have suggested that they would like to see this occur throughout 2017 and 2018. We are, as we have been, in a tentative space that depends on an uncertain future.” At least, the Fed is moving cautiously. “Moving too quickly could undo much of what the economy has already accomplished,” Conti-Brown notes. Rushing back into “a world where the Fed has a less than $1 trillion balance sheet, with interest rates in the 3% to 4% range, could deal a serious blow to the fragile, if not very long, economic recovery.” He notes that Fed critics want the central bank to move more quickly in case inflation surges. While inflation is currently under control, Conti-Brown says, their argument is that it might still spike. “Navigating these concerns makes the world of central banking in 2017 a very fraught exercise.” “The [financial] crisis has made sure that the Fed will be a prominent player in economic policymaking for the indefinite future.”–Peter Conti-Brown Tayyeb Shabbir, Wharton adjunct professor of finance, agrees that the Fed under Chair Janet Yellen “seems to be moving at just the right speed.” But Shabbir, whose last book on financial crises was co-edited by Nobel Laureate and Wharton economist Lawrence Klein, sees a new normal coming. “Monetary policy will regain its normal functionality; expectations of consumers, investors and all economic agents in general will return to ‘normal’ — which may not be the exact reversion to the pre-crisis level but it will be normal in terms of … functionality.” But there will be a residual effect. “Having hit the gas pedal to the floor once, albeit for a protracted time, should not preclude it [from] working more ‘normally’ once the extreme conditions have disappeared,” he adds. “However, war wounds may heal, but scars are left behind.” The Fed’s Unorthodox Actions Buoyed in part by low interest rates, the U.S. housing market started flourishing in the 1990s and accelerated in the mid-2000s before reaching a peak in 2006, seeing a boom in construction, home prices and credit. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, “average home prices in the United States more than doubled between 1998 and 2006, the sharpest increase recorded in U.S. history.” More consumers borrowed money to buy homes: Mortgage debt rose to 97% of GDP in 2006 from 61% in 1998. Typically, people with poor credit — subprime borrowers — had a tougher time qualifying for mortgages. But during the housing bubble, many more mortgages were being taken out and repackaged into complex securities, then sold off to investors. Thus, the risk of lending to borrowers shifted away from the bank or mortgage lender. This led to lenders qualifying more subprime borrowers for home loans, particularly into adjustable rate mortgages; when rates reset they refinanced or took out another mortgage. This pushed up home prices to sometimes stratospheric levels. But the gravy train couldn’t last forever and mounting defaults on mortgages put heavy pressure on banks and institutional investors who bought these securities. (These securities were so complex that even ones with subprime mortgages received high grades from credit ratings agencies.) Investment banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, which loaded up on these securities, saw the value of their holdings plunge so much they went out of business. AIG, which insured many of these securities, also was in danger of collapse until the Fed rescued it. Under Fed chair Ben Bernanke, the Fed determined that the fall of AIG would take others down. Sponsored Content: By intervening this way, the Fed deviated from its usual role as the banks’ banker. In the same way as consumers open accounts in a bank, banks have accounts — or reserves — with the Fed. Historically, the Fed mostly lent and supported just banks, with some rare exceptions. But in the escalating financial crisis, it engineered the rescue of AIG, intervened in the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase and expanded its lending to include non-banks. The Fed wanted to make credit more freely available because it was afraid that due to the big losses suffered by banks, they would freeze credit and severely limit lending, which would harm economic activity. A severe credit crunch, among other things, could lead to another Great Depression. Once the immediate crisis was averted, and the recession ended in 2009, the Fed worked to combat persistently weak economic growth through credit-easing — popularly known as quantitative easing (QE) but with differences from Japan’s program — by injecting money into the economy through purchases of longer-term bonds and mortgage-related securities from banks and others. This 2009 program ended in October 2014. The Fed undertook this program because even with the fed funds rate near zero, it was not enough to boost economic growth. “War wounds may heal, but scars are left behind.”–Tayyeb Shabbir Meanwhile, the Fed began paying interest on banks’ reserves for the first time, which helps the central bank hit the target for its key federal funds rate (the overnight rate for loans banks charge each other). It’s also an incentive for banks to keep money at the Fed. “A quickening economic recovery could provide incentives for banks to withdraw funds held as excess reserves at the Fed and inject them into the real economy,” said the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “Given the significant amounts of funds held as excess reserves, this increased lending might lead to inflation pressures inconsistent with the Fed’s mandate of price stability.” Shabbir observes that one “apparent paradox” in the economy is that the current rate of unemployment would typically warrant more “aggressive rate hikes than we have seen so far. However … the Great Recession and the deep changes that it has wrought in the structure of the U. S. labor market — such as the unprecedented, lengthy average duration of unemployment, relatively lower worker’s wage expectations and declining ‘union power’ — [have] cast doubts about the relative tightness of the labor market as traditionally understood in the pre-Great Recession era, which was a more close fit to the oft-mentioned ‘Phillips Curve’ relationship” — where wages rose slowly when the jobless rate was high, and vice versa. “An important new wrinkle of the ‘natural’ rate of unemployment may be that its link with wage growth may have been transformed — if not broken — by the dynamics of this recovery from the Great Recession,” Shabbir continues. “After all, last time when the unemployment rate hovered around the current levels, wage growth was 4% vs. the present 2.3%. However, this aspect bears close attention as it is probable that the wage growth may be only delayed and not banished.” Normalization Plan The Fed’s normalization plan calls for raising the federal funds rate away from zero (liftoff from the zero interest rate policy or ZIRP) and reducing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Normalization would entail that the fed funds rate revert closer to its pre-2008 average: 4.5% from January 1990 to December 2007, according to Shabbir. Currently, the fed funds rate target is 0.75% to 1%. The Fed has raised rates three times since December 2015 — the first time since 2006 — each by a relatively cautious 0.25%. Economists expect one or two more hikes this year. However, it is important to remember that the Fed’s normalization plan is contingent on continued growth in the economy and inflation staying near its 2% target. “It is really dependent on the strength of the U.S. economy,” says Wharton finance professor Joao Gomes. “The latest growth numbers were disappointing — we had a lot of weakness in various areas, like retail, for example. There are a lot of conditions for this ‘liftoff’” to happen. Moreover, political uncertainty and potential policy changes could dramatically alter the path of the economy. “The big wild card is what the next Fed chair will want to do.”–Joao Gomes Gomes does see the Fed, barring any jarring events, continuing to be “very cautious for the rest of the year into early next year.” He thinks the normalization plan released by the Fed is a “cautious” plan whose main focus is “not to derail the recovery of the U.S. economy, not to push the economy back into recession.” If the Fed raised rates too quickly, Gomes notes, it could also create problems for households that have accumulated a lot of debt in recent years as well as derail a still vulnerable housing market. “It’s probably a plan that markets are happy with as long as inflation stays around 2% or so, which for the moment there are no real expectations of anything different.” The biggest near-term threat Gomes sees is political in nature. “The big wild card is what the next Fed chair will want to do. That’s a really important calculation because [there is a high probability that] we will have a new Fed chair … in 2018, assuming that President Trump continues to not like Janet Yellen.” This new Fed chair could favor “a more aggressive increase of interest rates and more aggressive unwinding of the balance sheet.” If that happens, he says, “unless steps are taken to reassure the markets, we will definitely see uncertainty creeping up and a lot of potential disruption to capital markets.” Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is looking to end its own quantitative easing program as green shoots appear in EU economies. “Europe is doing much better than last year, and the year before. You see growth pretty much everywhere,” Gomes says. The jobless rate has been falling across the board, he notes, even in troubled economies such as Italy, Spain and Portugal. “Overall, the picture is very positive so I think QE is going to be done in Europe. We’ll start seeing pressure for higher interest rates next year and maybe even this year.” Macroeconomic and Financial Markets Impact The conventional view of the impact of monetary policy normalization is for long-term interest rates to rise “substantially. I think that view overstates the Fed’s ability to control those rates,” says Wharton finance professor Nikolai Roussanov. “Ultimately, the main drivers of those rates are the market participants’ expectations of future economic growth as well as inflation. As long as both remain subdued, I don’t think we will see as massive an increase in rates as many have anticipated.” Gomes concurs. “The main impact on long-term rates … is expectations about U.S. growth,” he says. “There will be some impact of monetary policy normalization, but again it’s really important to remember that the goal of the Fed is not to have much of an impact. So the phasing out of the balance sheet expansion will be as slow as necessary to make sure there won’t be a big noticeable impact. [The FOMC] will largely follow the real economy and try not to have long-term rates move in any dramatic way. If they do, they will just step back. They will reduce the balance sheet … slowly.” He expects the Fed’s balance sheet to remain huge in the next five to 10 years — or longer. “Given how gradually the Fed has proceeded so far, the fears of painful external adjustment and a repeat of the wave of emerging market crises that we saw in the 1990s are probably misplaced.”–Nikolai Roussanov Globally, it is a different picture. The impact of the Fed’s normalization on the global markets and emerging economies could be more “profound,” Roussanov says. “During the 2013 ‘taper tantrum’ (when the Fed announced it was paring back its QE program), emerging countries and other high-yielding currencies suffered, and more outflows from those countries are likely following future Fed hikes. However, given how gradually the Fed has proceeded so far, the fears of painful external adjustment and a repeat of the wave of emerging market crises that we saw in the 1990s are probably misplaced.” Shabbir expects to see a readjustment globally, as well as “a degree of turmoil,” including the potential for a “disruptive capital flight” from developing nations. “The currencies of the developing countries may experience elevated volatility with a weakening trend against the dollar, which may increase the dollar-denominated as well as the domestic country debt — sovereign as well as corporate — of these countries, increasing their vulnerability to economic shocks.” For his part, Roussanov is not convinced that the low-growth narrative in the U.S. is entirely correct. “It’s true that growth has been slow, of course, but at the same time, we have seen huge advances in automation technology, spurred by artificial intelligence and machine learning, etc.,” he says. “While overall output growth has been slow, firms have been adopting new technologies, as evidenced by the rapid growth in the deployment of industrial robots, for example. Eventually, this has to manifest itself in rising productivity. The danger is that technological transformation will cause a massive disruption in the labor markets as U.S. workers are slow to acquire new skills.” Whatever the future impact of normalization, the Fed did what it had to do. “Post-2008 crisis, Bernanke was very innovative as he devised in real time a cure on the run since no playbook existed,” Shabbir says. “Yellen’s job may be harder as she tries to unwind the policy successfully. Both the interest rate policy and the balance sheet run-up have been unprecedented. So far, the script has played [out] rather well but the curtain is yet to fall. It appears that it will end well, but such an outcome is not guaranteed.” Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "Will the Fed and U.S. Monetary Policy Ever Get Back to ‘Normal’?."

Oil prices fell over 1 percent on concerns that output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be enough to drain a global glut that has depressed the market for almost three years. The energy sector's 0.94 percent fall led the decliners among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon was down 0.4 percent, while Chevron fell 0.2 percent. Adding to the pressure, financial stocks were down 0.5 percent. JPMorgan fell 1.1 percent, weighing the most on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs' 1.6 percent decline dragged on the Dow. Data showed core PCE price index fell to 1.5 percent in the 12 months through April from 1.6 percent in March, reinforcing views that the Federal Reserve might not raise rates again after June. "We're in a period of time where the first-quarter data was slightly weak and people are wondering if the data was an anomaly or is there something more there," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April, but the consumer confidence index fell to 117.9 in May from 119.4 in April. At 12:37 p.m. ET (1637 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.47 points, or 0.13 percent, at 21,052.81, the S&P 500 was down 1.21 points, or 0.050087 percent, at 2,414.61. The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.61 points, or 0.04 percent, at 6,207.59. The technology sector rose 0.3 percent. Apple's 0.5 percent rise was the biggest boost on the S&P and Nasdaq. Amazon was up 0.3 percent at $998.26, after briefly crossing the $1,000 mark. Alphabet's Class A shares were close behind, after hitting a record of $997.62. CardConnect's shares jumped 10.3 percent to $15.05 after First Data agreed to buy the payment processor for $750 million. First Data was up 0.8 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,770 to 1,069. On the Nasdaq, 1,824 issues fell and 926 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is likely to remain on solid ground in the wake of other reports on Tuesday that showed confidence among households still at lofty levels despite some slippage this month and strong gains in house prices in March. "Fed officials can continue with their gradual pace of rate hikes in June as the economy remains on course for stronger growth this quarter and throughout the rest of the year," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending increased 0.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in March as households spent more on both goods and services. April's increase was the biggest since December and eased concerns about second-quarter economic growth after weak reports on core capital goods orders, the goods trade deficit and inventory investment in April. Consumer spending was previously reported to have been unchanged in March. Consumer spending grew at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter, helping to restrict the increase in gross domestic product to an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year. Following April's report and upward revisions to March's data, economists said consumer spending was running at around a 3 percent rate, a sharp acceleration from the first quarter's 0.6 percent pace. GDP growth estimates for the second quarter range between a rate of 2 percent and 3.8 percent. "This takes out the downside risk to our projection for 3 percent real GDP growth this quarter, and we now see more balanced risks around that call," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower amid a drop in oil prices. The dollar .DXY dipped against a basket of currencies while U.S. government bond prices rose. TIGHTENING JOB MARKET Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published last week, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, "most participants" believed "it would soon be appropriate" to raise borrowing costs. The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points in March. Consumer spending is being boosted by a tightening labor market, which is gradually pushing up wages. Rising house prices are also supporting consumption. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 117.9 in May from 119.4 in April. The index, which hit a 16-year high of 124.9 in March, remains underpinned by labor market strength. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, recorded its second strongest reading since 2001. "Fed Chair (Janet) Yellen has in the past used the labor market differential as a check on the unemployment rate, and the reading for May should provide confirmation to Yellen and her colleagues that the economy has reached the Fed's assessment of full employment," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Expectations of further policy tightening next month are also supported by steadily rising inflation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy rebounded 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in March. But the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through April, the smallest gain since December 2015. The core PCE, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose 1.6 percent year-on-year in March. That was below the central bank's 2 percent target. "We anticipate 1.5 percent will mark the low on core PCE inflation and continue to see a move up to 2 percent next year," said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month as wages jumped 0.7 percent. Savings were little changed at $759.1 billion last month. A third report on Tuesday showed house prices increased 5.9 percent year-on-year in March.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent in morning trading to 19,657.76 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent to 5,736.30. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent to 2,351.21. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.2 percent to 25,759.49, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.5 percent at 3,124.12. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China's factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world's No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing' managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 30 cents to $49.36 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose slightly to 110.09 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro was little changed at $1.1188 from $1.1181. ___ Yuri Kageyama can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama Copyright 2017 by The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) AP Banks pull stocks away from records as 7-day streak fades By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer May 30, 2017 Updated 1 hr ago 0 Richard Drew FILE - This Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014, file photo, shows the facade of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are taking small losses Tuesday as banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. Small-company stocks are taking sharp losses as a seven-day winning streak appears to be ending. Technology companies and consumer-focused companies continue to climb and Amazon.com briefly surpassed $1,000 a share for the first time. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1 point, or 0.1 percent, to 2,414 as of 3:15 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,043. The Nasdaq composite dipped 4 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,206. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks tumbled 80 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,373. The Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq have both risen for seven days in a row, and both closed at record highs in subdued trading on Friday. THE QUOTE: JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said he thinks stocks will probably stay at high levels until more details about the Trump administration's tax proposals become public. "Barring unforeseen events, it's really going to come down to progress and details about the tax plan in my opinion," he said. "We've had this run up primarily on the fact that earnings have been good." Kinahan thinks Wall Street may wind up disappointed with any tax cuts that do pass, since whatever the administration proposes is likely to be scaled back in Congress. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.21 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. When bond yields decrease, interest rates fall along with them, and that reduces the profits banks can make from mortgages and other loans. JPMorgan Chase declined $1.38, or 1.6 percent, to $83.98. Smaller banks fell harder, as Hope Bancorp dropped 75 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $17.40 and First Financial Bancorp sank 75 cents, or 2.9 percent to $25.05. ENERGY: Oil prices finished only slightly lower, but energy companies continued to fall. Hess dropped $1.11, or 2.3 percent, to $47.04 and Exxon Mobil shed 37 cents to $81.18. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 45 cents to $51.84 a barrel in London. TURBULENCE: International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, could not bring laptops, tablets and some other devices in the cabins and had to check them instead. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. It's not clear how that might affect business travel. Delta lost $1.45, or 2.9 percent, to $49.35 and United Continental slid $2, or 2.5 percent, to $79.25. DEALING: E-commerce and payment services company First Data said it will buy payment processing company CardConnect for $15 a share in cash, or about $468 million. CardConnect's stock climbed $1.42, or 10.4 percent, to $15.08 and First Data picked up 14 cents to $16.79. Offshore drilling contractor Atwood Oceanics jumped after it agreed to be bought by Ensco PLC for $10.72 a share in stock, or $863 million. Atwood rose $1.85, or 22.8 percent, to $9.93 while U.K.-based Ensco lost 41 cents, or 6 percent, to $6.30. Cloud-based incentives company Xactly agreed to be taken private by Vista Equity Partners in a deal that values it at $15.65 a share, or $499 million. Its stock added $2.20, or 16.4 percent, to $15.60. TECH AGAIN ON TOP: Technology companies continued to lead the way. Security software maker Symantec advanced 44 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $30.05. Chipmaker Nvidia gained $2.46, or 1.7 percent, to $144.30 and Micron Technology rose 83 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $30.60. AMAZON MILESTONE: Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, peaking at $1,001.20 shortly after the market opened. Later it traded at $998.88, up $3.10 from Frida's close. The only other S&P 500 company valued at more than $1,000 a share is travel booking site Priceline, which traded at $1,855.92 on Tuesday. However Amazon has far more shares on the market than Priceline, and investors value it at $477 billion to Priceline's $90 billion. CURRENCIES: The dollar declined to 110.78 yen from 111.19 yen. The euro rose to $1.1188 from $1.1176. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline remained at $1.64 a gallon. Heating oil dipped 1 cent to $1.55 a gallon. Natural gas tumbled 17 cents, or 5 percent, to $3.15 per 1,000 cubic feet. METALS: Gold lost $5.70 to $1,265.70 an ounce. Silver added 10 cents to $17.43 an ounce. Copper held still at $2.56 a pound. OVERSEAS: The FTSE 100 index in Britain fell 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 sank 0.6 percent. Germany's DAX dipped 0.2 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 finished nearly flat and South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.4 percent. Markets in Hong Kong were closed for a holiday. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story.

U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) TOKYO (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday as worries lingered over political uncertainty in Washington and shares drooped overnight in the U.S. while China was boosted by manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent in morning trading to 19,657.76 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent to 5,736.30. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent to 2,351.21. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.2 percent to 25,759.49, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.5 percent at 3,124.12. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. × Advertisement TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China's factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world's No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing' managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 30 cents to $49.36 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose slightly to 110.09 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro was little changed at $1.1188 from $1.1181. ___ Yuri Kageyama can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Oil prices fell to keep U.S. crude CLc1 below the $50 a barrel mark on concerns output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be sufficient to lessen a global glut and signs of resurgent output in Libya. The energy sector's .SPNY 1.31 percent fall made it the worst performer among the major S&P 500 sectors. Exxon (XOM.N) was down 0.6 percent. Financial stocks, down 0.8 percent, also supplied some downward pressure. JPMorgan (JPM.N) fell 1.7 percent and Bank of America (BAC.N) lost 1.4 percent as the two biggest drags on the S&P 500. U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. "The markets are susceptible to geopolitical and to purely political risk, but in terms of the economy and in terms of earnings, we are where investors are comfortable," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. "There isn’t a huge rush to put more money into equities, there isn’t a huge rush to put more money into Treasuries - the market is treading water." Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan told CNBC that while he was concerned about the recent economic data, he expected two more rate hikes in 2017. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said a hike is probably coming soon, though the central bank may want to delay if inflation remains soft. Traders currently see an 86.6-percent chance of a quarter-point rate hike by the Fed at its June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 50.81 points, or 0.24 percent, to 21,029.47, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 2.91 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,412.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 7.01 points, or 0.11 percent, to 6,203.19. The technology sector .SPLRCT rose 0.31 percent, boosted by gains in Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), both up 0.6 percent. Amazon (AMZN.O) was up 0.1 percent at $996.70, after briefly crossing the $1,000 mark. Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Class A shares were close behind, hitting a record of $997.62 before ending the session up 0.3 percent at $996.17. Telecoms .SPLRCL jumped, up 1.4 percent, after MoffettNathanson upgraded the sector to "neutral" from "underweight," citing a lack of negative near-term catalysts. CardConnect's (CCN.O) shares jumped 10.3 percent to $15.05 after First Data (FDC.N) agreed to buy the payment processor for $750 million. First Data closed up 1.1 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 5.68 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.69 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) comments NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are lower Tuesday as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. Technology companies and consumer-focused companies continue to climb and Amazon.com briefly surpassed $1,000 a share for the first time. The losses threaten a seven-day winning streak for major stock indexes. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412 as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,037. The Nasdaq composite dipped 6 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,204. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks tumbled 9 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,372. About two-thirds of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange were trading lower around midday. The Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq have both risen for seven days in a row, and both closed at record highs Friday. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 63 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $49.17 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 85 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.79 a barrel in London. Hess dropped $1.58, or 3.3 percent, to $46.57 and Exxon Mobil shed 37 cents to $81.18. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.23 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. When bond yields decrease, interest rates fall along with them, and that reduces the profits banks can make from mortgages and other loans. PNC Financial Services gave up $2.05, or 1.7 percent, to $119.27 and JPMorgan Chase declined 72 cents to $84.64. TURBULENCE: International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, could not bring laptops, tablets and some other devices in the cabins and had to check them instead. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. It's not clear how that might affect business travel, and Delta lost $1.50, or 3 percent, to $49.30. United Continental slid $1.81, or 2.2 percent, to $79.44 and American gave up 69 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $48.06. DEALING: E-commerce and payment services company First Data said it will buy payment processing company CardConnect for $15 a share in cash, or about $468 million. CardConnect's stock climbed $1.38, or 10.1 percent, to $15.03 and First Data picked up 13 cents to $16.77. Offshore drilling contractor Atwood Oceanics jumped after it agreed to be bought by Ensco PLC for $10.72 a share in stock, or $863 million. Atwood rose $2.03, or 25.1 percent, to $10.11 while U.K.-based Ensco lost 28 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $6.42. Cloud-based incentives company Xactly agreed to be taken private by Vista Equity Partners in a deal that values it at $15.65 a share, or $499 million. Its stock added $2.20, or 16.4 percent, to $15.60. AMAZON MILESTONE: Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, peaking at $1,001.20 shortly after the market opened. Later it traded at $998.40, up $2.62 from Frida's close. The only other S&P 500 company valued at more than $1,000 a share is travel booking site Priceline, which traded at about $1,846 on Tuesday. TECH AGAIN ON TOP: Technology companies continued to lead the way. Security software maker Symantec advanced 63 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $30.24. Chipmaker Nvidia gained $3.27, or 2.3 percent, to $145.11 and Micron Technology rose 70 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $30.46. CONSUMERS: The Commerce Department said consumer spending grew 0.4 percent in April, another hint that the economy is rebounding after a sluggish start to this year. Consumer spending is responsible for 70 percent of economic activity. An important measurement of inflation rose in April and it's up 1.7 percent in the last year. That's still below the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. The Conference Board, a business research group, said consumers were slightly less confident in May for the second month in a row. However they remain optimistic by historical standards. CURRENCIES: The dollar declined to 110.86 yen from 111.19 yen. The euro rose to $1.1184 from $1.1176. OVERSEAS: The FTSE 100 index in Britain fell 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 sank 0.6 percent. Germany's DAX dipped 0.2 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 finished nearly flat and South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.4 percent. Markets in Hong Kong were closed for a holiday. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.23 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. When bond yields decrease, interest rates fall along with them, and that reduces the profits banks can make from mortgages and other loans. PNC Financial Services gave up $2.05, or 1.7 percent, to $119.27 and JPMorgan Chase declined 72 cents to $84.64. TURBULENCE: International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, could not bring laptops, tablets and some other devices in the cabins and had to check them instead. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. It’s not clear how that might affect business travel, and Delta lost $1.50, or 3 percent, to $49.30. United Continental slid $1.81, or 2.2 percent, to $79.44 and American gave up 69 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $48.06. DEALING: E-commerce and payment services company First Data said it will buy payment processing company CardConnect for $15 a share in cash, or about $468 million. CardConnect’s stock climbed $1.38, or 10.1 percent, to $15.03 and First Data picked up 13 cents to $16.77. Offshore drilling contractor Atwood Oceanics jumped after it agreed to be bought by Ensco PLC for $10.72 a share in stock, or $863 million. Atwood rose $2.03, or 25.1 percent, to $10.11 while U.K.-based Ensco lost 28 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $6.42. Cloud-based incentives company Xactly agreed to be taken private by Vista Equity Partners in a deal that values it at $15.65 a share, or $499 million. Its stock added $2.20, or 16.4 percent, to $15.60. AMAZON MILESTONE: Online retail giant Amazon.com traded above $1,000 a share for the first time, peaking at $1,001.20 shortly after the market opened. Later it traded at $998.40, up $2.62 from Frida’s close. The only other S&P 500 company valued at more than $1,000 a share is travel booking site Priceline, which traded at about $1,846 on Tuesday. TECH AGAIN ON TOP: Technology companies continued to lead the way. Security software maker Symantec advanced 63 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $30.24. Chipmaker Nvidia gained $3.27, or 2.3 percent, to $145.11 and Micron Technology rose 70 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $30.46. CONSUMERS: The Commerce Department said consumer spending grew 0.4 percent in April, another hint that the economy is rebounding after a sluggish start to this year. Consumer spending is responsible for 70 percent of economic activity. An important measurement of inflation rose in April and it’s up 1.7 percent in the last year. That’s still below the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. The Conference Board, a business research group, said consumers were slightly less confident in May for the second month in a row. However they remain optimistic by historical standards. CURRENCIES: The dollar declined to 110.86 yen from 111.19 yen. The euro rose to $1.1184 from $1.1176. OVERSEAS: The FTSE 100 index in Britain fell 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 sank 0.6 percent. Germany’s DAX dipped 0.2 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 finished nearly flat and South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.4 percent. Markets in Hong Kong were closed for a holiday.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# 3 years of Modi govt Manchester terror attack Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Technology News WRAPUP 2-U.S. consumer spending, inflation data support Fed rate hike case Shares0 Tue, 30 May 2017-09:18pm , Reuters U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to firming domestic demand that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is likely to remain on solid ground in the wake of other reports on Tuesday that showed confidence among households still at lofty levels despite some slippage this month and strong gains in house prices in March. "Fed officials can continue with their gradual pace of rate hikes in June as the economy remains on course for stronger growth this quarter and throughout the rest of the year," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending increased 0.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in March as households spent more on both goods and services. April's increase was the biggest since December and eased concerns about second-quarter economic growth after weak reports on core capital goods orders, the goods trade deficit and inventory investment in April. Consumer spending was previously reported to have been unchanged in March. Consumer spending grew at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter, helping to restrict the increase in gross domestic product to an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year. Following April's report and upward revisions to March's data, economists said consumer spending was running at around a 3 percent rate, a sharp acceleration from the first quarter's 0.6 percent pace. GDP growth estimates for the second quarter range between a rate of 2 percent and 3.8 percent. "This takes out the downside risk to our projection for 3 percent real GDP growth this quarter, and we now see more balanced risks around that call," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower amid a drop in oil prices. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies while U.S. government bond prices rose. TIGHTENING JOB MARKET Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published last week, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, "most participants" believed "it would soon be appropriate" to raise borrowing costs. The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points in March. Consumer spending is being boosted by a tightening labor market, which is gradually pushing up wages. Rising house prices are also supporting consumption. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 117.9 in May from 119.4 in April. The index, which hit a 16-year high of 124.9 in March, remains underpinned by labor market strength. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, recorded its second strongest reading since 2001. "Fed Chair (Janet) Yellen has in the past used the labor market differential as a check on the unemployment rate, and the reading for May should provide confirmation to Yellen and her colleagues that the economy has reached the Fed's assessment of full employment," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Expectations of further policy tightening next month are also supported by steadily rising inflation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy rebounded 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in March. But the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through April, the smallest gain since December 2015. The core PCE, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose 1.6 percent year-on-year in March. That was below the central bank's 2 percent target. "We anticipate 1.5 percent will mark the low on core PCE inflation and continue to see a move up to 2 percent next year," said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month as wages jumped 0.7 percent. Savings were little changed at $759.1 billion last month. A third report on Tuesday showed house prices increased 5.9 percent year-on-year in March. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

Oil prices fell over 1 percent on concerns that output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be enough to drain a global glut that has depressed the market for almost three years. The energy sector's 1.04 percent fall led the decliners among the major S&P 500 sectors. Oil majors Chevron and Exxon were down about 0.5 percent. Adding to the pressure, financial stocks were down 0.8 percent. JPMorgan fell 0.8 percent, weighing the most on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs' 1.3 percent fall dragged on the Dow. Data showed core PCE price index fell to 1.5 percent in the 12 months through April from 1.6 percent in March, reinforcing views that the Federal Reserve might not raise rates again after June. "We're in a period of time where the first-quarter data was slightly weak and people are wondering if the data was an anomaly or is there something more there," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.

Oil prices fell over 1 percent on concerns that output cuts by the world's big exporters may not be enough to drain a global glut that has depressed the market for almost three years. The energy sector's 1.04 percent fall led the decliners among the major S&P 500 sectors. Oil majors Chevron and Exxon were down about 0.5 percent. Adding to the pressure, financial stocks were down 0.8 percent. JPMorgan fell 0.8 percent, weighing the most on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs' 1.3 percent fall dragged on the Dow. Data showed core PCE price index fell to 1.5 percent in the 12 months through April from 1.6 percent in March, reinforcing views that the Federal Reserve might not raise rates again after June. "We're in a period of time where the first-quarter data was slightly weak and people are wondering if the data was an anomaly or is there something more there," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.

U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) TOKYO — Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday as worries lingered over political uncertainty in Washington and shares drooped overnight in the U.S. while China was boosted by manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 per cent to 19,628.57 in afternoon trading, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added nearly 0.2 per cent to 5,726.80. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.1 per cent to 2,345.58. Hong Kong's Hang Seng inched down nearly 0.1 per cent to 25,689.95, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.2 per cent at 3,115.33. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 6,203.19. TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China's factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world's No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing' managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: "This suggests further stablization of the world's second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country's heightened debts," Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 29 cents to $49.37 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 110.94 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro slipped to $1.1172 from $1.1181. ___ Yuri Kageyama can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *   Previous Next     FILE - This Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014, file photo, shows the facade of the New York Stock Exchange.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) AP Banks pull stocks away from records as 7-day streak fades By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer May 30, 2017 Updated 49 min ago 0 Richard Drew FILE - This Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014, file photo, shows the facade of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are lower early Tuesday, May 30, 2017, as energy companies once again slump with the price of oil and banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are taking small losses Tuesday as banks slide in tandem with bond yields and interest rates. Small-company stocks are taking sharp losses as a seven-day winning streak appears to be ending. Technology companies and consumer-focused companies continue to climb and Amazon.com briefly surpassed $1,000 a share for the first time. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1 point, or 0.1 percent, to 2,414 as of 3:15 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,043. The Nasdaq composite dipped 4 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,206. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks tumbled 80 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,373. The Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq have both risen for seven days in a row, and both closed at record highs in subdued trading on Friday. THE QUOTE: JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said he thinks stocks will probably stay at high levels until more details about the Trump administration's tax proposals become public. "Barring unforeseen events, it's really going to come down to progress and details about the tax plan in my opinion," he said. "We've had this run up primarily on the fact that earnings have been good." Kinahan thinks Wall Street may wind up disappointed with any tax cuts that do pass, since whatever the administration proposes is likely to be scaled back in Congress. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.21 percent from 2.25 percent late Friday. When bond yields decrease, interest rates fall along with them, and that reduces the profits banks can make from mortgages and other loans. JPMorgan Chase declined $1.38, or 1.6 percent, to $83.98. Smaller banks fell harder, as Hope Bancorp dropped 75 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $17.40 and First Financial Bancorp sank 75 cents, or 2.9 percent to $25.05. ENERGY: Oil prices finished only slightly lower, but energy companies continued to fall. Hess dropped $1.11, or 2.3 percent, to $47.04 and Exxon Mobil shed 37 cents to $81.18. The S&P 500 index of energy companies reached its lowest level in a year. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 45 cents to $51.84 a barrel in London. TURBULENCE: International airlines slumped as the government considered expanding a ban on laptops from the passenger cabins of flights to the United States. In March the Trump administration said passengers flying from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East, could not bring laptops, tablets and some other devices in the cabins and had to check them instead. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that ban might be expanded to all international flights to and from the U.S. It's not clear how that might affect business travel. Delta lost $1.45, or 2.9 percent, to $49.35 and United Continental slid $2, or 2.5 percent, to $79.25. DEALING: E-commerce and payment services company First Data said it will buy payment processing company CardConnect for $15 a share in cash, or about $468 million.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The California Economic Summit To Be Held In San Diego For The First Time SAN DIEGO, May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — The sixth annual California Economic Summit, the only statewide and multi-sector effort to promote economic security, will be held in San Diego on November 2-3, 2017. Through the Summit, a vibrant and diverse network of business, education, government and civic leaders are advancing a comprehensive agenda to reduce poverty, improve workforce opportunities, increase the supply of housing, lower the cost of living, and invest in communities and infrastructure necessary for a sustainable future. Earlier this year, a cadre of San Diego leaders took the initiative to bring the 2017 Summit to their region to continue the Summit’s strategy of using regional solutions to drive state policy. „I thought we had innovations here in San Diego, not only in housing but job creation and water management to showcase to the rest of the state, so I actively pursued this opportunity,” said Jennifer LeSar, who has been involved in the Summit’s Housing Action Team and was instrumental in the launch of Housing You Matters, a San Diego coalition working to improve housing affordability. „We have a diverse economy and are interested in developing more momentum for meeting the challenges for not only our region but for the entire state of California to successfully compete in the global economy.” Since 2012 the Summit’s robust network of civic, business and government leaders have been refining and promoting the Roadmap to Shared Prosperity. Among the accomplishments are the passage of $200 million Strong Workforce Program, which forged and funded new partnerships among community colleges, employers and students to help produce 1 million more skilled workers over the next decade. Summit leaders also helped to develop and are implementing Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) to encourage local governments to work together to finance economic development projects. „JPMorgan Chase is delighted to participate in this very important conversation and action agenda about our state’s future,” said Kari Decker, Managing Director of the Office of Corporate Responsibility for JPMorgan Chase in the Western Region. „We are well aware that the cost of living here, especially housing, is rising faster than wages, that many workers require new skills to qualify for better-paying jobs and that state, regional and community leaders need to better collaborate to help build a stronger economy. This summit is a critical component of that collective effort.” The Summit has long been focused on California’s economic equality and defining steps that need to be taken to expand the middle class through a triple-bottom-line strategy that simultaneously grows the economy, improves environmental quality and increases opportunity for all. The Summit’s 2017 Roadmap to Shared Prosperity defines an action plan to address the One Million Challenges, a Summit initiative launched in response to the state’s high cost of living and wage gaps: Produce one million more skilled workers Build one million more housing units Save, capture, and reuse one million acre-feet of water annually Eighteen million Californians live below or near the poverty line. A lack of upward mobility is keeping Californians from achieving all they want for themselves, their children and their grandchildren. Building pathways to increase upward mobility is critical for the state’s future. „We know that Californians are inspired to act on this critically important issue,” said Jim Mayer, CA Fwd President and Chief Executive Officer. „The Summit, with its regional infrastructure and state influence, is best suited to develop and promote a unifying solution.” The California Economic Summit was developed by CA Fwd and the California Stewardship Network. ABOUT CA FWD California Forward (CA Fwd) is a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization, devoted to improving the performance of government in California. It believes that increased emphasis on accountability and transparency will create government that Californians deserve and expect. CA Fwd strongly advocates for confidence and trust in elected officials as being an essential ingredient to good government.  ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA STEWARDSHIP NETWORK The California Stewardship Network was created in 2008, when a group of diverse regions across California were inspired by Becky Morgan to come together to establish an alliance of regional partnerships to tackle the state’s most pressing economic, environmental and community challenges.

South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.3 percent to 2,351.21. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.2 percent to 25,759.49, while the Shanghai Composite was up nearly 0.5 percent at 3,124.12. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 2.91 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,412.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,029.47. The Nasdaq composite dipped 7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,203.19. TRUMP FACTOR: An ongoing probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election has set off uncertainty about the administration of President Donald Trump. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has decided to provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee, while Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the investigation. Advertisement CHINA DATA: An official monthly survey showed that growth in China’s factory activity was steady last month in a sign that the recovery in the world’s No. 2 economy is holding up. The purchasing’ managers index, or PMI, released Wednesday came in at 51.2 for May. THE QUOTE: “This suggests further stablization of the world’s second largest economy and will allow policy makers more room to carry out the de-leverage campaign in an attempt to reduce the country’s heightened debts,” Margaret Yang Yan, analyst with CMC Markets Singapore, said of the China data. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 30 cents to $49.36 a barrel in New York. It lost 14 cents to $49.66 a barrel Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 30 cents to $51.94 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose slightly to 110.09 yen from 111.07 yen late Tuesday in Asia. The euro was little changed at $1.1188 from $1.1181. ___ Yuri Kageyama can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama Related Topics Business News Technology News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Business News » Asian stocks mixed amid… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Top Stories Senior OSC employee blows the whistle on whistleblower protection agency Top Story 12 key takeaways from the 2018 budget that could affect you Budget Cuts to EPA’s workforce harm the agency’s mission — or do they?

"Extraordinary measures are suitable for extraordinary times and categorically we are not in extraordinary times now. Look at the euro zone economy, it's on fire, growth is way above trend and it's shooting the lights out, so it does look a little weird," Nick Gartside, the international chief investment officer at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC on Tuesday. Speaking to a European Parliament committee on economic affairs on Monday, the ECB president argued that extraordinary monetary policies are still needed in order to raise inflation. "For domestic price pressures to strengthen, we still need very accommodative financing conditions, which are themselves dependent on a fairly substantial amount of monetary accommodation," he said, according to Reuters. Alex Kraus | Bloomberg via Getty Images His words, intended to temper expectations of any policy move by the central bank in June, weighed on the euro and seen European bond yields tick higher. The common currency earlier on Tuesday hit a more than one-week low of $1.111 against the dollar, although has since recovered to around $1.117. The euro shot higher Tuesday afternoon on a report by Reuters that said, citing unnamed sources, that ECB policymakers could discuss dropping its pledges to increase stimulus during their regular meeting next week. These price movements come as the ECB's official stance on dovish, ultra-loose monetary policy comes under increasingly heavy criticism. Jens Weidmann, Germany's representative on the ECB's Governing Council and president of the Bundesbank, said the current expansive monetary policy is "appropriate in principle" but also asked when the central bank would start to normalize. "As a result of the economic recovery and a predicted inflation rate of almost 2 percent in 2019, it is quite legitimate to ask when the Governing Council should consider monetary policy normalization," he said in Berlin on Monday, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, JPMorgan's Gartside, highlights that Draghi's dovish comments are starting to look a little bit odd, but underlines a potential reason for his stance. "Maybe the ECB are very wary of doing a 2011, and remember that was the year when they hiked rates in April, hiked rates in July, to cut them by the end of the year," he told CNBC. show chapters Euro zone economy is on fire: JPMAM    23 Hours Ago | 03:03 Paul Donovan, UBS chief economist, also weighed in, joking that Draghi has not begun his rehabilitation program to overcome his "addiction to easing." "Draghi told the European Parliament yesterday (Monday) that he did not have an easing problem, that it was only recreational easing and he could quit anytime that he wished to. It was just that he did not wish to," he said in his daily audio comment on Tuesday. Donovan believes the rest of the Governing Council will not allow Draghi to get away with aggressive dovishness for much longer. He predicts the ECB is likely to organically tighten policy in 2018, reducing the ECB balance sheet as a proportion of GDP (gross domestic product). The debate at the central bank seems to be shifting from if and when the central bank will begin normalization, to how quickly. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Omega Announces Closing of New and Amended Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities; Acquisition and Lease of 18 Facilities In UK; Corrects Market Rumor Related to Signature Healthcare May 30, 2017 09:16 AM Eastern Daylight Time HUNT VALLEY, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--New and Amended Credit Facilities. Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (NYSE:OHI) today announced that it has entered into (a) a new $1.8 billion senior unsecured revolving and term loan credit facility, comprised of a $1.25 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), a $425 million U.S. Dollar senior unsecured term loan facility (the “U.S. Dollar Term Loan Facility”), and a £100 million Pounds Sterling senior unsecured term loan facility (the “Sterling Term Loan Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the U.S. Dollar Term Loan Facility, collectively, the “REIT Credit Facilities”) and (b) an amended and restated $250 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the “Amended and Restated Term Loan”). In addition, Omega also announced that its subsidiary, OHI Healthcare Properties Limited Partnership (“OHI LP”), has entered into a new $100 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the “OHI LP Credit Facility”). Each of the new and amended credit facilities were effective May 25, 2017. The overall syndication of the REIT Credit Facilities and the OHI LP Credit Facility raised commitments of over $2.8 billion. The REIT Credit Facilities replace Omega’s previous $2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit and term loan credit facility (the “2014 Credit Facility”), part of which (a $200 million term loan due June 27, 2017) was previously repaid from proceeds of Omega’s $700 million senior notes offering in April 2017. The REIT Credit Facilities include an “accordion feature” that permits the Company to expand its borrowing capacity to an aggregate of not more than $2.5 billion. The Amended and Restated Term Loan amends and restates Omega’s previous $250 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the “2015 Term Loan”) to implement certain modifications to the terms and conditions similar to those now in the REIT Credit Facilities and the OHI LP Credit Facility. The OHI LP Credit Facility replaces OHI LP’s previous $100 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the “2015 OHI LP Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility is priced at LIBOR plus an applicable percentage (currently at 125 basis points, with a range of 87.5 to 165 basis points) based on the Company’s ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and/or Fitch Ratings, plus a facility fee based on the same ratings (currently 25 basis points, with a range of 12.5 to 30 basis points). The Revolving Credit Facility will be used for (a) refinancing existing indebtedness, (b) financing acquisitions, and (c) funding working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. At May 25, 2017, the Company had $333 million in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, of which $100 million was repaid on May 26, 2017. The Revolving Credit Facility matures in four years, on May 25, 2021, with two options by the Company to extend the maturity six additional months for each option. The U.S. Dollar Term Loan Facility, the Sterling Term Loan Facility, and the OHI LP Credit Facility are each priced at LIBOR plus an applicable percentage (currently at 145 basis points, with a range of 90 to 190 basis points) based on the Company’s ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and/or Fitch Ratings. The U.S. Dollar Term Loan Facility, the Sterling Term Loan Facility, and the OHI LP Credit Facility each mature in five years, on May 25, 2022, and will be used to refinance existing indebtedness. Neither the Company nor OHI LP experienced any material early termination penalties due to the termination of the 2014 Credit Facility and the 2015 OHI LP Credit Facility in connection with the effectiveness of the REIT Credit Facilities and the OHI LP Credit Facility. For the three month period ending June 30, 2017, the Company expects to record a one-time, non-cash charge of approximately $5.5 million relating to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the termination of the 2014 Credit Facility. The REIT Credit Facilities are made up of a syndication of financial institutions. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated is Joint Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner. Bank of America, N.A. is the Administrative Agent. Citizens Bank, National Association, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are Joint Lead Arrangers and Co-Syndication Agents.

United Kingdom (“UK”) Transaction. Omega also announced the completion of an acquisition and lease transaction with Gold Care Homes, a provider of care home services to the elderly in the UK. The transaction, which closed on May 11, 2017, for approximately $113 million, included 18 UK-based care home facilities and continues Omega’s expansion in the UK. Gold Care Homes is the second care home operator to be backed by Omega in the UK and this transaction follows similar transactions involving 35 care home facilities with its other UK care home operator, Healthcare Homes Group. Omega has now acquired a total of 53 care home facilities in the UK. Signature Holdings II LLC. Recent media coverage relating to one of Omega’s operators, Signature Holdings II LLC, inaccurately reported that Omega had engaged Alvarez & Marsal as a financial adviser in relation to matters involving Omega’s Signature Holdings II LLC-operated facilities. “While we do not provide financial information regarding our specific operators, the media report that we retained a financial adviser with regard to our facilities operated by Signature is simply false. We have a large and diverse portfolio comprised of approximately 1,000 properties located in 42 states and the UK and operated by 77 different operators. No single operator comprises more than 10% of our total portfolio based on rent and this diversification minimizes the potential for an adverse impact associated with any single operator encountering financial difficulties. Our management team has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to effectively address and resolve issues encountered by our operators and Omega’s credit quality, financial strength, and conservative balance sheet management are reflected in the favorable terms of the REIT Credit Facilities and the OHI LP Credit Facility,” stated Taylor Pickett, Omega’s President and CEO. Omega is a real estate investment trust investing in and providing financing to the long-term care industry. As of March 31, 2017, Omega has a portfolio of investments that includes approximately 1,000 properties located in 42 states and the United Kingdom and operated by 77 different operators. This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements regarding Omega’s or its tenants’, operators’, borrowers’ or managers’ expected future financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, funds from operations, dividends and dividend plans, financing opportunities and plans, capital markets transactions, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, operating metrics, capital expenditures, competitive positions, acquisitions, investment opportunities, dispositions, merger integration, growth opportunities, expected lease income, continued qualification as a REIT, plans and objectives of management for future operations and statements that include words such as “anticipate,” “if,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “will” and other similar expressions are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from Omega’s expectations. Omega does not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. Omega’s actual results may differ materially from those reflected in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things: (i) uncertainties relating to the business operations of the operators of Omega’s properties, including those relating to reimbursement by third-party payors, regulatory matters and occupancy levels; (ii) regulatory and other changes in the healthcare sector; (iii) changes in the financial position of Omega’s operators; (iv) the ability of any of Omega’s operators in bankruptcy to reject unexpired lease obligations, modify the terms of Omega’s mortgages and impede the ability of to collect unpaid rent or interest during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding and retain security deposits for the debtor's obligations; (v) the availability and cost of capital; (vi) changes in Omega’s credit ratings and the ratings of its debt securities; (vii) competition in the financing of healthcare facilities; (viii) Omega’s ability to maintain its status as a REIT; (ix) Omega’s ability to manage, re-lease or sell any owned and operated facilities, if any; (x) Omega’s ability to sell closed or foreclosed assets on a timely basis and on terms that allow Omega to realize the carrying value of these assets; (xi) the effect of economic and market conditions generally, and particularly in the healthcare industry; (xii) the potential impact of changes in the skilled nursing facility and assisted living facility markets or local real estate conditions on the Company’s ability to dispose of assets held for sale for the anticipated proceeds or on a timely basis, or to redeploy the proceeds therefrom on favorable terms; and (xiii) other factors identified in Omega’s filings with the SEC.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# 3 years of Modi govt Manchester terror attack Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Business News GLOBAL MARKETS-Europe feels the heat as political temperatures rise Shares0 Tue, 30 May 2017-04:21pm , Reuters European shares fell for a fourth day running on Tuesday and the euro was battling to avoid a similar fate, as the prospect of early Italian elections and Greece's ongoing struggles nudged up the political temperature gauge again. The region's banks also came under pressure as Deutsche Bank cut the sector to 'underweight', while sterling rebounded having been knocked recently by signs that next week's UK election is set to be closer than originally expected. All this drove the traditional safe-haven assets of gold and the Japanese yen higher and briefly pushed yields low-risk German government bonds to their lowest in more than a month. Low inflation readings out of Spain and Germany, as well as European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi's commitment to continued stimulus in a speech on Monday, helped keep the euro subdued at $1.116. At the heart of the moves, however, were signs that elections in Italy may now come as early as September, after the 5-Star Movement became the fourth big party to back a switch to a proportional electoral system. Italian shares remained flat having slumped 2 percent on Monday and southern euro zone bonds were also pushed into the red again. "We always knew Italy was going to come back into the market's sights but I think people thought we would have a longer stay of execution," said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley. "It does seem like the market will have to face worries about elections and populism again over the summer. That of course is a drag for the euro." In spite of the weakness seen in the last couple of weeks, the pan-European STOXX 600 index is still set to end May in positive territory and near a 2-year high. It will also be the index's fourth straight month of gains. Investors however are reshuffling their portfolios as they seek fresh catalysts following a surprisingly strong earnings season and hot streak of euro zone macro economic data. European equity strategists at Deutsche Bank downgraded banks to 'underweight' saying the sector's valuations - which have soared around 80 percent over the last year - were no longer "compelling". They also cut tech firms to neutral and JP Morgan's analysts did the same to carmakers. At the same time Deutsche upgraded construction and energy stocks to 'overweight' while JP Morgan raised UK stocks to neutral saying they were at the cheapest-ever levels on price price-to-book basis relative to region. "We think UK is becoming interesting in the regional allocation again," JPMorgan's strategists, led by Mislav Matejka, said in a note to clients. "(The) UK is a defensive market with high dividend yield. It should perform better in the backdrop of potential softening in activity indicators, lower inflation prints and continued range-bound bond yields." GOLD SHINES Greece's debt problems also continued to simmer after it failed to reach a deal on its next installment of its bailout programme earlier this month. Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos on Tuesday dismissed reports in Germany's Bild newspaper, that the country could opt out of receiving the new tranche if it does not receive clearer debt relief terms. The dollar index, under pressure over the past fortnight from concerns over the Trump administration's difficulties, gained around 0.2 percent in early trade in Europe. In commodities, oil prices retreated around 40 cents a barrel, as concerns lingered about whether the extension of output cuts by OPEC and other producing countries will be enough to support prices. Global benchmark Brent fell 0.8 percent to $51.90 and U.S. crude futures slipped about 0.4 percent to $49.60 a barrel. Gold meanwhile rose to a one-month high of $1,270 an ounce before it ran out of steam. It has risen almost five percent over the last three weeks as stock markets and other risk plays favoured by traders have stuttered. Risk surrounding the closeness of Britain's upcoming elections, the prospect of early elections in Italy and worries over Greek debt were supporting gold, said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA. "The picture will get more muddy as the week goes on as we have a lot of data from around the world coming in," he said.

While the brokerage may point to the controversy swirling around the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, and while one might argue the merits of Vanguard’s funds, the truth is likely much simpler: Vanguard’s refusal to pay Morgan Stanley for access to their clients. Because Vanguard won’t pay Morgan Stanley MS, -1.31%  , Morgan Stanley won’t pay brokers to recommend Vanguard’s funds. What goes around, comes around. Coincidentally, this development arrives on the heels of Morgan Stanley’s settlement with Massachusetts securities regulators over allegations that the company ran an improper sales contest to boost their securities-based (margin) loan book. It is common knowledge that margin loans are one of the most profitable brokerage products, so at least there is some form of perverse logic at work here. Not so with the Vanguard decision. Does this sound familiar? It should. In 1995, one of Morgan Stanley’s acquisitions, Dean Witter, folded under intense media pressure and ended the practice of “differentiated commissions” (paying brokers higher commissions to steer clients into proprietary mutual funds). The details of these two breaches of client trust differ, but the core behavior is identical — distorting investor advice through ethically questionable compensation schemes. Morgan Stanley is hardly alone. Just two examples: Wells Fargo WFC, -0.48%  opened more than 2.2 million fake accounts to fulfill employee sales incentives. Since the scandal came to light in September 2016, more than 5,000 employees have lost their jobs — including then-CEO John Stumpf. J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -1.71%  in 2015 was fined $307 million to settle accusations regarding improperly steering clients.to the company’s own — more expensive — mutual funds and hedge funds. The list of instances where banks and brokers have placed their interests before their clients is both impressive and depressing. But I shouldn’t really be surprised, as I witnessed with increasing dismay these practices occurring with accelerating frequency during a 30-year career in the investment business. (And I am not surprised that these same firms oppose adopting a fiduciary standard for brokers.) I eventually felt compelled to abandon the traditional broker-dealer world to join an independent registered investment adviser, The Caprock Group. Brokerage firms have a long history of pushing product, as investment banking, capital markets, sales and trading businesses each function as competing, stand-alone profit centers within larger organizations. In concert, they manufacture products which are then distributed to customers of the firms. The primary source of revenue for each of these profit centers? Those same customers. No amount of disclosure can entirely mitigate such misaligned incentives. Read: Still wondering what the fiduciary rule is? You’re not alone Perhaps the best example of this dysfunction is what is known as “open architecture” — terminology used by many firms to imply impartiality. But in reality their platforms are open only to investment managers willing to pay annual pay-to-play fees ranging from $250,000 to more than $1 million. Bank ownership adds yet another layer of potential conflict as firms squeeze ever more revenue from existing clients by cross selling them everything from checking accounts to credit cards, regardless of whether doing so is in the client’s best interest. As a result, brokers and bankers are accountable to their firm’s revenue goals and may be forbidden to advise on assets not held at the firm — even if those might be the best solutions for clients. It is critical to understand how much you are paying, to whom, and for what. The problem is that fees are often intentionally opaque. For example, UBS’s 2017 fee disclosure document is 33 pages long; Morgan Stanley’s runs 26 pages. Complicating matters is that many advisers simply dodge the question (or, worse, don’t know the answers). So how does an investor pierce the fog? Essentially, there are two types of fees. One is for advice. The other is for products. Both are rational. But both must be fully disclosed and understood. Brokers and bankers must outline every cost and expense borne by each investment they recommend. And if they recommend credit cards, margin loans, insurance products, or structured notes, they must both explain the investment rationale and justify the additional expense. Why? Because the impact of fees on performance is significant. A 1.5% fee difference over 20 years on a $1 million investment earning 6% is more than $700,000, consuming almost three-quarters of the value of the initial investment. Investors don’t need to be sold. They need to be advised. This is the age of transparency. Every investor has a right to clearly understand the fees and conflicts of interest that are present in the management of their investments. Every investor should insist that they be advised by a fiduciary. Every investor needs an advocate who can source, vet, and recommend the most efficient and cost-effective solutions available to help them achieve their goals. Investors don’t need to be sold. They need to be advised. And they need to know that their adviser’s interests are aligned with their own. In fact, aligned interests are now table stakes in the financial services world. From there, investment acumen, sophistication, capacity for independent thought and action, and a relentless fiduciary ethic are what divides great advisers from the rest. And every investor has the right to a great adviser. Greg Mech is a managing director at The Caprock Group.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman INTRODUCTION OF REVISED DISCOUNT CONTROL POLICY JPMORGAN GLOBAL CONVERTIBLES INCOME FUND LIMITED   Legal Entity Identifier: 549300FIUYKKL39ILD07   INTRODUCTION OF REVISED DISCOUNT CONTROL POLICY   The information contained within this announcement constitutes inside information. JPMorgan Global Convertibles Income Fund Limited (the „Company”) provides investors with exposure to a globally diversified portfolio of convertible bonds and the portfolio has been constructed to deliver an attractive level of yield with the potential for some capital growth.  Since IPO in June 2013, the Company has delivered on its mandate, maintaining its target yield of 4.5 pence per annum and generating NAV performance, on a total return basis, ahead of its benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays Credit Sensitive Convertibles Index (hedged into Sterling).  However, the Board is concerned that, for a low-volatility asset class, the level of movement in the Company’s share price, with the Company’s shares having traded, since IPO, at both high premiums and relatively wide discounts, has significantly increased the overall volatility of shareholder returns. While the Company’s discount has narrowed in recent months to its current level of approximately 5%, it is the Board’s view that the Company’s share price should, ideally, more closely track the Company’s NAV than it has done to date. With this in mind, the Board, with immediate effect, has introduced a revised discount control policy under which the Board intends to seek to ensure that the Company’s share price remains close to NAV such that, in normal market conditions, the Company’s shares trade within a range of a 2 per cent. discount to a 2 per cent. premium to the Company’s cum income NAV per share. This will be achieved primarily through the use of share buybacks and/or share issuance as necessary. The person responsible for arranging for the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Rhys Williams of JPMorgan Funds Limited, Company Secretary.   30 May 2017   For further information, please contact:   Rhys Williams JPMorgan Funds Limited +44 (0)20 7742 4000   Joe Winkley Neil Morgan Winterflood Securities Limited +44 (0)20 3100 0000 CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious NAV Update and Dividend Declaration Next PostNext Global Brain Monitoring Devices Market competitive landscape and Global Trends to 2022 Projects the Market to Reach USD XX.XX Billion By 2022 Search Recent Posts Tetra Bio-Pharma Strengthens its Board with the Appointment of Dr. Bill Cheliak Element Issues US$1.2 Billion of Rated ABS Term Notes Through Chesapeake II SMART Global Holdings, Inc.
