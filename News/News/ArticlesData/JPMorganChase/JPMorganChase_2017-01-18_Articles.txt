Business Home LBoard Universiti Malaya denies it is going bankrupt FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Capital curbs push Chinese firms to risky, costly dollar bonds Reuters | January 18, 2017 JPMorgan analysts, using their own dataset, are forecasting another rise this year, even though many economists expect the yuan to fall further, making the loans more expensive to service and repay. SHANGHAI: China’s efforts to support its currency and cool its hot property market are encouraging more Chinese companies, including many state firms, to take on extra cost and risk by raising foreign-currency bonds in Hong Kong and other offshore locations. Despite the yuan’s nearly 7 percent slump against the dollar in 2016, Chinese companies including state-owned Bank of China raised a record US$111 billion in offshore dollar bonds, according to data from Dealogic, up from US$88 billion in 2015. JPMorgan analysts, using their own dataset, are forecasting another rise this year, even though many economists expect the yuan to fall further, making the loans more expensive to service and repay. The list includes issuers who need dollars to pay for overseas acquisitions and deals but are unable to use their yuan after China tightened its grip on capital outflows last year to support the currency. “It’s getting increasingly difficult to move money out,” said Shen Weizheng, fund manager at Ivy Capital, which invests in stocks and bonds in Hong Kong. “So for Chinese companies eager to invest overseas, the dollar bond market becomes an easier funding avenue.” State firms are also doing so because the government has made it easier for them to tap offshore markets, and there is pressure on them to bring more dollars onshore, investment bankers said. Some property firms have also been left with little choice but to raise money offshore as government measures to contain a property bubble have included lending restrictions onshore. Both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have tightened bond issuance rules for real estate firms since October, and regulators have repeatedly urged Chinese lenders to restrict property lending. Chinese property developers have US$7.9 billion in loans falling due in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data, which could push more into offshore markets if they need refinancing. On top of the exchange risks, the borrowers also have to swallow much higher borrowing costs. China Evergrande Group pays a 7 percent yield on its dollar bonds in Hong Kong, but just 3 percent in China, while China Aoyuan Property Group raised US$250 million through three-year bonds in early January, paying 6.35 percent, almost double the average yield on yuan bonds onshore. Despite the cost, more issuers are lining up for after the Chinese New Year in late January. A fund manager at Invesco Asset Management in Hong Kong said his firm had signed confidential agreements with 10 Chinese issuers to become their cornerstone investor. Fast track An underwriter who helps Chinese firms issue dollar bonds said state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were keen to issue dollar bonds partly because “the central government is encouraging them to bring dollars back to China, and SOEs are not very sensitive to borrowing costs”. The government fast-tracked approvals for bringing dollar bond proceeds back onshore for several state firms, in a bid to ease depreciation pressure on the yuan and slow the pace at which the country was burning through currency reserves. Previously, all SOEs needed to register their offshore debt issuance plans with China’s central planning agency, but last year it allowed 21 SOEs to proceed without registration. China’s local government financing vehicles (LGFV) have also joined this growing band of bond issuers in Hong Kong. Last January, Jiangsu NewHeadline Development, a financing vehicle of the Lianyungang municipal government in Jiangsu Province, issued US$200 million of 3-year bonds paying interest of 6.20 percent. NewHeadline, the first LGFV to sell offshore bonds, could have issued yuan bonds onshore paying around 5 percent, without the risk of the exchange rate moving against them. “I asked them: your fundamentals are not bad, so why are you willing to raise funds at a higher cost?” said a fund manager who subscribed to the bonds. “They said there was a political target to raise overseas money.” A NewHeadline official told Reuters the purpose was to “boost our overseas branding, so that more foreign investors know us”. She didn’t say why the company, which is mainly involved in infrastructure and water treatment in China, wanted overseas branding. A stream of LGFVs followed in NewHeadline’s footsteps, and the company is mulling a second offshore bond this year. The attractive yields, combined with investors’ expectations of a rising dollar, led to an increasing number of funds targeting dollar bonds in China last year. That fueled a fivefold increase in the outbound funds held in a scheme set up a decade ago to let domestic investors invest overseas, even as Beijing has suspended approvals for new quota for the scheme as part of its capital curbs. Quota holders can now rent out their quota for twice the price they could last year, such is the demand. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Keris Alison Lahiff Jan 17, 2017 9:07 PM EST A pall spread over the markets as the Trump rally came to a screeching halt on Tuesday, following uncertainty over which of the incoming president's policies were concrete and which were just bluster. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, its fifth session in six in decline. Banks JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) led the Dow's losses on Tuesday in a pullback following Friday's rally in financial stocks. The S&P 500 was down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq slid 0.6%. The Volatility Index (VIX.X) increased 6.6%. President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th President of the U.S. this Friday. His recent statements on trade policies and foreign relations only highlight the tenuous grasp anyone has on how the next 100 days will play out.  "The question surrounding the financial markets will be whether or not most of his campaign rhetoric regarding trade agreements will actually be implemented," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist, wrote in a note. "We suspect in large part it will be watered down. The mere thought of it, however, will raise the possibilities that trade wars will develop, thus bringing the world financial order closer to protectionism than at any time since the early 1930's." In an interview Friday with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said the U.S. dollar has become "too strong" and criticized China for what he sees as currency manipulation. Trump noted that U.S. "companies can't compete with [China] now because our currency is too strong and it's killing us."

Earnings applicable to common shareholders soared to $1.51 billion in the fourth quarter from $753 million a year earlier, while earnings per share increased to 81 cents from 39 cents, the bank said on Tuesday. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Bank stocks have rallied since the election, on the hope that the new Trump administration will usher in a new era of looser bank regulations along with economic growth. Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan, however, raised questions about how long this investor enthusiasm will last. "There is clearly optimism out there, but how long that holds is really a question, given that political and geopolitical events can change sentiment very quickly," Pruzan said in an interview. Trading in debt securities and stocks shot up in the wake of Donald Trump's surprise election victory on Nov. 8 as investors took the view that he would push policies that would boost the U.S. economy and kindle inflation. Revenue in the bank's fixed-income business jumped to $1.5 billion in the quarter from $550 million in the same period last year. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the No. 1 U.S. bank by assets, had reported a 31-percent rise fixed-income revenue last week, while second-ranked Bank of America Corp said its revenue from trading fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities rose 12 percent. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley's chief rival, report on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley's shares were up 1.4 percent at $44.40 in premarket trading, having risen 28.5 percent since the election through Friday's close. Revenue from equities trading, a business in which Morgan Stanley is typically strong, rose to $2 billion from $1.8 billion. Revenue from wealth management rose 6.4 percent to $3.99 billion. The pretax margin in the business increased to 22 percent from 20 percent a year earlier. Total revenue jumped 16.6 percent to $9.02 billion, beating the average estimate $8.47 billion. The bank's return on equity was 8.7 percent in the quarter, short of Chief Executive James Gorman's target of 9 percent to 11 percent by the end of 2017. Investment banking revenue, which includes income from advising on mergers and acquisitions as well as underwriting bond and share offerings, rose 5.1 percent to $1.38 billion. The bank, which has said it wants to cut costs by $1 billion this year, said non-interest expenses rose 7.6 percent to $6.78 billion in the latest quarter. Total compensation and benefits expenses rose 11.9 percent to $4.08 billion. Morgan Stanley ranked second in worldwide announced M&A deals during 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. The bank laid off a number of senior investment bankers earlier this month and cut bonuses by roughly 15 percent, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Morgan Stanley's quarterly profit doubling, lifted by bond trading revenue that nearly tripled. Trading in bonds and stocks have surged since Donald Trump's surprise election victory in November. Morgan Stanley's fixed income trading results far exceeded the healthy gains posted by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America last week. Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski called it a "solid quarter," saying, "We think stronger fixed income, currencies and commodities trading should not necessarily be seen as a fluke. .. FICC trading should be a beneficiary of higher rates, as higher rates will require more bond portfolio repositioning." Revenue also rose in the company's investment banking and wealth management businesses. Morgan Stanley's shares rose in early trading, adding on to their nearly 29 percent gain since the election. Its archrival, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup report their results on Wednesday.

"Company") today announced that it has commenced a cash tender offer (the "Tender Offer") for any and all of its outstanding 6.750% senior guaranteed notes due 2022 (the "Notes"). The Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, January 25, 2017, unless extended or earlier terminated (such time, as may be extended, the "Expiration Time"). Holders who validly tender the Notes prior to the Expiration Time will be eligible to receive $1,036.55 for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the Settlement Date (as defined below). Tendered Notes may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Time. Subject to certain market and other conditions, including the Financing Condition (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), the Company expects to accept for purchase the business day following the Expiration Time all of the Notes (the date of such acceptance, the "Acceptance Date"). Settlement of the Tender Offer is expected to occur within three business days following the Acceptance Date (the "Settlement Date"). The Company intends to redeem any Notes outstanding following the consummation of the Tender Offer that are not purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer.

The Tender Offer is not conditioned upon the tender of any minimum principal amount of Notes. The Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to amend or terminate the Tender Offer at any time.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:50 AM, January 18, 2017 LONDON — UK Prime Minister Theresa May is playing hardball as she pursues a “hard Brexit”. Her agenda is now to leave the single market, quit sending large sums of money to Brussels, clamp down on immigration and restore law-making powers to British politicians and judges. In her much-anticipated speech on how she wants to withdraw Britain from the European Union, Ms May interpreted June’s narrow vote as a clarion call for change. Instead of the EU membership that evolved over four decades, she told an audience of European diplomats in London on Tuesday that she wants to customise the customs union and deliver a “bold and ambitious” fresh trade deal with the bloc. Her ideal accord would allow tariff-free trade between Britain and the EU, while she would secure the liberty to strike new pacts with other countries. London-based banks could still provide services across the continent with ease and get time to adjust to the new order. Ms May’s speech put to rest recent suggestions that the premier should be dubbed “Theresa Maybe”, for being too cautious to act. Having slid ahead of it on concern over what she had planned, the pound enjoyed its biggest surge against the dollar since 2008 on the guarantee of a vote in Parliament. Her aim is to achieve her wish list in the two years allocated for divorce talks despite scepticism that is possible, given that any trade pact would need the sign-off of all 27 EU members. Failure to get what she wants would mean her taking the UK out of Europe with “no deal” at all, she said. FALL-BACK POSITION “One might expect a successful negotiating strategy to have ambitious objectives and a credible fall-back position,” said Mr Malcolm Barr, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “May certainly has the former, but we doubt the prime minister has the latter.” To those in Europe who blanche at such ambition, she said signing up to her model would be “economically rational” for them since the UK is “a crucial — profitable — export market” for its companies. She warned those who want to punish Britain for its decision to leave that they would be conducting “an act of calamitous self-harm”. Such a tough approach carries risks. It will almost certainly trigger a battle between the premier and pro-European lawmakers at home who worry she could still wreck the economy. She sought to deflect their attacks by promising a parliamentary vote on the final deal. OVER TO BARNIER The shape of the final agreement also will not, ultimately, be up to Ms May. It will be the views of the other EU member states, molded by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, which will be decisive. EU officials welcomed Ms May’s new-found transparency, while repeating their long-held lines that they won’t enter negotiations before Ms May formally says she wants out and that the UK won’t be allowed to enjoy the full advantages of EU membership without accepting the responsibilities. Businesses gave a mixed response. While they welcomed the clarity and the signal of a transition, they worried Ms May is sacrificing trade to deal with social issues and regain sovereignty. Bankers said they will continue studying whether to shift jobs to the EU to maintain access. YEARS AWAY The ultimate verdict on Ms May’s strategy potentially remains years away. Only when the final details of any new UK-EU trade agreement are clear, after as many as two years of discussions, will it be possible to evaluate the prime minister’s approach. Everything now rides on how the EU reacts. In her speech, Ms May mixed sweetness with spice. While the UK wants to be “reliable partners, willing allies and close friends” it will also fight back if the EU decides to punish it, she said. Retaliation against the UK “would not be the act of a friend”, she said. “Britain would not — indeed we could not — accept such an approach.” One way Europe could strike back is to present May with a large exit bill totalling billions of euros and use the timing of talks on transition as a negotiating chip. What exactly the prime minister would be prepared to do in the event a deal cannot be reached was not fully spelled out. She talked about action to radically cut business taxes and attract the best and biggest businesses away from Europe to the UK. She also implied that the current joint working on security, intelligence and military collaboration could stop, an outcome that Ms May suspects would hurt Europe more than the UK. She mentioned Britain’s highly-rated intelligence services four times in her speech — the same number of times as she said the words “customs union”. The question will be whether Ms May’s gamble pays off or whether she’s repeating the same mistakes her predecessor, Mr David Cameron, made in last year’s referendum. Just as he underestimated the willingness of voters to risk economic prosperity in exchange for gaining control over law-making and immigration, Ms May runs the risk of failing to see the importance to Europe of protecting the EU as a political project, whatever the cost. Ms May’s game of hard ball might increase her chances of achieving the best deal possible, but also of ending up with nothing.

"We are at a moment where there are so many cross-currents, some of which are caused by the president-elect himself, that you will need a cast-iron stomach to run the gauntlet from here through Friday's inauguration," the "Mad Money" host said. The reason it is so important to have firm belief in stocks in a portfolio right now, Cramer said, is because a "tweet lightning bolt" from Donald Trump could take down a company's shares at any time. The sell-off in bank stocks on Tuesday made them more attractive to Cramer, not less. He recommended waiting two days before buying any stocks going into the dip. Oil stocks are also hard to own right now with crude stalled in the low $50s. Nevertheless, Cramer encouraged investors to stay long oil and gas. "Come Friday, we will have the most pro-fossil fuel president in history. Don't be whipsawed … find something you like that is oil and gas and stick with it," Cramer said. Timothy A. Clary | AFP | Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a press conference January 11, 2017 at Trump Tower in New York. Financial stocks took a nosedive on Tuesday, but that didn't scare off Cramer from the group. "I am committed to this group and after some profit-taking, I think it runs anew,"Cramer said. On Friday, three of the largest banks in the U.S.—Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo—issued statements that were incredibly positive. Many investors believe that the recent rally in financials is based on a mere post-election high, but Cramer disagreed. Banks have been waiting for this moment, Cramer said, and they have been prepared to strike at the right time. With some groups like retail struggling recently, Cramer noted tremendous strength in the restaurant group, particularly the casual dining and fast food plays. Even more impressive is that when these companies missed the numbers, their stocks went higher. This signaled the market's willingness to take into consideration long-term strength. To gain further insight on what the charts predict for the future, Cramer spoke with Bob Lang, who is a technician and founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and a colleague of Cramer's at RealMoney.com. In Lang's perspective, 2017 could be the year for Panera Bread, Cheesecake Factory, Jack in the Box and Popeyes. "On the fundamentals, I have to agree with him," Cramer said. Jason Alden | Bloomberg | Getty Images A pile of Benson & Hedges Gold cigarettes, produced by British American Tobacco Plc. Cramer also turned his attention to a privately-held company making waves in the technology industry. Knightscope is a technology company that makes Autonomous Data Machines. These are basically robots that patrol areas like corporate campuses, shopping malls and event venues. Think "Robocop" without the accidental fatalities. In addition to its innovative hardware and software, Knightscope also has a unique machine-as-service business model that dramatically reduces the upfront costs of suing the company's technology. And while Knightscope is not publicly traded, it recently did a so-called mini-IPO in collaboration with SeedInvest. Cramer spoke with Knightscope's chairman and CEO Bill Li, who commented on crime as a negative monetary impact for society. "Every single year it is a hidden tax we all pay in blood, tears and treasure. So imagine if we can combine a set of hardware, software and give every security guard super-human capabilities," Li said. With news of more consolidation in the tobacco space, Cramer thinks it is time for a shake-up at some of the biggest tobacco companies. British American Tobacco announced it would acquire the last 58 percent of Reynolds American that it doesn't already own for more than $49 billion, or $59.64 a share. This was just one of the latest moves in a long wave of consolidation that has hit the tobacco industry, as Reynolds American acquired Lorillard for $25 billion over a year ago. The news of British American gave Cramer an epiphany. "With British American and Reynolds combining forces, they will finally have the scale to really challenge Philip Morris," he said. In the lightning round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Home Depot: "I have been a bull on Home Depot for about 100 points and I'm not relenting. I saw it down to like $134 the other day. If this stock comes down as part of a major sell-off into the inauguration I want you to buy, buy, buy." Seadrill Ltd: "That is the lowest quality of the drillers. I prefer Schlumberger, which my charitable trust at actionalertsplus.com owns. You can read about it, we like it very much. I think that that is a much better way. They do report later this week. We want to go high quality."

Even though voters approved the "social use" measure last November, the ballot proposal failed to spell out many rules for how marijuana could be used in public, beyond saying that it can't be smoked inside and that patrons must be over 21 to use it.

"It's not about proposals anymore ... but what are they going to do," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. "I think investors are at a pause trying to figure out what's next." He also said he is positive about U.S. equities, noting underlying global economic growth has been overlooked. The Dow closed 58 points lower after briefly falling 100 points, with Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth Group and JPMorgan Chase contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent, with financials dropping more than 2 percent. The Nasdaq underperformed, declining 0.63 percent. The S&P 500 "remains bound by a consolidation phase that reflects an indecisive market as we approach the inauguration," said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, in a note. "We believe the risk is greater to the downside in the near term, and would be wary of a breach of the lower boundary of the range near 2250." "You don't know what's going to happen. So it's hard to reposition into this or that," said Jeff Layman, a partner at BKD Wealth Advisors. Trump criticized a proposed corporate tax plan from the House of Representatives, labeling the plan as "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. The stock market has soared since the election partially on hopes of corporate tax reform, deregulation of certain sectors and more government spending. "There's a lot of nervousness as Trump gets set to take office," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "Until we see what he does in his first 100 days, I think the market is going to remain in a wait-and-see pattern."  Trump's inauguration is scheduled for Friday. Trump's remarks also took a bite out of the dollar, which fell 0.85 percent against a basket of currencies. In turn, the euro rose 0.88 percent to $1.0707 and the yen gained 1.11 percent to 112.67. Adding pressure to U.S. stocks were concerns of a hard Brexit. In a speech Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May indicated the United Kingdom would seek a clean break from the European Union. She added, however, The U.K. government will put the Brexit deal it agrees with the European Union to a parliamentary vote. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said May's speech was expected to be "catastrophic." "But, she has managed the expectations and delivered the speech very well. Moreover, the final Brexit deal will be put up for a vote in parliament and this makes things a little less pessimistic," he said. The British pound skyrocketed more than 2.5 percent against the dollar, trading around $1.239, on track for its best day since 2008. The pound briefly broke below $1.20 earlier this week. "The fact that the pound briefly broke below $1.20 and then rebounded shows you that the bears aren't ready to take the pound in that direction," said Adam Sarhan, CEO at 50 Park Investments. The pound has fallen sharply since last June's Brexit vote. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rebounded after May's speech, falling about 0.15 percent, paring losses. There are no major U.S. economic data due Tuesday, but a slew of firms reported quarterly results, including Morgan Stanley, which beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line. Morgan Stanley shares fell 2.5 percent, however. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 11.8.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 18 January 2017 | MYT 12:54 PM Morgan Stanley partners with tech firms to boost wealth business If you can't beat 'em, join 'em: The focus on technology is part of a broader strategy to increase profit margins in Morgan Stanley's wealth business to a range of 23% to 25% by next year. Gorman (pic) believes technology can encourage customers to do more business with Morgan Stanley and allow advisers to use their time in more productive ways. — Reuters NEW YORK: Morgan Stanley inked deals with 10 technology outfits last year to improve the products and services it offers wealth-management customers, the bank said.  Among the new partners are Addepar, which offers investment-tracking software, and Zelle, a digital payments network that aims to compete against the popular mobile application Venmo.  Although the tools will not necessarily generate fees, they will help financial advisers do their jobs better, Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman said. They may also attract and retain customers who prefer digital options, he added.  "We've got to be careful that we are not penny wise and pound foolish," he said.  Big banks, investment firms and brokerages have been investing heavily in financial technology lately to avoid losing customers to Silicon Valley.  In the wealth-management business, the most common threat has been so-called "roboadvisors," like Wealthfront and Betterment, which manage clients' money using algorithms. They tend to charge less than human advisers and cater to customers with relatively little money to invest.  Morgan Stanley's wealth business is sticking to a model that favours wealthier customers, Gorman said. However, he left the door open to serving those who want purely digital advice, and said he expects all customers to want cutting-edge digital options going forward.  "We will be building a lot of digital technology to support the financial advisors and the branch operations," he said.  In December, Morgan Stanley said 20 of its top adviser teams would use Addepar's software to track wealthy clients' assets across all of their accounts - even those outside Morgan Stanley – to manage their assets better.  Zelle, the peer-to-peer payments app, was developed by a group of big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp. It plans to launch later this year.  In an earnings-related document, Morgan Stanley listed several other technology firms including cloud-based messaging service Twilio, data-analytics provider Cloudera and tax-software maker LifeYield, as partners it is using to modernise branches, communicate with customers and target clients who prefer digital options.  Morgan Stanley has also made a number of key hires to build out its digital department, including Naureen Hassan, who joined as chief digital officer for the wealth business from Charles Schwab & Co Inc last year.  The focus on technology is part of a broader strategy to increase profit margins in Morgan Stanley's wealth business to a range of 23% to 25% by next year, from a current 22%.  As Gorman tells it, the technology can encourage customers to do more business with Morgan Stanley and allow advisers to use their time in more productive ways. Gorman feels "strongly" that Morgan Stanley will hit the 2017 target, he said.  Morgan Stanley has also been trying to increase lending to wealth customers to bolster its bottom line.  Since taking full control of the Smith Barney brokerage from Citigroup Inc in 2012, Morgan Stanley acquired a lush amount of deposits. It is working to put them to use through mortgages, lending against customers' investment portfolios and tailored loans that use fine art and other luxury items as collateral.  Over the course of 2016, Morgan Stanley grew loans to wealth customers by 24%, to US$55.3bil (RM245.83bil). — Reuters You May Be Interested CIA unveils new rules for collecting information on Americans India to consider Apple's request for incentives with 'open mind': minister For white-collar staff, AI threatens new workplace revolution Giving nasi lemak extra oomph with wild boar curry Six simple steps to feng shui your home Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Others Also Read Glamorous nights with nature Help Bajau Laut to have a place to call home Be firm with telemarketers advertisement Latest News Six Coolpad workers detained in patent dispute with former employer Huawei Toshiba woes intensify on reports of US$6bil writedown, shares plummet Snap Inc hires Jennifer Park Stout as head of global policy Panasonic aims to move Tesla auto partnership beyond batteries: CEO US exchanges rent helicopter, drape banner in pursuit of Snapchat IPO Most Viewed in Tech Six Coolpad workers detained in patent dispute with former employer Huawei Pokémon Go: New update fixes GPS drift Panasonic aims to move Tesla auto partnership beyond batteries: CEO Upcoming 2017 MacBook Pros could get latest-gen Intel Core Kaby Lake processors Japan clears up confusion over high-tech toilets The Bentley Continental Supersports gets its own smartwatch For white-collar staff, AI threatens new workplace revolution Bikeshare cycles dumped en masse in China China to develop prototype super, super computer in 2017 Toshiba woes intensify on reports of US$6bil writedown, shares plummet Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D) Navigating Kuala Lumpur's traffic during rush hour can be chaotic.

The settlement was higher than the USD 7 billion paid by Citigroup to federal and state authorities in 2014. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Deutsche Bank finalised a USD 7.2 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice over its sale of toxic mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, the government agency said on Tuesday. Deutsche's agreement represents the largest resolution for the conduct of a single entity in misleading investors in residential mortgcage-backed securities, the department said in a statement. The settlement was higher than the USD 7 billion paid by Citigroup to federal and state authorities in 2014. "Deutsche Bank did not merely mislead investors: it contributed directly to an international financial crisis," Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in the statement. John Cryan, Deutsche's chief executive, said that the bank's conduct between 2005 and 2007 fell short of standards and was "unacceptable." He said the bank had exited many of the underlying activities and improved standards. Deutsche Bank ADR-listed shares closed down 3.2 percent to USD 18.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Frankfurt-based bank announced it had reached the agreement in principle with US authorities on Dec. 23. Its stock price hit a record low in September after the bank acknowledged the Justice Department made an opening demand of USD 14 billion. The Justice Department reached USD 46 billion in settlements with US banks over the shoddy securities that contributed to the US housing market collapse and financial crisis before turning to Deutsche and other European banks. Other banks paid more than Deutsche, but their settlements also included wrongdoing by institutions they acquired during the crisis. Bank of America Corp , for instance, agreed to pay USD 16.7 billion, which also covered Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial. JPMorgan Chase & Co settled for USD 13 billion, including misconduct by Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns. As part of its deal, Deutsche Bank will pay a civil monetary penalty of USD 3.1 billion and provide USD 4.1 billion in consumer relief to homeowners, borrowers and communities harmed by its practices. The bank also agreed to a statement of facts that describes how it made false and misleading representations to investors about the loans underlying billions of dollars worth of mortgage securities issued by the bank in 2006 and 2007. In May 2006, a supervisor is quoted as warning a senior trader that a loan originator would underwrite loans to anyone with "half a pulse", according to the statement of facts. The supervisor also said that month that Deutsche Bank, among others, "tolerate[d] misrepresentation" from originators who accepted blacked out pay stubs to state that borrowers had higher incomes. Deutsche Bank also knew appraisals were inflated, and concealed second liens on properties. The preliminary deal with Deutsche was made public before Christmas as US probes of other European banks over the shoddy securities also came to a head. Zurich-based Credit Suisse announced that it had agreed in principle to a USD 5.3 billion settlement, and the Justice Department sued Barclays Plc and two former executives for fraud for allegedly deceiving investors about the quality of loans underlying tens of billions of dollars of the securities. Separately, Deutsche Bank will slash bonuses for senior employees by about 90 percent, a move that will be announced on Wednesday, Spiegel reported.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 17, 2017 at 7:27PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Shares of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell precipitously on Tuesday, dropping by more than 4% on the eve of the presidential inauguration this Friday. A multitude of factors no doubt played into the decline, but there are two in particular that seem to be the primary culprits. 1. Waning investor sentiment Analysts at Citigroup opined this week that investor confidence in the incoming presidential administration may be waning. An index that attempts to capture this, the News Implied Sentiment Indicator, has reversed most of its post-election climb. The metric, which measures the number of Bloomberg News stories that contain the words "bullish" and "bearish," is a crude metric to be sure. But there could certainly be something to it -- at least in the case of bank stocks. Shares of the nation's biggest banks surged in the wake of the presidential election. A Republican-controlled federal government combined with promises made by the incoming administration on the campaign trail to roll back regulations and accelerate economic growth by way of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, persuaded investors that banks could soon start to earn a lot more money. BAC data by YCharts. Few banks stand to benefit as much as Bank of America, which has seen its stock climb 30% over the past two months. Higher interest rates spurred by raster economic growth would boost Bank of America's top and bottom lines more than any other major bank. Moreover, because of its missteps leading up to the financial crisis, the North Carolina-based bank has been under the watchful eye of regulators ever since. This has driven up its compliance costs and impeded its ability to return capital to shareholders. The question now is whether investors were too optimistic that the new President will be able to deliver on his campaign vows. The answer to this remains to be seen, but the sharp decline in bank stocks Tuesday, coupled with Citigroup's analysis of investor sentiment, suggests that investors are dialing back their expectations. 2. Lawsuit The second piece of news that seems to have weighed on Bank of America's stock on Tuesday relates to the Supreme Court. The court refused to hear an appeal by the bank, joined by Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, challenging antitrust lawsuits accusing the banks of conspiring to rig a key short-term interest rate benchmark, the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, going back decades. The ruling leaves Bank of America and other banks vulnerable to potentially billions of dollars' worth of damages suffered by investor who held securities tied to Libor. "The wrong result here could be economically devastating," argued the banks. The case could still be dismissed or settled, but the added uncertainty is never a good thing for stocks. In sum, I still believe that Bank of America is a very good stock to own for the long run, but the road is bound to be bumpy. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.
