After years of currency weakness that boosted exporters amid unprecedented monetary stimulus, stocks reliant on the domestic economy are beginning to outperform. Strategists from firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co., BNP Paribas SA and Kepler Cheuvreux SA say the trend will pick up pace as the region’s growth improves and the euro strengthens against the dollar. Boosted by the single currency’s stellar gains this year, JPMorgan’s basket of local stocks -- which includes Zara owner Inditex SA, French construction company Vinci SA and Dutch brewer Heineken NV -- has climbed more than one of exporters. Stock benchmarks in Italy and Spain, whose members rely more on the domestic economy, are also beating Germany’s exporter-heavy DAX Index in May. “We are starting to see a trend, especially in the past month, where more domestic companies, like retailers, have been outperforming, while exporters in the auto and aerospace and defense industries are lagging,” said Pierre Martin, a trader at Saxo Bank in London. “For investors who are targeting around 1.15 for the euro against the dollar, it would make sense to be a bit less bullish on companies like Airbus and Michelin.” Carmakers, among the biggest winners since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s 2012 pledge to preserve the euro through the end of last year, are the worst losers in industry groups this month. Airbus SE, which gets about two-thirds of its revenue outside the region, has dropped 1.8 percent, while Heineken has surged 6.8 percent and retailers Inditex and Hennes & Mauritz AB are up 2 percent or more. May has marked the longest stretch in almost a year in which the Euro Stoxx 50 Index and the single currency have moved in sync. A sustained positive correlation could signal the reversal of a trend that has been in place since 2014 as the weakening exchange rate boosted overseas profit at global giants in the benchmark gauge. For money managers assessing whether the euro will rise beyond levels that multinational firms typically hedge for, the ECB’s June meeting will be key. “The trend has caught our eye -- if the euro strength persists, we will consider adding a bit more to small caps, which tend to be more domestic,” said Simon Wiersma, an Amsterdam-based investment manager at ING Bank NV, which oversees about 26 billion euros ($29 billion). If the economic data “stay as good as they are now, the euro could get stronger.” Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter.

The critical level for equity investors would be around 1.15, said Wiersma, particularly if the euro stays above that threshold for three months or longer. Major global firms are likely to be hedged for a rise up to that level, according to Saxo Bank’s Martin. Investors will closely watch the ECB meeting on June 8 for clues on the longevity of the trend, as a steady stream of positive economic data heightens pressure on officials to outline an exit strategy from years of accommodative monetary policies. Such speculation has been one of the factors driving the euro higher, according to Lukas Daalder, the Rotterdam-based chief investment officer for investment solutions at Robeco. “From where we are now, further strength in the currency is going to start creating a problem for some companies’ profits, and benefit domestics,” said Emmanuel Cau, a London-based equity strategist at JPMorgan. “We are starting to see some rotation already. A stronger euro is ultimately a good thing for European equities.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The below graph shows the trajectory of the stock over the past year. And it looks like there is plenty of growth still to come. JPMorgan has a December 2017 target of $1100 per share. Other analysts are even more bullish looking at a forecast of $1250 by year end. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth says: “We believe Amazon is well positioned as the market leader in ecommerce, where it’s still early days with U.S. ecommerce representing ~12% of adjusted retail sales (ex-gas, food, and autos). We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall ecommerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party vs. third-party inventory and its Prime offering both serve as major advantages.” So far this year Amazon stocks are up 32% already compared with the S&P 500’s 8% rise. The stock is also up 40% in the past 12 months. he growth in the share price means that Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos is now the road’s second richest person and could well become the richest man in the world if the stock continues to appreciate.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Deutsche Bank Says Buy 3 Top Wall Street Investment Banks Now By Lee Jackson May 26, 2017 8:35 am EDT Print Email Tweet While there has been some considerable discussion recently about the return of Glass-Steagall, which separated commercial banking from investment banking, it hasn’t happened yet, and the big Wall Street firms that immersed themselves in traditional banking are still ahead of the game when it comes to generating revenues. With the stock market continuing higher, and rates staying low, the ability to generate revenues from both silos remains important. A new Deutsche Bank research report makes the case that while loan growth has slowed, mostly due to very stringent underwriting standards, many of the top companies have revalued since the election, making some pricier than others. We screened the Deutsche Bank research universe and found that three of Wall Street’s biggest white-glove firms remain Buy rated and still make sense for growth investors going forward. Goldman Sachs This continues to be the gold standard of Wall Street banks and trades at a reasonable 13 times estimated 2017 earnings. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) has a gigantic institutional equity, debt and derivatives business, an ultra-high net worth clientele, top investment banking and capital markets expertise. The bank continues to be a dominant force around the world and is one of the most sought after in the world. And it is one of the very few that dictate who can be a client at the firm. In investment banking, the company has the preeminent client franchise. Goldman Sachs advised on more than $1.5 trillion of announced mergers and acquisitions transactions last year, the highest level the bank has ever recorded. It also has maintained a leading market share over the past 25 years. It maintained a market position when merger and acquisition activity was dominated by technology in 1999, by financials in 2008 and by natural resources in 2014. The bottom line is, regardless of where market strength is in any given year, Goldman Sachs is up to the task. The company reported first-quarter results that missed on the top and bottom lines, a rare miss for a firm that typically outperforms. The sell-off that came after results were reported in April is giving investors a solid entry point for the stock, which is poised to finish 2017 in much better shape. Goldman Sachs shareholders are paid a 1.35% dividend. The Deutsche Bank price objective is $255, and the Wall Street consensus target price is $244.08. The shares closed Thursday at $222.47. JPMorgan This stock trades at a reasonable 13 times estimated 2017 forward earnings and could respond good in a rising rate scenario. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is one of the leading global financial services firms, and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States, with about $2.6 trillion in assets. The company as it is today formed through the merger of retail bank Chase Manhattan and investment bank JPMorgan. The firm has many operating divisions, including investment and corporate banking, asset management, retail financial services, commercial banking, credit cards and financial transaction services. The company reported solid first-quarter results and continues to take advantage of revenue opportunities in new markets and with the credit card business. JPMorgan investors receive a 2.34% dividend. The Deutsche Bank price target is set at $90, and the consensus target is $94.10. The shares closed most recently at $85.35. Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) recently posted outstanding quarterly results, and it may be among the best buys in the banking and investment arena. It is another one of the white glove Wall Street firms that continues to show tremendous growth, and it is running neck and neck with Goldman Sachs as the bank of choice for high-profile initial public offerings. Trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 12.4 times estimated 2017 earnings, that seems extremely reasonable given the 2017 expectations for earnings growth of more than 15%. The company also has 560 billion in cash equivalents on its balance sheet versus $288 billion in total debt. Morgan Stanley investors are paid a 1.88% dividend. Deutsche Bank has a $47 price target, and the consensus price objective is $48.42. Shares closed Thursday’s trading at $42.63.

Will the lucrative yet delicate relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia survive the life of the agreement? Will surging US shale output prove too much temptation for Opec countries to stick to their own production promises? And, perhaps most perplexing: What does Opec have planned long-term? The deal to maintain the cuts for another nine months, hammered out this week in Vienna, could expire in March with a return to Opec’s pump-at-will policy that prevailed between 2014 and 2016 and pushed prices below $30 a barrel. Or the organisation could keep adjusting production. Read more Oil prices fall as Donald Trump plans to sell off reserves “What concerns me is that there is no clear messaging around the exit strategy,” Ebele Kemery, head of energy investing at JPMorgan Asset Management, said. “The way we look at the market going forward, there’s going to be oversupply in 2018. They’re talking about price stability. To get price stability we need to know what the endgame is.” Ms Kemery’s concern over a lack of strategy appeared to be widespread. Brent crude fell 5 per cent to $51.24 (£40) a barrel on the decision, wiping out most of the gains since Russia and Saudi Arabia publicly backed the nine-month extension last week. Despite an admission that November’s landmark agreement to limit output failed to eliminate the global oil glut, the commitment of two-dozen oil-producing countries did succeed in establishing a new floor for prices that’s well above the lows seen last year. “Opec is settling in for the long haul,” said Roger Diwan, an Opec watcher at consultant IHS Markit. “I think we’ll remain between $50 and $60 a barrel for the time being.” The agreement, which includes countries accounting for 60 percent of the world’s oil production, has already delivered for national budgets from Moscow to Tehran, as higher prices outweighed lower production. “This is a historic deal, it already was in November and now still more,” said Jan Stuart, chief energy economist at Credit Suisse “Now we have more confidence of a 2017 rebalance.” The extension to March prolongs a rare period of collaboration between Opec and some of its biggest rivals. Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, said the relationship between Opec and non-members of the cartel was at a “pivotal moment”. The calculus may shift in 2018, testing the increasingly close cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia, according to Ronald Smith, senior oil analyst at Citigroup in Moscow. It may not be in the best interest of Vladimir Putin’s balance sheet to keep new oilfields on the shelf. The lost revenue would be felt mostly by state-owned Rosneft on projects scheduled to ramp up production in 2018 and 2019. “Rosneft, the state-owned champion, will have invested a lot of money in these fields that will be sitting idle if they continue to extend the agreement,” Mr Smith said. “The math is going to be more ambiguous going forward. At some point they may decide they need to take back some market share.” Also a contender in the battle for market share – and producers who didn’t sign on to the Vienna agreement – are US shale drillers, who could benefit from this week’s deal. Read more FTSE 100 closes at fresh record high spurred by rally in oil prices Oil price jumps 2% as Saudi Arabia and Russia extend production cut Oil price collapses below $45 amid fears of glut Shell reports more than 300% increase in earnings Resurgent US production has meant oil inventories remain well above the level targeted by Opec ministers. Analysts at energy consultancy group Wood MacKenzie said the deal extension would help US shale oil output accelerate to its fastest growth rate in years. In 2018, global oil inventories would increase by about 600,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, followed by about 500,000 each quarter for the rest of the year, the group said. “There’s still an oversupply to wrestle with,” said Simon Flowers, chief analyst at Wood MacKenzie. Even so, after more than two years of flip-flopping from market management to pump-at-will and back again, it’s not clear what Opec will do next. As recently as March, the production ceiling was envisaged as a short-term prop to rapidly bring a glut of global oil inventories back to historically typical levels. In March, Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih told an industry conference in Houston that the kingdom’s policy was to manage output “for a restricted period of time, with the aim of accelerating rebalancing, and then allowing the free market to work”. That is exactly what some fear, and Mr Falih did not dispel those concerns on Thursday, saying, “This is not a structural intervention”. With the deal agreed to, Mr Falih said he expected Opec to achieve its goal of returning global oil inventories to their five-year average by the end of the year. Both Saudi Arabia and Russia said after the meeting that they could take further action if the market situation warranted it.  Business picture of the day 29 show all Business picture of the day 1/29 UK car production slumps by nearly a fifth in April as timing of Easter bites - Thursday May 24 UK car manufacturing plummeted by almost a fifth in April, as the timing of Easter ate into the number of production days in the month.

Corporates’ rapid move onto offshore bond markets, partly a response to the crackdown on runaway credit growth at home, highlights China’s multi-faceted indebtedness, a growing worry for investors. Overall debt is approaching 300 percent of annual economic output (GDP) and Moody’s said it was the reason for cutting China’s credit rating for the first time in 30 years. Stripping out maturing debt and coupon payments, year-to-date bond sales from companies in emerging markets total $65 billion (£50.19 billion) including $54 billion from China, JPMorgan estimates. In gross issuance terms, almost half this year’s emerging market corporate bond sales are from Chinese firms, the bank said. Company debt issuance in other emerging markets has been subdued by commodity and growth slumps. Some indexes cap the weight they give to each country but most are committed to broadly representing the market. This means that the indexes have to increase the weighting they give to China and investors whose portfolios track or benchmark an index must adjust accordingly. “It poses a challenge for global portfolios. You don’t want to have too much of a good thing,” said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at AllianzGlobal Investments. China today comprises over 20 percent of the Markit iBOXX emerging market corporate index versus 0.5 percent in 2007. In JPMorgan’s CEMBI Broad index too, China is 21 percent, up from less than 4 percent in 2010, while in the iBoxx corporate dollar bond index which also includes developed countries, China has crept to 8 percent, from less than one percent five years ago. Chinese firms should this year easily surpass the $108 billion debt raised in 2016 and $116 billion in 2014. In 2010, just $14 billion was issued. “It’s just a juggernaut of issuance,” said Guy Stear, co-head of fixed income research at Societe Generale in Paris. “It’s so large that it’s a game changer in terms of EM corporates… it’s not just commodity companies, its cement, materials, internet companies, there’s a broad range.” The Chinese deals are mostly welcomed by money managers who need to invest the money pouring into their funds. Also, Chinese state-run firms still carry investment grade ratings, unlike issuers from many big emerging economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. “Relative to rating Chinese debt pays relatively decent yield…against that people are conscious that if you are running an EM credit fund you have very very high exposure to one part of the world,” Stear said. ALLOCATION CONUNDRUM One popular solution for the allocation dilemma is “unconstrained” debt funds that are less committed to representing the market. Morningstar data showed 10 such funds focused on Asian fixed income were launched already this year by asset managers. More than 40 launched in 2016. “We are already seeing clients and investors wanting a diversified approach rather than just seeking exposure to a broad emerging market bond index,” said Bryan Collins, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International in Hong Kong. Such funds can opt for less China exposure. Or they can delve down the credit curve and away from state-run firms whose close correlation with sovereign yields offers less prospect of outperformance, Collins said. Other commonly used indexes cap China’s weight – JPMorgan’s CEMBI Broad Diversified limits the weight each country can have, while Citigroup and Bloomberg have recently launched index variations capping China exposure. “We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8-10 percent,” said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook also noted that the $400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the $5.7 trillion outstanding in U.S. investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country’s overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as $28 trillion. COOLING DOWN Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody’s rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody’s downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs. But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies’ total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan ($797.36 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin estimates. For investment-grade Chinese firms, dollar borrowing works out some 90 basis points cheaper than on domestic markets where interest rates have risen. The spread between JP Morgan’s China index and onshore AA-rated corporate debt is at its widest in two years, this chart shows: http://tmsnrt.rs/2rxmkUI “If you are laden with debt, interest rates are rising and you need to roll over debt, you find the money wherever you can,” Stephen Jen, CEO of Eurizon SLJ Capital, said.

Janet Adamy and Paul Overberg 13 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Venezuela's people are hungry – but its lenders are kept happy Even Trump is having trouble selling his Ferrari A Wall Street Journal analysis shows that since the 1990s, sparsely populated counties have replaced large cities as America’s most troubled areas by key measures of socioeconomic well-being—a decline that’s accelerating. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 995.78 +2.40 +0.24% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 85.36 +0.01 +0.01% AdChoices At the corner where East North Street meets North Cherry Street in the small Ohio town of Kenton, the Immaculate Conception Church keeps a handwritten record of major ceremonies. Over the last decade, according to these sacramental registries, the church has held twice as many funerals as baptisms. In tiny communities like Kenton, an unprecedented shift is under way. Federal and other data show that in 2013, in the majority of sparsely populated U.S. counties, more people died than were born—the first time that’s happened since the dawn of universal birth registration in the 1930s. For more than a century, rural towns sustained themselves, and often thrived, through a mix of agriculture and light manufacturing. Until recently, programs funded by counties and townships, combined with the charitable efforts of churches and community groups, provided a viable social safety net in lean times. Starting in the 1980s, the nation’s basket cases were its urban areas—where a toxic stew of crime, drugs and suburban flight conspired to make large cities the slowest-growing and most troubled places. Today, however, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows that by many key measures of socioeconomic well-being, those charts have flipped. In terms of poverty, college attainment, teenage births, divorce, death rates from heart disease and cancer, reliance on federal disability insurance and male labor-force participation, rural counties now rank the worst among the four major U.S. population groupings (the others are big cities, suburbs and medium or small metro areas). In fact, the total rural population—accounting for births, deaths and migration—has declined for five straight years. “The gap is opening up and will continue to open up,” said Enrico Moretti, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the new urban-rural divide.

Those gains never materialized. As jobs in manufacturing and agriculture continue to vanish, America’s heartland faces a larger, more existential crisis. Some economists now believe that a modern nation is richer when economic activity is concentrated in cities. In Hardin County, where Kenton is the seat, factories that once made cabooses for trains and axles for commercial trucks have shut down. Since 1980, the share of county residents who live in poverty has risen by 45% and median household income adjusted for inflation has fallen by 7%. At the same time, census figures show, the percentage of adults who are divorced has nearly tripled, outpacing the U.S. average. Opioid abuse is also driving up crime. Father Dave Young, the 38-year-old Catholic priest at Immaculate Conception, was shocked when a thief stole ornamental candlesticks and a ciborium, spilling communion wafers along the way. Before coming to this county a decade ago, Father Young had grown up in nearby Columbus—where for many years he didn’t feel safe walking the streets. “I always had my guard up,” he said. Since 1980, however, the state capital’s population has risen 52%, buoyed by thousands of jobs from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., plus the growth of Ohio State University. Median household income in Columbus is up 6% over the same span, adjusted for inflation. “The economy has grown a lot there,” said Father Young. “The downtown, they’ve really worked on it.” Meanwhile, as Kenton—population 8,200—continues to unravel, he said he has begun always locking the church door. Again, he finds himself looking over his shoulder. “I just did not expect it here,” he said.© Ty Wright for the Wall Street Journal In the first half of the 20th century, America’s cities grew into booming hubs for heavy manufacturing, expanding at a prodigious clip. By the 1960s, however, cheap land in the suburbs and generous highway and mortgage subsidies provided city dwellers with a ready escape—just as racial tensions prompted many white residents to leave. Gutted neighborhoods and the loss of jobs and taxpayers contributed to a socioeconomic collapse. From the 1980s into the mid-1990s, the data show, America’s big cities had the highest concentration of divorced people and the highest rates of teenage births and deaths from cardiovascular disease and cancer. “The whole narrative was ‘the urban crisis,’” said Henry Cisneros, who was Bill Clinton’s secretary of housing and urban development. To address these problems, the Clinton administration pursued aggressive new policies to target urban ills. Public-housing projects were demolished to break up pockets of concentrated poverty that had incubated crime and the crack cocaine epidemic. At that time, rural America seemed stable by comparison—if not prosperous. Well into the mid-1990s, the nation’s smallest counties were home to almost one-third of all net new business establishments, more than twice the share spawned in the largest counties, according to the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public-policy organization. Employers offering private health insurance propped up medical centers that gave rural residents access to reliable care. By the late 1990s, the shift to a knowledge-based economy began transforming cities into magnets for desirable high-wage jobs. For a new generation of workers raised in suburbs, or arriving from other countries, cities offered diversity and density that bolstered opportunities for work and play. Urban residents who owned their homes saw rapid price appreciation, while many low-wage earners were driven to city fringes. As crime rates fell, urban developers sought to cater to a new upper-middle class. Hospital systems invested in sophisticated heart-attack and stroke-treatment protocols to make common medical problems less deadly. Campaigns to combat teenage pregnancy favored cities where they could reach more people. As large cities and suburbs and midsize metros saw an upswing in key measures of quality of life, rural areas struggled to find ways to harness the changing economy. Starting in the late 1990s, Amazon.com Inc. began opening fulfillment centers in sparsely populated states to help customers avoid sales taxes. One of those centers, established in 1999, brought hundreds of jobs to Coffeyville, Kan.—population 9,500. Yet as two-day shipping became a priority, Amazon shifted its warehousing strategy to be closer to cities where its customers were concentrated, and shut the Coffeyville center in 2015. An Amazon spokeswoman said that it didn’t make the decision lightly, and that last year it opened one of two planned fulfillment centers near Kansas City that will create more than 2,000 full-time jobs. Just as Amazon closed down, so did the century-old hospital in nearby Independence, population 8,700. The nearly one-million-square-foot Coffeyville warehouse Amazon rented has been empty since it went on the market for $35 million, and was recently repossessed at a value of $11.4 million after the building owner filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Coffeyville officials said the area’s problem isn’t a lack of jobs—it’s a shortage of qualified workers. After Amazon said it would close, economic-development leaders held an employment fair expecting to get up to 600 job seekers. Fewer than 100 showed up, said Trisha Purdon, executive director of the Montgomery County Action Council. In the late 1990s, convinced that technology would allow companies to shift back-office jobs to small towns, former Utah Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt pitched outposts in his state to potential employers. But companies were turned off by the idea of having to visit and maintain offices in such locations, he said. Eventually, many of the call centers he landed moved overseas where labor was even cheaper. Although federal and state antipoverty programs were not limited to urban areas, they often failed to address the realities of the rural poor. The 1996 welfare overhaul put more city dwellers back to work, for example, but didn’t take into account the lack of public transportation and child care that made it difficult for people in small towns to hold down jobs, said Lisa Pruitt, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law. Rhonda Vannoster of Independence, Kan., who is 25, has four children with a fifth on the way. She is divorced and jobless and doesn’t own a car, which limits her work options. She said she wants to get trained as a nursing aide but struggles to make time for it. “There just aren’t a lot of good jobs,” she said. There has long been a wage gap between workers in urban and rural areas, but the recession of 2007-09 caused it to widen. In densely populated labor markets (with more than one million workers), Prof. Moretti found that the average wage is now one-third higher than in less-populated places that have 250,000 or fewer workers—a difference 50% larger than it was in the 1970s. As employers left small towns, many of the most ambitious young residents packed up and left, too. In 1980, the median age of people in small towns and big cities almost matched. Today, the median age in small towns is about 41 years—five years above the median in big cities. A third of adults in urban areas hold a college degree, almost twice the share in rural counties, census figures show. Consolidation has shut down many rural hospitals, which have struggled from a shortage of patients with employer-sponsored insurance. At least 79 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, according to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Rural residents say irregular care and long drives for treatment left them sicker, a shift made worse by high rates of rural obesity and smoking. “Once you have a cancer diagnosis…your probability of survival is much lower in rural areas,” said Gopal K. Singh, a senior federal health agency research analyst who has studied mortality differences. The opioid epidemic—and a lack of access to treatment—have compounded the damage. In Hardin County, prosecutor Brad Bailey said drug cases, which accounted for less than 20% of his criminal cases a decade ago, have surged to 80%. The epidemic is spawning more thefts, including a rash of snatched air-conditioners sold for scrap metal, said Dennis Musser, police chief in Kenton. Linda Martell, a 69-year-old who moved to Kenton from outside Cleveland a decade ago to be near her daughter, was surprised a chain saw and heavy tools were stolen from her garage. When she was a young adult, she recalled, “All the problems were in the big cities.” In November’s presidential election, rural districts voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, who pledged to revive forgotten towns by scaling back regulations, trade agreements and illegal immigration and encouraging manufacturing companies to hire more American workers. A promised $1 trillion infrastructure bill could give a boost to many rural communities. Lawmakers from both parties concede they overlooked escalating dmall-town problems for years. “When you have a state like Florida, you campaign in the urban areas,” said former Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez. He recalls being surprised when he learned in the mid-2000s that rural areas, not cities, were the center of an emerging methamphetamine epidemic. During the Bush administration, lawmakers were preoccupied with two wars, securing the homeland after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Barack Obama’s administration tried to lift rural areas by pushing expanded broadband access, but found that service providers were reluctant to enter sparsely populated towns, said former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Since the collapse of the housing market, real-estate appreciation in nonmetropolitan areas has lagged behind cities, eroding the primary source of wealth and savings for many families. “We didn’t really have much of a transformation strategy for places where the world was changing,” Mr. Vilsack said. Meanwhile, major cities once considered socioeconomic laggards have turned themselves around. In St. Louis, which has more than 30 nearby four-year schools, the percentage of residents with college degrees tripled between 1980 and 2015—creating a talent pool that has lured health care, finance and bioscience employers, officials say. Instead of people moving where the jobs are, “jobs follow people,” said Greg Laposa, a local chamber of commerce vice president. In many cities, falling crime has attracted more middle- and upper-class families while an influx of millennials delaying marriage has helped keep divorce rates low. Maria Nelson, a 45-year-old media company manager who came to Washington, D.C., to work after college, had always assumed she would someday move to the suburbs, where she had grown up. A generation of heavy federal spending helped make the nation’s capital one of the country’s highest-earning urban centers. Its median household income rose to $71,000 a year in 2015, a 51% increase since 1980, adjusted for inflation. While Ms. Nelson was able to buy a brick row house in 2002, she said she worries about younger colleagues—let alone anyone moving in from a small town—who face soaring real-estate prices. “The whole area just seems to be out of range for most people now,” she said In Kenton, Father Young said that despite their mounting troubles, he is optimistic about his parishioners. Some of them tell him they worry about what will happen when they die because they still provide for their adult children. He likes to say there is always hope. “They can find a job,” he said. “Columbus is close enough.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Download Our Free Report Biglaw, General Counsel, In-House Counsel, Technology 5 Ways In Which The Business Of Law Is NOT Changing Anytime Soon Are we experiencing, or about to experience, a revolution in the world of legal services? Slow your roll.... By David Lat May 26, 2017 at 3:26 PM Shares6 Journalists have a bias in favor of change. Something’s not “news” unless it’s new. Pronouncements of “seismic shifts” and “sea changes” generate more buzz and pageviews than saying things aren’t really changing all that much. This explains why we media types tend to go on breathlessly about “transformation” this and “disruption” that. But picking up on the major theme of my story from yesterday about the latest Am Law 200 rankings, in which I argued that reports of Biglaw’s death (or even disruption) are greatly exaggerated, I’d like to provide more examples of how the practice and business of law aren’t changing as much as some might think. These all come from a great event I attended earlier this week, the third annual Big Law Business Summit, hosted this year at the gleaming tower on Lexington Avenue that’s home to the Bloomberg empire. 1. Don’t expect a regulatory revolution, even if President Donald Trump talks a big game. Dramatic regulatory changes could have major implications for Biglaw and the business of law — but don’t bank on such changes actually happening. Former SEC chair Mary Jo White, now back at Debevoise & Plimpton (this is her sixth stint at the firm, for anyone who’s counting), had this to say: White said she doesn’t expect enforcement actions to dip significantly, and she predicted the Financial CHOICE Act, which aims to replace the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and roll back many of its provisions, likely won’t make it further than the House of Representatives…. “I think whatever change happens is going to come several years down the road by virtue of how the regulators carry out their jobs with a different kind of philosophy,” said White, now a senior chair of Debevoise & Plimpton. “But it’s both uncertain where the administration is actually going to land on policy, and then there’s uncertainty as to whether they can bring that about.” Stephen Cutler, vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase and former head of the SEC’s enforcement division, echoed her sentiments, predicting that the Trump administration’s regulatory reform won’t be as sweeping as some hope (or fear): “I think we’re a long way away from accomplishing a significant change in the regulatory agenda even if one were to have that agenda.” 2. The separation of law and compliance, a major post-recession development, might actually get reversed. Regulation of the financial sector increased dramatically since the Great Recession (and might not be going down as much as some might think, if White and Cutler are correct). One notable change in response to that regulation was the establishment at many banks of separate compliance divisions, distinct from the legal department, and with reporting lines not even going to the general counsel. But this trend could be unwound — and that’s as it should be, as argued by Morgan Stanley’s chief legal officer, Eric Grossman: During a keynote address at Bloomberg Law’s Big Law Business Summit in Midtown Manhattan Wednesday, Grossman told an audience of law firm partners and corporate legal officers that it’s “counterproductive” to separate a company’s legal and compliance functions, and that doing so does a disservice to clients, shareholders, employees, and regulators. “If you’ve built the right culture, the lawyers and the compliance professionals all share the same goal.” …. Grossman said he expects other financial firms to [do what Morgan Stanley has done and] combine the functions again soon. “If they’re allowed to, they will,” he said. 3. Robots aren’t taking all your jobs. Grossman noted that in his industry, they’re seeing the rise of automated investment advisory services (such as Betterment) — but there will still be strong demand for human financial advisors, for a long, long time. Baby boomers, who have a huge amount of investable assets, just aren’t there yet in terms of robot advisors. And it’s not just a factor of age, but also of issues; in Grossman’s view, if you have serious issues or problems, whether financial or legal or otherwise, you’ll still want to talk to a human. As general counsel to a bank, Grossman spends a good amount of time (and legal spend) on ediscovery. In that sphere, technology has made things more efficient, but it hasn’t eliminated the role of human beings: “Computers can reduce your universe of documents from 10 million to one million, but you still need humans to look at individual documents to see how they fit into a case.” Jamie Wine, global chair of the litigation department at Latham & Watkins, talked about how her firm is working with IBM (of Watson fame) to see how artificial intelligence can improve the delivery of legal services. But AI is still not a total substitute for actual lawyers. For example, artificial intelligence can streamline the due diligence process, but it’s still not perfect; for example, it’s not great at detecting when key provisions are missing from a contract. As Stuart Ingis, chairman of Venable, added, “Computers aren’t yet able to advocate. We are being hired to advocate, whether in court or in a deal, and computers can’t yet do that.” (A fun fact demonstrating how slow some lawyers are to adopt technology: Jamie Wine still uses a BlackBerry. The horror, the horror!) 4. The billable hour still reigns supreme. As head of Capital One Financial’s legal department, Matthew Cooper is all in favor of trying out new approaches to the acquisition and pricing of legal services. His company has, for example, asked its law firms to farm out document review to lower-cost providers, instead of charging Capital One a small fortune to have it done by associates. That said, the bulk of the company’s legal work is still done on an hourly basis. In Cooper’s view, “the death of the billable hour has been overstated.” 5. Diversity is still a challenge — and isn’t an easy problem to fix. Jamie Wine of Latham said that law firms are making major efforts to enhance diversity, but “we aren’t seeing as much change as we’d like — and the reasons why are very complicated.” (For more on that subject, see this prior Above the Law column by David Perla and Sanjay Kamlani, Diversity In The Legal Profession: The More Things Change, The More They Stay The Same – Until They Don’t.) One factor is that young lawyers might not aspire to Wine’s life as a Biglaw partner (notwithstanding Latham’s insane profits per partner). She suggested that women and diverse lawyers might look at her and say, “I don’t want that life — she works her ass off and she travels all the time.” But for those lawyers who do want to go for the gold (or golden handcuffs?) of Biglaw, Wine offered words of encouragement: “I understand that you might be nervous about juggling work and family responsibilities. I get that. My main message to you is, stick with it, stick it out. These things have a way of working themselves out.” In other words, Lean In (affiliate link). Or to tweak another famous saying (of disputed origin), be the change you want to be — in Biglaw.

Vernon were bouncing around town Friday — when their paychecks were rejected for “insufficient funds.” The embarrassing snafu — coming right before the long Memorial Day weekend — had city officials pointing fingers at one another and at the city’s banker. Mayor Richard Thomas blamed the “incompetence” of Comptroller Maureen Walker, saying she failed to process necessary paperwork until late Friday morning, long after employees received their checks or direct deposit acknowledgements. But Walker passed the buck to JPMorgan Chase, saying the bank “admitted there was a lag” in receiving and reviewing documents. The bank said it was reviewing the situation. As of Friday afternoon Thomas couldn’t even say how many employees were affected. But the bounce-a- thon-was widespread. “We were very alarmed when a number of city employees – police, fire and public works workers – were turned away this morning when they went to cash their checks,” he said. “We’re still investigating if other agencies were impacted. It appears that every city check that was issued could have been impacted until this morning,” he added. “From what we know the checks were cut and provided yesterday. It’s no surprise that today is payday. To receive a message of insufficient funds is unacceptable.” The city, which is just north of New York City, has about 700 full-time and 200 part-time employees, Thomas said. It’s budget is over $100 million. The comptroller refuted Thomas’ claim that the funds hadn’t cleared by afternoon. “Let me be perfectly clear: At no time were there insufficient funds,” Walker insisted. “The bank admitted there was a lag between the time we sent a file to the time they uploaded and reviewed it… A small handful of employees who tried to cash paper checks before 10:30 a.m. were unable to cash their checks.” Walker said she deposited money into the city’s payroll account at 11:51 a.m. Thursday and received notice that the money was available. “If the mayor is talking about insufficient funds and bounced checks, he needs to get the information before he goes and writes all these emails and press releases and puts it on Facebook,” she said, adding that his reaction was “foolishness.” The mayor said the comptroller refused to talk to him when he went to her office. Walker said that’s because he did it after sounding alarm bells and notifying the press. Walker also said she did wait until 8:40 a.m. Friday to send a file that the bank requires for fraud prevention. The document outlines every check the city cut and wasn’t uploaded or reviewed immediately. “We do it Friday mornings, sometimes as early as Thursday afternoon,” she said. A bank source said the norm would have been to send the file by Thursday. By late Friday, officials said the problem and had cleared up and the city’s checks were again being honored.

What went unnoticed -- and is largely unknown -- is how important Blackstone is to the Kushner family company. Since 2013, Blackstone has loaned more than $400 million to finance four Kushner Cos. deals -- two of which have not been reported -- making it one of the business’s largest lenders. And their ties go beyond the loans. Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone’s co-founder and chief executive officer, heads Trump’s business-advisory council and was in Riyadh with the president and Kushner. The Saudi promise to invest in Blackstone’s fund drove the firm’s stock up more than 8 percent. A Blackstone spokeswoman, Christine Anderson, said the company began talks with the Saudis a year ago, “well before President Trump was even his party’s nominee.” Blackstone is one of the largest non-bank real-estate lenders, and corporate deals are often announced during state visits. A spokesman for Kushner Cos. declined to comment. But the sequence of the deals and the intertwined personal relationships of the principals raise concerns about conflicts of interest. Schwarzman, one of the world’s richest businessmen, is a Republican and, like Trump, a resident of New York and Palm Beach. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and Kushner’s wife, was an investor in a fund Blackstone created in 2010 to seed hedge funds, according to financial disclosures. Kushner has divested some of his assets to family members, and the White House says he’ll recuse himself when necessary. (Separately, the Washington Post reported in an unrelated matter Thursday, citing people familiar with the investigation, that Kushner is now a subject of the FBI probe into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.  Jamie Gorelick, an attorney for Kushner, told the Post that her client has cooperated with a congressional investigation into the matter and “will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.”) Advisory Panel Schwarzman’s advisory panel -- which also includes General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra, Tesla Inc. co-founder and CEO Elon Musk and JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon -- isn’t subject to ethics rules. Meanwhile, whether there are links among the arms deal, the Saudi investment and the loans, future steps will seem fraught. Schwarzman’s relationship with Trump is echoed in the next generation. Jon Gray, Blackstone’s global head of real estate, met with Trump when the president-elect was interviewing candidates for Treasury secretary even though he supported Hillary Clinton. Gray, 47, and Kushner, 36, have known each other for at least four years. They both had much to celebrate in March 2013 at the anniversary party for the New York Observer, a newspaper the Kushners own. Gray was coming off a year that saw Blackstone close on $13.3 billion of capital pledges for what was then the world’s biggest private-equity real-estate fund. He had been named to the Blackstone board, a sign he was being groomed for the top job at Schwarzman’s company. ‘25 to Watch’ Days earlier, the Observer named Gray among “25 to Watch” for its annual list of “100 Most Influential New Yorkers.” The paper has often heaped praise on those with whom its owners might do business, and the recommendation to watch Gray was prescient. Shares in Blackstone doubled in 2013, thanks in large part to Gray’s real-estate deals. These included the December 2013 initial public offering of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., which became the most profitable private-equity deal on record, and would later play a key role in Blackstone’s search for investors outside the U.S., notably in China. All of this was happening as Blackstone was quietly financing two Kushner endeavors. In June 2013, Kushner and CIM Group, a Los Angeles-based real-estate investor, bought an office building in Manhattan’s financial district. Though documents filed with New York show Deutsche Bank AG issued the group an $88 million loan for the property at 2 Rector St., Blackstone was also among the project’s lenders, according to a person familiar with the transaction. CIM and Kushner repaid the loan in full in March 2016 with the roughly $225-million sale of the property to investors, including Cove Property Group and Bentall Kennedy. Undisclosed Partners A similar arrangement enabled Kushner Cos.’ purchase of five Jehovah’s Witnesses warehouse and printing buildings that October. Documents show Natixis Real Estate Capital loaned Kushner’s consortium $249 million for the deal. Again, Blackstone was among the undisclosed partners. The buildings, in the Brooklyn neighborhood known as Dumbo -- the acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass -- were the first step in realizing Jared Kushner’s dream of a new business hub for startups and technology companies. The Witnesses’ headquarters, famous for its red “WATCHTOWER” sign, wouldn’t come until later. Last August, Kushner Cos. and its partners bought the building with $376 million in loans from a limited liability company controlled by Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc. The deal came a few weeks after Trump briefly eclipsed Clinton in the polls. Kushner, still in his role as CEO, announced plans to transform the property “into one of the marquee urban office campuses anywhere in the country, let alone New York City.” The future success of the development is far from certain, as large office tenants still haven’t warmed to Brooklyn, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. Kushner Cos. will begin looking for companies to move into the Watchtower building soon. Purchasing Power Two things are more certain. First, the Saudis were very happy with the arms sale. Second, Blackstone’s securing the pledge from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund moves the company closer to its goal of having more than $100 billion of purchasing power for infrastructure projects, an asset type where private investment has been limited by lengthy planning and permitting processes. Thanks to the Saudi boost, Blackstone shares are once again above their initial public offering price of $31 after slumping two years ago. That means Schwarzman, as well as having Trump’s ear, has about $500 million more in net worth. Loading Other Articles...

The slow economic recovery, combined with costs related to the digital revolution and heightened regulation, means mergers will likely continue. If the trends of the last two decades continue, half of the regional and community banks in the U.S. will be gone before today’s infants finish college. But the next wave of mergers will also be driven, at least in part, by a less-publicized factor: the anticipated drop in available deposits over the coming years. Since the financial crisis, easy access to liquidity for banks of all sizes — but particularly regional and community banks — has had a lot to do with the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. Between 2009 and 2014, the Fed injected excess reserves of $2.5 trillion into the banking system to encourage lending and help jump-start the economy. Meanwhile, the long period of historically low interest rates restricted competition for deposits in the industry. A high-rate environment usually leads to banks jockeying for customers based on deposit yields — a contest typically won by the biggest banks. Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers that waiting too long to raise interest rates would be "unwise." But higher rates and an unwinding of excess reserves will likely mean a drop in available bank deposits. Bloomberg News But more recently, the Fed has been upfront about its plans to slowly raise rates and unwind excess reserves. In March, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate for the second time in three months. The central bank left rates unchanged in May. But Fed Chair Janet Yellen's comments earlier this year to members of Congress were telling when she said that waiting too long to raise rates would be “unwise.” A report in May from JPMorgan Chase, according to news coverage of it, estimates that $1.5 trillion could be sucked out of the system over the next five years if the Fed follows through with recent guidance moving ahead with reversal its “quantitative easing” measures. The Fed’s post-crisis accommodative policies led to a lower cost of funds for banks that in turn saw their deposit balances grow. But a concern is that a suddenly higher cost of funds will lead to deposit declines. Without a sudden growth in retail deposits, community and regional banks will be forced to reduce assets or seek alternative funding. The ability of community and regional banks to win deposits with slightly higher rates than larger competitors has also been complicated by the ability of retail depositors to shop for rates online. Higher yields on customer deposits could benefit the largest banks, which can afford to more aggressively market higher yields in a bid to grow their deposits. In the past, brokered deposits had provided relief to smaller banks from shortfalls in funding. But recent regulatory guidance suggests that brokered funds would not be the resource they once were. Regulators have let their concerns be known that they view such deposits as having funded “unsound or rapid expansion of loan and investment portfolios” in the crisis, and that overuse of such funding has “contributed to bank failures and losses.” Large banks would also be better positioned than smaller institutions to make up for a loss of deposits by replacing them with other types of funding from the capital markets. If deposits fall as predicted, banks are likely to search for merger opportunities that will broaden their deposit base. While factors like fintech competitors and increased regulatory burden may be stealing the limelight, it may be the more mundane “lack of deposit growth” that will ultimately cause more banks to look for the exit. While many banks are considering merging or selling, a number of successful regional banks have chosen to focus on niche industries, specialized products or underbanked geographies. Whatever path is chosen, management needs to clearly articulate its strategy to remain competitive in a tightening deposit environment. Anything less than a well-considered plan for managing this oft-underestimated risk invites potential regulatory scrutiny or even shareholder action.

Production cuts will stay on until next March to boost prices. However, no long-term strategy appears to be in place to stabilise the market. Meanwhile, high cost US producers are grateful for higher prices that allow them back into the game. Vienna (AsiaNews/Agencies) – The agreement between OPEC countries led by Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC nations led by Russia to reduce output has been extended by another nine months, starting on 1st July. Curbs on production were put in place in November, when the Vienna-based 14-member oil exporters cartel agree to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day, whilst non-OPEC countries accepted a reduction of 600,000 barrels. The attempt to push up prices by reducing the amount of oil available in the market has had some good results but it cannot be taken for granted in the future. This is especially true since higher prices have revived US production, which has higher costs. In fact, the new deal has not had the desired effect, as oil prices dropped below US$ 50 a barrel. The market seems to have already factored in the new extension agreed by Russia and Saudi Arabia. And an additional nine months cannot preclude that in March 2018 prices might fall below US$ 30 a barrel. “What concerns me is that there is no clear messaging around the exit strategy,” said Ebele Kemery, head of energy investing at JPMorgan Asset Management. “The way we look at the market going forward, there’s going to be oversupply in 2018. They’re talking about price stability,” she added. “To get price stability we need to know what the end-game is.” Kemery’s concern over a lack of strategy appears to be widespread. Still, cuts did succeed in establishing a new floor for prices that is well above the lows seen last year. Indeed, “OPEC is settling in for the long haul,’’ said Roger Diwan, an OPEC watcher at consultant IHS Markit Ltd in Washington. “I think we’ll remain between and a barrel for the time being.” The agreement, which includes countries accounting for 60 per cent of the world’s oil production, has already delivered for national budgets from Moscow to Tehran, as higher prices outweighed lower production. “This is a historic deal, it already was in November and now still more,” said Jan Stuart, chief energy economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. “Now we have more confidence of a 2017 rebalance.” The last time both sides worked together was 15 years ago. Back then, the agreement fell apart soon after it was made. But for Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, the relationship now between OPEC and non-members was at a “pivotal moment.” This may shift though in 2018, said Ronald Smith, senior oil analyst at Citigroup Inc. in Moscow. It may not be in Vladimir Putin’s best interest to keep new oilfields on the shelf. The lost revenue would be felt mostly by state-owned Rosneft PJSC on projects scheduled to ramp up production in 2018 and 2019. “Rosneft, the state-owned champion, will have invested a lot of money in these fields that will be sitting idle if they continue to extend the agreement,” Smith said. “At some point they may decide they need to take back some market share.” Similarly, back in March, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih told an industry conference in Houston that the kingdom’s policy was to manage output “for a restricted period of time, with the aim of accelerating rebalancing, and then allowing the free market to work.” "All the simulations that have been done by OPEC and non-OPEC experts . . . demonstrated that we will be within the five-year average in the first quarter of next year," Khalid al-Falih said. e-mail this to a friend Printable version TAGs saudi arabia russia oil opec prices e-mail this to a friend :OPEC and non-OPEC countries close to a new nine-month deal Middle East South Asia Central Asia North Asia South East Asia East Asia South West Asia Afghanistan Armenia Azerbaijan Bahrain Bangladesh Bhutan Brunei Myanmar Cambodia China East Timor Georgia India Indonesia Iran Iraq Israel Japan Kazakhstan North Korea South Korea Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Laos Lebanon Macau Malaysia Mongolia Nepal Oman Pakistan Philippines Qatar Russia Saudi Arabia Singapore Sri Lanka Syria Taiwan Tajikistan Thailand Turkey Turkmenistan United Arab Emirates Uzbekistan Vietnam Yemen Palestine Hong Kong Jordan Europe Nord America Sud America Africa ​Saudi Arabia and Russia get all 24 countries to agree.

Emerging assets have taken heart in recent days from relatively dovish minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, though disappointment over the scale of oil supply cuts announced by OPEC kept the MSCI emerging equity index from adding significantly to gains. The benchmark has, however, posted a rise every month in 2017, for year-to-date gains of almost 18 percent and while currencies were flat on the day versus the dollar, most are up for the third straight week. Emerging market funds continue to receive new money, JPMorgan said, though its data showed inflows halved from the previous week to $1.2 billion for equity funds and $1 billion coming into emerging debt funds. With the VIX volatility gauge at two-week lows and just off recent multi-year troughs, the backdrop remains positive for emerging markets, said Cristian Maggio, a strategist at TD Securities. "As long as volatility remains low, emerging currencies provide a quite high carry, and many short-term traders don't care about the fundamentals, they just care about the money they make for the next day and it remains an environment where they can make quite a bit of money," Maggio said. Currency gains were led by the yuan which hit the firmest level since February with a weekly 0.3 percent gain. This is partly down to hefty dollar sales by Chinese banks on Thursday following the Moody's rating cut. The sudden surge in the yuan shows that the Chinese authorities might "attempt to give a warning to the RMB bears who speculate on RMB depreciation following the downgrade on China", said Ken Cheung, Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. The yuan was also lifted by flows from overseas as the offshore yuan rose to the strongest level since February after Hong Kong's overnight yuan borrowing rate jumped to six-month highs. The South African rand slipped off one-month highs hit after the central bank kept interest rates on hold while local bond yields rose. Leaders of the ruling African National Party (ANC) are to meet over the weekend and rumours swirled of President Jacob Zuma's removal. This has been denied by the party and Maggio called it wishful thinking. "The odds that Zuma will be ending his term prematurely are increasing, but I don't think it means this will happen over the weekend. So we may see a correction in the rand next week," he added.

Emerging assets have taken heart in recent days from relatively dovish minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, though disappointment over the scale of oil supply cuts announced by OPEC kept the MSCI emerging equity index from adding significantly to gains. The benchmark has, however, posted a rise every month in 2017, for year-to-date gains of almost 18 percent and while currencies were flat on the day versus the dollar, most are up for the third straight week. Emerging market funds continue to receive new money, JPMorgan said, though its data showed inflows halved from the previous week to $1.2 billion for equity funds and $1 billion coming into emerging debt funds. With the VIX volatility gauge at two-week lows and just off recent multi-year troughs, the backdrop remains positive for emerging markets, said Cristian Maggio, a strategist at TD Securities. "As long as volatility remains low, emerging currencies provide a quite high carry, and many short-term traders don't care about the fundamentals, they just care about the money they make for the next day and it remains an environment where they can make quite a bit of money," Maggio said. Currency gains were led by the yuan which hit the firmest level since February with a weekly 0.3 percent gain. This is partly down to hefty dollar sales by Chinese banks on Thursday following the Moody's rating cut. The sudden surge in the yuan shows that the Chinese authorities might "attempt to give a warning to the RMB bears who speculate on RMB depreciation following the downgrade on China", said Ken Cheung, Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. The yuan was also lifted by flows from overseas as the offshore yuan rose to the strongest level since February after Hong Kong's overnight yuan borrowing rate jumped to six-month highs. The South African rand slipped off one-month highs hit after the central bank kept interest rates on hold while local bond yields rose. Leaders of the ruling African National Party (ANC) are to meet over the weekend and rumours swirled of President Jacob Zuma's removal. This has been denied by the party and Maggio called it wishful thinking. "The odds that Zuma will be ending his term prematurely are increasing, but I don't think it means this will happen over the weekend. So we may see a correction in the rand next week," he added.

What went unnoticed -- and is largely unknown -- is how important Blackstone is to the Kushner family company. Quotes in the article Blackstone Group LP BX ▲ 32.58 +0.11 +0.34% Graham Holdings Co GHC ▼ 594.05 -0.15 -0.03% General Motors Co GM ▲ 33.07 +0.47 +1.44% Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc HLT ▲ 65.34 +0.21 +0.32% Since 2013, Blackstone has loaned more than $400 million to finance four Kushner Cos. deals -- two of which have not been reported -- making it one of the business’s largest lenders. And their ties go beyond the loans. Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone’s co-founder and chief executive officer, heads Trump’s business-advisory council and was in Riyadh with the president and Kushner. The Saudi promise to invest in Blackstone’s fund drove the firm’s stock up more than 8 percent. A Blackstone spokeswoman, Christine Anderson, said the company began talks with the Saudis a year ago, “well before President Trump was even his party’s nominee.” Blackstone is one of the largest non-bank real-estate lenders, and corporate deals are often announced during state visits. A spokesman for Kushner Cos. declined to comment. But the sequence of the deals and the intertwined personal relationships of the principals raise concerns about conflicts of interest. Schwarzman, one of the world’s richest businessmen, is a Republican and, like Trump, a resident of New York and Palm Beach. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and Kushner’s wife, was an investor in a fund Blackstone created in 2010 to seed hedge funds, according to financial disclosures. Kushner has divested some of his assets to family members, and the White House says he’ll recuse himself when necessary. (Separately, the Washington Post reported in an unrelated matter Thursday, citing people familiar with the investigation, that Kushner is now a subject of the FBI probe into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Jamie Gorelick, an attorney for Kushner, told the Post that her client has cooperated with a congressional investigation into the matter and “will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.”) Advisory Panel Schwarzman’s advisory panel -- which also includes General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra, Tesla Inc. co-founder and CEO Elon Musk and JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon -- isn’t subject to ethics rules. Meanwhile, whether there are links among the arms deal, the Saudi investment and the loans, future steps will seem fraught. Schwarzman’s relationship with Trump is echoed in the next generation. Jon Gray, Blackstone’s global head of real estate, met with Trump when the president-elect was interviewing candidates for Treasury secretary even though he supported Hillary Clinton. Load Error Gray, 47, and Kushner, 36, have known each other for at least four years. They both had much to celebrate in March 2013 at the anniversary party for the New York Observer, a newspaper the Kushners own. Gray was coming off a year that saw Blackstone close on $13.3 billion of capital pledges for what was then the world’s biggest private-equity real-estate fund. He had been named to the Blackstone board, a sign he was being groomed for the top job at Schwarzman’s company.  ‘25 to Watch’ Days earlier, the Observer named Gray among “25 to Watch” for its annual list of “100 Most Influential New Yorkers.” The paper has often heaped praise on those with whom its owners might do business, and the recommendation to watch Gray was prescient. Shares in Blackstone doubled in 2013, thanks in large part to Gray’s real-estate deals. These included the December 2013 initial public offering of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., which became the most profitable private-equity deal on record, and would later play a key role in Blackstone’s search for investors outside the U.S., notably in China.  All of this was happening as Blackstone was quietly financing two Kushner endeavors. In June 2013, Kushner and CIM Group, a Los Angeles-based real-estate investor, bought an office building in Manhattan’s financial district. Though documents filed with New York show Deutsche Bank AG issued the group an $88 million loan for the property at 2 Rector St., Blackstone was also among the project’s lenders, according to a person familiar with the transaction. CIM and Kushner repaid the loan in full in March 2016 with the roughly $225-million sale of the property to investors, including Cove Property Group and Bentall Kennedy. Undisclosed Partners A similar arrangement enabled Kushner Cos.’ purchase of five Jehovah’s Witnesses warehouse and printing buildings that October. Documents show Natixis Real Estate Capital loaned Kushner’s consortium $249 million for the deal. Again, Blackstone was among the undisclosed partners. The buildings, in the Brooklyn neighborhood known as Dumbo -- the acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass -- were the first step in realizing Jared Kushner’s dream of a new business hub for startups and technology companies. The Witnesses’ headquarters, famous for its red “WATCHTOWER” sign, wouldn’t come until later. Last August, Kushner Cos. and its partners bought the building with $376 million in loans from a limited liability company controlled by Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc. The deal came a few weeks after Trump briefly eclipsed Clinton in the polls. Kushner, still in his role as CEO, announced plans to transform the property “into one of the marquee urban office campuses anywhere in the country, let alone New York City.” The future success of the development is far from certain, as large office tenants still haven’t warmed to Brooklyn, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. Kushner Cos. will begin looking for companies to move into the Watchtower building soon. Purchasing Power Two things are more certain. First, the Saudis were very happy with the arms sale. Second, Blackstone’s securing the pledge from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund moves the company closer to its goal of having more than $100 billion of purchasing power for infrastructure projects, an asset type where private investment has been limited by lengthy planning and permitting processes. Thanks to the Saudi boost, Blackstone shares are once again above their initial public offering price of $31 after slumping two years ago. That means Schwarzman, as well as having Trump’s ear, has about $500 million more in net worth. --With assistance from David Kocieniewski Amanda Gordon and David M.

And another 16 investment trusts can demonstrate that they have raised their payout to shareholders for more than 20 years, according to data from the Association of Investment Companies (see table below). Hindsight is a wonderful thing in investing, but if you had bought into the best-performing of the 20 trusts, the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust,  ten years ago you would now be sat on a capital return of nearly 300 per cent. Of the four 50-year dividend heroes, the Bankers Investment Trust is the best performing share over the last decade with a gain of 142 per cent. That’s double the gains over the same period for the FTSE All Share index at 73 per cent. INVESTMENT TRUST DIVIDEND HEROES Source: AIC using Morningstar Company Sector Number of consecutive years dividend increased % Dividend Yield (as at 24 May 2017) % share price return over 10 years to 24 May 2017 City of London Investment Trust UK Equity Income 50 3.8 117.4 Bankers Investment Trust Global 50 2.2 141.5 Caledonia Investments Global 50 1.9 60.3 Alliance Trust Global 50 1.8 135.5 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust Global 46 1.7 138.9 F&C Global Smaller Companies Global 46 0.9 204.1 Brunner Investment Trust Global 45 2.3 101.1 JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust UK Equity Income 44 3.6 74.4 Murray Income UK Equity Income 43 4.0 74.7 Witan Investment Trust Global 42 1.9 158.7 Scottish American Global Equity Income 37 3.1 106.9 Merchants Trust UK Equity Income 35 4.9 60.0 Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust Global 34 0.8 295.2 Temple Bar UK Equity Income 33 3.1 121.3 Scottish Investment Trust Global 33 1.7 99.9 Value & Income UK Equity Income 29 3.9 62.2 F&C Capital & Income UK Equity Income 23 3.3 86.2 British & American UK Equity Income 22 8.4 87.8 Northern Investors Company* Private Equity 21 3.8 510.6 Schroder Income Growth UK Equity Income 21 3.7 105.7 *Please note Northern Investors Company is winding up The Bankers Investment Trust 'seeks to maximise returns for shareholders through a broadly diversified international portfolio. The trust aims to deliver capital growth in excess of the FTSE All-Share Index, and regular dividend growth that exceeds the rise in the Retail Prices Index.' The most recent addition to the 50-year club is also the poorest performer of the four in terms of capital returns: Caledonia Investments, with a yield of 1.9 per cent, has seen its share price appreciate by 60 per cent over the last decade, lagging the FTSE All-Share.

Share this article Share But Caledonia can this year boast a hefty special dividend of 100p per share, payable alongside the final dividend. Commenting on the extra payout, chief executive of the £1.8bn trust William Wyatt said, ‘We believe it appropriate to augment the long term yield offered to shareholders by our ordinary dividend through payment of occasional special dividends when the company’s long-term business model delivers cash in excess of our immediate strategic plans. ‘We are delighted to announce an increase of 4.2 per cent in our total dividends for the year,' he added. WHAT ARE INVESTMENT TRUSTS? Investment trusts are effectively funds that are listed on the stock market. Investors buy shares in the company, which can be independent or run by one of the big asset management firms. A manager runs the trust in a similar way to a fund - placing its money in assets like equities, private equity, bonds and commodities - in order to increase the trust's value and therefore share price, and often to pay dividends to investors. They are an easy way for retail investors to gain access to particular sectors and regions of the world, and often charge lower fees than similar funds. According to stock market information, Caledonia 'focuses on established businesses, where return on capital employed is a differentiator of longer term performance. The company's investments include listed and private companies, as well as funds, in a range of sectors and geographies'.  The other two trusts to have raised dividends for five decades are the City of London Investment Trust (yield 3.8 per cent, 10-year return of 117 per cent) and the Alliance Trust (yield 1.8 per cent, 10-year return of 136 per cent. Of all 20 trusts the most stellar capital return comes from the Northern Investors' Company, a Newcastle-based private equity trust that saw its value increase by an eye-watering 510 per cent in the last ten years - but it is in the process of being wound up. After that it is the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust that can boast a share price gain of 295 per cent since May 2007 and a current yield of 0.8 per cent. It has increased the dividend annually for 34 years. The highest yield meanwhile is to be found at the British & American investment trust, which pays out 8.4 per cent of a share price that has appreciated by 88 per cent in the last 10 years. It has raised the divi for 22 years. Annabel Brodie-Smith of the AIC said, 'It’s an achievement to now have four investment companies that have consecutively increased their dividends for 50 years.  'With interest rates at an all-time low, investors remain hungry for income and investment companies have the unique ability to "smooth" dividends, meaning they can boost dividends from their reserves when times get tough.'

Will the lucrative yet delicate relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia survive the life of the agreement? Will surging U.S. shale output prove too much temptation for OPEC countries to stick to their own production promises? And, perhaps most perplexing: What does OPEC have planned long-term? The deal to maintain the cut another nine months, hammered out this week in Vienna, could expire in March with a return to OPEC's pump-at-will policy that prevailed between 2014 and 2016 and pushed prices below $30 a barrel. Or the organization could keep adjusting production. "What concerns me is that there is no clear messaging around the exit strategy," Ebele Kemery, head of energy investing at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV. "The way we look at the market going forward, there's going to be oversupply in 2018. They're talking about price stability. To get price stability we need to know what the end-game is." Kemery's concern over a lack of strategy appeared to be widespread. Brent crude fell 5 percent to $51.24 a barrel on the decision, wiping out most of the gains since Russia and Saudi Arabia publicly backed the nine-month extension last week. Futures in London slid 25 cents to $51.21 a barrel at 12:35 p.m. Singapore time, heading for a weekly decline. New Floor Despite an admission that November's landmark agreement to limit output failed to eliminate the global oil glut, the commitment of two-dozen oil-producing countries did succeed in establishing a new floor for prices that's well above the lows seen last year. "OPEC is settling in for the long haul,'' said Roger Diwan, an OPEC watcher at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. in Washington. "I think we'll remain between $50 and $60 a barrel for the time being.'' The agreement, which includes countries accounting for 60 percent of the world's oil production, has already delivered for national budgets from Moscow to Tehran, as higher prices outweighed lower production. "This is a historic deal, it already was in November and now still more,'' said Jan Stuart, chief energy economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. "Now we have more confidence of a 2017 rebalance.'' The extension to March prolongs a rare period of collaboration between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some of its biggest rivals. The last time both sides worked together was 15 years ago. Back then, the agreement fell apart soon after it was made. Alexander Novak, Russia's energy minister, said the relationship between OPEC and non-members of the cartel was at a "pivotal moment.'' Shifting Calculus The calculus may shift in 2018, testing the increasingly close cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia, according to Ronald Smith, senior oil analyst at Citigroup Inc. in Moscow. It may not be in the best interest of Vladimir Putin's balance sheet to keep new oilfields on the shelf. The lost revenue would be felt mostly by state-owned Rosneft PJSC on projects scheduled to ramp up production in 2018 and 2019. "Rosneft, the state-owned champion, will have invested a lot of money in these fields that will be sitting idle if they continue to extend the agreement,'' Smith said. "The math is going to be more ambiguous going forward. At some point they may decide they need to take back some market share.'' Also a contender in the battle for market share -- and producers who didn't sign on to the Vienna agreement -- are U.S. shale drillers, who could benefit from this week's deal. Higher Inventories Resurgent U.S. production has meant oil inventories remain well above the level targeted by OPEC ministers. Analysts at energy consultant Wood MacKenzie said the deal extension would help U.S. shale oil output accelerate to its fastest growth rate in years. In 2018, global oil inventories would increase by about 600,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, followed by about 500,000 each quarter for the rest of the year. "There's still an oversupply to wrestle with," said Simon Flowers, chief analyst at the consultant. Even so, after more than two years of flip-flopping from market management to pump-at-will and back again, it's not clear what OPEC will do next. As recently as March, the production ceiling was envisaged as a short-term prop to rapidly bring a glut of global oil inventories back to historically typical levels. In March, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih told an industry conference in Houston that the kingdom's policy was to manage output "for a restricted period of time, with the aim of accelerating rebalancing, and then allowing the free market to work." That is exactly what some fear, and Al-Falih did not dispel those concerns on Thursday, telling Bloomberg, "This is not a structural intervention.'' With the deal agreed to, Al-Falih said he expected OPEC to achieve its goal of returning global oil inventories to their five-year average by the end of the year. He reiterated a pledge "to do whatever it takes" to rebalance the market. If Al-Falih's optimistic outlook is correct, OPEC may not need a clear exit strategy. "The exit strategy for OPEC is, eventually, when the market is tight enough, start to cheat on the cuts,'' said Gary Ross, global head of oil at PIRA Energy Group, part of S&P Global Inc.

From manipulating LIBOR, a benchmark interest rate, to rigging the daily fix of foreign-exchange (FX) rates, traders have shown themselves ready not just to stretch the rules, but to collude in outright illegality. A global code of conduct for the FX market, unveiled on May 25th, aims to put things on a sounder footing. Drawn up over the past two years by a coalition of central bankers, known as the FX Working Group (FXWG), and supported by a panel of industry participants, the code’s 55 principles lay down international standards on a range of practices, from the handling of confidential information to the pricing and settlement of deals.

Graphic detail12 hours ago A spat over language erupts at the World Bank Graphic detail14 hours ago Our general election poll tracker Graphic detail14 hours ago See all updates Such standards seem long overdue in the massive FX market. Roughly $5trn is traded every day (see chart). Many companies, pension funds and money managers depend on banks to hedge their exposure to currency fluctuations. Yet in the past traders colluded with one another in internet chat rooms, secretly swapping client data in order to rig the widely used WM/Reuters benchmark exchange rates. Some were caught and fired. Banks such as Citigroup, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS paid billions of dollars in fines. The FX market has always been lightly regulated, but many countries do have codes of conduct, usually drafted by the central bank in consultation with market participants. Often, however, the codes were defective: they missed areas vulnerable to malpractice; and were rarely updated, scantily enforced and widely flouted. The new code starts with some advantages. It will supersede the national codes, and provide a single global set of principles, with adherence closely monitored by a newly formed committee of central bankers and trading institutions. It is also designed to reflect current market practice, with clear guidelines on communication between participants and on trade-execution practices—two areas of weakness highlighted by the scandal. Managers of FX traders will now be enjoined to limit access to confidential information, and to ensure that clear guidance has been given on approved channels of communication. Greater disclosure is also demanded on how orders are processed, so that clients will never lose oversight and control of their trades. The code will, however, be voluntary. Guy Debelle of the Reserve Bank of Australia, who led the drafting, reckons that to write binding rules for a global market would have been more convoluted and less effective. Principles, he argues, are harder to exploit or ignore than rules. Alongside the code itself, the FXWG has developed a blueprint for adoption, which makes those active in the market responsible for embedding the code in their day-to-day operations. Central banks have committed themselves to leading by example, by implementing the code for their own FX activities. Consideration is being given to maintaining public registers of those who have signed up. “I wouldn’t underestimate the impact of peer pressure in improving behaviour,” says Mr Debelle. Given the painfully low level of trust in foreign-exchange and other financial markets, central bankers are adamant that codes like these must not be ignored or allowed to become outdated. The new global FX committee will monitor the success of the project and consider the case for further updates. But the incentives for adherence do not seem compelling. Whether the code actually prevents market malfeasance will be determined by the many institutions, large and small, that trade FX each day. And, as the market has proved in the past, it is important not to underestimate the power of peer pressure to worsen behaviour as well as improve it.

What went unnoticed -- and is largely unknown -- is how important Blackstone is to the Kushner family company. Schwarzman, right, with Trump at the White House on April 11. Photographer: Olivier Douliery/Pool via Bloomberg Since 2013, Blackstone has loaned more than $400 million to finance four Kushner Cos. deals -- two of which have not been reported -- making it one of the business’s largest lenders. And their ties go beyond the loans. Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone’s co-founder and chief executive officer, heads Trump’s business-advisory council and was in Riyadh with the president and Kushner. The Saudi promise to invest in Blackstone’s fund drove the firm’s stock up more than 8 percent. A Blackstone spokeswoman, Christine Anderson, said the company began talks with the Saudis a year ago, “well before President Trump was even his party’s nominee.” Blackstone is one of the largest non-bank real-estate lenders, and corporate deals are often announced during state visits. A spokesman for Kushner Cos. declined to comment. But the sequence of the deals and the intertwined personal relationships of the principals raise concerns about conflicts of interest. Schwarzman, one of the world’s richest businessmen, is a Republican and, like Trump, a resident of New York and Palm Beach. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and Kushner’s wife, was an investor in a fund Blackstone created in 2010 to seed hedge funds, according to financial disclosures. Kushner has divested some of his assets to family members, and the White House says he’ll recuse himself when necessary. (Separately, the Washington Post reported in an unrelated matter Thursday, citing people familiar with the investigation, that Kushner is now a subject of the FBI probe into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Jamie Gorelick, an attorney for Kushner, told the Post that her client has cooperated with a congressional investigation into the matter and “will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.”) Advisory Panel Schwarzman’s advisory panel -- which also includes General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra, Tesla Inc. co-founder and CEO Elon Musk and JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon -- isn’t subject to ethics rules. Meanwhile, whether there are links among the arms deal, the Saudi investment and the loans, future steps will seem fraught. Schwarzman’s relationship with Trump is echoed in the next generation. Jon Gray, Blackstone’s global head of real estate, met with Trump when the president-elect was interviewing candidates for Treasury secretary even though he supported Hillary Clinton. Jared Kushner and Jon Gray. Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg Gray, 47, and Kushner, 36, have known each other for at least four years. They both had much to celebrate in March 2013 at the anniversary party for the New York Observer, a newspaper the Kushners own. Gray was coming off a year that saw Blackstone close on $13.3 billion of capital pledges for what was then the world’s biggest private-equity real-estate fund. He had been named to the Blackstone board, a sign he was being groomed for the top job at Schwarzman’s company.  ‘25 to Watch’ Days earlier, the Observer named Gray among “25 to Watch” for its annual list of “100 Most Influential New Yorkers.” The paper has often heaped praise on those with whom its owners might do business, and the recommendation to watch Gray was prescient. Shares in Blackstone doubled in 2013, thanks in large part to Gray’s real-estate deals. These included the December 2013 initial public offering of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., which became the most profitable private-equity deal on record, and would later play a key role in Blackstone’s search for investors outside the U.S., notably in China.  All of this was happening as Blackstone was quietly financing two Kushner endeavors. In June 2013, Kushner and CIM Group, a Los Angeles-based real-estate investor, bought an office building in Manhattan’s financial district. Though documents filed with New York show Deutsche Bank AG issued the group an $88 million loan for the property at 2 Rector St., Blackstone was also among the project’s lenders, according to a person familiar with the transaction. CIM and Kushner repaid the loan in full in March 2016 with the roughly $225-million sale of the property to investors, including Cove Property Group and Bentall Kennedy. Undisclosed Partners A similar arrangement enabled Kushner Cos.’ purchase of five Jehovah’s Witnesses warehouse and printing buildings that October. Documents show Natixis Real Estate Capital loaned Kushner’s consortium $249 million for the deal. Again, Blackstone was among the undisclosed partners. The buildings, in the Brooklyn neighborhood known as Dumbo -- the acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass -- were the first step in realizing Jared Kushner’s dream of a new business hub for startups and technology companies. The Witnesses’ headquarters, famous for its red “WATCHTOWER” sign, wouldn’t come until later. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Last August, Kushner Cos. and its partners bought the building with $376 million in loans from a limited liability company controlled by Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc. The deal came a few weeks after Trump briefly eclipsed Clinton in the polls. Kushner, still in his role as CEO, announced plans to transform the property “into one of the marquee urban office campuses anywhere in the country, let alone New York City.” The future success of the development is far from certain, as large office tenants still haven’t warmed to Brooklyn, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. Kushner Cos. will begin looking for companies to move into the Watchtower building soon. Purchasing Power Two things are more certain. First, the Saudis were very happy with the arms sale. Second, Blackstone’s securing the pledge from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund moves the company closer to its goal of having more than $100 billion of purchasing power for infrastructure projects, an asset type where private investment has been limited by lengthy planning and permitting processes. Thanks to the Saudi boost, Blackstone shares are once again above their initial public offering price of $31 after slumping two years ago. That means Schwarzman, as well as having Trump’s ear, has about $500 million more in net worth. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE Most Read Forget Supersonic.

Barclays suspended Jack Murray in October 2013, shortly after regulators began probing banks suspected of manipulating the global-currencies market. During that investigation, the lender discovered Murray shared bank secrets with rivals, including trading positions, strategies, stop-loss orders, spreads and customer orders, according to a December judgment released by the court Thursday. Murray worked for Chris Ashton, a member of the “Cartel” instant-messaging group that was at the center of regulatory probes into the rigging of foreign-exchange benchmarks. Global banks have paid about $10 billion to resolve investigations related to the issue. Almost a dozen FX traders and sales people have sued their former employers in the past two years, claiming they were made scapegoats by banks rushing to appease regulators amid the scandal. Murray is the third Barclays trader to  lose an employment suit, following Ashton and another trader, Mark Clark. A Barclays spokesman declined to comment. A call and email to Murray’s lawyer weren’t immediately returned. The bank’s internal probe had cleared Murray of attempting to manipulate currency benchmarks. The release of the ruling by the court was likely delayed amid a transition to a new electronic database of employment tribunal decisions. Fixing FX: The Currency Trader’s New Guide to Ethical Behavior Murray’s conduct "in terms of exchanging confidential trading information with competitors and the inappropriate and highly sexually explicit language were all extremely serious and it was reasonable” for the bank to conclude they amounted to gross misconduct, the judge said in the ruling. In the judgment, the judge said Murray disclosed a client nickname in a chatroom with Ashton and another member of the Cartel, Richard Usher, who at the time was working for JPMorgan Chase & Co. Murray “agreed the nickname would probably have been widely known inside the bank and did not know for sure whether anyone outside the bank would recognize the nickname, but would speculate that this was the case," the judge said. As Usher "was in the chatroom it is likely that the nickname was used because he would understand who was being referred to." During the trial in July, Murray blushed in the witness stand as he was urged to explain to the courtroom sexual and racist slang he’d used in chat rooms on the Bloomberg terminal’s instant messaging service -- language that he said was common among traders. It was referred to as “pub speak” in the ruling. "I was following those around me," he said while giving evidence. “I never at any point thought I was doing anything wrong.” The ruling is one of the last in a spate of lawsuits brought by employees in the wake of the foreign-exchange scandal. David Madaras, a former Citigroup Inc. trader, is awaiting his ruling. Unlike Barclays, which won all three lawsuits initiated by former FX traders, other banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Citigroup have had mixed success. One RBS trader and several from Citigroup won their suits, because the banks were too hasty to dismiss staff as a result of regulatory scrutiny. Still, the courts declined to award substantial sums. In most cases, the judges found the firings were justified, and the lenders would have won should they have taken more time to follow proper procedures.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Where the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF Finds Its Top Dividend Stocks If you're looking to add income investments to your stock portfolio, you can take a cue from which sectors the best dividend-focused ETFs are buying. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) May 26, 2017 at 4:30PM Dividend investors know the value of owning stocks that make regular payments to their shareholders, and many have come to trust exchange-traded funds that specialize in finding top dividend stocks. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) focuses on dividend stocks that pay above-average yields, and it has produced solid returns for its shareholders over time. The ETF scours the market to find the best opportunities for income-producing investments, and where it has found the best prospects is a bit surprising. The market's attitude toward dividends has changed dramatically in recent years, and the stocks that make up Vanguard High Dividend Yield's portfolio come from places that many wouldn't expect. The top source of dividend stocks for the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF The consumer-goods space has been a fertile ground for dividend stocks over the years. That's largely because the mature companies that dominate it are in a better position than many of their younger counterparts in other industries to return excess capital to shareholders. With fewer opportunities to effectively reinvest free cash flow in pursuit of faster growth, many of those consumer products giants instead simply boost their dividend payouts gradually over time. Vanguard High Dividend Yield has about 15% of its assets in consumer goods stocks, with Procter & Gamble among its top holdings. P&G's more than 60-year streak of annual dividend increases is a testament to the power of the consumer sector to generate income, and Vanguard ETF shareholders get the benefit of its dividends as well as those of the dozens of other consumer stocks it owns. Image source: Getty Images. The up-and-coming dividend-paying sector Where things get interesting, though, is with Vanguard High Dividend Yield's second-most important sector. Technology is a close runner-up, accounting for 14.3% of the portfolio. Microsoft is the fund's top holding. For a long time, tech companies needed every spare dollar they could find in order to fund their growth. Now, though, as the sector matures, it includes a number of older tech giants that have accumulated billions of dollars in cash. Lacking tempting enough opportunities to invest those funds strategically, many have turned to dividends, and yields among some of the larger stocks in the tech space are well above the average yield for the U.S. stock market as a whole. Returning to normal The third-largest share of the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF comes from the financial industry. That sector currently accounts for 13.6% of the ETF's overall assets, and you'll find banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo among the top five holdings of the fund. What's particularly remarkable about financial stocks' position here is that they've made such a huge recovery after the crushing blow that the financial crisis dealt them in 2008 and 2009. In the wake of that crash, most bank stocks nearly eliminated their payouts, in some cases ending long streaks of increases and making the industry a non-entity on the dividend front. Yet as the economy bounced back, banks found ways to restore their dividends. While their yields aren't as high as they once were, major institutions are healthier financially than they were in the past. Given time, financials might well grow their payouts enough to reclaim the top spot in this and similar dividend-centric ETFs. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF combs the market for the dividend stocks with the best prospects for current income. Where  it finds them changes over time. Staying on top of where such funds are discovering what they see as the strongest dividend stocks will give you a head start in your search for income investments for your own portfolio.

In a win for Dublin’s campaign to attract financial services firms in the wake of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Legal & General Investment Management will move the operations subject to regulatory approval, L&G said on Friday. LGIM’s decision follows plans by rival fund manager M&G, a subsidiary of Prudential, to set up a management company and distribution arm in Luxembourg, which along with Dublin is one of Europe’s main hubs for fund services. LGIM is one of Europe’s largest investors, with just under 900 billion pounds of assets under management at the end of 2016, and one of the biggest investors in the UK stock market. “This is yet another very important signal to the market that financial services companies can come to Ireland quickly and service their European customers, with minimum disruption to their business,” said Martin Shanahan, the head of IDA Ireland, the state agency that attracts foreign investment. L&G said it foresaw no impact on operations and staff in other LGIM locations. Although asset manager Legg Mason said in March that it was setting up a management company in Ireland, Dublin missed out on two high profile moves after insurer AIG chose Luxembourg and Lloyd’s of London chose Brussels. L&G’s decision is the second boost to Ireland’s credentials this month after JPMorgan Chase, which currently employs around 500 people in Dublin, said it had agreed to buy a building in the city with room for 1,000 staff. And fellow insurer and asset manager Standard Life said last week that is was likely to choose Dublin as the base for its EU subsidiary after Britain leaves the bloc. The head of International Financial Services at IDA Ireland said on Thursday that several firms, including insurers, asset managers and banks, had confirmed they had chosen Ireland and announcements would be made from June onwards.

Tech Search Search CEO DailyCEO Daily: Saturday May 27, 2017 Tech-CeteraThis Is How CEOs Unplug from Work ChipotleChipotle Says Hackers Stole Customer Payment Card Information DiversityMarriott CEO: At a Time of Great Anxiety Around Diversity, We Need to Communicate AT&T launches its Internet TV service, DirecTV Now, in New York on Nov. 28, 2016. Phot credit: Dave Kotinsky Getty Images for DirecTV Tech AT&T’s DirecTV Now Sees Slower Subscriber Growth Aaron Pressman May 26, 2017 AT&T's Internet-delivered cable TV app, DirecTV Now, saw subscriber signs ups slide after an initial boom. The service, which provides access to more than 100 cable channels, had 328,000 subscriber in its first two months after debuting at the end of November, Bloomberg reported. But in February, DirecTV Now lost 3,000 subscribers and it showed no growth in March, the news service reported citing unnamed sources. Fortune contacted AT&T for comment and will update this story if it responds. DirecTV Now and several other Internet streaming services like Google's (googl) YouTube TV and Dish Network's (dish) Sling, seek to bring the experience of traditional cable TV to customers who don't want the expense or the hassles of the usual cable set up, with all the in-home wiring and set top boxes. But while the legions of so-called cord cutters are growing rapidly, it remains an open question just how interested they are in having access to the dozens of channels available on cable TV. Many seem more interested in Internet services like Netflix (nflx), Amazon's (amzn) Prime Video, and Hulu. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. DirecTV Now also suffered from a series of glitches and outages in its early weeks and a starting promotional price of $35 for 100 channels jumped to $60 after a few weeks (a $35 package is still available including about 60 channels). AT&T didn't disclose how many subscribers DirecTV Now had on its first quarter call with analysts on April 23. But CFO John Stephens said the company had purposely tried to slow subscriber growth to work out some of the kinks. "We deliberately pulled back on marketing to give the platform time to mature and improve, and we're seeing just that," he said. "You should expect us to be more aggressive with DirecTV Now in the second half of the year, with additional features and content." And CEO Randall Stephenson made a similar point earlier this week at a JPMorgan Chase investor conference. The rapid early pace of sign ups was "much faster than we were wanting to go," he said. "So we've kind of pulled back." Tech-CeteraThis Is How CEOs Unplug from Work ChipotleChipotle Says Hackers Stole Customer Payment Card Information FacebookHere’s Why Facebook Is Helping Google and Apple With Instant Articles GoldBitcoin Is Twice as Valuable as Gold Right Now Change.orgLinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman Invests Big Change In Change.org BitcoinBitcoin’s Wild Ride: Are Governments Fueling the Price Surge? Mark ZuckerbergThe 10 Best Quotes About Success From Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard Commencement Address Most Powerful WomenHow Virtual Reality Could Help Midwives Deliver Babies Stephenson's strategy has been to rely on bundling and combining services to attract more customers. AT&T wireless subscribers can watch DirecTV Now video on their phones without using up any of their data allowances, for example. And the company offers a $25 credit for unlimited data mobile subscribers who also buy any of its TV services, whether delivered by satellite, cable, or Internet app. Expect more bundles once AT&T closes on its $109 billion acquisition of entertainment giant Time Warner (twx), likely before the end of the year. Still, AT&T (t) has to strike a careful balance in promoting Internet video, as it's also the largest pay TV provider in the country, with its DirecTV satellite offering and U-Verse wired cable service. But those ranks have been shrinking—it lost a net 233,000 pay TV subscribers in the first quarter.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 26, 2017 9:08am   Comments Share: Amid the hype of the WannaCry scare, which catalyzed a 43-percent pop in bitcoin value, the cryptocurrency is all anyone’s talking about. In the last two months, it has more than tripled in price, from $925.20 on March 24 to $2,791.70 May 25. Wednesday’s rate was more than double that of April 30 and represented a 447-percent year-over-year gain. At the beginning of 2015, it was trading below $200, and at a present rate of $2,577.32, it’s continuing to shatter all-time highs. But even as the bitcoin rockets, some traders are disinclined to engage. Why Some Won’t Buy Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC and co-host of Benzinga’s PreMarket Prep radio show, remains skeptical, deterred primarily by uncertainty surrounding valuation and price targeting. “How do I sit back and crunch numbers and come up with a fundamental value for bitcoin?” he quipped on Thursday’s PreMarket Prep. “If you have a traditional currency like the Canadian dollar, you can look at trade, you can look at interest rates, you can look at what shape the economy is in to try to get a gauge for if people are going to demand Canadian dollars or not.” Jeff Goldman, author of "Failed Traders," can empathize. Related Link: Is It Possible To Turn $100 Into $70 Million? It Is If You Bought Bitcoin 7 Years Ago “It just comes down to supply and demand,” Goldman said on the show. “But the supply part is set on bitcoin, and now all it is is being demand-driven right now, so fundamentally, I don’t know how you value it, to be honest.” But that hasn’t prevented him from trying. Goldman weighs cryptocurrencies’ fundamental values partly by looking at “smart players” and high-profile companies buying in, and it appears other investors entertain similar strategies. Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) made a February play on Ethereum, the currency’s value has rose from $14.58 to $193.04. Another method of valuation is tracking the scheduled mining of bitcoins. Specific quantities are released periodically, and the exact number in circulation is easily discovered for calculations. Goldman’s Bitcoin Play As a believer in blockchain technology, Goldman first bought bitcoin in April 2015 at a value around $250. He continues to hold most of his portfolio amid all-time highs but has begun to sell some “because it’s just getting way, way bubbly at this point.” “Right now I think this is being driven by everybody wanting to get in,” he said. “There are only 16 million bitcoins ━ that’s not a lot of bitcoins [...] It’s really just hitting the news now, and there are real investors wanting to get in, and there’s just not a lot of supply of bitcoin.” Related Link: SEC To Review Decision Denying Bitcoin Market Listing Despite his active participation, Goldman understands why many opt for the sidelines. “To buy bitcoin is not all that easy,” he said. The process begins with opening an account through a platform like Coinbase and linking to a bank account. After that, traders are limited in the amount they can invest until they provide more personal information, such as a photo ID or social security number. Then the ceiling rises. Additionally, coin delivery takes days from the time of purchase, so access is not immediate.

Wall Street analysts believe the pace of the rally may slow, but that Amazon will be almost 10 percent higher a year from now. The stock came within one dollar of $1,000 during Thursday's session, touching an all-time high of $999 a share on the nose before falling back slightly, according to FactSet. It closed a little bit more than 1 percent higher on the day at $993.38. The average 12-month price target from 31 analysts for Amazon is $1,095 according to TipRanks. Susquehanna, Wedbush and Goldman Sachs all share the Wall Street high forecast of $1,250, according to the analyst tracking firm's database. Wall Street's Amazon average price target View photos Source: TipRanks Surprisingly, some on Wall Street think Amazon's online retail business is still at the beginning stages of growth. "We believe Amazon is well positioned as the market leader in e-commerce, where it's still early days with U.S. e-commerce representing ~12% of adjusted retail sales (ex-gas, food, and autos)," JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to clients on May 17. "We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall e-commerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party vs. third-party inventory and its Prime offering both serve as major advantages." Anmuth reaffirmed his $1,110 December 2017 price target and overweight rating for Amazon in the report. Amazon is one of the market's best-performing stocks, with its shares up 32 percent this year compared with the S&P 500's 8 percent return. The stock is also up 40 percent in the past 12 months. The internet company is driving the market's and hedge funds' performance. It was the third-largest contributor to the S&P 500's return year to date through May 18, according to a Goldman Sachs report Friday. The bank also noted 66 hedge funds had Amazon as a top 10 position at the end of the March quarter, which is the second-highest number after Facebook (NASDAQ: FB).

The deciding factor was not bonuses – although that played a role – but the prevailing regulatory authority, Ralph Van Helden, regional manager Benelux told the NRC. Although the Dutch central bank DNB was being consulted by Lloyd’s until the last moment, Lloyd’s preferred the ‘pragmatic’ approach of the Belgian central bank, Van Helden said. ‘We needed a regulator which understood the unique, complex structure of our company. This is all the more important as it will remain a small office, employing scores not hundreds of people,’ he told the paper. ‘Lloyd’s remains committed to its European markets following the ‘Brexit’ vote and is delivering on plans to continue trading with the single market,’ the company said in a website statement. Without a central EU base, Lloyd’s risked losing an annual €1.5bn in premium income. Amsterdam The race to attract the big London-based financial institutions post-Brexit is heating up with Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin and Amsterdam among the front runners. But Amsterdam is losing out on the bonus front – the 20% cap puts off many financial bosses. Last month US investment bank JPMorgan Chase announced it was moving its European headquarters to Frankfurt, saying the bonus cap was an important reason not to consider Amsterdam. British bank Standard Chartered and the Japanese bank Nomura are also relocating their European headquarters to the German financial centre. HSBC opted for Paris, while Bank of America is opening an office in Dublin.

In a win for Dublin's campaign to attract financial services firms after Britain's vote to leave the European Union, Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) will move the operations subject to regulatory approval, L&G said on Friday. Aviva, meanwhile, is going through the process of converting its Irish life and general insurance branches to regulated subsidiaries to meet the needs of its Irish insurance customers more effectively after Brexit, an Aviva spokesman told Reuters. LGIM's decision follows plans by rival fund manager M&G, a subsidiary of Prudential, to set up a management company and distribution arm in Luxembourg, which along with Dublin is one of Europe's main hubs for fund services. LGIM is one of Europe's largest investors, with just under 900 billion pounds of assets under management at the end of 2016, and one of the biggest investors in the UK stock market. "This is yet another very important signal to the market that financial services companies can come to Ireland quickly and service their European customers, with minimum disruption to their business," said Martin Shanahan, the head of IDA Ireland, the state agency that attracts foreign investment. L&G said it foresaw no impact on operations and staff in other LGIM locations. Although asset manager Legg Mason said in March that it was setting up a management company in Ireland, Dublin missed out on two high profile moves after insurer AIG chose Luxembourg and Lloyd's of London chose Brussels. L&G and Aviva's decisions are a further boost to Ireland's credentials after JPMorgan Chase, which currently employs around 500 people in Dublin, said this month it had agreed to buy a building in the city with room for 1,000 staff. And fellow insurer and asset manager Standard Life said last week that it was likely to choose Dublin as the base for its EU subsidiary after Britain leaves the bloc. The head of International Financial Services at IDA Ireland said on Thursday that several firms, including insurers, asset managers and banks, had confirmed they had chosen Ireland and announcements would be made from June onwards.

"At this conference, one thing I immediately noticed, I have a hard time finding the nerd table," said Joseph Poon, founder of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, a system for digital payments. He was speaking on the sidelines of the Token Summit in New York, a conference Thursday that looked at the application of bitcoin's blockchain technology to business. "For the past five years, it's always been easy to find the nerd table because it's everywhere. The conference was the nerd table. Now it seems like it's all ambassadors, and it's basically like I can only find like 10 people I can recognize here," Poon said. Wall Street is getting more invested in digital currencies and just in time for Bitcoin to hit a record high. That may not be a coincidence. Bitcoin has more than doubled in price this year and briefly surged to a record of $2,791.70 Thursday, before briefly erasing $400. The gains come with increased interest in digital currencies, or tokens. Bitcoin is a kind of token for which transactions are recorded in a secure accounting system called blockchain. The demand to attend the Token Summit exceeded organizer William Mougayar's own expectation of 300 — there were as many on the waiting list before he closed it, he said. He began organizing the Token Summit in December, and out of 650 registrants from 44 countries he said about a quarter were involved with the business and financing side. "I was surprised," he said. Earlier in the week at another New York digital currency conference, Consensus, Fidelity announced it will allow clients to see bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held on Coinbase on its website, according to a Reuters report. Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson said in the report that the asset manager has also allowed employees to use bitcoin to pay in the firm's cafeteria. "They basically let the world know they are looking at it," Nick Kirk, formerly of IBM Research and an investor in cryptocurrencies, said from the Token Summit. "The smart money is starting to come in now." Kirk said he recently met with proprietary trading firms from Chicago that are interested in digital currencies. It's not just Fidelity that's getting more public about their interest in digital currencies and the underlying blockchain technology. One currency in particular, ethereum, has gained more than 2,000 percent this year because investors see its potential in paving the way for a new, decentralized internet. Last week, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance announced 86 new members of the standards-setting development group, including financial communications company Broadridge, clearinghouse DTCC and consulting firm Deloitte. JPMorgan , Intel and Microsoft were among the founding group. JPMorgan on Monday also announced at the Consensus conference that the bank is working with the makers of a digital currency called zcash to increase privacy for settlement of transactions on a blockchain, according to CoinDesk, the conference host. At Consensus "there were a lot of suits," David Vorick, co-founder and CEO of Sia, a cloud computing company based on blockchain, said of his experience at Consensus. "It just felt like everybody was there doing business. Even myself. I was wearing a suit, and that's not my natural state of being."

TREVOR COLE Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday, May 26, 2017 8:57AM EDT Last updated Friday, May 26, 2017 9:07AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Title The Golden Passport: Harvard Business School, the Limits of Capitalism, and the Moral Failure of the MBA Elite Author Duff McDonald Genre Non-Fiction Publisher HarperBusiness Pages 672 Price $43.50 How terrible a plague upon the modern world is the Harvard Business School? Over the school’s 109-year existence, how much of the injustice, venality and misery ingrained in Western economies can be laid at the feet of the school’s professors and their wealthy MBA spawn? Those weren’t questions Canadian journalist Duff McDonald set out to answer when he began writing this mammoth accounting of the history and impact of America’s most prominent and influential graduate school for business. McDonald insists that, when it came to ol’ HBS, he had, at the outset of his 30-month process, no particular axe to grind. But as he paged through the annals and waded through the evidence, he couldn’t ignore what he was seeing. Pretty soon, it seems that McDonald came to much the same conclusion as McGill University’s Henry Mintzberg, who in 2012 called MBAs “a menace to society,” and MIT professor John Van Maanen, who said in 2015 that the innumerable CEOs educated at HBS had left the world “a much worse place.” You’d like some proof? Consider that America’s military failures during the war in Vietnam can be traced back to the analytical methods that Defense Secretary Robert McNamara learned at HBS. Consider that many of the bankers and executives most responsible for the 2007 financial crisis were HBS graduates doing exactly what HBS graduates had been taught to do – go for the money, damn the consequences. Consider that George W. Bush, until recently viewed as the Worst President Ever, graduated with an MBA from the Harvard Business School. That’s just the highlight reel of HBS sins. To cover the rest, McDonald needs almost 600 pages. And it all began, like many disasters, so innocuously. Back in the early-to-mid 1800s, long before HBS existed, North American society looked down on business and the men who practised it. The smart sons of the wealthiest families went into the professions, became doctors or lawyers, while the dim bulbs slouched off to make and sell things. Slowly that began to change. By 1900 there were more than 500,000 factories in the United States, and more and more ambitious youths were drawn to the money-making potential of a life in commerce. Business colleges sprang up to meet the demand for training. That’s when the decision makers at Harvard and the Boston Brahmins who funded it came up with a plan: If they couldn’t persuade their young men to choose a suitably prestigious profession over business, they’d just redefine business as a prestigious profession. “Business in its upper walks has become a highly intellectual calling,” said Harvard president Charles Eliot to the Harvard Club of Connecticut in 1908. That same year, he opened the Harvard Business School with an ambitious goal: to be “a force for good.” The first seeds for the trouble to come were laid there, in that early arrogance. HBS, McDonald says, set out to produce “a more enlightened businessman” and quickly became “intoxicated with its own importance.” In attempting to elevate the role of the manager to something exalted and yet teachable, HBS and its professors became convinced that it was true. Around that presumption, other seeds of misfortune began to take root. This is the third book of what McDonald calls his trilogy of American business. The first two dipped into the worlds of banking (Last Man Standing, on the career of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon) and management consulting (The Firm, a history of the hugely influential consultancy McKinsey & Co.). Of the three, Golden Passport is by far the most ambitious, and in McDonald’s hands this history of the Harvard Business School, its successes and failures, misdeeds and misapprehensions, becomes a window into the increasingly corrupted soul of mercantile America. In building his case that HBS has done far more harm than good over the years, McDonald marches resolutely through the 20th century, decade by decade, describing in fine detail the economic forces at play, the evolving attitudes of the marketplace and the arguments of its leading thinkers, both inside and outside the school. Along the way, he profiles the HBS deans and professors who rose to prominence, usually on the back of some grand new theory about the keys to managerial and commercial success. He charts the path of each of these theories – the stopwatch metric of “Taylorism,” for example, which stressed the value of quantity over quality, or much later, Michael Jensen’s version of agency theory, linking executive compensation to shareholder return – from its heroic, profitable rise to its inevitable repudiation and fall. At each stage, McDonald keeps an eye on the challenges lurking around the corner. As he describes the self-satisfaction that permeated the halls of HBS and the minds of its graduates in the prosperous 1950s, for example, he also clangs the bell about the coming global business pressures that no one at the school foresaw. A sense of the intellectual shallowness of HBS wafts through the entire book, as McDonald makes a mockery of the very idea of treating business as a profession. Again and again he returns to the subject of the school’s signature teaching practice – the case method. While business theories have come and gone through the school’s history, the case method has endured, and HBS embraces the approach like no other school on earth (although the University of Western Ontario’s Ivey Business School comes close). Every year, HBS students read and then argue over hundreds of reported cases describing a real business problem, the executive response and the result (perhaps the most famous example being the story of how Johnson & Johnson CEO James Burke guided the company through the 1982 Tylenol crisis, when poison-laced bottles of Tylenol killed seven people in Chicago). The school has always claimed that the case method gives students the equivalent of real-world experience, teaching them how to think through problems and equipping them to be effective leaders. McDonald chops away at that notion, articulating the many problems with the case method, such as the inward focus it creates – a method taught by HBS students-turned-professors who’ve only learned through that method with no awareness of the outside world – or the fact that the chief skill it teaches students is to be glib, “to think on their feet and to argue with conviction, even if they don’t entirely know what they’re talking about.” Throughout The Golden Passport (the title is an allusion to the success and riches practically guaranteed to every Harvard MBA), McDonald’s tone is deliciously derisive. He quickly establishes a pattern wherein he describes some proposition or assumption promoted by HBS thinkers, sets it on display for the reader to fully appreciate, and then strikes it down with a cruel stroke, using words such as “absurd” and “hilarious” and “a crock.” Over time, reading this history of America’s most prestigious business school comes to feel like hearing the life story of an esteemed man as told by his smirking, smart-ass younger brother. But by sheer thoroughness, McDonald makes his case, until the follies of the Harvard Business School, and the calamities that grew from them, are laid bare. Early in the book, McDonald brings up education critic Abraham Flexner, who in 1930 warned that HBS was pretentious enough to be dangerous. Anyone who makes it all the way through The Golden Passport – anyone, that is, not mentioned among the many lists of people who have profited handsomely from their association with HBS – would have to conclude he was right.

Our next edition will publish on Tuesday May 30. WHITE HOUSE MIND MELD — MM on Thursday spoke with someone with access to the thinking of top White House officials who made a series of interesting points. When President Trump returns from his trip, a White House shakeup remains a significant possibility. Chief of Staff Reince Preibus remains on shaky ground. NEC Director Gary Cohn, a choice favored by Jared Kushner, could replace him. But that could spark a revolt among hardline conservatives and America First-types. So other names will enter the frame. Story Continued Below Confidence in the ability of Congress to clear an Obamacare repeal bill is fairly low given the latest CBO score and changes that could be made in the Senate that would land the bill in trouble back in the House. This person put the chances of getting health care done at about 25 percent. The odds of getting tax reform done (this year or early next) are better but only around 40 or 50 percent, according to this person. That’s left people in serious fear of heading into the 2018 midterms with no major legislative accomplishments. And then there’s Russia. Where does that go? “I have no idea,” this person said. SPEAKING OF HEALTH CARE — POLITICO’s Burgess Everett and Jennifer Haberkorn: “A feeling of pessimism is settling over Senate Republicans as they head into a week-long Memorial Day recess with deeply uncertain prospects for their push to repeal Obamacare. “Senators reported that they’ve made little progress on the party’s most intractable problems this week, such as how to scale back Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and overall Medicaid spending. Republicans are near agreement on making tax credits for low-income, elderly Americans more generous, but that might be the simplest matter at hand” Read more. KUSHNER EYED IN RUSSIA PROBE — Via NBC: “White House correspondent Peter Alexander reports NBC News has learned Jared Kushner has come under scrutiny by the FBI, according to multiple U.S. sources. Investigators believe Kushner has significant information relevant to their inquiry, officials said. That does not mean they suspect him of a crime or intend to charge him” Read more. WILLING TO TESTIFY — POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein and Cristiano Lima: “Lawyers for … Kushner said on Thursday that the White House senior adviser would be willing to testify before Congress about his past meetings with Russian officials after news broke that he was reportedly being scrutinized in the FBI investigation … “Kushner, who met at least one time last year with Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, as well as with Russian banker, Sergey Gorkov, had previously said he'd be willing to speak before Congress on the matter, a sentiment he reiterated Thursday night” Read more. SHUTDOWN WATCH — POLITICO’s Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan: “House Republican leaders, facing a serious time crunch this fall, are already plotting ways to avoid a government shutdown at the end of September — a real possibility given partisan divisions over spending priorities. “Speaker Paul Ryan in a closed-door GOP conference meeting Thursday morning laid out the legislative calendar, showing lawmakers they're approximately four months behind schedule in the appropriations process for 2018, in part because … “Trump's budget landed later than usual. The early discussion about salvaging the annual spending process underscores how much Trump, Ryan and other party leaders are struggling to govern now that they run Washington.” Read more. GDP PREP — Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson on the second estimate of Q1 GDP out this morning: “We didn't believe the first estimate of Q1 GDP growth, 0.7%, and we won't believe today's second estimate, either. The data are riddled with distortions, most notably the long-standing problem of residual seasonality, which depressed the number by about one percentage point. “The reversal begins in the second quarter, which should enjoy a seasonal boost of about 0.6pp. The BEA, however, has said it will seek to address the issue of residual seasonality with the publication of its annual revisions on July 28, when it also will release the first estimate of Q2 growth.” GOOD FRIDAY MORNING — Hope everyone has a great Memorial Day weekend.

DRIVING THE DAY — President Trump meets with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and takes part in the G7 meeting in Taormina, Italy … Second estimate of Q1 GDP at 8:30 a.m. expected to be revised up to 0.9 percent from 0.7 percent … Univ. Michigan Consumer Sentiment at 10:00 a.m. expected to rise to 97.5 from 97.0 … THIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES — Zachary Warmbrodt on Republicans’ efforts to majorly reform the National Flood Insurance Program, with the clock ticking before it expires at the end of September.

Herszenhorn: “Donald Trump and top EU officials, in their first face-to-face meeting in Brussels Thursday, confronted an uneasy new transatlantic relationship with large questions marks looming over issues like free trade and climate change. “There was plenty of back-slapping … But while the EU leaders described the meeting as ‘cordial’ and ‘friendly,’ it was clear that the new and unpredictable American president had not offered reassurances on some core areas of concern for Brussels.” Read more. GERMANS: “VERY BAD” — USA Today’s Jessica Estepa: “In a Brussels meeting with top European Union leadership … Trump took a pretty personal dig at Germany over its trade surplus. ‘The Germans are bad, very bad,’ Trump told EU Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk, according to German news magazine Der Spiegel. “The ‘very bad’ translation comes from the Cambridge Dictionary, anyway. Google Translate says Trump's comments actually translate to ‘evil, very evil.’ ‘Look at the millions of cars they’re selling in the US. Terrible. We will stop this,” Trump reportedly said of the Germans. Here's the thing: the U.S. can't negotiate a deal with Germany alone. It has to deal with the entire EU” Read more. NO EXPLICIT MUTUAL DEFENSE PLEDGE — NYT’s Michael D. Shear, Mark Landler and James Kanter: “Trump on Thursday punctured any illusions that he was on a fence-mending tour of Europe, declining to explicitly endorse NATO’s mutual defense pledge and lashing out at fellow members for what he called their ‘chronic underpayments’ to the alliance.” Read more. NAMING THE MARKET — Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg view: “My own feeling is that, with the political implementation outlook having gotten more complicated and likely to remain so, the current rally is essentially a Liquidity Trade amplified by a reflationary flavor. “To develop a much more robust underpinning, it would need to be anchored by stronger global reflation and better prospects for pro-growth policies in the U.S. -- the evidence for which is not overwhelming, at least for now.” WALL STREET SCALES FRESH PEAKS AS OIL PRICES SLIDE — FT’s Dave Shellock and Jamie Chisholm: “U.S. equity indices climbed to record highs as last week’s concerns about the ability of the US administration to push through its pro-growth agenda continued to recede. The bullish tone on Wall Street came in spite of a poor showing by the energy sector, as oil prices tumbled after Opec agreed to extend production cuts into next year. “The S&P 500 equity index rose 0.4 per cent to a record close of 2,415, having earlier hit an all-time intraday peak of 2,418.71. The Nasdaq Composite index also ended at a record high of 6,205, up 0.7 per cent.” Read more. WALL STREET SIGNALS BOND YIELDS TO STAY LOWER — Bloomberg’s Brian Chappatta and Liz McCormick: “Stubbornly low Treasury yields are spurring Wall Street to slash forecasts for the months ahead, and whether the Federal Reserve winds up raising rates again has little to do with it. “At about 2.25 percent, 10-year yields are plumbing 2017 lows, following a rally Wednesday as the central bank signaled an imminent rate hike but also a gradual approach to shrinking its massive bond portfolio. Banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut year-end yield forecasts this month, while maintaining calls for more tightening.” Read more. BLACKSTONE, SAUDI ARABIA TEAM UP — NYT’s Kate Kelly and Landon Thomas Jr.: “A little over a year ago, the private equity titan Stephen A. Schwarzman sat down with Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia and chairman of the kingdom’s largest sovereign wealth fund, in hopes of expanding their relationship. .. “Thirteen months and one election upset later, Mr. Schwarzman, who leads an elite committee of business executives advising President Trump, has announced a $20 billion cornerstone investment by the Saudi entity in a soon-to-be-created Blackstone infrastructure fund. That investment vehicle, which Blackstone plans to double in size, represents a new focus for the firm.” Read more. WELLS FARGO BOOSTS BROKER RECRUITMENT BONUSES — WSJ’s Michael Wursthorn: ““Wells Fargo & Co. is sweetening its signing bonuses for veteran brokers, a move to capitalize on Morgan Stanley ’s and Merrill Lynch’s retreat from the industry’s costly recruiting practice known as ‘prisoner exchange.’ “The San Francisco bank’s brokerage arm told industry recruiters this week it would raise its recruitment offers after The Wall Street Journal reported Morgan Stanley would significantly cut back on the pricey practice of poaching brokers, people familiar with the matter said.” Read more. STUDENT LOANS COULD MOVE FROM ED TO TREASURY — NYT’s Jessica Silver-Greenberg, Stacy Cowley and Patricia Cohen: “The Trump administration is considering moving responsibility for overseeing more than $1 trillion in student debt from the Education Department to the Treasury Department, a switch that would radically change the system that helps 43 million students finance higher education. “A shift in handling federal student aid is being weighed as the Trump administration and Ms. DeVos consider overhauling the Department of Education. Mr. Trump’s proposed budget for 2018 slashes funding for the department by nearly 50 percent. Moving one of its core functions to Treasury would significantly diminish the agency’s power. It could also alter the mission of the student loan program.” Read more. WORLD BANK ECONOMIST FACES CONSEQUENCES — Bloomberg’s Andrew Mayeda: The World Bank’s chief economist has been stripped of his management duties after researchers rebelled against his efforts to make them communicate more clearly, including curbs on the written use of ‘and.’ “Paul Romer is relinquishing oversight of the Development Economics Group, the research hub of the Washington-based development lender … Kristalina Georgieva, the chief executive for the bank’s biggest fund, will take overmanagement of the unit July 1. Romer will remain chief economist” Read more. BLACKROCK TO PAY $1.25B FOR NY HQ — Reuters’ Trevor Hunnicutt and Herbert Lash: “BlackRock Inc will initially pay about $60 per square foot in rent for its future headquarters in the Hudson Yards district on the far west side of midtown Manhattan, the company said in a filing on Thursday. “BlackRock, which oversees $5.4 trillion in assets and is the world's largest asset manager, is moving into 847,000 square feet (78,690 sq meters) of a development that will be part of a neighborhood rising over rail yards and tracks in a once-forlorn corner of New York City” Read more. MACHINE LEARNING SET TO SHAKE UP EQUITY HEDGE FUNDS — FT’s Lindsay Fortado and Robin Wigglesworth: “Machine learning poses a threat to equity hedge funds within the next decade as the technique becomes powerful enough to forecast market moves better than humans, one of the earliest investors in the industry is forecasting. “Jeff Tarrant, the founder of Protégé Partners, says that the model of hedge funds charging ‘2 and 20’ — a 2 per cent management fee and 20 per cent performance fee — for investing in large-cap stocks rising and falling ‘doesn’t work any more’ and is ripe for disruption.” Read more. POLITICS MAY MOVE MARKET, BUT NOT FOR LONG — NYT’s James Stewart: “The United States stock market shuddered last week on a report that President Trump had tried to stop an F.B.I. investigation of his former national security adviser, with the Dow Jones industrials falling 373 points in one day and drawing comparisons to the Watergate-era bear market. “If you think politics is roiling United States markets, consider Brazil: The day after the Trump-induced turmoil on United States exchanges, the Brazilian market fell 10 percent and trading had to be halted after news of a bribery scandal engulfed its relatively new president, Michel Temer. In a period of otherwise extended market calm, geopolitics have been driving periodic bouts of volatility” Read more. BITCOIN TWICE AS EXPENSIVE AS GOLD — Bloomberg’s Ranjeetha Pakiam: “The bitcoin frenzy just got crazier. The cryptocurrency is now worth almost double an ounce of gold, with a single coin priced at about $2,450. “While both are sought as a financial haven in times of political and economic uncertainty, industry executives say the surge in bitcoin is also driven by investors moving to a more established digital asset from riskier versions as more companies embrace the underlying technology. Some are concerned there’s a bitcoin bubble in the making.” Read more. MORE ON DURBIN — From the National Restaurant Association’s Cicely Simpson: “We welcome … news that Congress is listening to the needs of small businesses. We urge Congress to keep these protections in place on behalf of Main Street businesses across the country." — Cicely Simpson, Executive Vice President, National Restaurant Association « View Archives Authors: Ben White bwhite@politico.com @morningmoneyben Aubree Eliza Weaver aweaver@politico.com @AubreeEWeaver About The Author Ben White is POLITICO Pro's chief economic correspondent and author of the “Morning Money” column covering the nexus of finance and public policy.

Ethereum is a rival cryptocurrency to bitcoin and has rallied over 2,700 percent this year. Arjun Kharpal | @ArjunKharpal 19 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Ethereum is headed for a 38% correction after big price rally, analyst says    15 Hours Ago | 01:01 Ethereum, a rival cryptocurrency to bitcoin that has rallied over 2,700 percent this year, could be due for a correction to the tune of 38 percent, according to one analyst. On January 1, ethereum was trading at just under $8 and has risen to a record high of $227.26 on Wednesday, marking a 2,747.9 percent rise, according to Coinmarketcap.com. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $191.78 in the early hours of Friday morning and has been moving within a tight range. This brings ethereum close to a price level which one technical analyst, who looks at historical trading patterns to determine future price moves, said could see a sharp drop in the digital currency. Nicola Duke, an analyst at analysis platform Forex Analytix, said that if ethereum trades below $170, then it could mean the price falls to $140. This would mark a 38.4 percent decline in the price from Wednesday's high of $227 and around a 27 percent fall from Friday's early morning trading price. show chapters Here are three big risks to the bitcoin rally: Trader    Thursday, 25 May 2017 | 5:30 PM ET | 04:25 Ethereum has fallen from Wednesday's high which could mean traders may start taking profits. "The fact we have had that wobble yesterday might mean we see some profit taking into the weekend," Duke told CNBC in a phone interview on Friday. But after falling to $140, which Duke said is a "huge level to buy against", ethereum could rally $100 to $240. This could happen on Tuesday. Duke has so far been correct on her calls on bitcoin. On Thursday, the analyst told CNBC that if bitcoin got close to $2,800 there might be some pullback. The cryptocurrency reached $2791 on Thursday and then declined. It was around $2,571 on Friday morning. Duke said that the bitcoin decline could continue to January before bottoming and then a rally. Investors have been getting interested in alternative cryptocurrencies to bitcoin given that it has seen a huge rally this year. Ethereum is seen as a good alternative and has been backed by major financial institutions and corporations. A group called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) was recently founded to connect large companies to technology vendors in order to work on projects using the blockchain. Companies involved in the launch include JPMorgan, Microsoft, and Intel. On Tuesday, the EEA announced another 86 firms joined the alliance, which is adding growing legitimacy to the cryptocurrency. A full explanation about ethereum and its appeal can be found here. Daniel Masters, director at Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), said that bitcoin is acting as a "gateway" into different digital currencies, which are now becoming more accepted alongside traditional fiat currencies. "Some of these currencies are doing a lot better relatively, but the point here is we are moving into this really rich diverse cryptocurrency ecosystem side by side the fiat currency," Masters told CNBC. GABI is an investment fund that is listed on The International Stock Exchange on the Channel Islands.

Lugosky, Stanley By Bob Kalinowski / Published: May 26, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     A headline-grabbing lawsuit against the owners of 16 local McDonald’s restaurants for paying employees exclusively with fee-laden debit cards appears to have reached a conclusion. The state Supreme Court this week denied a request to hear an appeal filed by the owners after prior courts ruled the pay method was illegal. “The kids won. McDonald’s lost,” said West Pittston-based attorney Mike Cefalo, who filed the class action lawsuit on behalf of local McDonald’s workers in June 2013. Albert and Carol Mueller of Clarks Summit, the franchise owners, declined comment on the Supreme Court’s refusal to hear their argument, a spokeswoman said. The case will now return to Luzerne County Court, where Judge Thomas F. Burke Jr. will determine what damages will be awarded to the plaintiffs, according to Cefalo. In June 2015, Burke ruled that paying employees exclusively with a debit card did not fall in line with the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law, which mandates “wages shall be paid in lawful money of the United States or check.” The state Superior Court last year upheld Burke’s decision. “The language is clear. A debit card is not ‘lawful money’ and it is not a ‘check’ ...” Superior Court Judge Anne Lazarus wrote in the court’s opinion. Attorneys for the Muellers had argued a debit card was the “functional equivalent” of a check or lawful money. The Superior Court panel called that argument “unavailing,” because the cards were mandatory and “forced users to incur fees” for all types of transactions. The J.P. Morgan Chase payroll cards issued to local McDonald’s employees carried fees for nearly every type of transaction, according to Cefalo’s lawsuit, including a $1.50 charge for ATM withdrawals, $5 for over-the-counter cash withdrawals, $1 to check the card’s balance, 75 cents per online bill payment and $10 per month if the card is left inactive for more than three months. After Cefalo filed the lawsuit, it quickly gained national attention, including a front-page story in The New York Times and an investigation by federal officials. Soon after, the Muellers announced they were abandoning the pay practice and would give employees the choice of being paid by check, direct deposit or by payroll card.

Held in conjunction with the annual conference of the Asian Bureau of Finance and Economic Research (ABFER) that took place from 22–25 May 2017, the Forum is co-organised and funded by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The AMPF offers a valuable platform for globally prominent academics, financial practitioners and policymakers to discuss monetary policy issues in the Asian context. The conference allows participants to exchange views and share insights in their areas of expertise, with the aim of raising the level of intellectual discourse on economic and monetary challenges confronting Asian policymakers. The organisers have been very encouraged by the high-level participation at this Forum and the great interest it has garnered over the years. A joint ABFER/AMPF dinner last night marked the close of the annual ABFER conference, as well as the official opening of the AMPF. The dinner keynote speech was delivered by Professor Raghuram G. Rajan, Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Prof Rajan explained why industrial countries’ central banks embarked on unconventional monetary policies and what the effects have been. He then argued that this should give us a sense of what the consequences of exit might be. Finally, he addressed the issue of whether central banks have become politically vulnerable as a result of their existing mandate, and whether there is a need for some international “rules of the game” to limit undue monetary policy spillovers. The AMPF programme today will begin with a keynote address by Dr. Willem Buiter, Global Chief Economist of Citigroup. Dr. Buiter will take stock of recent developments in the world economy and share his views on the pickup in global growth momentum. At the same time, he will highlight risks that appear to be underweighted by markets, such as a possible increase in trade protectionism, the rise of anti-immigration sentiment, structural reform challenges and geopolitical uncertainties. Dr. Buiter’s address will be followed by the presentation of a commissioned paper by one of the world’s leading researchers on international economics and finance—Professor Jeffrey Frankel, James W. Harpel Professor of Capital Formation and Growth at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. In his paper on “Systematic Managed Floating”, Professor Frankel revisits his earlier research spanning the last few decades on different exchange rate regimes and defines an intermediate system called “systematic managed floating”, whereby the central bank absorbs pressures on the currency through a combination of exchange rate flexibility and foreign exchange market intervention. He also empirically examines the issue of whether the choice of exchange rate regime makes a difference and finds that systematic managed floating allows the exchange rate to serve as a buffer to external shocks. The commissioned paper will be discussed by Professor Andrew Rose, Bernard T. Rocca Jr. Professor at the Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley and Professor Assaf Razin, Professor Emeritus at Tel Aviv University. The afternoon segment of the AMPF consists of a panel dialogue between three distinguished policymakers and economists: Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies and Chairman of MAS; Dr. Jacob A. Frenkel, Chairman of JP Morgan Chase International; and Professor Raghuram G. Rajan. The panelists will discuss the current challenges confronting the global economy as well as the deeper reforms to the international monetary and financial architecture needed to secure long-term stability, with Professor Steven Davis as the moderator. Professor Steven Davis, William H. Abbott Professor of International Business and Economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business remarked that “The Fourth Asian Monetary Policy Forum features an extraordinary group of policymakers and researchers, who will share their insights and perspectives on the global economy and the implications for economic policy. Chicago Booth is extremely pleased to partner with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the NUS Business School and the Asian Bureau of Finance and Economic Research in sponsoring and organising this high-level, influential forum.” Professor Bernard Yeung, Dean and Stephen Riady Distinguished Professor at NUS Business School, said: “AMPF has defined itself as a vital platform that allows prominent policymakers, practitioners and scholars to exchange deep insights on pertinent Asian economic, financial and monetary policy issues within the global context. The continual involvement of very highly respected speakers and participants is testament to the forum’s significance and impact on research, policymaking and management.  We are grateful to their support and their profound intellectual contributions. NUS Business School is honoured to join MAS, Chicago Booth and ABFER in organising the Forum.” Mr Edward Robinson, Assistant Managing Director (Economic Policy) & Chief Economist, MAS, said: “MAS is extremely pleased that the Asian Monetary Policy Forum in its fourth year continues to provide a platform for casting a timely spotlight and enhanced analytical lenses on macroeconomic and financial issues of great relevance to this region. At a time of opportunity but also of lingering uncertainty, this year’s event has once again attracted outstanding scholars, leading practitioners and top policymakers to share their profound insights on the global economy and functioning of the international monetary system. MAS is delighted to once again join our partners Chicago Booth, ABFER and NUS Business School in sponsoring this Forum, and facilitating the diffusion of knowIedge capital in the form of economic and financial policy-relevant research.” More information on AMPF and conference details can be found at http://abfer.org/AsianMonetary-Policy-Forum/asian-monetary-policy-forum-2017.html.  Back to List Publications Handbook Online Exchange Handbook Trading Places World Exchanges Media & Resources Press Events News FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index Glossary Acronyms White Papers Twitter Legal and About Us About Mondo Visione Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Cookies Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap © Mondo Visione 2017 About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Careers Sitemap Back to Top News RSS Site by Red Ant

Quotes in the article Exxon Mobil Corp XOM ▼ 81.55 -0.20 -0.24% Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDS.B ▲ 56.33 +0.04 +0.07% RUMAH, Saudi Arabia—To understand the deep bonds between Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and the country’s royal family, consider a $55-plus million project the state oil giant recently completed on an empty expanse of desert north of Riyadh. It includes a mosque, a children’s camp and a museum. Broad boulevards with solar-powered streetlamps lead to gleaming white grandstands at the complex’s centerpiece—a stage for Saudi Arabia’s most prestigious camel beauty contest. In a country with limited industrial capability, Saudi Aramco, as the oil company is known, was one of the few firms that could build the project in time for the springtime pageant, an event cherished by King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. “Within 50 days, they made this city,” said Badah Alsubaie, a camel-complex official. The kingdom wants to list a minority of Aramco’s shares in what could be the world’s largest-ever initial public offering, planned for the second half of 2018. First, however, the company needs to be separated from the kingdom. The kingdom’s oil company and its gargantuan cash flow drove the development of modern Saudi Arabia. In addition to being the engine of the national economy, Aramco is a core part of the government apparatus, so much so that some Aramco employees call their employer the “Ministry of Aramco.” Yet many potential investors say that, to be valued on a footing with publicly traded peers such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Aramco will need to present financial statements showing the company is independent, and that its profits aren’t subsidizing pavilions for camel beauty pageants or other Saudi budget items. “I’d much rather have a simple, straightforward company that specializes in that area of the market than one that might go off in other directions,” says Paul Mumford, a fund manager who invests in energy stocks for Cavendish Asset Management. Load Error The company and the kingdom are so deeply enmeshed that, a year into IPO preparations, company and government officials are still wrestling with how to untangle them, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former Aramco executives, government officials and outside advisers, as well as corporate and government documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The IPO is crucial to the ambitions of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who wants to invest the proceeds in other industries to make Saudi Arabia’s economy less reliant on oil. Saudi Aramco said in a statement it has “initiated a multi-phased program to define our relationship with our stakeholders for the future.” The company said it couldn’t answer certain specific questions about IPO preparation due to concerns about complying with stock-exchange regulations ahead of the offering. Saudi Aramco’s chairman, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, said in a March interview that Aramco is “ring-fenced financially” from the state, with governance comparable to multinationals. Yet people familiar with the behemoth’s finances say that it is often unclear even to some officials high up in the company whether Aramco has been reimbursed in full for projects, and how the reimbursement process works. Discussing the desert construction complex, a Saudi Aramco spokesman said in an emailed statement the company “was fully reimbursed for its costs relating to this event.” Aramco, which contributes over 70% of government revenues, has a range of roles beyond infrastructure building, including economic planning. It also provides heavily discounted fuel to support companies and consumers with inexpensive power.

A spokesman for Aramco said that “its sales within the Kingdom are regulated by the government.” Saudi Electricity Company, the third-largest nonfinancial company in the kingdom, said in 2015 it owed some 73.7 billion riyals ($19.7 billion) to the government and Aramco for fuel it received from Aramco since 2000. Aramco owns 6.9% of the company. That fuel allows Saudi citizens and businesses to buy electricity at a discount. Two people with knowledge of Aramco’s finances say Saudi Electricity still hasn’t paid Aramco for the fuel. Saudi Arabian Mining Company, the sixth-largest nonfinancial company, disclosed in 2016 that one of its biggest competitive advantages was access to “quality phosphate rock and molten sulphur from Saudi Aramco.” An Aramco spokesman said the sulphur “is a byproduct of operations and is sold on a commercial basis.” The company that became Aramco started in 1933 as a joint venture between the Saudi government and Standard Oil Company of California, and for years was largely U.S.-run. Control shifted to Saudis through the 1960s and ‘70s; in 1980, the government became Aramco’s outright owner through a deal it struck with its U.S. partner. As the world’s thirst for oil grew, Aramco kept pace, and has accounted for more than 10% of global oil production in recent years. The company broadened its expertise from tapping and managing the world’s biggest oil reservoirs to shipping and processing crude into more-valuable products. Aramco now has joint ventures with multinationals including Exxon Mobil and Dow Chemical Co. Its profits built the modern Saudi state almost from scratch. In 1968, Saudi Arabia’s gross domestic product was less than $4.2 billion, according to World Bank data, and a Saudi born that year could expect to live less than 51 years. In 2015, Saudi GDP was $646 billion, and life expectancy reached nearly 75 years. Aramco took on infrastructure projects including roads, hospitals and schools, and provided a host of social and economic programs: interest-free housing loans, funding for U.S.-bound students and malaria eradication. The company said its construction projects are part of a “program of corporate citizenship” that has included “national capacity building, training, schools and education.” In addition, the company said it has “also undertaken infrastructure projects at the request of the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia” for which it said it received “due compensation.” Other people with direct knowledge of Aramco’s finances dispute that, saying the company hasn’t been reimbursed for some projects built at the government’s request. Untangling the paybacks is difficult, says a person involved in the process, because the government and Aramco sometimes deal with compensation as part of the negotiation of Aramco’s annual payments to the government. In 2006, then-King Abdullah ordered up Saudi Arabia’s first coed university for an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion. An Aramco spokesman says “the government bore the substantial majority of the costs” for the project, and that the government reimbursed Aramco for building a $1 billion “sports city” encompassing a soccer stadium and at least five mosques. On other specific projects, such as a years-long stormwater-drainage project in Jeddah, the company declined to comment. Another project, a futuristic museum and cultural center rising from Saudi Arabia’s eastern desert, cost Aramco more than $800 million, people familiar with the project said. The company still owns and runs the King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture, which is slated to open next year. Aramco was also involved in building the counter-terrorism center in Riyadh where President Donald Trump and King Salman were photographed earlier this week touching a glowing orb, says a person familiar with the matter. In 2014, some Aramco officials began confronting Saudi Arabia’s brewing economic problems. In their unofficial role as the country’s economic steward, they prepared a private report warning the government of a looming demographic explosion, where the country would need to create some 300,000 to 350,000 jobs annually to keep unemployment below 20%. The government didn’t initially act. Then oil prices crashed. Abdullah died in 2015; instead of asking for stadiums, his successor King Salman asked his son, Prince Mohammed, to break the kingdom’s oil dependence, and empowered the prince to oversee a sweeping economic overhaul. On Jan. 7, 2016, Aramco employees learned about their future from The Economist magazine: Prince Mohammed told an interviewer the company would go public. “There was a shudder of silence in the room when it was announced,” said one employee. “We were the ones pushing the research saying the economy needed to be diversified, but we never considered an IPO as the way to do that.” Public-relations staff rushed to issue a statement that made the news look like the result of a long-running study, say people familiar with the event. The announcement set off a race to figure out how to list a company so big and so intertwined with the government that taking it public, some bankers have said, would be equivalent to “floating a country.” Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair sat with Prince Mohammed in a desert camp; Larry Summers, a veteran of Clinton and Obama White Houses, met Saudi leaders, as did former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, say people familiar with the meetings. The former politicians, experts in politics and economics, are also affiliated with banks vying for Aramco IPO business. Mr. Blair is the chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.’s international council, which advises the bank (Aramco’s chairman, Mr. Falih, was also on that council). Messrs. Summers and Cantor are affiliated with boutique firms advising Aramco. In his meetings with Prince Mohammed, Mr. Blair discussed “general Middle East politics,” but nothing to do with “business” or his role at J.P. Morgan, according to a person close to Mr. Blair. As a first step, Mr. Falih and Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser appointed Motassim al-Maashouq to lead a group that would figure out how to untangle the oil, fuels and chemicals businesses from Aramco’s government obligations. In a speech to the corporate-planning department, Mr. Maashouq, the goateed and gregarious onetime head of an Aramco division that builds non-oil projects, told employees the IPO would be “a landmark” for Aramco and that “transparency and efficiency will make things better,” one attendee recalls. Mr. Maashouq enlisted more than 20 Aramco employees. They were assigned to teams called “Project X,” “Project Y” and “Project Z,” say people familiar with the matter, and began meeting in offices with combination locks on the doors. Project X worked up a plan to take the entire company public; Projects Y and Z examined more modest offerings of Aramco’s processing businesses, say people familiar with the matter. Executives decided to move ahead with Project X, they say, and put together another team, “Project R,” to focus on getting the company ready to go public. The teams, along with outside advisers, developed plans to move subsidies off Aramco’s books and put non-energy functions—such as building stadiums and camel complexes—under government ministries. The very process of realizing the prince’s economic overhaul only served to highlight the blurred lines around Aramco’s role. The government began asking Aramco’s oil-price-forecasting group for about 10 reports a week on countries and companies the prince viewed as alternative investment opportunities. Those included Russia, Japan’s SoftBank, the Comoros Islands and an amusement-park company. “We’re going, ‘What’s Six Flags got to do with the price oil?’ ” says a person involved in the assignment. The internal team preparing the company’s IPO began to realize they might not meet the lofty price publicly predicted by Prince Mohammed of $2 trillion. According to internal documents, the team reached a valuation of less than $1.5 trillion under current tax rates and royalty rates. Within Aramco, worries about potential disruption caused by the IPO effort have led some employees to work on what one calls a “constructive sabotage” effort—an attempt to persuade superiors Aramco should remain an arm of government. Their quiet rebellion seems unlikely to succeed. Prince Mohammed is committed to the IPO, according to people in his circle. An Aramco spokesman declined to comment on the potential valuation or on the prince’s plans. Saudi business leaders also were becoming unsettled by aspects of the economic overhaul plan. Already hit by reduced government support, companies were facing new taxes and other measures aimed at weaning the country off oil revenue. To some, it felt like the government was focused on one thing: maximizing an Aramco IPO. On March 4, several Saudi business leaders sat with Prince Mohammed to air their grievances, according to minutes of the meeting reviewed by The Journal. Changes the prince planned to introduce as part of Vision 2030—the name of the government’s economic transformation plan—would add to their costs, they complained, including by hampering their ability to bring in foreign workers. The only sector exempted, they pointed out, was oil, according to the meeting minutes. The prince offered little comfort. The take-away for one executive whose company was represented: “What 2030 stands for is we take 30 and give you 20.” While the meeting was being held, Aramco was close to finishing the camel stage. On a recent afternoon, hundreds of camels chewed their cuds in dusty paddocks. One white female—made particularly desirable by the downturned snout towering two feet over her caregiver’s head—was the subject of a $10 million auction bid. Her owner turned it down. Aramco engineers were on site through the contest, said Mr. Alsubaie, the camel-complex official. Saudi officials frame Aramco’s involvement as a marriage of Bedouin tradition and modern wealth that epitomizes today’s Saudi Arabia. The government called the contest, which gave out some $30 million in prizes, “part of the transformation of the country’s oil-dependent economy.” Top prizes went to two Saudi princes. In the weeks since the camel facility was finished, government thinking on untangling Aramco has shifted, say people familiar with the matter. For months, company officials and their bankers signaled they would break Aramco’s non-oil functions from the company ahead of the IPO. On the eve of the camel pageant finale in April, senior officials said they now intend to keep the construction function in the company, hoping it can make a profit. The work is so good, say officials involved in the process, investors will want a piece.
